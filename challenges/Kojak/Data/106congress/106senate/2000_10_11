Mr. President, today the Senate will begin debate on \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 3244, the sex trafficking \nvictims legislation. I want to start this discussion and debate off \nwith thanking my good friend and colleague, Senator Paul Wellstone. He \nand I have worked together on this bill the entire year. We have come \nat this from different points of view. I think we have worked together \nand come up with an excellent proposal and package. I hope for \nunanimous support from the Senate.\n  We got near that in the House, with a vote of 377-1. I have spoken \nwith that one person who deeply regrets voting against us on this bill. \nIt was actually for another provision that was in the bill. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The sex trafficking victims legislation is here under a previous \norder, and there will be up to 7 hours of debate on the conference \nreport we are going to discuss. Senator Thompson will raise a point of \norder against the report and is expected to appeal the ruling of the \nChair. Therefore, a vote on the appeal, as well as a vote on adoption \nof the conference report, is expected to occur during this afternoon's \nsession. The Senate will also consider the VA-HUD appropriations bill \nand the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, with votes on both expected to occur prior to today's \nadjournment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2001, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $393 per year or $197 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $4.00 per copy.

The Senate will now proceed to the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 3244.\n  The clerk will report the conference report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate on the bill, H.R. \n     3244, an act to combat trafficking of persons, especially \n     into the sex trade, slavery, and slavery-like conditions, in \n     the United States and countries around the world through \n     prevention, through prosecution and enforcement against \n     traffickers, and through protection and assistance to victims \n     of trafficking, having met, have agreed that the House recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 5, 2000.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I believe under the uniform unanimous \nconsent agreement that we have, time has been allocated to several \ndifferent Members of the Senate to speak on this conference report; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, let me start this debate and discussion \nwith the story of Irina. Irina's story appeared in the New York Times \nnot that long ago, and it is similar to the story of a number of women \nwith whom I have met and who have been caught in this situation of sex \ntrafficking--young ladies I met with in Nepal, and several testified in \ncommittee. I think Irina's story tells in graphic detail why this is a \nproblem and why the Senate needs to act.\n\n       Irina always assumed that her beauty would somehow rescue \n     her from the poverty and hopelessness of village life. A few \n     months ago, after answering a vague ad in a small Ukrainian \n     newspaper, she slipped off a tour boat when it put in at \n     Haifa, hoping to make a bundle dancing naked on the tops of \n     tables.\n       She was 21, self-assured and glad to be out of Ukraine. \n     Israel offered a new world, and for a week or two everything \n     seemed possible. Then, one morning, she was driven to a \n     brothel, where her boss burned her passport before her eyes.\n       ``I own you,'' she recalled his saying. ``You are my \n     property and you will work until you earn your way out. Don't \n     try to leave. You have no papers and you don't speak Hebrew. \n     You will be arrested and deported. Then we will get you and \n     bring you back.''\n\n  That was her master. The article goes on.\n\n       It happens every single day. Not just in Israel, which has \n     deported nearly 1,500 Russian and Ukrainian women like Irina \n     in the past three years. But throughout the world, where \n     selling naive and desperate young women into sexual bondage \n     has become one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises in \n     the robust global economy.\n       . . . Many end up like Irina. Stunned and outraged by the \n     sudden order to prostitute herself, she simply refused. She \n     was beaten and raped before she succumbed. Finally she got a \n     break. The brothel was raided and she was brought here [to \n     another place], the only women's prison in Israel. Now, like \n     hundreds of Ukrainian and Russian women with no documents or \n     obvious forgeries, she is waiting to be sent home.\n\n  This is a quote from Irina:\n\n       ``I don't think the man who ruined my life will even be \n     fined,'' she said softly, slow tears filling her enormous \n     green eyes. ``You can call me a fool for coming here. That's \n     my crime. I am stupid. A stupid girl from a little village. \n     But can people really buy and sell women and get away with \n     it? Sometimes I sit here and ask myself if that really \n     happened to me, if it can really happen at all.''\n       Then, waving her arm toward a muddy prison yard, where \n     Russian is spoken more commonly than Hebrew, she whispered \n     one last thought: ``I am not the only one, you know. They \n     have ruined us all.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full text \nof this article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Traffickers' New Cargo: Naive Slavic Women\n\n                          (By Michael Specter)\n\n       Ramle, Israel.--Irina always assumed that her beauty would \n     somehow rescue her from the poverty and hopelessness of \n     village life. A few months ago, after answering a vague ad in \n     a small Ukrainian newspaper, she slipped off a tour boat when \n     it put in at Haifa, hoping to make a bundle dancing naked on \n     the tops of tables.\n       She was 21, self-assured and glad to be out of Ukraine. \n     Israel offered a new world, and for a week or two everything \n     seemed possible.

Don't \n     try to leave. You have no papers and you don't speak Hebrew. \n     You will be arrested and deported. Then we will get you and \n     bring you back.''\n       It happens every single day. Not just in Israel, which has \n     deported nearly 1,500 Russian and Ukrainian women like Irina \n     in the past three years. But throughout the world, where \n     selling naive and desperate young women into sexual bondage \n     has become one of the fastest-growing criminal enterprises in \n     the robust global economy.\n       The international bazaar for women is hardly new, of \n     course. Asians have been its basic commodity for decades. But \n     economic hopelessness in the Slavic world has opened what \n     experts call the most lucrative market of all to criminal \n     gangs that have flourished since the fall of Communism: white \n     women with little to sustain them but their dreams. Pimps, \n     law enforcement officials and relief groups all agree that \n     Ukrainian and Russian women are now the most valuable in the \n     trade.\n       Because their immigration is often illegal--and because \n     some percentage of the women choose to work as prostitutes--\n     statistics are difficult to assess. But the United Nations \n     estimates that four million people throughout the world are \n     trafficked each year--forced through lies and coercion to \n     work against their will in many types of servitude. The \n     International Organization for Migration has said that as \n     many as 500,000 women are annually trafficked into Western \n     Europe alone.\n       Many end up like Irina. Stunned and outraged by the sudden \n     order to prostitute herself, she simply refused. She was \n     beaten and raped before she succumbed. Finally she got a \n     break. The brothel was raided and she was brought here to \n     Neve Tirtsa in Ramle, the only women's prison in Israel. Now, \n     like hundreds of Ukrainian and Russian women with no \n     documents or obvious forgeries, she is waiting to be sent \n     home.\n       ``I don't think the man who ruined my life will even be \n     fined,'' she said softly, slow tears filling her enormous \n     green eyes. ``You can call me a fool for coming here. That's \n     my crime. I am stupid. A stupid girl from a little village. \n     But can people really buy and sell women and get away with \n     it? Sometimes I sit here and ask myself if that really \n     happened to me, if it can really happen at all.''\n       Then, waving her arm toward the muddy prison yard, where \n     Russian is spoken more commonly than Hebrew, she whispered \n     one last thought: ``I'm not the only one, you know. They have \n     ruined us all.''\n\n\n         traffic patterns: russia and ukraine supply the flesh\n\n       Centered in Moscow and the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, the \n     networks trafficking women run east to Japan and Thailand, \n     where thousands of young Slavic women now work against their \n     will as prostitutes, and west to the Adriatic Coast and \n     beyond. The routes are controlled by Russian crime gangs \n     based in Moscow. Even when they do not specifically move the \n     women overseas, they provide security, logistical support, \n     liaison with brothel owners in many countries and, usually, \n     false documents.\n       Women often start their hellish journey by choice. Seeking \n     a better life, they are lured by local advertisements for \n     good jobs in foreign countries at wages they could never \n     imagine at home.\n       In Ukraine alone, the number of women who leave is \n     staggering. As many as 400,000 women under 30 have gone in \n     the past decade, according to their country's Interior \n     Ministry. The Thai Embassy in Moscow, which processes visa \n     applications from Russia and Ukraine, says it receives nearly \n     1,000 visa applications a day, most of these from women.\n       Israel is a fairly typical destination. Prostitution is not \n     illegal here, although brothels are, and with 250,000 foreign \n     male workers--most of whom are single or here without their \n     wives--the demand is great. Police officials estimate that \n     there are 25,000 paid sexual transactions every day. Brothels \n     are ubiquitous.\n       None of the women seem to realize the risks they run until \n     it is too late. Once they cross the border their passports \n     will be confiscated, their freedoms curtailed and what little \n     money they have taken from them at once.\n       ``You want to tell these kids that if something seems too \n     good to be true it usually is,'' said Lyudmilla Biryuk, a \n     Ukrainian psychologist who has counseled women who have \n     escaped or been released from bondage. ``But you can't \n     imagine what fear and real ignorance can do to a person.''\n       The women are smuggled by car, bus, boat and plane. Handed \n     off in the dead of night, many are told they will pick \n     oranges, work\n\n[[Page S10165]]\n\n     as dancers or as waitresses. Others have decided to try their \n     luck at prostitution, usually for what they assume will be a \n     few lucrative months. They have no idea of the violence that \n     awaits them.\n       The efficient, economically brutal routine--whether here in \n     Israel, or in one of a dozen other countries--rarely varies. \n     Women are held in apartments, bars and makeshift brothels; \n     there they service, by their own count, as many as 15 clients \n     a day. Often they sleep in shifts, four to a bed. The best \n     that most hope for is to be deported after the police finally \n     catch up with their captors.\n       Few ever testify. Those who do risk death. Last year in \n     Istanbul, Turkey, according to Ukrainian police \n     investigators, two women were thrown to their deaths from a \n     balcony while six of their Russian friends watched.\n       In Serbia, also last year, said a young Ukrainian woman who \n     escaped in October, a woman who refused to work as a \n     prostitute was beheaded in public.\n       In Milan a week before Christmas, the police broke up a \n     ring that was holding auctions in which women abducted from \n     the countries of the former Soviet Union were put on blocks, \n     partially naked, and sold at an average price of just under \n     $1,000.\n       ``This is happening wherever you look now,'' said Michael \n     Platzer, the Vienna-based head of operations for the United \n     Nations' Center for International Crime Prevention. ``The \n     mafia is not stupid. There is less law enforcement since the \n     Soviet Union fell apart and more freedom of movement. The \n     earnings are incredible. The overhead is low--you don't have \n     to buy cars and guns. Drugs you sell once and they are gone. \n     Women can earn money for a long time.''\n       ``Also,'' he added, ``the laws help the gangsters. \n     Prostitution is semilegal in many places and that makes \n     enforcement tricky. In most cases punishment is very light.''\n       In some countries, Israel among them, there is not even a \n     specific law against the sale of human beings.\n       Mr. Platzer said that although certainly ``tens of \n     thousands'' of women were sold into prostitution each year, \n     he was uncomfortable with statistics since nobody involved \n     has any reason to tell the truth.\n       ``But if you want to use numbers,'' he said, ``think about \n     this. Two hundred million people are victims of contemporary \n     forms of slavery. Most aren't prostitutes, of course, but \n     children in sweatshops, domestic workers, migrants. During \n     four centuries, 12 million people were believed to be \n     involved in the slave trade between Africa and the New World. \n     The 200 million--and many of course are women who are \n     trafficked for sex--is a current figure. It's happening now. \n     Today.''\n\n\n          distress calls: far-flung victims provide few clues\n\n       The distress call came from Donetsk, the bleak center of \n     coal production in southern Ukraine. A woman was screaming on \n     the telephone line. Her sister and a friend were prisoners in \n     a bar somewhere near Rome. They spoke no Italian and had no \n     way out, but had managed, briefly, to get hold of a man's \n     cell phone.\n       ``Do you have any idea where they are, exactly?'' asked \n     Olga Shved, who runs La Strada in Kiev, Ukraine's new center \n     dedicated to fighting the trafficking of women in Eastern \n     Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.\n       The woman's answer was no. Ms. Shved began searching for \n     files and telephone numbers of the local consul, the police, \n     anybody who could help.\n       ``Do they know how far from Rome they are?'' she asked, her \n     voice tightening with each word. ``What about the name of the \n     street or bar? Anything will help,'' she said, jotting notes \n     furiously as she spoke. ``We can get the police on this, but \n     we need something. If they call back, tell them to give us a \n     clue. The street number. The number of a bus that runs past. \n     One thing is all we need.''\n       Ms. Shved hung up and called officials at Ukraine's \n     Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry. Her conversations \n     were short, direct and obviously a routine part of her job.\n       That is because Ukraine--and to a lesser degree its Slavic \n     neighbors Russia and Belarus--has replaced Thailand and the \n     Philippines as the epicenter of the global business in \n     trafficking women. The Ukrainian problem has been worsened by \n     a ravaged economy, an atrophied system of law enforcement, \n     and criminal gangs that grow more brazen each year. Young \n     European women are in demand, and Ukraine, a country of 51 \n     million people, has a seemingly endless supply. It is not \n     that hard to see why.\n       Neither Russia nor Ukraine reports accurate unemployment \n     statistics. But even partial numbers present a clear story of \n     chaos and economic dislocation. Federal employment statistics \n     in Ukraine indicate that more than two-thirds of the \n     unemployed are women. The Government also keeps another \n     statistic: employed but not working. Those are people who \n     technically have jobs, and can use company amenities like \n     day-care centers and hospitals. But they do not work or get \n     paid. Three-quarters are women. And of those who have lost \n     their jobs since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, more \n     than 80 percent are women.\n       The average salary in Ukraine today is slightly less than \n     $30 a month, but it is half that in the small towns that \n     criminal gangs favor for recruiting women to work abroad. On \n     average, there are 30 applicants for every job in most \n     Ukrainian cities. There is no real hope; but there is \n     freedom.\n       In that climate, looking for work in foreign countries has \n     increasingly become a matter of survival.\n       ``It's no secret that the highest prices now go for the \n     white women,'' said Marco Buffo, executive director of On the \n     Road, an anti-trafficking organization in northern Italy. \n     ``They are the novelty item now. It used to be Nigerians and \n     Asians at the top of the market. Now it's the Ukrainians.''\n       Economics is not the only factor causing women to flee \n     their homelands. There is also social reality. For the first \n     time, young women in Ukraine and Russia have the right, the \n     ability and the willpower to walk away from their parents and \n     their hometowns. Village life is disintegrating throughout \n     much of the former Soviet world, and youngsters are grabbing \n     any chance they can find to save themselves.\n       ``After the wall fell down, the Ukrainian people tried to \n     live in the new circumstances,'' said Ms. Shved. ``It was \n     very hard, and it gets no easier. Girls now have few and \n     opportunities yet great freedom. They see `Pretty Woman,' or \n     a thousand movies and ads with the same point, that somebody \n     who is rich can save them. The glory and ease of wealth is \n     almost the basic point of the Western advertising that we \n     see. Here the towns are dying. What jobs there are go to men. \n     So they leave.''\n       First, however, they answer ads from employment agencies \n     promising to find them work in a foreign country. Here again, \n     Russian crime gangs play a central role. They often recruit \n     people through seemingly innocuous ``mail order bride'' \n     meetings. Even when they do not, few such organizations can \n     operate without paying off one gang or another. Sometimes \n     want ads are almost honest, suggesting that the women earn up \n     to $1,000 a month as ``escorts'' abroad. Often they are vague \n     or blatantly untrue.\n\n\n        recruiting methods: ads make offers too good to be true\n\n       One typical ad used by traffickers in Kiev last year read: \n     ``Girls: Must be single and very pretty. Young and tall. We \n     invite you for work as models, secretaries, dancers, \n     choreographers, gymnasts. Housing is supplied. Foreign posts \n     available. Must apply in person.''\n       One young woman who did, and made it back alive, described \n     a harrowing journey. ``I met these guys and they asked if I \n     would work at a strip bar,'' she said. ``Why not, I thought. \n     They said we would have to leave at once. We went by car to \n     the Slovak Republic where they grabbed my passport. I think \n     they got me new papers there, but threatened me if I spoke \n     out. We made it to Vienna, then to Turkey. I was kept in a \n     bar and I was told I owed $5,000 for my travel. I worked for \n     three days, and on the fourth I was arrested.''\n       Lately, the ads have started to disappear from the main \n     cities--where the realities of such offers are known now. \n     These days the appeals are made in the provinces, where their \n     success is undiminished.\n       Most of the thousands of Ukrainian women who go abroad each \n     year are illegal immigrants who do not work in the sex \n     business. Often they apply for a legal visa--to dance, or \n     work in a bar--and then stay after it expires.\n       Many go to Turkey and Germany, where Russian crime groups \n     are particularly powerful. Israeli leaders say that Russian \n     women--they tend to refer to all women from the former Soviet \n     Union as Russian--disappear off tour boats every day. \n     Officials in Italy estimate that at least 30,000 Ukrainian \n     women are employed illegally there now.\n       Most are domestic workers, but a growing number are \n     prostitutes, some of them having been promised work as \n     domestics only to find out their jobs were a lie. Part of the \n     problem became clear in a two-year study recently concluded \n     by the Washington-based nonprofit group Global Survival \n     Network: police officials in many countries just don't care.\n       The network, after undercover interviews with gangsters, \n     pimps and corrupt officials, found that local police forces--\n     often those best able to prevent trafficking--are least \n     interested in helping.\n       Gillian Caldwell of Global Survival Network has been deeply \n     involved in the study. ``In Tokyo,'' she said, ``a \n     sympathetic senator arranged a meeting for us with senior \n     police officials to discuss the growing prevalence of \n     trafficking from Russia into Japan. The police insisted it \n     wasn't a problem, and they didn't even want the concrete \n     information we could have provided. That didn't surprise \n     local relief agencies, who cited instances in which police \n     had actually sold trafficked women back to the criminal \n     networks which had enslaved them.''\n\n\n      official reactions: best-placed to help, but least inclined\n\n       Complacency among police agencies is not uncommon.\n       ``Women's groups want to blow this all out of proportion,'' \n     said Gennadi V. Lepenko, chief of Kiev's branch of Interpol, \n     the international police agency. ``Perhaps this was a problem \n     a few years ago. But it's under control now.''\n       That is not the view at Ukraine's Parliament--which is \n     trying to pass new laws to protect young women--or at the \n     Interior Ministry.\n       ``We have a very serious problem here and we are simply not \n     equipped to solve it by ourselves,'' said Mikhail Lebed, \n     chief of criminal investigations for the Ukrainian Interior \n     Ministry. ``It is a human tragedy, but\n\n[[Page S10166]]\n\n     also, frankly, a national crisis. Gangsters make more from \n     these women in a week than we have in our law enforcement \n     budget for the whole year. To be honest, unless we get some \n     help we are not going to stop it.''\n       But solutions will not be simple. Criminal gangs risk \n     little by ferrying women out of the country; indeed, many of \n     the women go voluntarily. Laws are vague, cooperation between \n     countries rare and punishment of traffickers almost \n     nonexistent. Without work or much hope of a future at home, \n     an eager teenager will find it hard to believe that the \n     promise of a job in Italy, Turkey or Israel is almost certain \n     to be worthless.\n       ``I answered an ad to be a waitress,'' said Tamara, 19, a \n     Ukrainian prostitute in a massage parlor near Tel Aviv's old \n     Central Bus Station, a Russian-language ghetto for the \n     cheapest brothels. ``I'm not sure I would go back now if I \n     could. What would I do there, stand on a bread line or work \n     in a factory for no wages?''\n       Tamara, like all other such women interviewed for this \n     article, asked that her full name not be published. She has \n     classic Slavic features, with long blond hair and deep green \n     eyes. She turned several potential customers away so she \n     could speak at length with a reporter. She was willing to \n     talk as along as her boss was out. She said she was not \n     watched closely while she remained within the garish confines \n     of the ``health club.''\n       ``I didn't plan to do this,'' she said, looking sourly at \n     the rich red walls and leopard prints around her. ``They took \n     my passport, so I don't have much choice. But they do give me \n     money. And believe me, it's better than anything I could ever \n     get at home.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Irina's story is told all too often and \nis reenacted all too often around the world today. Our Government \nestimates that between 600,000 and 2 million women are trafficked each \nyear beyond international borders. They are trafficked for the purpose \nof sexual prostitution by organized crime units and groups that are \naggressively out making money off the trafficking of human flesh. It is \nwrong. This bill seeks to deal with that wrong and that tragedy that \nhas occurred and is occurring around the world today.\n  This is significant human rights legislation that this body is going \nto pass. I hope, predict, and pray that it will pass today. It is \nsignificant human rights legislation for those poor young victims who \nare trafficked and who are caught sometimes with the view that, ``I am \njust stupid, I got caught in this,'' but who live this horrible, \nhellish life they have been put into and trafficked into and can't find \ntheir way out.\n  The conference report is entitled ``The Victims of Trafficking and \nViolence Protection Act of 2000.'' As I mentioned previously, it passed \nthe House of Representatives on Friday, October 6, by a vote of 371-1.\n  The Senate will vote on this conference report today, with the lead \nunderlying bill being the Brownback-Wellstone anti-trafficking \nlegislation. Senator Wellstone and I have been working for the last \nyear on this legislation, which is a companion to the Smith-Gejdenson \nbill in the House known as the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of \n2000.\n  I want to thank and recognize my staff, Sharon Payt and Karen \nKnutson, two people who have worked tirelessly and endlessly to deal \nwith this particular issue.\n  Our anti-trafficking bill is the first complete legislation to \naddress the growing practice of international ``trafficking'' \nworldwide. This is one of the largest manifestations of modern-day \nslavery internationally. Notably, this legislation is the most \nsignificant human rights bill of the 106th Congress, if passed today, \nas hoped for. This is also the largest anti-slavery bill that the \nUnited States has adopted since 1865 and the demise of slavery at the \nend of the Civil War. Therefore, I greatly anticipate this vote today \nin the Senate on this legislation.\n  Senator Wellstone's and my trafficking bill, which passed in the \nSenate on July 27 of this year, was conferenced to reconcile the \ndifferences with the House bill, and the conference report was filed on \nOctober 5, Thursday, of last week. The final conference package \ncontains four additional pieces of legislation which are substantially \nappropriate to our bill. Most significant among those bill amendments \nis the Violence Against Women Act, known as VAWA, which provides relief \nand assistance to those who suffer domestic violence in America. Thus, \nthe additional four bills included in this conference report include \nthe Violence Against Women Act. This is a reauthorization of the \ninitial bill which was passed in 1994 as part of the Omnibus Crime \nControl Act; this legislation renews several grant programs to assist \nlaw enforcement officers, social service providers, and others dealing \nwith sexual crime and domestic violence.\n  Also in this package is Aimee's law, which provides for interstate \ncompensation for the costs of incarceration of early-release sex \noffenders who commit another sex crime in a second State. It is based \non the circumstances of what happened in a Pennsylvania case where a \nmurderer was released early out of a Nevada prison, went to \nPennsylvania, and kidnapped and brutally raped and murdered a young \ngirl there who was in the very flower of life and coming forth. This \nlaw is built upon that terrible crime that took place in Pennsylvania.\n  Also in this package is the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, which \nallows for State attorneys general to enforce their State alcohol \ncontrol laws in Federal court, including laws prohibiting sales to \nminors, which strengthens the grant of authority to States under the \n21st amendment to the Constitution; and the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act, which authorizes the payment of foreign seized assets to \nAmerican victims of international terrorism.\n  The last step to adopting this legislative package in Congress rests \nwith the Senate today.\n  Before I continue describing this urgently needed legislation, I \nwould like to take a few moments to thank some key people who have \nbrought us to this point today. Some of them are in the Galleries as I \nspeak. They are people of heart, courage, and intelligence whose \nadvocacy made a way for this bill--whose dedication pried open the \ndoors and let the light shine into this darkness. Among them is Senator \nWellstone who started this work long before I came on board. He and his \nwife, most notably, 3 years ago started advocating on this particular \nissue. I know he stands firmly and strongly today as one of the \nprincipal advocates to set this aside, and he brought this forward and \nseeks to go forward from here to help those who are victims of these \ncrimes.\n\n  I also thank Congressmen Chris Smith and Sam Gejdenson. I would also \nlike to thank Gary Haugen of the International Justice Mission and Dr. \nLaura Lederter of the Protect Project at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. \nLaura Lederter of the Protect Project at Johns Hopkins University is \nthe foremost authority in the country on tracking from where and to \nwhere these victims are trafficked.\n  I have up here one of the maps she introduced of women who have been \ntrafficked out of Russia and Ukraine with the fall of the Soviet Union. \nWith the increased travel out of there to freedom, we have seen a huge \namount of trafficking also taking place. These are the routes out of \nRussia and Ukraine and where they go--to Canada, to the United States, \nto Mexico, to Europe, to Africa and Asia, to Australia and New Zealand. \nThis is the work of her project.\n  I also want to thank Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, and \nGloria Steinem, whom I am not noted to thank, is part of this \ncoalition; Chuck Colson, Jessica Neuworth, William Bennett, the \nNational Association of Evangelicals, the Southern Baptist Convention, \namong others I'm sure I'm forgetting. I would also like to thank the \nstaff for both the Senate and House, including Joseph Rees, David \nAbramowitz, Charlotte Oldham-Moore, Jill Hickson, Mark Lagon, and my \nstaff Karen Knutson and Sharon Payt. Thank you all. We are here today \nat final passage because of all your efforts.\n\n  This legislation is our best opportunity to challenge the largest \nmanifestation of slavery worldwide, known as ``trafficking.'' This \npractice of trafficking involves the coercive transportation of persons \ninto slavery-like conditions, primarily involving forced prostitution, \namong other forms of slavery-like conditions.\n  Trafficking is the new slavery of the world. These victims are \nroutinely forced against their will into the sex trade, transported \nacross international borders, and left defenseless in a foreign \ncountry. This bill also addresses the insidious practice known as \n``debt bondage,'' wherein a person can be enslaved to the money lender \nfor an entire lifetime because of a $50 debt\n\n[[Page S10167]]\n\ntaken by the family for an emergency. This is a common practice in \ncountries throughout the South Asian region.\n  People of conscience have fought against the different manifestations \nof slavery for centuries. This anti-slavery legislation is in the \ntradition of William Wilberforce and Amy Carmichael of England, who \nwere ardent abolitionists against different forms of slavery. Amy \nCarmichael was a British missionary to India at the turn of last \ncentury, in the early 1900's. Upon arrival, she was mortified to \ndiscover the routine practice of forced temple prostitution. This was \nand continues to be a practice wherein young girls, from age six \nonward, are dedicated to the local temple, and are then forced into \nprostitution against their will to generate income. Upon this morbid \ndiscovery, Amy Carmichael began to physically steal the young girls \naway from this incredibly degrading form of slavery, hiding the girls \nto escape the inevitable backlash of violence. Eventually, the \ngovernment outlawed this practice of forced temple prostitution, as a \nresult of her efforts. However, it bears noting that this terrible \npractice continues today, in a lesser degree, in rural villages \nthroughout South Asia, including India.\n  This bill challenges the myriad forms of slavery including sex \ntrafficking, temple prostitution, and debt bondage, among other forms.\n  This new phenomenon of sex trafficking is growing exponentially. Some \nreport that it is, at least, $7 billion per year illicit trade, \nexceeded only by the international drug and arms trade. Its victims are \nenslaved into a devastating brutality against their will, with no hope \nfor release or justice, while its perpetrators build criminal empires \non this suffering with impunity. Our legislation will begin to \nchallenge these injustices.\n  This is the new slavery of the world, Dr. Kevin Bales of the \nUniversity of Surrey in England recently testified for us before the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. He astutely observed that the new \nslavery has a peculiar quality which does not look like the old forms \nassociated with lifetime bondage as a chattel slave, but it is slavery \nnonetheless.\n  Sex trafficking is among the most common forms of the new slavery and \ntypically entails shorter periods of bondage, usually asking for 5 to 6 \nyears, or whenever something like AIDS or tuberculosis is contracted, \nafter which the victim is thrown out on the street, broken, without \ncommunity or resources, left to die. I have met with people caught in \nthat condition.\n  Women and children are routinely forced against their will. Sex \ntraffickers favor girls aging in the range of 10 to 13.\n  I have a number of other things I could say, but my time is limited. \nI know a number of people want to speak on this bill. I ask to reserve \nthe remainder of my time. I will turn the floor over to Senator \nWellstone.\n  I ask unanimous consent on any quorum calls that might be called \nduring the discussion of this conference report, that time be allotted \nand assessed against all allocated time to speak under the bill, \nincluding myself and Senator Wellstone, along with Senator Biden, \nSenator Hatch, and Senator Leahy, who have all been allocated time. I \nask the quorum calls be equally divided between those who have time \nunder the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I finally note to others who seek to speak on this \nbill, I invite Members to come to the floor to make comments. At the \nconclusion of our presentation, a vote will occur on this conference \nreport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Brownback, for his very gracious \nremarks. It has been an honor to work with him on this legislation. I \nthink a very strong friendship has come out of this effort. There are \nsome times when we can work and reach out and have the most interesting \nand I hope important coalition. Working with Senator Brownback, Sharon \nPayt, and Karen Knutson has been the best legislative work. At the end \nof the day, I believe today we will pass this legislation. Members can \nfeel they have done something really good. They can make a positive \ndifference. I thank Senator Brownback for his great leadership and his \ngreat work for each step along the way. In all the negotiations, all \nthe work that has been done, the Senator has been there. I thank the \nSenator.\n  I want to talk about Charlotte Oldham-Moore and Jill Hickson, who \nhave worked with me and our staff, who have done a great job. There are \nother people who will be on the floor who put this together--especially \nthe Violence Against Women Act--Senator Leahy, Senator Biden, Senator \nHatch, and others, and Sam Gejdenson and Chris Smith have been \nphenomenal. I thank them for their yeoman work on the House side. I \nalso thank Frank Loy and Harold Koh at the State Department for their \nwork.\n  The trafficking of human beings for forced prostitution and sweatshop \nlabor is a rapidly growing human rights abuse. It is one of the \ngreatest aspects of the globalization of the world economy. The Victims \nof Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 is the first piece \nof legislation to address the widespread practice of the trafficking of \nmen, women, and children into sweatshop labor and sexual bondage.\n  My wife Sheila urged me to do something about this problem several \nyears ago. Consequently, she and I spent time with women trafficked \nfrom the Ukraine to work in brothels in Western Europe and the United \nStates. They told us after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the \nascendancy of the mob, trafficking in women and girls became a booming \nindustry that destroyed the lives of the youngest and most vulnerable \nin their home countries.\n\n  We began work on the bill then, and 3 years later, after \nextraordinary bipartisan effort, tremendous leadership from Senators \nBrownback and Leahy, and Sam Gejdenson and Chris Smith, and others, it \npassed the House with a vote of 371-1. Now it is poised to pass the \nSenate.\n  Our Government estimates that 2 million people are trafficked each \nyear. Of those, 700,000 women and children, primarily young girls, are \ntrafficked from poor countries to rich countries and sold into slavery, \nraped, locked up, physically and psychologically abused, with food and \nhealth care withheld. Of those, as many as 50,000 immigrants are \nbrought into the United States each year, and they wind up trapped in \nbrothels, sweatshops, and other types of forced labor, abused and too \nfearful to seek help.\n  Traffickers exploit the unequal status of women and girls, including \nharmful stereotypes of women as property and sexual objects to be \nbought and sold. Traffickers have also taken advantage of the demand in \nour country and others for cheap, unprotected labor. For the \ntraffickers, the sale of human beings is a highly profitable, low-risk \nenterprise as these women are viewed as expendable and reusable \ncommodities.\n  Overall, profit in the trade can be staggering. It is estimated that \nthe size of this business is $7 billion annually, only surpassed by \nthat of the illegal arms trade. Trafficking has become a major source \nof new income for criminal rings. It is coldly observed that drugs are \nsold once while a woman or a child can be sold 10 or 20 times a day.\n  In the United States, Thai traffickers who incarcerated Thai women \nand men in sweatshops in El Monte, CA, are estimated to have made $8 \nmillion in 6 years. Further, Thai traffickers who enslaved Thai women \nin a New York brothel made about $1.5 million over 1 year and 3 months.\n  Last year, Albanian women were kidnapped from Kosovo refugee camps \nand trafficked to work in brothels in Turkey and Europe. Closer to \nhome, organized crime has trafficked Russian and Ukranian women into \nsexually exploitive work in dozens of cities in the United States of \nAmerica. Just next door, law enforcement authorities suspected mafia \ninvolvement in the gruesome murder of a Russian woman trafficked to \nMaryland.\n  All of these cases reflect a new condition: Women whose lives have \nbeen disrupted by civil wars or fundamental changes in political \ngeography, such as the disintegration of the Soviet Union or the \nviolence in the Balkans, have fallen prey to traffickers.\n  Seeking financial security, many innocent persons are lured by \ntraffickers'\n\n[[Page S10168]]\n\nfalse promises of a better life and lucrative jobs abroad. Seeking this \nbetter life, they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs in \nforeign countries at wages they could never imagine at home. However, \nwhen they arrive, these victims are often stripped of their passports, \nheld against their will, some in slave-like conditions, in the year \n2000.\n  Rape, intimidation, and violence are commonly employed by traffickers \nto control their victims and to prevent them from seeking help. Through \nphysical isolation and psychological trauma, traffickers and brothel \nowners imprison women in a world of economic and sexual exploitation \nthat imposes a constant threat of arrest and deportation, as well as \nviolent reprisals by the traffickers themselves to whom the women must \npay off ever-growing debts. That is the way this works.\n  Many brothel owners actually prefer foreign women, women who are far \nfrom help and from home, who do not speak the language, precisely \nbecause of the ease of controlling them. Most of these women never \nimagined they would enter such a hellish world, having traveled abroad \nto find better jobs or to see the world.\n  Many in their naivete believe nothing bad can happen to them in the \nrich and comfortable countries such as Switzerland or Germany or the \nUnited States. Others are less naive, but they are desperate for money \nand opportunity. But they are no less hurt by the trafficker's brutal \ngrip.\n  Trafficking rings are often run by criminals operating through \nnominally reputable agencies. In some cases overseas, police and \nimmigration officials of other nations participate and benefit from the \ntrafficking. Lack of awareness or complacency among government \nofficials such as border control and consular offices contributes to \nthe problem. Furthermore, traffickers are rarely punished, as official \npolicies often inhibit victims from testifying against their \ntraffickers, making trafficking a highly profitable, low-risk business \nventure for some.\n  Trafficking abuses are occurring not just in far-off lands but here \nat home in America as well. The INS has discovered 250 brothels in 26 \ndifferent cities which involve trafficking victims. This is from a CIA \nreport. This is the whole problem of no punishment--being able to do \nthis with virtual impunity.\n  In a 1996 trafficking case involving Russian and Ukrainian women who \nanswered ads to be au pairs, sales clerks and waitresses, and were \nforced to provide sexual services and live in a massage parlor in \nBethesda, MD, the Russian-American massage parlor owner was fined. He \nentered a plea bargain and charges were dropped with the restriction \nthat he would not operate a business again in Montgomery County. The \nwomen, who had not been paid any salary and were charged $150 for their \nhousing, were deported or left the United States voluntarily. There was \nno charge at all.\n  Teenage Mexican girls were held in slavery in Florida and the \nCarolinas, and they were forced to submit to prostitution.\n  Russian and Latvian women were forced to work in nightclubs in the \nMidwest. According to charges filed against the traffickers, the \ntraffickers picked the women up upon their arrival at the airport, \nseized their documents and return tickets, locked them in hotels and \nbeat them. This is in our country. The women were told that if they \nrefused to work in sexually exploitive conditions, the Russian Mafia \nwould kill their families. Furthermore, over a 3-year period, hundreds \nof women from the Czech Republic who answered advertisements in Czech \nnewspapers for modeling were ensnared in an illegal prostitution ring.\n  Trafficking in persons for labor is an enormous problem as well. The \nINS has also worked on cases involving South Asian children smuggled \ninto the United States to work in slavery-like conditions. In one case, \nabout 100 Indian children, some of them as young as 9 or 10, were \nbrought into New York and shuffled around the country to work in \nconstruction and restaurants--ages 9 and 10, in the United States; \ntoday, in the United States--2000.\n  Some of the children appear to have been sold by their parents to the \ntraffickers. In Woodbine, MD, a pastor bought Estonian children, ages \n14 to 17, promising them they would attend Calvery Chapel Christian \nAcademy, but then forcing them to clean roach-invested apartments and \nto do construction. The children worked 15 hours a day. The children \nwere threatened and punishments included denial of food and being \nforced to stand in one spot for prolonged periods.\n\n  The bitter irony is that quite often victims are punished more \nharshly than the traffickers because of their illegal immigration \nstatus, their serving as prostitutes, or their lack of documents, which \nthe traffickers have confiscated in order to control the victims.\n  A review of the trafficking cases showed that the penalties were \nlight and did not reflect the multitude of human rights abuses \nperpetrated against these women.\n  In a Los Angeles case, traffickers kidnapped a Chinese woman, raped \nher, forced her into prostitution, posted guards to control her \nmovements, and burned her with cigarettes. Nevertheless, the lead \ndefendants received 4 years and the other defendants received 2 and 3 \nyears. That is what they received.\n  In a tragic case involving over 70 Thai laborers who had been held \nagainst their will, systematically abused, and made to work 20-hour \nshifts in a sweatshop, the seven defendants received sentences ranging \nfrom 4 to 7 years with one defendant receiving 7 months.\n  In another case where Asian women were kept physically confined for \nyears with metal bars on the windows, guards, and an electronic \nmonitoring system, and were forced to submit to sex with as many as 400 \ncustomers to repay their smuggling debt, the traffickers received 4 \nyears and 9 years--in the United States of America, in the year 2000.\n  I thank Senator Brownback for his work. It is important.\n  A review of the trafficking cases showed that the penalties were \nlight and they did not reflect the multitude of the human rights abuses \nperpetrated against these women. The statutory minimum for sale into \ninvoluntary servitude is only 10 years, whereas the maximum for dealing \nin small quantities of certain drugs is life.\n  Let me repeat that. The statutory minimum for sale into involuntary \nservitude is only 10 years, whereas the maximum for dealing in small \nquantities of certain drugs is life.\n  Few State and Federal laws are aimed directly at people who deliver \nor control women for the purpose of involuntary servitude or slavery in \nsweatshops or brothels. Consequently, prosecutors are forced to \nassemble cases using a hodgepodge of laws, such as document fraud and \ninterstate commerce, and accept penalties that they believe are too \nlight for the offense. Up until this legislation, there was no way for \nthe prosecutors to go after these traffickers.\n  The Victims of Violence and Trafficking Protection Act of 2000 \nestablishes, for the first time, a bright line between the victim and \nthe perpetrator. It punishes the perpetrator and provides a \ncomprehensive approach to solving the root problems that create \nmillions of trafficking victims each year.\n  This legislation aims to prevent trafficking in persons, provide \nprotection and assistance to those who have been trafficked, and \nstrengthen prosecution and punishment for those who are responsible for \nthe trafficking. It is designed to help Federal law enforcement \nofficials expand antitrafficking efforts here and abroad, to expand \ndomestic antitrafficking and victim assistance efforts, and to assist \nnongovernment organizations, governments and others worldwide, who are \nproviding critical assistance to victims of trafficking. It addresses \nthe underlying problems which fuel the trafficking industry by \npromoting public antitrafficking awareness campaigns and initiatives in \nother countries to enhance economic opportunity, such as microcredit \nlending programs and skills training, for those who are most \nsusceptible to trafficking, and have an outreach so women and girls as \nyoung as 10 and 11 know what they might be getting into.\n\n  It also increases protections and services for trafficking victims by \nestablishing programs designed to assist in the safe reintegration of \nvictims into their communities and ensure that such programs address \nboth the physical and mental health needs of trafficking victims.\n\n[[Page S10169]]\n\n  Imagine what it would be like to be age 12 or 13, a young girl, to go \nthrough this. We have, in Minnesota, the Center for the Treatment of \nTorture Victims. It is a holy place. I have had an opportunity to meet \nwith staff and meet with many men and women who have been helped by \nthis center. These girls, these women, have gone through the same \nliving hell.\n  This legislation also increases protections and services for \ntrafficking victims by providing community support. Furthermore, the \nbill seeks to stop the practice--and this is so important. I am sitting \nnext to Senator Kennedy who has done so much with the immigration work. \nThis bill seeks to stop the practice of immediately deporting the \nvictims back to potentially dangerous situations by providing them with \nsome interim immigration relief. Victims of ``severe forms of \ntrafficking,'' defined as people who were held against their will--\n``for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion \nfor the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt \nbondage or slavery''--would be eligible for a special visa letting them \nstay in the country at least through the duration of their captors' \nprosecution, and perhaps permanently.*****-*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -\nFolios: -Date: -Subformat:\n  Right now, if you are a Ukrainian girl or woman in a massage parlor \nin Bethesda, and you step forward to get some help, you are deported. \nThe trafficker is hardly prosecuted. The victim is automatically \ndeported. This provides temporary visa protection.\n  I will give an example. In a 1996 trafficking case involving Russian \nand Ukrainian women who had answered ads to be au pairs, sales clerks, \nand waitresses but were forced to provide sexual services and live in a \nmassage parlor in Bethesda, MD, 2 miles from here, the Russian American \nmassage parlor owner was fined. He entered a plea bargain and charges \nwere dropped with the restriction that he would not operate his \nbusiness again in Montgomery County. The women, who had not been paid \nany salary, were forced into prostitution, and were charged for their \nhousing, were deported.\n  This legislation toughens current Federal trafficking penalties, \ncriminalizing all forms of trafficking in persons and establishing \npunishment commensurate with the heinous nature of this crime. The bill \nestablishes specific laws against trafficking. Violators can be \nsentenced to prison for 20 years to life, depending on the severity of \nthe crime. Yes, if you are trafficking a young girl and forcing her \ninto prostitution, you can face a life sentence. They can also be \nforced to make full restitution to their victims, paying them the \nsalary that would have been due for their months or years of \ninvoluntary service.\n  This bill requires expanded reporting on trafficking, including a \nseparate list of countries which are not meeting minimum standards for \nthe elimination of trafficking.\n  It requires the President to suspend ``nonhumanitarian and nontrade'' \nassistance to only the worst violators on the list of countries which \ndo not meet these minimum standards and who actively condone this human \nrights abuse. This is a major piece of human rights legislation. This \nis a major human rights bill.\n  These are the rare governments which are openly complicit in \ntrafficking people across their borders. It allows the Congress to \nmonitor closely the progress of countries in their fight against \ntrafficking, and it gives the administration flexibility to couple its \ndiplomatic efforts to combat trafficking with targeted enforcement \naction. Finally, the bill provides three generous waivers.\n  By passing the Victims of Violence and Trafficking Act today, this \nChamber will take a historic step toward the elimination of trafficking \nin persons.\n  Thanks to the partnership of Jewish and Evangelical groups, women and \nhuman rights organizations, and others, we will take a historic and \neffective step against organized crime rings and corrupt public \nofficials who each year traffic more than 2 million people into \ndesperate, broken lives of bondage and servitude.\n  Something important is in the air when such a broad coalition of \npeople, including Bill Bennett, Gloria Steinem, Rabbi David \nSapperstein, Ann Jordan, and Chuck Colson work together for the passage \nof this legislation. I am thankful for their support, I am thankful for \nthe support of the administration, and I am thankful for your support \ntoday in seeking to end this horrible, widespread, and growing human \nrights abuse.\n  By way of conclusion, I say to my colleagues, starting with Senator \nBrownback, I believe with passage of this legislation--I believe it \nwill pass today and the President will sign it--we are lighting a \ncandle. We are lighting a candle for these women and girls and sometime \nmen forced into forced labor. I also think because of the work of so \nmany in the House and the Senate, this can be a piece of legislation \nthat other governments in other parts of the world can pass as well. \nThis is the beginning of an international effort to go after this \ntrafficking, to go after this major, god-awful human rights abuse, this \nhorrible exploitation of women, sometimes men, and of girls.\n\n  I am very proud of this legislation. I thank my colleague from \nKansas. I thank other colleagues as well.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator has 36 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. The \nother part of this legislation that is so significant, and I know \ncolleagues are here to speak about it, is the reauthorization of the \nViolence Against Women Act. I want to reserve time to speak about that \nvery important piece of legislation. For me, to see both of these bills \npass and to see it happen today is one of the best days I can have in \nthe Senate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Massachusetts will \nwithhold for a moment, is my understanding correct that the Senator \nfrom Vermont has 3 hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, I do not \nintend to use all that time. At some point, I am going to yield back a \nconsiderable amount of time. I know there are Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle who have commitments tonight, some connected with the debates \nof the two parties' Presidential nominees. It is my hope we will be \nvoting fairly early this afternoon--a vote on the Thompson point of \norder and final passage.\n  I yield such time as the Senator from Massachusetts needs, and I ask \nunanimous consent that I then be able to yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the absolutely \nsplendid presentation by my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone. I \nagree with him on so many issues. His statement today was one of his \nvery best. We can certainly understand the extraordinary work he has \ndone, along with Senator Brownback and others, to make sure this \nlegislation is considered. All of us will forever be grateful to him \nfor his leadership in this extremely important area. I certainly am. I \nthank him for an absolutely splendid presentation.\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is finally about to pass \nthe re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The current \nauthorization for the Act expired on September 30, and it has taken far \ntoo long to bring this important extension to the Senate floor.\n  A woman is beaten every 15 seconds as a result of domestic violence. \nEvery year, one-third of the women who are murdered are killed by their \nhusbands or partners, and approximately one million women are stalked. \nConservative estimates indicate that 60 percent of disabled women, up \nto 25 percent of pregnant women, and 1 out of 25 elderly people have \nsuffered domestic violence.\n  This isn't a problem that only affects adults. Each year, 3.3 million \nchildren are exposed to domestic violence. In homes where abuse of \nwomen occurs, children are 1,500 times more likely to be abused as \nwell. Whether they witness the violence or are actually assaulted by \nthe abuser, many children learn shocking behavior from adults. 12 \npercent of high school dating couples\n\n[[Page S10170]]\n\nhave suffered abuse in their relationships, and often these teenagers \nare themselves victims of abuse at home.\n  Eighteen year-old Tanyaliz Torres and her mother were stabbed to \ndeath by her father in Springfield, Massachusetts. Fifty-eight-year-old \nMabel Greineder of Wellesley, Massachusetts was stabbed and bludgeoned \nto death by her husband. From October 1999 through September 2000, 24 \nMassachusetts women and children were killed as a result of domestic \nviolence. It is a national epidemic that touches every community in the \ncountry.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was enacted in 1994 to address this \nproblem and provide greater safety and peace of mind for millions of \nwomen and their families. The act creates a partnership between the \npublic sector and the private sector at every level--Federal, State, \nand local. Its goal is to establish a safety net of new programs and \npolicies, including community-based services for victims, a National \nDomestic Violence Hotline, needed technological assistance, and larger \nnumbers of well-trained law enforcement officers and prosecutors.\n  The national Hotline gives women across the country immediate access \nto the help they need. Since its initiation in 1996, it has received \nover 500,000 calls. When a Spanish-speaking woman in Arizona needed \nshelter for herself and her three children, the Hotline called a \nshelter in Phoenix, found a Spanish-speaking counselor, and gave the \ncaller the counselor's name and directions to the shelter. In the \ncountless cases, the Hotline is an invaluable resource, and we must do \nall we can to support it.\n  In Massachusetts, $20 million under the Violence Against Women Act \nhas been awarded to advocacy organizations, law enforcement personnel, \nand State and local governments. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head \nreceived funding to develop and strengthen tribal justice strategies to \nremedy violent crimes against Indian women and to develop and \nstrengthen services for victims.\n  The act also supports HarborCOV--Harbor Communities Overcoming \nViolence--a Massachusetts program serving Chelsea and Greater Boston. \nIn addition to its core services, HarborCOV has an economic development \ncomponent which helps survivors move from welfare to work. Employment \ntraining and employment referrals are also provided to help domestic \nviolence victims find jobs.\n  The reauthorization will ensure that support for these programs and \nothers will continue. It also includes important new measures, such as \ntransitional housing assistance and a $175 million authorization for \nshelters, which will be significant additional tools in the battle \nagainst domestic violence.\n  One of the most important provisions in the bill is the Battered \nImmigrant Protection Act. This provision helps battered immigrants by \nrestoring access to a variety of legal protections undermined by the \n1996 immigration laws. The Violence Against Women Act passed in 1994 \nincluded provisions that allowed battered immigrants to apply for legal \nstatus without the cooperation of their abusers, and enabled victims to \nseek protective orders and cooperate with law enforcement officials to \nprosecute crimes of domestic violence.\n  Unfortunately, the subsequent changes in immigration laws have \nreduced access to those protections. Thousands of battered immigrants \nare again being forced to remain in abusive relationships, out of fear \nof being deported or losing their children. The pending bill removes \nobstacles currently hindering the ability of battered immigrants to \nescape domestic violence safely and prosecute their abusers.\n  It restores and expands vital legal protections like 245(i) relief. \nThis provision will assist battered immigrants, like Donna, who have \nbeen in legal limbo since the passage of the 1996 immigration laws. \nDonna, a national of Ethiopia, fled to the U.S. in 1992 after her \nfather, a member of a prominent political party, was murdered. In 1994, \nDonna met Saul, a lawful permanent resident and native of Ethiopia. \nThey married and moved to Saul's home in Massachusetts. Two years \nlater, Saul began drinking heavily and gradually became physically and \nverbally abusive. The abuse escalated and Donna was forced to flee from \ntheir home. She moved in with close family friends who helped her seek \ncounseling. She also filed a petition for permanent residence under the \nprovisions of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Unfortunately, with the elimination of 245(i), the only way for Donna \nto obtain her green card is to return to Ethiopia, the country where \nher father was murdered. The possibility of returning there terrifies \nher. This legislation will enable her to obtain her green card here, \nwhere she has the support and protection of family and access to the \ndomestic violence counseling she needs.\n  Under this act, battered immigrants will also have up to one year \nfrom the entry of an order of removal to file motions to reopen prior \ndeportation orders. The Attorney General may waive the one year \ndeadline on the basis of extraordinary circumstances or hardship to the \nbattered immigrant's child.\n  This Act will also expand remedies for battered immigrants living \nabroad with spouses and parents serving in the United States military \nor other federal positions. Current law only allows battered immigrants \nresiding in the United States to request this relief. This bill will \nmake it easier for these immigrants and their children to escape \nabusive relationships and obtain the help they deserve.\n  The legislation also grants the Attorney General the discretion to \nwaive certain bars to immigration relief for qualified applicants. For \nexample, battered immigrant women acting in self-defense are often \nconvicted of domestic violence crimes. Under the 1996 immigration law, \nthey became deportable and are denied relief under the Violence Against \nWomen Act. The Attorney General will be able to use the waiver \nauthority to help battered immigrants who otherwise qualify for relief.\n  Also, recently divorced battered immigrants will be able to file \nself-petitions. Current law allows only battered immigrant women \ncurrently married to their abusive spouses to qualify for relief. As a \nresult, many abusers have successfully rushed to the court house to \nobtain divorces, in order to deny relief to their immigrant spouse. \nThis provision will prevent this unfair result and ensure that victims \nare not wrongly deprived of the legal protection they need.\n\n  These and other important measures will do a great deal to protect \nbattered immigrants and their children from domestic violence and free \nthem from the fear that often prevents them from prosecuting these \ncrimes. Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 to help \nall victims of domestic violence, regardless of their citizenship. It \nis long past time to restore and expand these protections.\n  I am also pleased that the legislation includes authorization for \nincreased funds for the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Consistent \nwith last year's funding, the bill authorizes $2 million a year for the \nhotline and ensures that the Hotline will be an effective source of \nassistance, providing vital services to women, children, and their \nfamilies.\n  A second, equally important part of the bill we are considering today \nis the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which condemns and combats \nthe trafficking of persons into forced prostitution or forced labor, a \npractice that is tantamount to modern day slavery.\n  Enactment of this legislation will strengthen laws that punish \ntraffickers and ensure protection for their victims--most of whom are \nwomen and children.\n  One of the most important of these provisions expands assistance and \nprotection to victims of severe forms of trafficking, ensuring that \nthey receive appropriate shelter and care, and are able to remain in \nthe United States to assist in the prosecution of traffickers. Relief \nfrom deportation is also critical for victims who could face \nretribution or other hardship if removed from the United States.\n  Sara, a native of Sri Lanka, was promised a lucrative job as a \nhousekeeper. Upon arrival in the U.S., Sara was virtually imprisoned in \nher employer's Massachusetts home, and subjected to physical and sexual \nassault. She bore three children as a result of rape. After 5 years of \nliving in captivity and isolation, she was finally\n\n[[Page S10171]]\n\nable to escape. This legislation will provide persons like Sara with \nthe protection and rights they need to assist in the prosecution of \nthese despicable crimes.\n  Finally, this legislation also includes an important provision to \nprovide compensatory damages to Frank Reed and other American citizens \nwho were victims of Iranian terrorism.\n  In 1986, Frank Reed, of Malden, MA, was kidnapped in Lebanon. At the \ntime, he was a private citizen and president of the Lebanese \nInternational School. During his 44-month captivity, he was \nblindfolded, chained, tortured, and held in solitary confinement for 2 \nyears. His captors periodically fed him arsenic, from which his health \nstill suffers.\n  In 1990, he was released to Syrian Army intelligence officers in \nBeirut, who took him to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus. I met him when he \nreturned to the United States after his tragic and traumatic ordeal.\n  A U.S. judge ordered the Iranian Government to provide Frank Reed and \nhis wife with $26 million in compensatory damages, but the Government \nhas refused to comply.\n  Under the legislation we are approving today, the U.S. Government \nwill provide the funding. The amount will be recovered in turn by the \nU.S. Government from the Iranian Government through a Foreign Military \nSales Account that holds $400 million.\n  Frank Reed suffered immensely at the hands of his brutal captors, and \nso did his family, and he deserves this compensation.\n  I strongly support the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act, and the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act. This legislation will ensure that we are doing much more \nto protect women from violence and abuse, and it deserves to be enacted \nas soon as possible.\n\n\n                 ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. President, I want to also address the Senate for just a few \nmoments on another matter of importance to families all across this \ncountry which is central to their concerns, and that is, what has \nhappened to this Senate's commitment to passing and reauthorizing the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act? That legislation is the \nbackbone of Federal participation in helping local communities \nstrengthen academic achievement and accomplishment. We are now going \ninto the final days of this Congress and we still have not reauthorized \nthat central piece of legislation even though we have had strong \ncommitment by the majority party that this was a priority and that we \nwere going to have consideration of this legislation.\n  We heard a great deal during the recent debates of our two candidates \nfor President and our two candidates for Vice President about \neducation. But our American families are wondering, whatever happened \nto the Senate of the United States on this issue? The fact is, we are \nbasically AWOL, we are A-W-O-L on this issue. It is the first time in \n35 years that we have failed to reauthorize this legislation.\n  I understand, as we remain here for these final days, that we will \nhave a conference report for agriculture, that we will have a series of \nappropriations conference reports, but there is no reason in the world \nwe can't go back and complete this legislation in the time that we are \nin here waiting for the various appropriations bills.\n\n  We continue to challenge the Republican leadership to bring this \nback. There is still unfinished business in education and in the area \nof minimum wage. There is unfinished business on the Patients' Bill of \nRights and on the prescription drug issue.\n  I want to reemphasize exactly where we are on the issue of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. These are statements that have \nbeen made by the Republican leader, Senator Lott's promise on \neducation, going back to January 6, 1999. He said:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. That is important.\n\n  Remarks to U.S. Conference of Mayors, January 29, 1999:\n\n       But Education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's \n     not going to be just words. . . .\n\n  Press conference, June 1999:\n\n       Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in \n     the Congress this year. . . .\n\n  Remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in February of 2000:\n\n       We're going to work very hard on education. I have \n     emphasized that every year I've been Majority Leader. . . . \n     And Republicans are committed to doing that.\n\n  A speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, February \n3, 2000:\n\n       We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act. . . . Education will be a high priority in this \n     Congress.\n\n  On the Senate floor, May 1, 2000:\n\n       This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it \n     seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's \n     talk education.\n\n  Press stakeout, May 2, 2000:\n\n       Question: Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture \n     vote on that?\n       Senator Lott: No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . \n     But education is number one in the minds of the American \n     people all across this country and every State, including my \n     own State. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a \n     protracted debate and amendments on education, I think is the \n     way to go.\n\n  We agree with that statement. We still have some time, while we are \nwaiting for the appropriators to conclude their work, where we ought to \nbe bringing this back and having a full debate. We are prepared to do \nthat. We think it can be done.\n  Senate floor, July 10, 2000:\n\n       I, too, would very much like to see us complete the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act. . . . I feel very \n     strongly about getting it done. . . . We can work day and \n     night for the next 3 weeks.\n\n  Senate floor, July 25, 2000:\n\n       We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this \n     legislation this year and get it completed.\n\n  That was on July 25, and we are still waiting.\n  The fact is, we are failing to meet this central challenge. Our \nPresidential candidates are talking about the issue of education, but \nthey are talking about it in a vacuum because the Senate of the United \nStates is failing to take up this particular issue which makes such a \ndifference to families, and that is strengthening academic achievement \nand accomplishment. The fact is that we are in a new world of \ntechnology and it is demanding. We have to refocus and re-prioritize \nthe whole issue of education to make sure that it addresses the needs \nof today's economy and society. This is going to be central in terms of \nour national debate and discussion. That is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  What is going to be our involvement in terms of helping families? The \nfact is that we are absent in this debate because we are refusing to \nconclude action.\n\n  This is what is happening in America. More students are now taking \nthe SATs. 83 percent of four-year colleges use SAT scores as a factor \nin admission. Increasing numbers of students are recognizing that a \ncollege education is the key to success in America. Families understand \nthe importance of taking those tests; children understand it. We want \nto make sure we are helping those families who have children taking the \nSATs and those who would like their children to take the SATs.\n  As depicted on this chart, this is what has happened. From 1995, 42 \npercent of the children were taking SATs, and it is up to 44 percent in \n2000.\n  More students are also taking advanced math and science classes \nbecause they understand that in a highly technological world, with new \nkinds of demands in terms of technology, they are going to have to do \nmore in terms of math and science courses. We see increases in the \nnumber of students taking advanced classes in pre-calculus, calculus, \nand physics. Young people are doing their share. The real question is \nwhether we in the Congress are going to do ours. The answer comes back \nthat, no, we are not. Look at what has been happening with the SAT math \nscores. They are higher now than in the last 30 years, and they are \ncontinuously moving up. The indicators are all positive. You would not \nknow that listening to Governor Bush last week. We know we are facing \nchallenges across the country, but look at the SAT math scores; they \nare the highest in 30 years. More kids are taking the SAT, and still \nthe scores are moving up. I think we ought to understand what is \nhappening out there. Some progress is being made.\n\n[[Page S10172]]\n\n  Now, this doesn't mean that progress is being made in all of the \nStates. That is very important, indeed. Looking at the State SAT \naverages and progress made since 1997, some States have done much \nbetter than others. I am glad my own State of Massachusetts has moved \nup some 8 points, from an average total SAT score of 1,016 in 1997 to \n1,024 in 2000. We have had major educational reforms. We have done many \nthings in our State in terms of smaller class sizes, better trained \nteachers, and afterschool programs. We are not doing all the things we \nneed to be doing, but we have done a lot. We have also taken advantage \nof Net Day to try, in a voluntary way, to get good computers in \nclassrooms with well-trained teachers.\n  We also have found out in this discussion and debate that not all the \nStates--including the State of Texas--have made progress. It is \ninteresting that actually the State of Texas has declined some 2 points \nin their average total SAT score since 1997. They dropped from an \naverage score of 995 in 1997 to 993 in 2000. They are also below the \nnational SAT total score average. The national average has gone up 3 \npoints from 1997 to 2000, but the State of Texas has gone down 2 \npoints. That is a 5-point spread. So I think when we listen to these \ndebates about what ought to be done, we ought to try to take with a \ngrain of salt what has been happening in Texas over the period of these \nlast 3 years.\n  In addition, looking back at the trend over the last 10 years, as I \nunderstand it, in SAT verbal scores since 1990, Texas has been 10 \npoints below the national average. By 2000, the gap had grown to 12 \npoints. In math, Texas has been 12 points below the national average. \nBy 2000, the gap has grown to 14 points.\n  I think we want to have leadership at the national level that is \ngoing to bring continued improvement. We know we have challenges. We \nknow we have challenges in urban areas and we have challenges in rural \nareas. But we also know some of the things that work. The STARS \nProgram, as we have seen in Tennessee, has been very important in terms \nof enhancing children's academic achievement and accomplishment.\n  We know what has happened when we focus on getting better teachers in \nschools, such as in the State of Connecticut. Much of the progress \nthere has been under Republican as well as Democratic Governors. We \nwant to try to find out what has worked in these States and then have \nan opportunity to try to give general national application to it. But \nwe are effectively being closed out by the Republican leadership from \nhaving this debate. That is what families ought to understand across \nthis country.\n  We are basically being told we can't have a debate here in the Senate \non the issue of education. We had 6 days when the measure was before \nthe Senate, and 2 days were for debate only. We had eight votes and one \nwas a voice vote. So that meant seven rollcalls and three of them were \nvirtually unanimous. So we really didn't have much debate and \ndiscussion. We had 16 days of debate on the bankruptcy legislation and \n55 different amendments on it. So it is a matter of prioritizing.\n  I dare say we are failing to meet the responsibilities to families \nacross this country who want to have investment in the kinds of \neducational programs that are going to work and who understand their \nchildren are living in a new age of technological challenges. They want \nto see their children move ahead academically. We have seen that \nchildren are prepared to do that. We have seen them taking more \ndifficult courses. They are taking the challenges of SATs. They are \nprepared to move ahead.\n  Some of the States are moving ahead boldly, such as North Carolina, \nin terms of their efforts. But we have to ask ourselves: Where in the \nworld are the Congress and Senate in terms of helping and assisting \nfamilies in this area? The fact of the matter is that we are AWOL. We \nhave failed to do our homework. If we were students with this behavior, \nwe would be in the principal's office for several hours in discipline.\n  We are going to continue to talk about this. I see that we now are \ngoing to have a continuing resolution that will go into next week. We \nmay go even further. There is no reason in the world we can't use these \ninterludes to take on one of the really important issues for families; \nthat is, the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement that I can now yield to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. I ask the Senator from California how much time she would \nlike.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Between 10 and 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  So many have worked so hard on this. The distinguished Senators from \nMassachusetts and Minnesota have spoken already, but especially \nSenators Boxer, Mikulski, Lincoln, Landrieu, Murray, and Feinstein have \nworked so hard.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  I ask the Chair how much time is remaining for the Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 hours 35 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank my friend \nfrom Vermont for all his hard work. I thank my friend, Senator \nWellstone. I thank Senator Brownback. I thank Senator Biden and Senator \nHatch.\n  We have a very important bill before us. I think the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act sort of stands on its own. I would love to have \nseen that come on its own because it is a landmark piece of \nlegislation. I felt the same way about the Violence Against Women Act.\n  That is a landmark piece of legislation. Unfortunately, I think we \nhave issues and pieces of legislation that shouldn't be in here. But \nthat is the way it goes. How you would ever get to the point where you \nwould put an issue that deals with sales of wine on the Internet is \nbeyond me. I don't think people really get what we do here when we take \nthese issues and blend them together. But let's call it the way it is.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act and the Violence Against Women \nAct are so important that Members are willing to say, even if they \ndidn't agree with all the appendages, they are willing to go along with \nthem. I am going to make some comments about each piece that is in this \nlegislation.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is very near and dear to my heart \nbecause in 1990 I was over in the House, where I served very proudly \nfor about 10 years, and Senator Biden came to me and said: Would you be \nwilling to offer the Violence Against Women Act in the House? He had \nauthored it in the Senate. I was extremely pleased to agree.\n  The whole issue of domestic violence in our country up until that \ntime was never discussed. It was swept under the rug. Even though we \nknew it was brutalizing women and children, we didn't have the courage \nto act. In those early years, it was very hard to get attention paid to \nviolence against women.\n  I was able in the House to get through just a couple of pieces of \nthat legislation. But it wasn't until I came to the Senate with Senator \nBiden that we really orchestrated tremendous support for the bill. In \n1994, we got it through as part of the Crime Act. It has proven itself.\n  In this particular reauthorization, we will provide $3.3 billion in \nfunding over the next 5 years to protect victims of domestic abuse and \nviolence. We have made tremendous progress. We have seen a reduction of \nabout 21 percent in domestic violence. But still to this day, we have a \nnational crisis that shatters the lives of millions of women across the \ncountry and tears at the very fabric of our society.\n  Reauthorizing these programs sends a much needed message to those who \neven think about lifting a hand to a spouse or think about lifting a \nhand to an innocent child that we will not stand silently by and that \nwe in fact will protect those victims of domestic violence.\n  We know that nationwide nearly one in every three adult women \nexperiences at least one physical assault by an intimate partner. We \nknow for a fact that domestic violence is the leading cause\n\n[[Page S10173]]\n\nof injury to women age 15 to 44, with nearly one-third of women who are \nmurdered being murdered by a husband or a boyfriend.\n  Although domestic violence affects both men and women, the \noverwhelming majority of domestic violence victims happen to be women. \nThat is why a majority of the services authorized under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act focus on the unique circumstances of women in abusive \nrelationships.\n  Again, we have made progress. Since 1994, when the bill passed and \nPresident Clinton signed it into law, there has been a 21-percent \ndecrease in intimate partner violence and we have increased battered \nwomen's shelters by 60 percent.\n  I remember in those years when we were battling for this bill, we \noriginally pointed out that there were more shelters for animals than \nthere were for battered women. I am proud to say today we have seen an \nincrease in the number of shelters so we can in fact address the \ncritical needs of victimized women and their children, many of whom \nhave absolutely no place to go and therefore sometimes they are forced \nto stay in these abusive relationships. Where are they going to go? \nThey will go out on the street if they don't have a loving family to go \nhome to. It is a tragic situation indeed.\n  The bill ensures that we will be funding a continued increase in \nthese shelters. But we also want to stop the violence before it gets to \nthat. We have STOP grants that provide moneys for rape prevention, and \neducation grants, and a 24-hour national domestic violence hotline \nwhich is so important. Women in these circumstances need to have a \nreassuring voice. They believe sometimes that no one cares about them; \nthey are all alone. If they can dial that hotline and get professional \nhelp, it makes all the difference in the world.\n  This bill will strengthen law enforcement efforts to reduce domestic \nviolence by requiring the enforcement of other States' protection \norders as a condition of funding for some of the grants. In other \nwords, if you have a batterer who tries to escape prosecution by going \nacross State lines, we address this issue.\n  This is very important. I want to talk about the children. We talk \nabout battered women, but we know--this is an incredible fact as we \nlook at the causes of violence in society, and we are right to look \neverywhere in the society--we need to understand if a young boy sees \nhis father beat his mother, that child is twice as likely to abuse his \nown wife than the son of a nonviolent parent. If a child, particularly \na young boy, sees a father beat a mother, he is twice as likely to \nabuse his own spouse.\n  We know 10 million children every year are exposed to domestic \nviolence. More alarming even than that is the fact that 50 percent to \n70 percent of those men who abuse their female partners also abuse \ntheir children. It becomes a way of life and a way of communicating for \nwhich we should have zero tolerance. These abused children are at high \nrisk for violent, delinquent behavior. The National Institute for \nJustice reports that being abused as a child increases a child's \nlikelihood of arrest as a juvenile by 53 percent. We know even when \nthey are young they are more apt to be arrested and get in trouble. We \nknow when they are adult and they marry they are more likely to abuse a \nspouse.\n\n  When we talk about the Violence Against Women Act, we are not talking \nonly about women. We are also talking about the children. If there is \nanything we can do in this hallowed hall of the Senate, it is to \nprotect children. We have the Safe Havens for Children Pilot Program; \nwe have victims of child abuse programs funded; we have rural domestic \nviolence and child abuse enforcement grants. This package also includes \ntraining for judges and court personnel. We also, for the first time, \nlook at battered immigrants, which is a very important issue, because \nwe sometimes have people coming here who don't understand their rights. \nThey need to understand their rights, that their bodies don't belong to \nanyone else, and they have a right to cry out if they are abused.\n  There are many other programs reauthorized by the Violence Against \nWomen Act, such as those to combat sexual assault and rape, \ntransitional housing, and civil, legal assistance. Again, a lot of \nthese folks don't understand their legal rights. We provide grants to \ncounsel them. We include protection for older and disabled women.\n  It is hard to even imagine an older woman in our society or a \ndisabled person being victimized. Is there no rule that would say to \nevery human being that there has to be respect? Unfortunately, in some \ncases, these rules don't penetrate. So we have to get tough and make \nsure that we prevent this. However, if it happens, we will crack down.\n  Again, I thank Senator Joe Biden for his work. It is very important.\n  Also, a judgeship that is being held up is the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. One might \nask what it has to do with the Violence Against Women Act. The fact is, \nBonnie Campbell has been the first and only Director of the Violence \nAgainst Women Office in the Department of Justice, and her nomination \nis being held up because of partisan politics in the Senate. Here is a \nwoman who paved the way for the Violence Against Women Act, ensuring it \nwas successful, and she is a perfect person to be a judge. She was the \nattorney general in Iowa for many years. Her achievements and \nqualifications are obvious. If we really care about the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, and I believe we do, then I believe we will have an \noverwhelming vote, hopefully a unanimous vote. Then we ought to look at \none of the people who has made this act such a success. What a \nwonderful tribute it would be to the women of America to make Bonnie \nCampbell a judge.\n  I join with Senator Harkin on this because I know he has been quite \ndistressed that such an excellent nominee has had a hearing, but her \nnomination has not come out of committee. We know of no one who is \nopposed to Bonnie Campbell. I think it would be a fitting tribute to \nthe women of America to bring her nomination quickly to the floor.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Wellstone and Senator Brownback on \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act. We know that some of these \nvictims have been subjected to the most horrific lives, including rape, \nsexual abuse, torture, starvation, and imprisonment. The selling of \nnaive and desperate women into sexual bondage has become one of the \nfastest growing criminal enterprises in the global economy. It is hard \nto understand how this could happen. But when people are in a strange \nland and are frightened, they look to others to protect them when they \nreally want to hurt and harm them. This legislation authorizes $94 \nmillion over 2 years to stop this abhorrent practice.\n  At the beginning of my remarks, I talked about sometimes attaching \nbills to other bills that make no sense. I am sad to say this has the \nalcoholic beverage sales attached to it. I am very sorry for the small \nwineries in my State. I tried to protect them. I will have some kind of \na colloquy with Senator Hatch on this. Half of our 900 wineries in \nCalifornia are run by families. They don't have big, elaborate \ndistributors; they don't have a big distribution. Because of this they \nwill need to sell their product on the Internet. I have nothing against \nthe way wine is distributed, but the new technologies will make it \npossible for our many wine sellers to sell directly to consumers \nwithout the need to go through a middleman or middle person. I think it \nis sad that we have attached this because these very small family-owned \nwineries may well suffer.\n  I am going to be working with my colleagues. I know Senator Leahy is \nquite sympathetic to this. We want to make sure there are no negative \nimpacts from this legislation. We think there will be. But we are going \nto follow this very closely.\n  The excuse given is, we will stop kids from buying on the Internet. \nThat is a legitimate point. But we recommended a solution dealing \ndirectly with preventing underage drinking, and it was not accepted. In \nmy heart of hearts, I believe this is a special interest piece of \nlegislation to protect the distributors. It doesn't do anything to \nprotect young people from buying liquor. I think it is a sad day for \nour small wineries that are trying hard to survive in California.\n\n[[Page S10174]]\n\n  In conclusion, I again thank Senator Leahy for this time. It is a \nwonderful day. We finally got this Violence Against Women Act \nreauthorized. We are going to put an end, hopefully, to the sex \ntrafficking. It is a good day for the Senate.\n  I only hope we will heed the words of Senator Kennedy now and get on \nwith education, get on with prescription drugs, and get on with the \nreal Patients' Bill of Rights. Let's do our work. We can do our work. \nThe American people want us to do it. The way the procedure is going \nnow, we have no chance to offer amendments on education or health care. \nIt is a shame.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia on Bonnie Campbell. As the one who has brought life into the \nViolence Against Women Act, it is remarkable that she cannot even get a \nvote in this Chamber on her judicial nomination.\n  I have said on the floor, although we are different parties, I have \nagreed with Gov. George Bush, who has said that in the Senate a nominee \nought to get a vote, up or down, within 60 days. I urge in the time \nremaining in this session that he, as the head of his party, as their \nPresidential nominee, call the Republican leader of the Senate and say \nthat all of these women, all of these minorities, in fact, all of the \npeople who have been sitting here for well over 60 days waiting for a \nvote on their nomination, let them have a vote. Vote for them or vote \nagainst them. Bonnie Campbell deserves a vote. My guess is the reason \nshe has not been brought for a vote is they know at least 80 of the 100 \nSenators would vote for her. It would be impossible to justify a vote \nagainst her because of her extraordinary qualifications.\n  Again, if Governor Bush is serious when he says have a vote within 60 \ndays, pick up the phone, call the Senate majority leader, reach him at \nthe switchboard, 202-224-3121, and ask him to bring her to a vote. It \nis a very easy thing to do.\n  I agree with the Senator on the Internet alcohol bill. That was \nincluded over my objection. It is unnecessary. It is dangerous to e-\ncommerce. Adding Internet sales on alcohol demeans the issue of \nviolence against women and sex trafficking that this bill is all about. \nIt is demeaning to what is a good bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his comments on all fronts. \nRegarding his last comment, he is so right. When I first learned there \nwas a move to attach this bill to the Violence Against Women Act, I was \nabsolutely stunned. People have to watch what we do here. They \nunderstand, unfortunately, that the special interests still have a lot \nof influence. This is one case where they had too much influence. As my \nfriend knows, we tried to work this so we could address the issue of \njuveniles buying liquor from the Internet, which everyone agrees is a \nterrible thing. This hurts our small wineries--let's call it the way it \nis--in favor of the big distributors.\n\n  But on the Bonnie Campbell point, I particularly want to say to my \nfriend how much I have appreciated his leadership on these judicial \nnominations. I say today we would not have had even the meager number \nthat we have had without his leadership and his pointing out, over and \nover again, that women and minorities are getting second-class \ntreatment here.\n  I ask my friend if he would recount, briefly, the study he had quoted \nmany times, showing that women and minorities take about 3 months \nlonger, on average, to get through; just his comments on how it always \nseems we are here fighting for women or a minority. It does not seem as \nif we have to fight that hard for the white male.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, the study was done by the non-\npartisan Citizens for Independent Courts. In fact, the former \nRepublican Congressman from Oklahoma, Mickey Edwards, co-chaired that \nstudy. They found, without taking sides and without taking political \nstands, that women and minorities took longer to be confirmed by the \nSenate. Unfortunately, a lot of those women and minorities are not even \ngetting a vote.\n  Again I say if Governor Bush means it, pick up the phone and call \n202-224-3121; ask the Senate switchboard to connect him to the \nRepublican leader and say: You know, I have made it a tenet of my \ncampaign that the Senate should vote on a nomination within 60 days. \nYou can bring every one of these people to the floor for a vote, up or \ndown, today. Let's do so. Who knows. We will find out how the Senate \nfeels about them. Are they for them or are they against them? Right \nnow, instead of voting yes or no, we vote ``maybe,'' by having one or \ntwo Senators in the dark of night put holds on these people.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Washington State, who has been \none of the great leaders on the issue of violence against women, on sex \ntrafficking, and on these other issues. I ask her, how much time does \nthe Senator from Washington require?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \ncomments. I am looking forward, hopefully, to him chairing the \nJudiciary Committee next year; so that women such as Bonnie Campbell \nare not held up for months on end and we actually have a chance to put \ngood, qualified women and minorities into judiciary positions in this \ncountry.\n  I also thank the Senator from Vermont for his tremendous work on the \nViolence Against Women Act, bringing us to a point today where we are \nfinally going to have a vote on this bill, despite the fact there are \nother parts of this bill that I do not believe should be attached to \nit. I appreciate his efforts because this is an extremely important \nbill.\n  I have come to the floor to express my strong support for \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and to endorse the pending \nconference report. In communities across America, the Violence Against \nWomen Act has been an overwhelming success. It has empowered women and \nchildren to escape violent relationships, and it has helped to put \nabusers behind bars. On every account, the Violence Against Women Act \ndeserves to be reauthorized. I urge my colleagues to support this vital \nlegislation.\n  It is unfortunate that reauthorization was allowed to lapse this past \nmonth, but I am pleased the Republican leadership has finally agreed \nthat reauthorization must be a priority. I wish we had reached the \nconclusion earlier in this session.\n  This subject deserves a much more open and extended debate than has \nbeen allowed, but I want to take full advantage of the opportunity \nbefore us, the chance to reauthorize and strengthen the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. VAWA has been nothing short of historic.\n  Not long ago, domestic violence was considered a private family \nmatter. That perception made it very difficult for women to get help \nand for communities to confront domestic violence. But all of that \nchanged in 1994. I am very proud to have worked to pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act because, for the first time, our Nation recognized \ndomestic violence for what it is--a violent crime and a public health \nthreat.\n  Through the Violence Against Women Act, we created a national \nstrategy for dealing with violence against women. Today, looking back, \nit is very clear just how revolutionary the act was. For the first \ntime, it established a community-wide response, bringing together cops \nand prosecutors, shelters and advocates and others on the front lines \nof domestic violence. It authorized programs to give financial and \ntechnical support to police departments to focus on domestic violence \nand to encourage arrests. It recognized and supported the essential \nrole of the courts in ensuring justice. It provided funding for \nbattered women's shelters and for programs that address the public \nhealth impact of domestic violence.\n  VAWA authorized funding for the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, for Rape Prevention and Education, and it helped establish \na national toll-free hotline for victims of domestic violence. Today, \n1-800-799-SAFE offers battered women immediate help. In fact, every \nmonth, that hotline receives more than 13,000 calls. Back in 1994, some \npeople wondered whether this unprecedented national strategy would \nwork. Today, 6 years\n\n[[Page S10175]]\n\nlater, the facts are in and it is clear that the Violence Against Women \nAct has been a success. Arrests and convictions are up. We have more \nthan doubled funding for battered women's shelters. Since 1994, we have \nappropriated close to $2 billion for VAWA-related programs.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of my highest \npriorities has always been increasing funding for the Violence Against \nWomen Act programs. In communities throughout my State and others, the \nneed is overwhelming, and funding makes a dramatic difference. Working \nwith the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, and Education of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, I have seen funding for shelters \nclimb from $10 million to more than $100 million. I know Senator \nSpecter has been a strong advocate for the Violence Against Women Act \nprograms. I am pleased that VAWA has always been a bipartisan issue in \nappropriations.\n  While we have much to be proud of today, we cannot forget that abuse \nis still too common. In Washington State, my home State, the toll-free \ndomestic violence hotline received more than 37,000 calls between July \n1998 and July 1999. We cannot forget that there are still too few \nresources for women in need. In my State during that same period, \n23,806 women and children were turned away from shelters--turned away \nas they sought help because the resources were not there.\n  We cannot forget that not all communities offer a full range of \nservices, and not all police departments are equipped to handle a life-\nthreatening domestic violence call.\n  The truth is, while the Violence Against Women Act was a historic \nfirst step, it was just that, a first step. The time has come for us to \nbuild on the foundation created by that act. VAWA offered an immediate \nresponse to the threat of violence. Now it is time to address the long-\nterm issues. It is time to confront the long-range economic barriers \nthat trap women and children in violent relationships.\n  I have worked with Senators Wellstone and Schumer to write and \nintroduce the Battered Women's Economic Security Act. This legislation \ntears down economic barriers and breaks the cycle of violence. Our bill \ndeals with employment discrimination, insurance discrimination, housing \nassistance, legal help, and child care. It addresses the punitive \nelements of the welfare system that can penalize women who are fleeing \ndangerous situations. It provides additional help to shelters and \nproviders to meet the overwhelming needs of battered women and \nchildren.\n  I had hoped we would have been able to reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act in a timely manner and move to addressing those \neconomic issues that I have outlined. Unfortunately, we cannot have \nthat debate today or in this session of Congress. But let me assure my \ncolleagues we will be back in the 107th Congress to fight to put these \npowerful tools in the hands of victims and their advocates.\n  Before I conclude, I want to say a special word of thanks to the many \npeople who have helped us reach this point today.\n  I thank, again, Senator Leahy and Senator Biden for their leadership. \nThey worked very hard to bring a bipartisan bill to the floor today.\n  I also thank all of the advocates who fought so hard to ensure the \nsuccess of the Violence Against Women Act and who have been aggressive \nin urging this Congress to act. Without their support in our \ncommunities, VAWA would never have been a success.\n  I thank the Washington State Coalition Against Domestic Violence for \nits dedicated work.\n  I thank all of the advocates, police officers, and community leaders \nwith whom I have worked since 1994 to implement VAWA and to strengthen \nthis important act.\n  I thank the many shelters and organizations that have opened their \nfacilities to me during this session of Congress, including the Tacoma-\nPierce County YWCA, Kitsap Special Assault Victims Investigative \nServices in Bremerton, the Bellingham YWCA, the Vancouver YWCA Domestic \nViolence Day Care Shelter, the Spokane Domestic Violence Consortium, \nthe Spokane Women's Drop-In Center, and the people at Vashon Island \nDomestic Violence Outreach Services.\n  As I have visited with them, I have seen firsthand the services they \noffer and the challenges they face. I have spoken personally with women \nwho have had their lives changed because of the services offered, and I \nhave been impressed by the progress they are making day in and day out. \nThose experiences have strengthened my determination to support their \nwork in the Senate.\n  In closing, it is clear the Violence Against Women Act has been a \nremarkable success. We cannot delay authorization any longer, and I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this measure. I look forward to working \nwith those in the Senate and those in my State to help build on the \nprogress of the Violence Against Women Act in the next session of \nCongress.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 55 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Out of the 3 hours? We have not been in session 3 hours, \nMr. President. The Senator from Vermont had a total of 3 hours. We went \ninto session less than 3 hours ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will indulge, we will \nrecalculate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thought there might be more. You have to watch out for \nthat fuzzy math.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 hour 55 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That sounds a little closer to it. I am going to be \nreserving time for my own speech, but I have been withholding giving a \nspeech because other Members on our side want to speak. I see the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland. I yield 5 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland, my good friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I hope today the Senate will pass \nlegislation to improve the lives of women in America and around the \nworld and protect them from predators.\n  Make no mistake, when people commit crimes, they never commit crimes \nagainst people who are bigger, stronger, or have more power than they. \nThey always go after the weak, the vulnerable. One can be weak either \nin physical strength or weak because one does not have the same size \nweapon.\n  Today we have two pieces of legislation pending: One, the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and the other will \nbreak new ground to protect women and children who are bought and sold \naround the world as if they were commodities. They are victims of \npredatory behavior.\n  By passing this legislation, we are going to protect them. Women in \ntheir own homes are often victims of violence. Mr. President, 900,000 \nwomen last year were battered in their own homes.\n  The Violence Against Women Act says we will not tolerate violence, \nwhether it is in the home, in the neighborhood, or on a street corner.\n  I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Brownback who have been working on \nthis legislation, along with Senator Joe Biden. We appreciate the \nsupport and leadership of the good men here.\n  We want to be sure that through this legislation, we are going to not \nonly prevent violence but help women rebuild their lives. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act works through domestic violence programs at the State \nlevel, works with law enforcement, and works in treatment programs for \nthose who were the abusers. I hope we pass this legislation.\n  The second part is legislation that will also be a hallmark. It is \nthe Sexual Trafficking Victims Protection Act. Girls as young as 10 \nyears old are kidnapped from their villages and taken to brothels or \nsweatshops where they are imprisoned, forced to work as prostitutes, \nbeaten, threatened, and even drugged into submissiveness. They prey \nupon women in the poorest regions of the world.\n  In addition, in central and southern Europe, with the collapse of the \nold economy, women from very poor villages are lured by fraudulent scam\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\npredators into thinking they are going to work in the West and are \ngoing to work in the hospitality industry. You bet it's hospitality. It \nis called turning them into whores.\n  I say to my colleagues, that is not what the free world and free \neconomy should be about. We want to make the trafficking in women and \nchildren as criminal as the trafficking in illegal drugs. Guess what. \nOften the same scum who traffic in women are also the ones who traffic \nin drugs and traffic in illegal weapons of mass destruction.\n  I support and applaud the efforts of the Senator from Kansas who has \ntaken the leadership in this area. He has visited Asia and has seen the \nrecruitment and despicable circumstances under which young girls and \nchildren are forced to work. From briefings here, we know this is going \non in the Balkans, out of Ukraine, and out of Poland. Many are brought \ninto this country under false pretenses with phony visas. We have to \nstop the trafficking of women around the world.\n  This is very good legislation.\n  It will improve the lives of women in America and around the world. \nBy passing the Violence Against Women Act, we are helping the victims \nof domestic violence to rebuild their lives. By passing the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act, we are protecting women and children who are \nbought and sold, and forced into slavery.\n  Again every year, more than 900,000 women are victims of violence in \ntheir own homes. Every second, 20 women are battered. The Violence \nAgainst Women Act says we will not let violence threaten women, \nfamilies, or communities.\n  Violence against women is not just a threat to the health and safety \nof women. It is a threat to the health and safety of families and our \ncommunities.\n  No woman in this country should live in fear. No woman should fear \nwalking home at night. No woman should fear leaving a campus library. \nNo woman should fear that her husband or boyfriend will hurt her or her \nchildren.\n  We will not tolerate it--not in Maryland, where 41 women were killed \nby domestic violence last year; not anywhere in America, where 4 women \na day are killed by domestic violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act supports programs that help women to \nrebuild their lives. It strengthens law enforcement's response to \ndomestic violence. It gives legal assistance to victims of domestic \nviolence, and it creates safe havens for women and children who are \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  The Violence Against Women Act will protect thousands of woman \nthroughout the country. Today we are also taking steps to protect women \nthroughout the world--by passing the Sex Trafficking Victims Act.\n  The truly repugnant practice of trafficking in human beings affects \nbetween one and two million women and girls each year. As I have \nstated, girls as young as ten years old are kidnaped from their \nvillages. Or unsuspecting families allow their daughters to leave--with \npromises of good jobs and better lives. These women are taken to \nbrothels or sweatshops--where they are imprisoned. They are forced to \nwork as prostitutes. They are beaten, they are threatened--and many are \nkilled. Even if a woman escapes, she is often so afraid of retaliation \nthat she will not testify against her abductors.\n  Organized, international criminals are responsible for the increase \nin trafficking. They prey on young women in the poorest regions of the \nworld. They take advantage of the most vulnerable--who live in \ndeveloping countries with poor economic and uneven law enforcement.\n  Most countries have no way of dealing with this sophisticated form of \ninternational crime. Many countries where trafficking is most prevalent \nlack the laws and law enforcement authority to handle the problem. To \noften, when local authorities catch traffickers, the women get the \nbrunt of the punishment for prostitution--while traffickers face minor \npenalties.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It focuses on \nprevention, protection, and support for victims, and prosecution of \ntraffickers. It recognizes that trafficking is a global problem that \nrequires an international solution.\n  To prevent trafficking this legislation raises the awareness of the \nproblem in villages and countries. It educates potential victims by \npromoting anti-trafficking awareness campaigns and by authorizing \neducational and training assistance to international organizations and \nforeign governments. It also requires the Secretary of State to report \non the severe forms of trafficking in persons in the annual country \nreports.\n  To strengthen prosecution, this legislation provides local \nauthorities with the tools to crack down on traffickers.\n  To support the victims of trafficking, this legislation directs funds \nfor international organizations that help these women to rebuild their \nlives. They are given a safe haven where they can recover. They are \nprovided with education, training, and microloans.\n  This legislation also recognizes that trafficking is not just a \nforeign problem. Approximately 50,000 women are brought to the United \nStates each year where they are forced into prostitution or other \nservitude. This bill toughens current Federal trafficking penalties by \ndoubling the current maximum penalties for traffickers to 20 years \nimprisonment with the possibility of life imprisonment. It also changes \nimmigration law to help victims of trafficking. This will stop the \npractice of deporting victims back to potentially dangerous situations.\n  We want this century to be one of democracy and human rights. We will \nnot achieve this unless everyone, including the worlds' poorest women, \nis able to control their own lives. This means education, economic \ndevelopment, family planning and civic institutions that protect the \nrights of women. The legislation we are passing today will take us \ncloser to achieving these goals. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nstrongly supporting the Violence Against Women Act and the Sex \nTrafficking Victims Act.\n  In conclusion, 4 years ago, I was a victim of violence. I was coming \nhome from dinner with a wonderful professor who was an economic adviser \nto me and was here for a conference. I got her to her hotel. As I \nstepped out of my car, zam, I was mugged. I lost my handbag. I had a \nsevere injury to my hand. I tried to fight him off, but he was over 6 \nfeet, and I am under 5 feet. Fortunately, I escaped with my life. All I \nhad was a broken memory and shattered security in my own neighborhood.\n  Thanks to the success of the Baltimore Police Department and the \npressing of charges and the willingness not to plea bargain, that man \nis doing time while I hope I am out here doing good. I want to be sure \nthe streets of America are safe. I have an entire Baltimore community \non my side, including the informants. Not every woman has that. Let's \ntry to get them the resources they need to be safe in their homes and \ncommunities. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recall very well the incident of which \nthe Senator from Maryland speaks. I am pleased this is a case where the \nperpetrator was arrested and prosecuted.\n  One of the things I learned in my years as a prosecutor is that too \noften nobody wanted to pursue those cases. All that meant, of course, \nwas that somebody else would be a victim. In this case, it was the \nSenator from Maryland. But from my experience, had the person not been \napprehended, not been convicted, then someday it would be somebody \nelse. So I commend the people of Baltimore who rallied to her. At least \nout of that sorry thing there was adequate prosecution. But we have so \nmuch violence against women that we never see.\n  I recall so many times police officers seeing a badly battered woman, \nand where we would bring prosecution, but as I talked to her, I would \nfind this had happened several times before in a domestic situation and \nthat they had gone to law enforcement, and others, and had been turned \nback where nothing had been followed up on. We had a very aggressive \nprogram in my office where we would follow up on it. I have to think \nthere are a number of deaths, though, that have occurred and do occur \nin places where it is not followed up on.\n  This is something you do not see in the sunny ads and the perfect \nhomes and domestic situations that we see on our television. The fact \nis, there are a lot of places in this country where\n\n[[Page S10177]]\n\nthere is enormous violence against women.\n  I would add to the comments of my colleague, it goes across every \neconomic strata, it goes across all social strata. This is not one \nthing that is just in poor neighborhoods or just in one ethnic group or \nanother. This goes across the economic strata. It goes across good \nneighborhoods and bad neighborhoods, large families and small families. \nBut, unfortunately, many times it never comes to the attention of law \nenforcement. Regrettably, sometimes when it does, it is not followed up \non. This act, itself, will help focus the attention of law enforcement \non this.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Jersey had asked to speak, and I \nknow the Senator from Louisiana wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could say before my colleague from \nMaryland leaves the floor, I thank her for her leadership on this \nViolence Against Women Act and for her statements on the sex \ntrafficking bill. I look forward to working with her on both issues as \nwe move forward. Hopefully, this will be cleared through the Senate and \nsigned into law and we can take more actions and steps down the road to \nsee that people are cared for in these terrible situations. I do \nappreciate her comments and her support. I thank the Senator.\n  I apologize for the interruption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Kansas does not have to make any \napologies with all the work he has done on this. I appreciate him being \nhere.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join with the others in thanking our \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for his leadership in this area \nand, of course, Senator Biden and other Senators who have spoken this \nmorning on this important subject.\n  I want to follow up with what Senator Leahy just said by sharing with \nhim, and with all here, an unfortunate story that appeared recently in \na newspaper out of Maryland where a 44-year-old man was convicted of \nraping an 18-year-old girl who was unconscious from drinking.\n  Unfortunately, this judge is one of many judges, or at least too \nmany--the number is too high--who are ignorant and uninformed. He said \non the record in this particular case: ``Finding an unconscious woman \nis a dream come true to a lot of men.''\n  Finding an unconscious woman is a dream come true to a lot of men.\n  I will submit this judge's name for the Record and will be writing \nhim a personal letter, asking him, if he did make this statement which \nwas reported, that he resign his seat immediately.\n  That is part of the problem we have in this Nation. The Senator from \nVermont, as a former prosecutor, understands this well, that this \nproblem is pervasive. It is a real shame in America--this country of \nfreedom and order and democracy--that we still have a severe and \nserious problem of domestic violence.\n  Sometimes our Nation takes that extra step and goes that extra mile \nto stop violence on the street and to continue to support our police \nofficers. Yet when it comes to stopping violence in our own homes, our \nGovernment falls short in terms of funding, in terms of research, in \nterms of education.\n  That is the hope that this act brings. It is to help move judges such \nas this off the bench; so when he is up for reelection, there is some \neducation in the community that would force his either resignation or \nmoving him off the bench through the election cycle.\n  There are prosecutors around the Nation, some of whom are more \nenlightened than others. But I will tell you of two in my State who are \ndoing an outstanding job on this subject: DA Paul Connick from \nJefferson Parish and DA Walter Reed from St. Tammany Parish.\n  We have many excellent DAs. But in the last few years, many of these \nDAs--99 percent of whom, I would imagine, in the Nation are male and \nwho perhaps do not come to the subject from a very personal point of \nview--have been really educated because of the good work that has been \ndone in this Congress and with groups all around this Nation.\n  These two particular DAs have instituted a very progressive policy \nwhich is basically a no-drop policy, which means that if a battered \nwoman comes in to file a charge, the DA takes it upon himself, and \nbasically the State and the county and the parish, even if she begins \nto back down because her self-esteem is not as strong as it should be, \nor she is understandably frightened, or she has been threatened if she \ndoes not drop the charges, to simply tell the abuser, when he comes in \nfor his interview: I am sorry, we refuse to drop the charges. This is \nagainst you and me, buddy, basically, and we are going to see this to \nthe end, where you can get the punishment coming to you.\n  They are really being very aggressive. I hope if other district \nattorneys or other staffers or folks and other elected officials are \ntuning in today, they will encourage district attorneys all over this \nNation to take up the no-drop policy, because getting abusers \nconvicted, getting them punished, and then getting them the right \ntreatment for this is the only way we are going to stop this terrible \ntragedy from occurring.\n\n  There are so many things I could say about this subject, but I do \nthink our leaders realize it is about education; it is about district \nattorneys; it is about judges, it is about the court system; it is not \njust about shelters and counseling and aid, which is so important. This \nis the first step, giving women a safe place to go, giving children a \nsafe place to go. Our justice system must work for them. That is why \nthis bill is so important.\n  My colleague from New Jersey is waiting to speak on the same subject. \nI thank Senator Lautenberg for his great leadership in this area. But \nlet me just for the record read some recent headlines.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let me read some recent headlines from our national \nnewspapers because the Senator was making an earlier point that I agree \nwith, that this isn't just in poor neighborhoods; this isn't just in \nneighborhoods of people who have recently come to this Nation; this \nisn't about people who have not had a good education; this affects \neveryone in all walks of life.\n  ``Popular Romance Novelist Shot and Killed by Estranged Husband,'' an \nAP story from June 1999.\n  ``Tommy Lee goes to jail for Wife Abuse,'' from USA Today, in May \n1998.\n  ``Colorado Rockies Pitcher Arrested on Suspicion of Punching Pregnant \nWife in Face,'' from the Washington Post, August 1999.\n  ``Number of Women Dying from Domestic Violence Holding Steady Despite \nDrastic Drop in Overall Homicide Rates,'' San Francisco, February 1998.\n  Mr. President, we have to do a better job. We have to continue on \nthis track. Violence has no place in our society--on our streets, on \nour playgrounds, or in back alleys. But it most certainly has no place \nin our homes where children grow up. If a home can't be safe, if a home \ncan't provide peace for a child or a woman, as a person, where can they \nfind peace, Mr. President? That is what this bill is about.\n  I think it is appropriate that the Violence Against Women Act will be \npassed with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It says that we \nunderstand that violence against women is a world wide problem.\n  In passing the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 we seized the \nopportunity to be a world leader--to take the stand that in the \ngreatest democracy in the world it is unacceptable that such violence \noccurs.\n  We have spent $16 billion on programs on education, assistance and \nprosecution. We must continue.\n  Every 5 minutes a woman is raped. Every day four women die as a \nresult of domestic violence.\n  More women are injured by domestic violence than by automobile \naccidents and cancer deaths combined.\n  We have made progress but there is more to be done.\n  Here are some of the other statistics from that Tulane study:\n  More than eight of ten knew someone who had been murdered;\n  More than half had witnessed a shooting;\n  43% said they had seen a dead body in their neighborhood; and\n  37% of them were themselves victims of physical violence.\n\n[[Page S10178]]\n\n  If we think that violence is something that only affects other \ncountries we must think again. If we think that a bill like the \nviolence against women's act only affects women we are wrong.\n  Studies show that a child's exposure to the father abusing the mother \nis the strongest risk factor for transmitting violent behavior from one \ngeneration to the next.\n  A significant number of young males in the juvenile justice system \nwere from homes where violence was the order of the day.\n  Family violence costs the nation from $5 to $10 billion annually in \nmedical expenses, police and court costs, shelters and foster care, \nsick leave, absenteeism, and non-productivity.\n  Last week I told you about a woman from my State, Jacqulene Gersfeld, \nwho was gunned down by her husband outside a courthouse just moments \nafter she filed for divorce.\n  The VAWA reauthorization includes a provision to expand the \ninvestigation and prosecution of crimes of violence against women.\n  The need for this is great 85% of all reported rapes end up with no \nconviction. Almost 90% result in no jail time.\n  In Baltimore, MD, a 44 year old man was convicted of raping an 18 \nyear old girl who was unconscious from drinking. The judge in the case \nsaid the following on the record: ``Finding an unconscious woman is a \ndream come true for a lot of men.'' And so he sentenced him only to \nprobation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator \nLeahy, for helping us get an addition to this legislation that we think \nis critically important. I also extend my thanks to Senator Brownback \nof Kansas for his assistance in enabling us to get our particular \nsection of this bill into place.\n  Mr. President, a light comes as a result of the fact that we have our \nfemale colleagues with us in this Senate. How hard they work to get \nthings done on both sides of the aisle. What a difference it has made \nin the way we operate. Many of us were here before there was a \nreasonable presence of women--and it is not yet ``reasonable''; I will \nstrike that word. But that will change in time. We are getting there. \nThey have helped to bring to the consciousness of all America the kinds \nof abuses that are perpetrated against women and young children who are \nfemale--disgusting practices that shock us all; trafficking in young \nwomen, forcing them into virtual slavery and being sexually exploited, \nand losing their identity in the process. It is a humiliation few can \nimagine. I commend the authors of this bill. Also, I commend them for \nincluding the section on violence against women.\n  Mr. President, 3 years ago, when we were hard at work trying to \nreduce gun violence in our society, I offered a piece of legislation to \nprohibit those who had even as little as a misdemeanor charge proven \nagainst them from getting guns. It was a tough battle, and we were on \nthe losing side a couple of times, with the old song about it which is \n``the camel's nose under the tent, and you will be controlling guns,'' \nand so forth, instead of thinking about how many lives we would save. \nWe know that about 150 times a year a woman has a gun pointed at her \nhead--and I guess the reverse is also true occasionally--and is told, \n``I will blow your head off'' in front of children. What kind of wounds \ndoes that leave even if the trigger isn't pulled? It is a terrible \nmemory for all of those who are either victims or witnesses.\n  With the help of President Clinton, we were finally able to get a \npiece of legislation in a budget bill that had to be done--it is almost \n4 years now, and it had to be done and it passed and was signed into \nlaw--to prevent spousal and children abusers from getting permits to \nown a gun. The result is that almost 35,000 gun permits have been \ndenied to these people--35,000 potential opportunities for a man to put \na gun against a woman's head and threaten to take her life. So I \nsupport this bill with these two sections. I have added a section--\nmyself and Senator Mack of Florida--that talks about helping those who \nhave been victims of terrorism, whether on our shores or away from \nAmerica. American citizens are deserving of protection. I am pleased \nthe Senate is going to pass this package of worthy legislation.\n  The underlying Trafficking Victims Protection Act addresses a very \nserious human rights issue in Europe and elsewhere, where people are \ntrafficking particularly for sexual exploitation. Finally, we are \ntaking action to combat trafficking and to help these victims. I am \npleased that this conference report will also reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act and expand coverage to include new programs for \nimmigrant women, elderly women, and women in the military service.\n\n  Throughout my career, I have worked to help prevent domestic \nviolence. I strongly supported the original Violence Against Women Act, \nwhich Congress passed in 1994. I am so pleased that we are going to \ntake care of those aberrations of behavior that leave women and \nfamilies devastated. But we are getting onto another subject, as well, \nwhich I think is critical, and that is to provide justice for victims \nof terrorism as part of the trafficking victims protection conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, we all talk about our objections and abhorrence of \nterrorist attacks against American citizens, whether abroad or at home, \nand I had an experience that was almost in front of my eyes which \nshocked me and caused me to think about how we might prevent terrorism \nagainst our citizens at any time, at any place.\n  One of those victims was a young woman named Alisa Flatow. She was a \njunior at Brandeis University and she was studying in Israel for a \ntime. In 1995, on April 9, she boarded a bus that took her from a place \ncalled Ashkelon to another destination. She never arrived. Shortly \nafter noon, when the bus was in the Gaza Strip, a suicide bomber drove \na van loaded with explosives into the bus. Seven passengers were \nkilled. Alisa Flatow was among those injured. An Israeli Defense Forces \nhelicopter rushed her to a hospital in a community nearby. It was the \nsame day I arrived in Israel from a trip in the Middle East. When I \narrived there, our U.S. Ambassador informed me of the terrible tragedy \nthat had occurred and that one of them was a constituent from New \nJersey and that she had been severely injured in that attack. I \nimmediately reached her home in West Orange, NJ, an area very familiar \nto me because I lived near that neighborhood.\n  I spoke to her mother, Rosalyn, and was informed that Alisa's father, \nSteve, was already on his way to Israel. By the time he arrived, the \nemergency surgery had failed to save his daughter's life. She died on \nApril 10. She was 20 years old.\n  For any of those who have children, they know that 20 years of age is \nalmost the beginning of life.\n  I have three daughters and a son. Those were marvelous years as they \napproached the end of their college terms and prepared for life beyond.\n  But that didn't prevent a faction of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad \nfrom claiming responsibility and being proud of what they did with that \nsuicide bombing. What good was it going to do their cause to have one \nmission of terrorists to frighten people and prevent them from \nconducting their lives as they would like to without any specific gain \nto be had?\n  There was a sponsor who paid something to somebody to have these \nyoung people assassinated. It was Iran. That is one of the reasons that \ncountry is still on the State Department's list of terrorist countries.\n  I want to tell you, Mr. President, that I am befuddled by some of the \npolicy decisions we make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask if I can have 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 5 more minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank Senator Leahy.\n  There is no stronger advocate for the protection and safety of our \ncitizens than President Clinton. But I don't understand why we take a \ncountry such as Iran and start to deal with them in trade of \ninsignificant items. Would you believe--I am almost embarrassed to\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nsay it--that caviar, pistachio, Persian rugs are vital items for the \nwell-being of our society? It is outrageous.\n  But there are differences in point of view. I am not a professional \ndiplomat. Maybe I fail to understand the longer term value of something \nthat looks trivial to me as I express myself.\n  For the past five years, I have been proud to stand with Steve Flatow \nin his effort to achieve some measure of justice for the killing of his \ndaughter. He and I both want to hold Iran accountable.\n  But Alisa Flatow was not Iran's only victim. Matt Eisenfeld of \nConnecticut and Sarah Duker of New Jersey, a young American couple in \nIsrael, also were killed in 1996 when a suicide bomb from an Iran-\nsponsored group ripped through a bus they had boarded.\n  One cannot comprehend what these missions are supposed to accomplish.\n  I don't want to bring the situation in Israel and the Middle East up \nto a full-scale debate at this moment. But there can be nothing gained \nby assaults against people or their property.\n  I made a speech yesterday in which I pleaded with Mr. Arafat to stop \nthe hatred of his people; to stop the inflammation; to stop the \npropaganda that induces this kind of hatred and action; to stop ugly \ncartoons about people who inhabit Israel, the Jewish community; and to \nstop the anti-Semitic diatribes that still occur in Palestine. Stop it; \nstop it.\n  Well-known journalist Terry Anderson and others were held hostage in \nLebanon in the late 1980s by captors funded by Iran.\n  They and their families also deserve justice, as do the families of \nthose killed when the Cuban government in 1996 deliberately shot down \ntwo planes used by Brothers to the Rescue.\n  Mr. President, The Antiterrorism Act of 1996 gave American victims of \nstate-sponsored terrorism the right to sue the responsible state.\n  The law carved out a deliberately narrow exception to the sovereign \nimmunity protections our laws afford other countries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Vermont if I \nmay have 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield an extra 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, especially because of the tremendous work he has done \nalong with the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack, on this subject. I think \nthey have had to overcome so many obstacles and so many mysterious \nholds on their legislation. I, of course, yield 5 more minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont not only for his \ngraciousness in extending to me additional time but for the help and \nguidance that he gave as we tried to put this piece of legislation into \nlaw.\n  Our goal then, and our goal now, is to allow American victims to \nreceive some measure of justice in U.S. courts and to make state \nsponsors of terrorism pay for the death and devastation they have \nwrought.\n  Victims of terrorism have put the 1996 law to good use. The Flatow \nfamily won a U.S. court judgment against Iran in 1998. Other victims of \nterrorism won similar cases.\n  The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act helps the victims collect \ncompensatory damages they've won fair and square in our nation's \ncourts.\n  Foreign countries that sponsor terrorism should have to pay for the \nawful toll that terrorist attacks take on families like the Flatows. \nAnd we hope that making terrorist states pay that price will deter them \nfrom sponsoring terrorism in the future.\n  Let me close, by thanking the many cosponsors and Senators who have \nhelped advance this legislation. I particularly would like to thank \nSenator Mack, who has been with me every step of the way, and Gary \nShiffman on his staff.\n  I also want to thank Frederic Baron of my staff who worked so hard on \nthis bill.\n  I think this bill is a good example of bipartisan cooperation for a \nworthy cause--helping provide justice for American victims of terrorism \nabroad.\n  I am sure this legislation will pass overwhelmingly, but I want this \nmessage to go out across this globe: that if you sponsor terrorism \nagainst American citizens, you will pay a price. We ought to be \nunrelenting in that. I was proud of our country when we moved against \nAfghanistan to pay for the perpetrators of dastardly acts against \nAmerican citizens and their interests.\n  We can never step aside and argue whether or not it is appropriate. \nWe have to find out by testing the waters, by making sure that the \nlegislation is there. If there is a challenge, so be it. But we have to \nindicate we will not stand by and let this happen without repercussions \nto those who sponsor terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey and \nthe Senator from Florida for their excellent work. I want to take a \nmoment to engage in a colloquy with Senator Brownback to clarify a \nphrase in division A of the bill. In order to be eligible for the visa \nprovided, the traffic victim would be required to prove she would face \n``extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm.''\n  This is a new standard under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Can \nthe Senator explain why this new standard was created?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to respond to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  This was raised in conference committee under thorough discussion \nabout this new standard of ``extreme hardship involving unusual and \nsevere harm.'' There was a fear on the part of some conferees that some \njudicial interpretations over the term ``extreme hardship'' might be \ntoo expansive; specifically, the conferees objected to an \ninterpretation that the applicant could prove ``extreme hardship'' by \nshowing he or she would miss American baseball after being deported \nfrom the United States. So this language should be interpreted as a \nhigher standard than some of these expansive interpretations of \n``extreme hardship.''\n  At the same time, however, this language should not exclude bona fide \nvictims who would suffer genuine and serious harm if they were \ndeported. There is no requirement that the harm be physical harm. I \nrepeat, there is no requirement that the harm be physical harm or that \nit be caused by the trafficking itself. The harm or the hardship does \nnot have to be caused by the trafficking itself. The purpose of \ninserting the phrase ``unusual and severe'' is to require a showing \nthat something more than the inconvenience and dislocation that any \nalien would suffer upon removal might occur.\n\n  I wish to make it clear in future interpretations of this act, while \nthis is higher than extreme hardship, it doesn't require physical harm; \nit doesn't require the harm be associated with the trafficking, to be \nable to allow an American to qualify under this new definition within \nthe act.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for allowing me the opportunity \nto clarify this particular issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his clarification.\n  We have been talking about the trafficking legislation. Before a \nfinal vote, I want to get back to that legislation. I think it is such \nan important human rights effort.\n  I will talk about the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct and make a couple of points. Again, to have a vote on legislation \nthat goes after this egregious practice of trafficking of women and \ngirls for the purposes of forced prostitution and forced labor is \nimportant to our country and to the world. Then to have reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act also makes this a doubly important \nbill. I am so pleased to be on the conference committee and to be able \nto be a part of helping to make this happen.\n  I thank Senator Biden, I thank Senator Hatch, and I thank Senator \nLeahy and others, for including in this bill authorization for what we \ncall safe havens or safety visitation centers. Let me explain by way of \nexample from Minnesota. I need to honor these children, and I need to \nhonor their mother. Anyone from Minnesota will remember the case of \nAlex and Brandon, seen in this picture; two beautiful boys. It was \nthese two boys and what happened to them that made me understand the \nimportance of safety visitation centers more than anything else that \ncould ever have happened.\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\n  On July 3, 1996, Brandon, who was 5, and Alex, who was 4, were \nmurdered by their father during an unsupervised visit. Their mother, \nAngela, was separated from Kurt Frank, the children's father. During \nthe marriage, she was physically and emotionally abused. Angela had an \norder of protection against Kurt Frank, but during the custody hearing \nshe requested her husband not be allowed to see the children in \nunsupervised settings. The request he see the children only in \nsupervised settings was rejected by the judge. Kirk Frank was able to \nsee his sons with no supervision. When he did, and God knows why, he \nkilled them. We have a center now, that the community supports, which \nis a safety visitation center.\n  The point is this: There are two different examples. Say a woman has \nbeen battered. And please remember, every 13 seconds a woman is \nbattered in the country. Say she has had the courage to get away, to \nend this marriage. There is a separation going on and a divorce; you \nare still not necessarily going to say the father can't see the child, \nbut if the father comes to the home to pick up the child, he steps \ninside the home and then battering can start again. There is no \nprotection. If you can do it at the safe havens, supervision centers, \nyou can protect the woman and you can protect the children.\n  Or it might be the case where you are worried about the threat of a \nfather to the children, but you cannot say a father can't see the \nchild; with a supervised visitation center the father can see the \nchildren there.\n\n  This is really important. We are working very hard right now with \nSenator Hollings to get some funding. I am pleased this is a part of \nthis legislation.\n  I say to colleagues, this was the work of Jill Morningstar on my \nstaff, who, with my wife Sheila, made a lot of progress. It is so \nimportant to reauthorize. The hotline is important; the training for \npolice is important; the support for law enforcement is important; the \nsupport for battered women shelters is so important for the people who \nare there in the trenches. All of this matters. The focus on rural \ncommunities and support in rural communities is important, as well. It \nhas made a difference, a big difference.\n  In my State of Minnesota, this year already 33 women have been \nmurdered. Each case is an example of ``domestic violence.'' Last year, \nin the whole year, it was only 28. The year is only half over and we \nhave already had 33 women who have been murdered. Clearly, we are going \nto have to do a lot more. To reauthorize this bill today is a huge \nvictory.\n  Mr. President, I think it should whet our appetite to do much, much \nmore. I am absolutely committed to making sure we do more to provide \nsome support for children who witness this violence in their homes. \nThese kids run into difficulty in school. These kids, quite often, run \ninto trouble. These children are falling between the cracks and there \nis no real support for them.\n  There is another piece of legislation--and I hope to get it in the \nbill--I am very excited about Day One in Minnesota where we want to \nmake sure all of the shelters are electronically wired so with one call \nto the hotline, a woman will know where she and her children can \ngo. Rather than calling, being told there is no space, and then not \nknowing where to go, it should only take one call. That is very \nimportant.\n\n  Then, there is a whole set of initiatives that would enable women to \nbe more independent, to get more support to be more independent--\nwhether it be affordable housing, whether it be family and medical \napplied to women in this situation, whether it be more job training--\nyou name it. This will enable women to be put in a position where they \nare not unable or unwilling to leave a very dangerous situation for \nthemselves and their children.\n  I say to colleagues, I am so pleased we are going to pass this \nconference report with an overwhelming vote. I am pleased to be a part \nof helping to work out this agreement. But I also think clearly, more \nthan anything else, this ought to make us more determined to do much \nmore. Again, about every 13 seconds a woman is battered in her home \ntoday in our country.\n  I will take a little more time to talk about the trafficking bill, \nsince both these bills are linked together, to again make the point for \nall my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, it is critically \nimportant to vote for this conference report, to keep this conference \nreport intact.\n  I will keep thanking Senator Brownback. It has been great to work \nwith him. I thank him for his fine work.\n  We are talking about 50,000 women, girls, trafficked to our country. \nWe are talking about 2 million worldwide. We are talking about women, \nsometimes girls as young as 10 or 11, coming from countries where there \nis economic disintegration. They are trying to figure out a way they \ncould go somewhere and they are told they could become waitresses. They \nare told there is a job.\n  When they arrive, their visas are taken away from them; they are \nbeaten; they don't know the language; they don't know their rights; and \nthey are forced into prostitution. We had a massage parlor 2 miles from \nhere in Bethesda which was staffed mainly by Russian-Ukraine women. \nThat is one example. This is one of the grimmest aspects of the new \nglobal economy. It is, in many ways, more profitable than drugs because \nthese women and girls are recyclable. It is that God-awful. In the year \n2000, this legislation is the first of its kind in this country. It is \na model for many other governments around the world.\n  We put a focus on three ``P's'': No. 1, prevention, getting the \noutreach work done to other nations so these young girls and women will \nknow what they are getting into and have some understanding what these \ntraffickers are about. No. 2, protection, so when a girl steps forward, \nthen she is not the one who pays the price. Right now there is no \ntemporary visa protection so if you were to try to get out of this you \nare the one who is deported. In the meantime, these traffickers go \nwithout any punishment, which is something I want to get to in a \nmoment. So you want to provide that protection. You also want to \nprovide services for these young women to be able to rebuild their \nlives after they have been through this torture. It is torture. And \nfinally, No. 3, prosecution. Right now our law enforcement community \ntells us they want to go after them but they do not have the laws. What \nwe are saying is, if you are involved in this trafficking, you are \ngoing to face stiff sentences. If you are involved in the trafficking \nof a girl under the age of 14, you can face a life sentence. So there \nis a very strong part of the provision dealing with punishment.\n\n  We also have a listing of countries where this is happening, with a \nspecial focus on governments that are complicit in it. The President \ncan take action against those governments, but there are also security \nwaivers and other waivers. It is a balanced piece of legislation. I am \nproud of it. I think it will make a difference.\n  I think it is terribly important. I read some of these examples \nbefore. Let me give a couple of examples right now of what is happening \nin the year 2000.\n  In Los Angeles, where traffickers kidnapped a Chinese woman, raped \nher, forced her into prostitution, posted guards to control her \nmovements, and burned her with cigarettes, the lead defendant received \n4 years and the other defendants received 2 to 3 years for this \noffense.\n  In another case where Asian women were kept physically confined for \nyears, with metal bars on the windows, guards and an electronic \nmonitoring system, and were forced to submit to sex with as many as 400 \ncustomers to repay their smuggling debt, the traffickers received \nbetween 4 and 9 years. This is the year 2000 we are talking about.\n  Then I gave the example of a 1996 trafficking case involving Russian \nand Ukrainian women who would answer ads to be au pairs, sales clerks, \nand waitresses but were forced to provide sexual services and live in a \nmassage parlor in Bethesda, MD. The Russian-American massage parlor \nowner was fined. He entered a plea bargain, the charges were dropped, \nwith the restriction he would not operate a business again in \nMontgomery County. The women, who had not been paid any salary and were \ncharged $150 for their housing, were deported or left the country.\n  This is what we are dealing with right now. There was a case \ninvolving\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\n70 deaf Mexicans that my colleagues may remember, who were held under \nlock and key, forced to peddle trinkets, who were beaten and in some \ncases tortured. The leader received 14 years and the other traffickers \nfrom 1 to 8 years.\n  We intend to take this more seriously. Let me give one other example. \nThe United States v. Hou, several Mexican nationals, all illegally in \nthe United States, were required to live in one of the chicken sheds at \nan egg ranch. The shed was open to the elements. The defendants, man \nand wife, did not give the men any shelter, but encouraged them to \nbuild a small room out of cardboard and styrofoam egg cartons.\n  The men lived less than 15 feet from the chickens they tended. The \nmen had to spread powerful pesticides in and around the chicken sheds, \nand the chemicals and various fuel oils were stored immediately next to \ntheir cardboard room. Faulty wiring in the rickety building resulted in \na fire. One of the workers was killed as he tried to escape the shed \nand another suffered horrible burns. Despite the atrocious conditions, \nthere was no evidence that the men had been kept in the defendants' \nservice through threats of force or violence; the men stayed in the \nshed because Ms. Hou preyed upon their lack of English-speaking ability \nand lack of immigration status, deliberately misleading the victims and \nconvincing them there was nowhere else to go.\n  Because the labor of the workers was maintained through a scheme of \nnonviolent and psychological coercion, the case did not fall under the \ninvoluntary servitude statutes--which could have resulted in life \nsentences given the death of one of the victims. Our legislation \nchanges that. That is why this legislation is so important. No longer \nin the United States of America are we going to turn our gaze away from \nthis kind of exploitation, to this kind of murder of innocent people.\n  This is a real commitment by the Senate and the Congress to defend \nhuman rights. This is a good piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a couple of other \nprovisions in this bill to clarify those for Members. We will be voting \non it later today. If others of my colleagues desire to speak on this \nbill, I urge them to come to the floor and speak now or forever hold \ntheir peace on this particular piece of legislation.\n  The item I wish to speak on now is Aimee's law. This is a part of \nthis overall conference report that has passed the House, as I \nmentioned, by 371-1. Aimee's law was prompted by the tragic death of a \ncollege senior, Aimee Willard, who was from Brookhaven, PA, near \nPhiladelphia. Arthur Bomar is a convicted murderer who was earlier \nparoled from a Nevada prison. Even after he had assaulted a woman in \nprison, Nevada released him early. Bomar traveled to Pennsylvania where \nhe found Aimee. He kidnapped, brutally raped, and murdered Aimee. He \nwas prosecuted a second time for murder for this terrible crime in \nDelaware County, PA.\n  Aimee's mother, Gail Willard, has become a tireless advocate for \nvictims' rights and serves as an inspiration on this particular piece \nof legislation.\n  This important legislation would use Federal crime-fighting funds to \ncreate an incentive for States to adopt stricter sentencing laws by \nholding States financially accountable for the tragic consequences of \nan early release which results in a violent crime being perpetrated on \nthe citizens of another State. Specifically, Aimee's law will redirect \nFederal crime-fighting dollars from a State which has released early a \nmurderer, rapist, child molester, to pay the prosecutorial and \nincarceration costs incurred by a State which has had to reconvict this \nreleased felon for a similar type of crime.\n  More than 14,000 murders, rapes, and sexual assaults on children are \ncommitted each year by felons who have been released after serving a \nsentence for one of these very same crimes.\n  Convicted murderers, rapists, and child molesters who are released \nfrom prisons and cross State lines are responsible for sexual assaults \non more than 1,200 people annually, including 935 children, including \nAimee Willard.\n  The reason I point this out is because Aimee's law previously passed \nthis body by a vote of 81-17. As I mentioned, it redirects Federal \ncrime funds from a State that has released early a murderer, rapist, or \nchild molester, to pay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs \nincurred by a State which has had to reconvict this felon for a similar \ncrime.\n  The formula for early release is if the criminal served less than 85 \npercent of his original sentence, and if a State kept a criminal in \nprison less time than the national average for a sentence of the same \ncrime.\n  To counter concerns raised by the National Governors' Association, \nthis does not federalize any crimes. I emphasize that, it does not \nfederalize any crimes. It simply upholds State standards regarding \nmurder, rape, and child molestation.\n  Sex offenders have one of the highest recidivism rates of any crime, \nthus, requiring more stringent standards in amount of the sentence \nserved.\n  This only affects Federal crime funds which are transferred from \nState 1 to State 2 where a crime has been committed of a similar type \nby the criminal who was released early from State 1.\n  The reason I go through this at some length is because some of my \ncolleagues have a concern about this. I understand there will be a \npoint of order raised against this as being part of the overall \npackage. There will be a vote on that point of order.\n  If people want to get this bill dealing with sex trafficking, the \nViolence Against Women Act, the international terrorism aspect of this \nbill, the Internet alcohol enforcement of this bill through, they need \nto vote against those who seek to strip this particular provision out \nof the bill because if they strip this provision out, the bill has to \ngo back to the House for it to be voted on, and it will have to be \nvoted on again in the Senate.\n  We do not have the time to do it. It will kill the bill. If people \nvote to strip this provision out of this particular bill and send it \nback to the House, and it has to come back here, it will kill the bill. \nWe do not have time to do that.\n  While some raise federalism arguments, most of our colleagues have \nalready voted in favor of Aimee's law; 81 have voted in favor of it \nalready. There are some arguable federalism principles involved. I \nthink most of those have been worked out with the National Governors' \nAssociation. There is a strong advocacy group that has worked to get \nthese standards where, if a person has been convicted in one State, \nthey should serve their time rather than being released to commit a \nsimilar crime in another State. That is the direction of this.\n  I plead with my colleagues: Do not remove this provision. Do not \nsupport the point of order because, if you do, it is going to kill \neverything. It will kill the sex trafficking bill. It will kill the \nViolence Against Women Act. Do not do it. Most people have already \nsupported this particular provision, Aimee's law.\n  I wish to say a couple of things on other issues before we break for \nthe policy luncheons. I particularly appreciate my colleagues, Senator \nLautenberg and Senator Mack, for their provisions on the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act. I understand Senator Hatch will speak later \nabout the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act on VAWA. We have had an \nexcellent discussion this morning on the importance of this legislation \nprotecting women who are subject to domestic violence. This is \nreauthorization of important language and important legislation and \nstrengthening of it as well. That is an important feature.\n\n  I appreciate Senate majority leader Trent Lott bringing this issue to \nthe floor. It is a good package of protection for both domestic and \ninternational women and children subject to violence. That is the theme \nthat runs through this set of acts. It is protection for women, \nprotection for children, protection domestically, and protection \ninternationally.\n  I am very pleased with this legislation. It is a key piece of \nlegislation to pass during this session of Congress to provide that \nlevel of protection. I am glad it has been done on a bipartisan basis. \nMostly my colleagues from the other side of the aisle have spoken this \nmorning supporting this legislation. Support is similarly strong on our \nside\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nof the aisle. It is good to have that support back and forth.\n  Rather than using up the rest of my time, I simply say to my \ncolleagues who want to speak, please come to the floor. I anticipate we \nwill be voting on this legislation by the middle of the afternoon. We \nwill be recessing for policy luncheons from 12:30 p.m. until I believe \n2:15 p.m., which is the normal recess time.\n  This will be a good time for people to comment on this important \nlegislation. I plead with them: Do not strike this particular \nprovision, Aimee's law, because it will sink the entire bill. It is a \ngood bill. It is good legislation. It previously passed both Houses \noverwhelmingly. Let's get it done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico time off my time. I yield to him for another purpose, and once \nhe speaks, I am sure the Chair will understand the reason. I yield to \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy in \nyielding me some time. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reiterate something the Senator from \nKansas and the Republican floor leader on this bill have said, and that \nis that we hope, because of the request of a number of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, to get these votes on both the Thompson point of \norder and final passage sometime midafternoon today. As one who holds \nthe largest bulk of the individual time, I alert my colleagues that \nafter the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, I will yield back the remaining part of that time which \nwill move up somewhat the time of the vote.\n  The reason, incidentally, I have reserved the bulk of my time is to \nprotect a number of Senators who wished to speak. I think virtually all \nof them have spoken. At least one of the Senators who would have wished \nto speak, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, has just \nundergone surgery for an accident to her leg and is not going to be \nhere, although, of course, any statement by her will be printed in the \nRecord. But the others have spoken.\n  Mr. President, I am glad that the Senate is finally taking up this \nconference report. Unlike the conference on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile \njustice bill that passed the Senate in May 1999 with a bipartisan \nmajority of 73 votes, and so many other matters that are still left \nundone by this Congress, we have an opportunity through this conference \nreport to come to conclusion on three items that I have supported and \ntried to pass for many months. Unfortunately, there are two additional, \nextraneous items that were added over my opposition and that should not \nhave been added to this conference report at all. I will speak on each \nof these matters.\n  At the outset, I want to acknowledge the important work of \nRepresentative Conyers in the House, who has been a stalwart and \nconsistent supporter of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. Without \nhis cooperation and support and the hard work of his staff, we would \nnot be standing here today. I also want to pay tribute to the efforts \nof Senators Boxer, Mikulski, Lincoln, Landrieu, Murray and Feinstein. \nTheir efforts throughout this Congress, including in the last several \ndays, have made the difference in our ability to move forward to begin \nthis debate today.\n  With Senators Kennedy, Biden, Specter, Smith and so many others, I \nhave been urging the Republican leadership to take up and pass the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2000 for some time. I had to urge action \nby the Judiciary Committee for several weeks before we were finally \nable to have it added to the agenda on June 15, 2000. It was reported \nunanimously the same month. Over the last several months since this \nlegislation was reported, I have worked and prodded and pushed along \nwith our Democratic Leader Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Robb, Senator Bingaman and others on both sides of the \naisle to try to get this matter taken up and passed without further \ndelay.\n  The President of the United States wrote the Majority Leader back on \nSeptember 27, 2000 urging passage. The First Lady and the Vice \nPresident had previously called for passage back in June at the time of \nthe Judiciary Committee markup. The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 \nis a matter upon which we need to act.\n  I addressed this matter twice on the Senate floor in late September \nwhen an effort was being made by some on the Republican side of the \naisle to try to use VAWA as a vehicle to force consideration of a \nflawed bankruptcy bill or to override Oregon state law. I said that \nplaying political games with this important legislation was the wrong \nthing to do and that VAWA should not be used as leverage to enact less \nworthy provisions. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the \nSenate has been adamant in its refusal to take up and consider VAWA as \na stand alone matter, even after the House passed its bill by a 415 to \n3 vote. While we have been successful in preventing VAWA from being \nused as a vehicle for some measures, thanks in part to the President \npro tempore Senator Thurmond and Senator Brownback honoring commitments \nthey made to me in order to go to conference, we have not been wholly \nsuccessful and two additional and unfortunate riders are included over \nmy objection in this conference report.\n  Due to their dilatory tactics, VAWA was allowed by the Republican \nleadership to lapse on Saturday, September 30, despite the fact that it \nhas served the women of this country well and the measure had passed \nthe House by a vote of 415 to 3. Such inaction by the current Senate \nmajority is not limited to reauthorization of VAWA. Congressional \nleaders have continued to drag their feet on enacting comprehensive \njuvenile crime prevention and enforcement legislation and reasonable \ngun safety measures, which have been stalled in conference for over a \nyear. Judicial vacancies around the country and most acutely in our \nfederal courts of appeals remain vacant month after month, year after \nyear, while qualified women and men cannot get a hearing or a vote. \nLegislation to extend the Campbell-Leahy program to help provide \nbulletproof vests for local law enforcement officers was the victim of \na secret hold in the Republican Senate cloakroom. Important \nintellectual property legislation is stalled without explanation by a \nsimilar anonymous hold on the other side of the aisle. And hate crime \nlegislation, the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000, has \nbeen dropped in conference in spite of the votes in both the Senate and \nHouse approving it.\n\n  I am pleased that we will finally be able to reestablish the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, a law that makes such a profound difference in the \nlives of women and families who fall victim to domestic violence. I \nwould not normally support efforts to add extraneous items in a \nconference report. In this case, in light of the unwillingness of the \nSenate Republican leadership to allow the Senate to act on the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2000 and the lapse of its authorization, I joined \nwith Senator Biden and Senator Hatch to add it to the sex trafficking \nconference report we now consider.\n  I agreed with Senator Biden's assessment that in light of its \nimportance and the resistance we have seen from the Senate Republican \nleadership to proceed to the VAWA bill for a straight up or down vote, \nthis was the only way we would ever be able to get it considered by the \nSenate this year. I commend Senator Biden for making clear at the \nsecond and last meeting of the conferees on September 28th that he \nintended to insist on the conference reauthorizing the Violence Against \nWomen Act. Indeed, I had raised it at our initial meeting of conferees \nas the one thing we should consider adding to this bill, if anything \nextraneous was to be considered.\n  Unfortunately, when we voted on adding VAWA to the conference report,\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nonly three Senate conferees voted to support it--Senators Biden, Hatch \nand me--and the other four Senate conferees all voted against. I am \nglad that over the ensuing days, the other four Senate conferees and \nthe House conferees, whose votes initially seemed to doom this effort, \nhave reversed position and joined with us to add VAWA into this \nconference report. I am glad that others agree with us that while we \nneed to address the tragic plight of women who are brought to the \nUnited States, we need to pass reauthorization of VAWA to help battered \nwomen in this country, as well.\n  Although a conferee, I did not sign the conference report that we \nconsider today. It may come as a surprise to some who have served in \nthis body and remember how conferences are supposed to proceed, that I \nwas not given an opportunity to consider the final report or to sign \nbefore it was filed. Indeed, after a second short meeting of conferees, \nthe final meeting, which had been promised so that we could finalize \nour action, never occurred. Side deals were struck and broken and \nrevised and implemented without resuming the conference. Legislating \naround here has come to resemble the television program ``Survivor'' \nmore than the process intended by the Constitution or our Senate rules. \nWe have all become increasingly accustomed to shortcuts in the \nlegislative process, but we are now getting to the point that once \nsufficient numbers of signatures are obtained on a conference report, \nonce an alliance has formed, conferees from the minority may not even \nbe accorded an opportunity to view the final package let alone asked \nfor their views. In this matter, after I had worked to ensure that VAWA \nwas included in the conference report, I was treated like a member of \nthe ill-fated Pagong tribe.\n\n  Had I been consulted we might have avoided the extended debate and \npoint of order that Senator Thompson is bringing today. I was able to \nintervene just before the filing of the conference report when I \nobtained a draft that showed the elimination of the small state minimum \nfunding level in certain grant programs. These eliminations would have \nbeen such a disaster for Vermont, New Hampshire, Delaware, Utah, Alaska \nand so many small and rural states that I had raise a strong objection \nand the small state minimum of $600,000 for shelters was restored by a \nlast-minute handwritten change to the final conference report.\n  Unfortunately, while this conference report contains provisions that \nenjoy broad bipartisan support and will make a positive contribution to \nthe well-being of many people, the Republican majority could not resist \nloading this conference report with other legislative proposals that \nare so problematic they could not have passed as stand-alone measures \nin this or any other Congress.\n  Let me begin by reviewing the positive parts of this conference \nreport. These are the reasons that, last Friday, our colleagues in the \nHouse passed the Conference Report on Victims of Trafficking and \nViolence Protection Act 371 to 1.\n  The trafficking of people for the illicit sex trade or slave labor is \nplainly abhorrent. This conference report partially addresses that \nproblem by providing additional authority to law enforcement and \noffering visas to victims of severe trafficking, among other measures. \nThose who have experienced the horror of trafficking and are willing to \nassist law enforcement in prosecuting trafficking should receive the \noption of staying in the United States. The law enforcement and \nimmigration measures in this report are the result of compromises \nreached between both Houses and both sides. In some cases, especially \nin the immigration area, these provisions are not as generous as I and \nmany other members of this conference would prefer.\n  This bill will also insist that information about severe forms of \ntrafficking in persons be provided in the annual State Department \nCountry Report for each foreign country, an important step forward in \nour attempts to raise consciousness about this issue. It also provides \nfor the establishment of an Inter-Agency Task Force to monitor and \ncombat trafficking, with annual and interim reports on countries whose \ngovernments do not comply with the minimum standards. The bill calls \nupon the President to establish initiatives to enhance economic \nopportunity for potential trafficking victims, such as microcredit \nlending programs, training, and education.\n\n  As someone who has been a strong supporter of human rights, both in \nthe United States and abroad, I am pleased to be associated with this \nattempt to reduce trafficking and protect its victims. I hope that the \nSenate can also turn its attention to human rights issues that affect \nimmigrants who arrive in the United States willingly. In particular, I \nrequest that the Senate consider S. 1940, the Refugee Protection Act, a \nbill I have introduced with Senator Brownback that would restrict the \nuse of expedited removal to times of immigration emergencies. Under \nexpedited removal, those who flee persecution in their home countries \nface automatic removal from our country if they are traveling without \ndocuments, or even with documents that are facially valid but that an \nINS officer suspects are invalid. The limited protections that were \nbuilt into this process when it was adopted in 1996 have proven \ninsufficient, and we are receiving continuing reports of people in real \ndanger being forced to leave the United States without even a hearing. \nThis is simply inappropriate, and does an injustice to our nation's \nreputation as a haven for the oppressed.\n  As I already noted, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women \nAct, or VAWA II, was also added to this report with strong bipartisan \nsupport. This is a particularly appropriate bill to add to this \nconference report. As the conference report states, ``[t]raffickers \nprimarily target women and girls, who are disproportionately affected \nby poverty, the lack of access to education, chronic unemployment, \ndiscrimination, and the lack of economic opportunity in countries of \norigin.'' VAWA II contains a number of important programs to protect \nwomen and children in this country, and would complement the goals of \nthis legislation.\n  I witnessed the devastating effects of domestic violence early in my \ncareer as the Vermont State's Attorney for Chittenden County. In those \ndays, long before the passage of the VAWA, Vermont lacked the support \nprograms and services to assist victims of domestic violence. Today, \nbecause of the effort and dedication of people in Vermont and across \nthe country who work on these problems every day, an increasing number \nof women and children are receiving help through domestic violence \nprograms and shelters around the nation.\n  Six years ago, VAWA passed Congress as part of the Violent Crime \nControl and Law Enforcement Act. That Act combined tough law \nenforcement strategies with safeguards and services for victims of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. I am proud to say that Vermont \nwas the first State in the country to apply for and receive funding \nunder VAWA. Since VAWA was enacted, Vermont has received almost $14 \nmillion in VAWA funds. Since the passage of VAWA in 1994, I have been \nprivileged to work with groups such as the Vermont Network Against \nDomestic Violence and Sexual Assault and the Vermont Center for Crime \nVictim Services and countless advocates who work to stop to violence \nagainst women and who provide assistance to victims.\n  This funding has enabled Vermont to develop specialized prosecution \nunits and child advocacy centers throughout the state. Lori Hayes, \nExecutive Director of the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services and \nMarty Levin of the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual \nAbuse have been especially instrumental in coordinating VAWA grants in \nVermont. Their hard work has brought grant funding to Vermont for \nencouraging the development and establishment of arrest policies for \ncombating rural domestic violence and child abuse. These grants have \nmade a real difference in the lives of those who suffer from violence \nand abuse. Reauthorization of these vital programs in VAWA II will \ncontinue to build on these successes.\n  VAWA II continues to move us toward reducing violence against women \nby strengthening law enforcement through the extension of STOP grants, \nwhich encourage a multi-disciplinary approach to improving the criminal \njustice system's response to violence against women. With support from \nSTOP grants, law enforcement, prosecutors, courts, victim advocates and\n\n[[Page S10184]]\n\nservice providers work together to ensure victim safety and offender \naccountability.\n  The benefits of STOP grants are evident throughout Vermont. With STOP \ngrants the Windham County Domestic Violence Unit, the Rutland County \nWomen's Network and Shelter and others like them have enhanced victim \nadvocacy services, improved safety for women and children, and ensured \nthat perpetrators are held accountable. The Northwest Unit for Special \nInvestigations in St. Albans, Vermont, established a multi-disciplinary \napproach to the investigation of adult sexual assault and domestic \nviolence cases with the help of STOP funds. By linking victims with \nadvocacy programs at the time of the initial report, the Unit finds \nthat more victims get needed services and support and thus find it \neasier to participate in the investigation and subsequent prosecution. \nThe State's Attorney's Office, which has designated a prosecutor to \nparticipate in the Unit, has implemented a new protocol for the \nprosecution of domestic violence cases. The protocol and multi-\ndisciplinary approach are credited with an 80 percent conviction rate \nin domestic violence and sexual assault cases.\n  Passing VAWA II will continue grants that strengthen pro-arrest \npolicies and enforcement of protection orders. In a rural state like \nVermont, law enforcement agencies greatly benefit from cooperative, \ninter-agency efforts to combat and solve significant problems. Last \nyear, approximately $850,000 of this funding supported Vermont efforts \nto encourage arrest policies.\n  Vermont will also benefit from the extension of Rural Domestic \nViolence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants under VAWA II. \nThese grants are designed to make victim services more accessible to \nwomen and children living in rural areas. I worked hard to see these \nprovisions included in the original VAWA in 1994, and I am proud that \nits success has merited an increased authorization for funding in VAWA \nII. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants \nhave been utilized by the Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and \nSexual Assault, the Vermont Attorney General's Office, and the Vermont \nDepartment of Social and Rehabilitation Services to increase community \nawareness, develop cooperative relationships between state child \nprotection agencies and domestic violence programs, expand existing \nmulti disciplinary task forces to include allied professional groups, \nand create local multi-use supervised visitation centers.\n\n  VAWA II also reauthorizes the National Stalker and Domestic Violence \nReduction Grant. This important grant program assists in the \nimprovement of local, state and national crime databases for tracking \nstalking and domestic violence. As we work to prevent violence against \nwomen, we must not forget those who have already fallen victim to it. \nVAWA II recognizes that combating violence against women extends beyond \nproviding assistance to victims, it includes preventing women from \nbecoming victims at all.\n  The National Domestic Violence Hotline, which has assisted over \n180,000 callers, will continue its crucial operation through the \nreauthorization of VAWA. Much like the state hotline that the Vermont \nNetwork Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault helped establish \nin Vermont, the National Hotline reaches victims who may feel they have \nnowhere to turn.\n  I am especially pleased to see that VAWA II will authorize a new \ngrant program for civil legal assistance. In the past, funding for \nlegal services for victims of domestic violence was dependent on a set-\naside in the STOP grant appropriation. This separate grant \nauthorization will allow victims of violence, stalking and sexual \nassault, who would otherwise be unable to afford professional legal \nrepresentation, to obtain access to trained attorneys and advocacy \nservices. In my State, Vermont Legal Aid, the Vermont Network to End \nDomestic Violence and the South Royalton Legal Clinic of Vermont Law \nSchool are currently involved in a collaborative project to expand \ncivil legal assistance services to domestic violence victims across the \nstate. These three organizations are partnering to create Intensive \nService Teams that will provide coordinated civil legal assistance and \nvictim advocacy in Rutland County and the Northeast Kingdom. Grants \nsuch as this one that support training, technical assistance and \nsupport for cooperative efforts between victim advocacy groups and \nlegal assistance providers will continue to prosper under VAWA II.\n  I remain concerned, however, over a highly objectionable provision \nthat prohibits any expenditure of the civil legal assistant grant funds \nto support litigation with respect to abortion. Currently, the Legal \nServices Corporation (LSC) operates under two abortion-related \nrestriction provisions: The 1974 LSC statute bans the use of federally \nappropriated Corporation funds for legal assistance for any abortion-\nrelated proceeding or litigation. Additionally, an appropriations rider \nto the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill restricts LSC funds \nfrom use by any person or entity that participates in abortion-related \nlitigation.\n  The language in VAWA II bill reaches further, in the sense that it \nwould ban more organizations than just LSC from spending funds on \nabortion-related litigation. Under the Senate language, grants can be \nmade to private, nonprofit entities, Indian tribal governments, and \npublicly funded organizations such as law schools. These grantees are \ncertainly worthy and appropriate to provide these services generally; \nthe objection is solely that they should not be gagged from providing \nabortion related legal assistance. I am concerned about the precedent \nthis provision would set in expanding the restriction on abortion-\nrelated litigation to other programs and organizations. I think this \nkind of language should give us pause as we consider the effect it \nwould have on victims who, in the face of domestic violence, sexual \nassault in family relationships, incest or rape, must run a gauntlet of \ncongressionally imposed barriers in order simply to obtain full and \ncomplete information about their comprehensive health-care options.\n\n  The original VAWA authorized funding for programs that provide \nshelter to battered women and children. I am pleased to see that VAWA \nII expands this funding so that facilities such as the Women Helping \nBattered Women Shelter in Burlington, Vermont, and the Rutland County \nWomen's Shelter in Rutland, Vermont will continue to serve victims in \ntheir most vulnerable time of need. As I have noted, at one point I \nobtained a draft conference report that had dropped the $600,000 small \nstate minimum funding these grants. I am relieved that my objection was \nheard and the minimum restored.\n  As glad as I am that we are finally reauthorizing VAWA, this is not \nthe version of VAWA that I cosponsored and supported in the Judiciary \nCommittee and urged the Senate to enact. In fact, this is not the VAWA \nII bill that was negotiated among staff at a bipartisan, bicameral \nmeeting earlier in this process. The version of VAWA II in this \nconference report was negotiated behind closed doors in the last \nminutes before the conference report was filed. Unfortunately, this \napproach saw additional provisions added and struck that have \ndiminished the final product. One provision of particular concern to me \nis that on transitional housing.\n  The previous Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act of \n2000, S. 2787, had over 70 co-sponsors. I am one of them. That version \nincluded better provisions on transitional housing assistance. It would \nhave been a significant improvement over the original VAWA. This new \ngrant program for short-term housing assistance and support services \nfor homeless families who have fled from domestic violence environments \nwas a priority for me and Vermont, where availability of affordable \nhousing is at an all-time low. Unfortunately, this authorization was \nreduced to one year without my consent. Those involved in the \ndiscussions attribute the change to ``jurisdictional concerns'' of the \nHealth, Labor and Pensions Committee. I look forward to working with \nSenators Jeffords, Gregg and Kennedy next year during reauthorization \nof the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to extend the \nauthorization of this important program. We should all be concerned \nwith providing victims of domestic violence with a safe place to \nrecover from their traumatic experiences. In addition, I would like to \nsee more support\n\n[[Page S10185]]\n\nfor groups that address the need for funding for under-served \npopulations.\n  There are positive things to come out of the revised version of VAWA \nII. I am pleased that we were able to cover ``dating violence'' in most \nof the provisions and grant programs. The Bureau of Justice Statistics \nreport indicates that more than four in every 10 incidents of domestic \nviolence involves non-married persons, and further, that the highest \nrate of domestic violence occurs among young people aged 16-24. It is \ncrucial that we authorize prosecution of their offenders. We cannot \nignore this increasingly at risk segment of the population. The House-\npassed version of VAWA II had contained such provisions and I support \nthem as they have been incorporated into the conference report.\n\n  In 1994, we designed VAWA to prevent abusive husbands from using \ncontrol over their wives' immigration status to control them. Over the \nensuing six years we have discovered additional areas that need to be \naddressed to protect immigrant women from abuse, and have attempted to \ndo so in this legislation. VAWA II will ensure that the immigration \nstatus of battered women will not be affected by changes in the status \nof their abusers. It will also make it easier for abused women and \ntheir children to become lawful permanent residents and obtain \ncancellation of removal. With this legislation, battered immigrant \nwomen should not have to choose to stay with their abusers in order to \nstay in the United States.\n  I am pleased that we have taken these additional steps to protect \nimmigrant women facing domestic abuse in the United States. I would \nalso like to point out the difficult situation of immigrant women who \nface domestic violence if they are returned to their home country.\n  Numerous cases have arisen recently in which women who fear being \nkilled by abusive spouses in their native lands were denied claims for \nasylum, despite the fact that the police in those countries do not \nenforce what limited laws apply to domestic violence. There are \nadditional cases in which women who fear for their lives due to \ningrained social practices--such as ``honor killings'' in Jordan, in \nwhich families have female relatives killed for ``dishonoring'' them--\nhave lost asylum claims. The Attorney General is currently reviewing \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals decision Matter of R-A-, which is the \nprecedent on which these later decisions have been based. I have \nwritten, along with Senator Landrieu and many other of my colleagues, \nurging the Attorney General to reverse this decision and protect women \nwho face persecution. I renew that request today, and hope that the \npassage of this legislation will prompt action on this issue as well.\n  The conference report includes a provision that would require \ndissemination of sex registry information to colleges and universities. \nCurrently, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) \napplies strict restrictions on the dissemination of information in \n``education records,'' but these restrictions are specifically defined \nto exclude ``records maintained by a law enforcement unit'' of the \nschool and were created for a law enforcement purpose. Thus, to the \nextent that campus police get information about registered sex \noffenders under State law, they are able to use it as they wish. \nApparently not satisfied to leave this issue to the States, the \nconference report would mandate that States provide sex registry \ninformation concerning students to colleges and universities where the \nstudents are registered.\n  I see no need to impose a federal disclosure requirement when the \nStates are now free to regulate as they see fit the dissemination of \nsex registry information to schools and campus police, who may use it \nto protect the safety of those on campus. No one is opposed to taking \nadequate safety measures regarding sex offenders on campus. My concern \nhas to do with unnecessary federal mandates when the States are \nperfectly capable of addressing the issue.\n\n  VAWA II includes a provision to enhance protections for older women \nfrom domestic violence and sexual assault. Last year I introduced the \nSeniors Safety Act, S. 751, which would enhance penalties for crimes \nagainst seniors. This provision in VAWA II is an important complement \nto that legislation and I am pleased this provision has been able to \ngenerate wide support.\n  VAWA II would also help young victims of crime through funding for \nthe establishment of safe and supervised visitation centers for \nchildren in order to reduce the opportunity for domestic violence. \nGrants will also be extended to continue funding agencies serving \nhomeless youth who have been or who are at risk of abuse and to \ncontinue funding for victims of child abuse, including money for \nadvocates, training for judicial personnel and televised testimony.\n  Many of the most successful services for victims start at the local \nlevel, such as Vermont's model hotline on domestic violence and sexual \nassault. VAWA II recognizes these local successes and continues grant \nfunding of community demonstration projects for the intervention and \nprevention of domestic violence.\n  The original VAWA was an important and comprehensive Federal effort \nto combat violence against women and to assist the victims of such \nviolence. Passage of VAWA II gives us the opportunity to continue \nfunding these successful programs, to improve victim services, and to \nstrengthen these laws so that violence against women is eliminated. I \nam pleased that we were able to find a way to get this considered and \npassed. I deeply regret that we have not been able to do so in stand-\nalone legislation or before VAWA expired last month.\n  The conference report also includes the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act. I commend Senators Lautenberg and Mack for working with \nthe Administration on this consensus legislation which addresses \nserious policy concerns raised by prior versions of the bill. This \nmeasure has been cleared for action and passage by unanimous consent \nfor some time by all Democratic Senators. In my view, it should have \nbeen passed in its own right a long time ago.\n  The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act addresses an issue that \nshould deeply concern all of us: the enforcement of court-ordered \njudgments that compensate the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. \nThis legislation has the strong support of American families who have \nlost loved ones due to the callous indifference to life of \ninternational terrorist organizations and their client states, and it \ndeserves our support as well.\n  One such family is the family of Alisa Flatow, an American student \nkilled in Gaza in a 1995 bus bombing. The Flatow family obtained a $247 \nmillion judgment in Federal court against the Iranian-sponsored Islamic \nJihad, which proudly claimed responsibility for the bombing that took \nher life. But the family has been unable to enforce this judgment \nbecause Iranian assets in the United States remain frozen.\n  The conference report that the Senate passes today will provide an \navenue for the Flatow family and others in their position to recover \nsome of the damages due them under American law. It will permit these \nplaintiffs to attach certain foreign assets to satisfy the compensatory \ndamages portion of their judgments against foreign states for personal \ninjury or death caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, \naircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support \nor resources for such an act. It will also permit these plaintiffs to \nrecover post-judgment interest and, in the case of claims against Cuba, \ncertain amounts that have been awarded as sanctions by judicial order.\n\n  I am also pleased that this measure also includes a Leahy-Feinstein \namendment dealing with support for victims of international terrorism. \nThis amendment will enable the Office for Victims of Crime to provide \nmore immediate and effective assistance to Americans who are victims of \nterrorism abroad--Americans like those killed or injured in the embassy \nbombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and in the Pan Am 103 bombing over \nLockerbie, Scotland. These victims deserve help, but according to OVC, \nexisting programs are failing to meet their needs. Working with OVC, we \nhave crafted legislation to correct this problem.\n  The Leahy-Feinstein part of this measure will permit the Office for \nVictims of Crime to serve these victims better by expanding the types \nof assistance for which the VOCA emergency\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\nreserve fund may be used, and the range of organizations to which \nassistance may be provided. These changes will not require new or \nappropriated funds: They simply allow OVC greater flexibility in using \nexisting reserve funds to assist victims of terrorism abroad, including \nthe victims of the Lockerbie and embassy bombings.\n  This provision will also authorize OVC to raise the cap on the VOCA \nemergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million, so that the \nfund is large enough to cover the extraordinary costs that would be \nincurred if a terrorist act caused massive casualties, and to replenish \nthe reserve fund with unobligated funds from its other grant programs.\n  At the same time, the provision will simplify the presently-\nauthorized system of using VOCA funds to provide victim compensation to \nAmerican victims of terrorism abroad, by permitting OVC to establish \nand operate an international crime victim compensation program. This \nprogram will, in addition, cover foreign nationals who are employees of \nany American government institution targeted for terrorist attack. The \nsource of funding is the VOCA emergency reserve fund, which we \nauthorized in an amendment I offered to the 1996 Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act.\n  Finally, the provision clarifies that deposits into the Crime Victims \nFund remain available for intended uses under VOCA when not expended \nimmediately. This should quell concerns raised regarding the effect of \nspending caps included in appropriations bills last year and this. I \nunderstand the appropriations' actions to have deferred spending but \nnot to have removed deposits from the Fund. This provision makes that \nexplicit.\n  I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her support and assistance on \nthis initiative. Senator Feinstein cares deeply about the rights of \nvictims, and I am pleased that we could work together on some \npractical, pragmatic improvements to our federal crime victims' laws. \nWe would have liked to do more. In particular, we would have liked to \nallow OVC to deliver timely and critically needed emergency assistance \nto all victims of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the \nUnited States and targeted at the United States or United States \nnationals.\n\n  Unfortunately, to achieve bipartisan consensus on this provision, we \nwere compelled to restrict OVC's authority, so that it may provide \nemergency assistance only to United States nationals and employees. It \nseems more than a little bizarre to me that the richest country in the \nworld would reserve emergency aid for victims of terrorism who can \nproduce a passport or W-2. I will continue to work with OVC and \nvictims' organization to remedy this anomaly.\n  I regret that we have not done more for victims this year, or during \nthe last few years. I have on several occasions noted my concern that \nwe not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing \nexclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must \nnote that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and \nmany opportunities for progress have been squandered. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with the Administration, victims groups, \nprosecutors, judges and other interested parties on how we can most \neffectively assist victims and provide them the greater voice and \nrights that they deserve.\n  This is the third good part of the package that comes before the \nSenate today. The sex trafficking bill, VAWA II and the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism legislation could each have passed in its own \nright. The are being bundled together because the Republican leadership \nrefused to proceed to consideration of VAWA II or the victims \nlegislation and this session is drawing to a close. We are already \npassed the sine die adjournment date that had been set by the Majority \nLeader. We are already into the second or third or fourth continuing \nresolution needed to keep the government operating while Congress \ncompletes appropriations bills that should have been enacted in July \nand September.\n  While the conference report contains many provisions which I support, \nit also has been used as a vehicle for some pet Republican legislative \nprojects that I do not endorse. I refer specifically to ``Aimee's law'' \nand the ``Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act.''\n  The conference report contains a legislative proposal called \n``Aimee's law,'' which, though well intended, will not serve this \ncountry well. We all shudder when a violent offender is incarcerated \nfor an insufficient length of time only to be released and claim \nanother victim. Let us be clear: everyone agrees that serious violent \noffenders should serve appropriate and sufficient incarceration. Yet, \nAimee's law is not the way to pursue this goal. Neither Aimee's law or \nCongress can accurately assess with one hundred percent accuracy which \noffender will be a recidivist and which offender will not. This \nproposal has myriad practical implementation problems that will make \nthis law a headache to administer for the States and the Department of \nJustice, without living up to its promise of stopping future tragedies.\n  Ironically, Aimee's law will adversely affect the States' ability to \nfight crime. By taking law enforcement funds away from the states, the \nlegislation will in effect reduce the states' capacity to fight crime. \nThe Pennsylvania Secretary of Corrections has advised that \n``Pennsylvania, along with many other states, plans for the use of \nfederal law enforcement money years in advance. Excessive penalties \nhave a high potential to interfere with states' abilities to keep \nviolent offenders--including those who have committed Aimee's law \ncrimes--incarcerated for longer periods of time.''\n\n  Specifically, this proposal would allow a state to apply to the \nAttorney General for reimbursement of the costs for investigation, \nprosecution and incarceration of prisoners who were previously \nconvicted in another state for murder, rape or a dangerous sexual \noffense. The source of the reimbursement funds will be from Federal law \nenforcement assistance funds that would otherwise be paid out to the \nstate that convicted the individual of the prior offense and released \nthat offender.\n  Last year, this proposal was adopted as an amendment to S. 254, the \nJuvenile Justice bill. Even then I expressed grave reservations with \nthe language and complications contained in the legislation. \nSpecifically, I noted that the proposal was ``extremely complicated and \ncan create a great deal of problems with some States'' and offered ``to \nwork more on the language to see if there are areas of unnecessary \ncomplication that could be removed.'' (Record, May 19, 2000, p. S5526). \nUnfortunately, the juvenile justice conference, in which the language \nof this proposal could have been refined, has failed to meet for over a \nyear. Apparently, the Republican leadership intends to end the Congress \nwithout ever completing work on the juvenile crime bill.\n  By any stretch of the imagination, the costs of Aimee's law outweigh \nits promised benefits:\n  First, Aimee's law penalizes states' law enforcement not for their \nown actions, but for the actions taken by judicial and corrections \nofficers resulting in the release of a defendant who has not served the \nincarceration period required under Aimee's law. Indeed, defendants who \nescape from jail without serving their full term and commit subsequent \ncrimes could subject the state in which they committed their initial \ncrimes to decreased federal funds otherwise used to help law \nenforcement.\n  Second, Aimee's law requires the annual collection, maintenance and \nreporting of criminal history for violent offenders and covers not just \nthose offenders currently in the system but any such offender no matter \nhow long ago that offender was convicted, served time and was released. \nThis provision alone demands an enormous investment of time and money, \nneither of which the legislation provides, to build the criminal \nhistory database necessary to implement the new law. As the Department \nof Justice has pointed out, ``[s]ince no time limit is imposed between \nthe prior and subsequent convictions, the system would require \nelectronic criminal records that do not now exist and would be very \nexpensive to accumulate.'' This ``would require the establishment of a \nmajor national data center to collect and match state records'' and \nconstitutes an ``unfunded mandate.''\n  During a colloquy in the House on October 6th, Congressman Conyers\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\nasked a House sponsor of Aimee's law whether it was the drafters' \nintent that Aimee's law shall apply prospectively, that is only to \noffenders whose first sentence for a covered offense occurs on or after \nthe effective date of this law, January 1, 2002, and the sponsor \nresponded affirmatively. Yet, the law remains murky on this point since \nthe effective date may be construed to apply only to the time when \nstates may make applications for reimbursement, not to when the \noffenses occurred. We have two years before the effective date to \nclarify this point, and others, in this problematic law.\n\n  Third, while Aimee's law would exempt certain States from application \nof the law, those exemptions are predicated, in part, upon ``the \naverage term of imprisonment imposed for that offense in all States.'' \nThe Pennsylvania Director of Corrections has pointed out that ``[t]here \nis no record of what the national `average. . .' is for crimes covered \nin this language. Further, if such an average existed, it would \ncontinually fluctuate, guaranteeing that there would always be some \nstates out of compliance.''\n  Fourth, Aimee's law adopts offense definitions that are unclear and \nfail to conform to the offense definitions found in the federal \ncriminal code or to the standard legal terms used in state codes making \nit difficult to enforce Aimee's law across state lines.\n  The National Governors' Association has repeatedly registered its \ndisapproval of Aimee's law as ``onerous, impractical and unworkable.'' \nConsequently, States may simply agree among themselves not to file the \napplications with the Attorney General required to obtain \nreimbursement. Indeed, such an application might trigger a retaliatory \nreview of the applicant's own record of released defendants and result \nin reduction of important federal funds. As a consequence, states may \nview invocation of Aimee's law reimbursement provisions as a risky \nproposition.\n  In short, Aimee's law is an empty promise that may make good fodder \nfor 60-second campaign spots but will do nothing to continue the \nprogress we have made over the last eight years to reduce the violent \ncrime rate or to truly help crime victims.\n  Senator Hatch has insisted that the ``Twenty-First Amendment \nEnforcement Act'' be included in the conference report, despite the \nfact that the conference met September 28th, and expressly rejected \ninclusion of this proposal in the conference report. It was rejected by \nthe Senate conferees and the House conferees went so far as to adopt \nthe position that no extraneous legislation would be added to the sex \ntrafficking provisions. Nevertheless, the conference report contains \nSenator Hatch's bill, which amounts to a double whammy--it is \nunnecessary and dangerous to e-commerce. The purported goal of this \nlegislation is to enforce state liquor laws. The approach of this \nlegislation sets a dangerous precedent by erecting barriers to \ninterstate and electronic commerce.\n  Specifically, the bill would permit the enforcement of state liquor \nlaws in Federal court. This expansion of the jurisdiction of the \nFederal courts is not warranted. State attorneys general are already \nenforcing their state liquor laws in state courts--whether the alcohol \nwas brought over the Internet or over the counter at the corner store. \nThe Internet has not changed the enforcement of state liquor laws.\n  This year, for instance, the Utah Attorney General successfully \nenforced that state's liquor laws against an out-of-state direct sales \nshipper of alcoholic beverages. That case resulted in fines of more \nthan $25,000 and guilty pleads by an out-of-state direct shipper to \nstate law counts of unlawfully importing alcohol and selling it to a \nminor.\n  Indeed, the Utah Attorney General, Jan Graham, declared: ``This case \nrepresents a significant win for Utah. No longer can retailers claim \nthat we have no authority over illegal transactions that occur outside \nof the state. If you're shipping to a Utah resident, we can and will \nprosecute you.''\n  This legislation is using the Internet as an excuse to impose a \nFederal fix for a problem that is already being solved at the state \nlevel. Whatever happened to Federalism? In fact, the National \nConference of State Legislatures opposes this legislation, calling the \nbill ``an overreaction to a situation which can be reconciled among the \nstates and not in a federal court.''\n  Skeptics rightly are concerned that some may be using the Internet as \nan excuse to protect the decades-old distribution system for wine and \nother alcoholic beverages. Although the Internet has not changed state \nliquor law enforcement, it has opened up the wine and beer market to \nnew consumer choices and competition.\n  With the power of electronic commerce, adult consumers now have the \nfreedom to choose from a rich assortment of different wine and beer \nproducts--from small wineries to nationwide brewers in America or any \nother country in the world.\n  We should be embracing this free market and open competition. \nCompetition in the free market is the American way. But instead some \nwine and beer wholesalers want to use this legislation as a \nprotectionist ploy to keep their present distribution system, which \neffectively locks out small wineries and micro-breweries from ever \ngetting their products on a store shelf. Mothers Against Drunk Driving \nand the National Conference of State Legislatures have noted that this \nFederal legislation is nothing more than an attempt to use the Federal \ncourts in a disagreement between wholesalers and small independent \nwineries and breweries.\n  On August 12, 1999, The Wall Street Journal wrote about this \nlegislation: ``This is a bad bill, with dangerous consequences not only \nfor alcohol but for the future of e-commerce and other cross-state \ntransactions.'' I whole-heartedly agree.\n  The Department of Justice has warned Congress in relation to \nlegislation affecting the Internet that: ``[A]ny prohibitions that are \ndesigned to prohibit criminal activity on the Internet must be \ncarefully drafted to accomplish the legislation's objectives without \nstifling the growth of the Internet or chilling its use.'' This bill \nfails that test. It is not carefully crafted. In fact, it is not even \nneeded. It also could chill the use of the Internet as a means of \npromoting interstate commerce.\n  I will vote in support of this conference report because the \nprovisions on sex trafficking, VAWA and justice for victims are \nproposals I endorse. I do so with profound regret with the process and \nthat the majority insisted on including Aimee's law and the internet \nalcohol bill that are not well considered. They are the price that we \npay for making progress here today. I will work to see if we can limit \ntheir damage.\n  In closing, I wish to thank the conferees and their staffs who showed \ncourtesy to me and mine. In particular, I thank Karen Knutsen of \nSenator Brownback's staff and Mark Lagon and Brian McKee of the staff \nof the Foreign Relations Committee. I thank Nancy Zirkin of the \nAmerican Association of University Women and Pat Reuss of the NOW Legal \nDefense and Education Fund for their efforts on behalf of VAWA II. This \nhas been a difficult matter at a difficult time that is being concluded \nas best we can under these circumstances in order to enact the sex \ntrafficking legislation, VAWA II and the victims bill for all the good \nthey can mean.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I thank you as well as the chairman of \nour committee, Mr. Hatch, and the ranking member, Mr. Leahy, for \nyielding me a brief amount of time to talk on the Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  I commend our leader on Judiciary, Senator Leahy, for his diligent \nwork on so many of the issues contained here. I know there are some \ndifferences on a few. I commend Senator Biden, who has worked long and \nhard on this issue for many years. We all owe him a debt of gratitude \nfor his strenuous efforts. I also thank the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer. When Senator Biden first introduced the bill in the Senate, \nSenator Boxer, then Congress Member Boxer, was the House sponsor; I was \nthe cosponsor. When she moved on to the Senate, I became the lead House \nsponsor and managed the bill as it was signed into law.\n  When it was first enacted in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act \nsignaled a sea change in our approach to the epidemic of violence \ndirected at women. Until the law, by and large it had been a dirty \nlittle secret that every night hundreds of women showed up at police \nprecincts, battered and bruised, because they were beaten by their \nspouse or their boyfriend or whatever. All too often they were told by \nthat law enforcement officer, who really had no education, no training, \nor no place to send the battered woman: Well, this is a domestic \nmatter. Go home and straighten it out with your husband.\n  So deep were the traditions ingrained that it was very hard to remove \nthem. In fact, the expression ``rule of thumb'' comes from the medieval \nlaw that said a husband could beat his wife with a stick provided that \nstick was no wider than his thumb.\n  The Violence Against Women Act took giant strides to take this \nterrible, dirty secret, bring it above ground, and begin really to \ncleanse it. The new law acknowledged that the ancient bias showed \nitself not just in the virulence of the perpetrators of violence but in \nthe failure of the system and the community to respond with sufficient \ncare and understanding. Shelters grew, police departments were \neducated, the VAWA hotline--which we added to the law as an \nafterthought, I remember, in the conference--got huge numbers of calls \nevery week, far more than anybody ever expected. The increased \npenalties for repeat sex offenders did a great deal of good.\n  In my State alone, for instance, the act provided $92 million for \npurposes such as shelter, such as education, such as rape crisis \ncenters, and such as prevention education for high school and college \nstudents, and victims' services. But, as impressive as the advances \nwere under the original VAWA, we still have a long way to go; this \nhorrible activity is ingrained deeply in our society. Building on the \nsuccess of VAWA I, VAWA II--the Violence Against Women Act II--is now \nbefore us. It is still the case that a third of all murdered women die \nat the hands of spouses and partners and a quarter of all violent \ncrimes against women are committed by spouses and partners. Indeed, the \nlatest figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics actually show an \nincrease of 13 percent in rape and sexual assault.\n  So we have a long way to go. The battle continues. It is why the \nViolence Against Women Act is so important and will make such a \ndifference in the lives of women across America. I will not catalog its \nprovisions. That has been done by my colleagues before me. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this legislation.\n  In conclusion, let us hope this law will hasten the time when \nviolence against women is not a unique and rampant problem requiring \nthe attention of this body. Let us pray for the time when women no \nlonger need to live in fear of being beaten.\n  I yield my time and thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see my good friend, the Senator from \nIowa, on the floor. I yield him 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Vermont for \nyielding me this time to voice my support for the reauthorization of \nthe Violence Against Women Act. It is an important act that should be \npassed forthwith.\n  I was a proud cosponsor of this bill when it passed in 1994, and I am \nan original cosponsor of the reauthorization bill. This is a law that \nhas helped hundreds of thousands of women and children in my State of \nIowa and across the Nation. Iowa has received more than $8 million \nthrough grants of VAWA. These grants fund the domestic violence hotline \nand keep the doors open at domestic violence shelters, such as the \nFamily Violence Center in Des Moines.\n  VAWA grants to Iowa have provided services to more than 2,000 sexual \nassault victims just this year, and more than 20,559 Iowa students this \nyear have received information about rape prevention through this \nFederal funding.\n  The numbers show that VAWA is working. A recent Justice report found \nthat intimate partner violence against women decreased by 21 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1998. This is strong evidence that State and community \nefforts are indeed working. But this fight is far from over. The \nreauthorization of this important legislation will allow these efforts \nto continue without having to worry that this funding will be lost from \nyear to year. I commend the Democratic and Republican leadership for \nworking to get this bill done before we adjourn.\n  I believe my friends on the Republican side of the aisle are \nsuffering from a split personality. They are willing to reauthorize the \nViolence Against Women Act, but they are not willing to put a judge on \nthe Federal bench who knows more about this law, has done more to \nimplement this law than any other person in this country, and that is \nBonnie J. Campbell, who right now heads the Office of Violence Against \nWomen that was set up by this law in 1994. In fact, Bonnie Campbell has \nbeen the head of this office since its inception, and the figures bear \nout the fact that this office is working, and it is working well.\n  Bonnie Campbell's name was submitted to the Senate in March. She had \nher hearing in May. All the paperwork is done. Yet she is bottled up in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Yesterday, the Senator from Alabama appeared on the CNN news show \n``Burden of Proof'' to discuss the status of judicial nominations. I \nwant to address some of the statements he made on that show.\n  Senator Sessions said Bonnie Campbell has no courtroom experience. \nThe truth: Bonnie Campbell's qualifications are exemplary. The American \nBar Association has given her their stamp of approval. She has had a \nlong history in law starting in 1984 with her private practice in Des \nMoines where she\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\nworked on cases involving medical malpractice, employment \ndiscrimination, personal injury, real estate, and family law.\n  She was then elected attorney general of Iowa, the first woman to \never hold that office. In that position, she gained high marks from all \nends of the political spectrum as someone who was strongly committed to \nenforcing the law to reducing crime and protecting consumers.\n  As I said, in 1995, she led the implementation of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act as head of that office under the Justice Department. \nHer strong performance in this role is reflected in last month's House \nvote to reauthorize VAWA--415-3.\n  Senator Sessions from Alabama says she has no courtroom experience. I \nwill mention a few of the judicial nominees who have been confirmed who \nwere criticized for having little or no courtroom experience.\n  Randall Rader--my friend from Utah might recognize that name--was \nappointed to the U.S. Claims Court in 1988 and then to the Federal \ncircuit in 1990. Before 1988, Mr. Rader had never practiced law, had \nonly been out of law school for 11 years, and his only post-law-school \nemployment had been with Congress as counsel to Senator Hatch from \nUtah. Yet today, he sits on a Federal bench. But Senator Sessions from \nAlabama says Bonnie Campbell has no courtroom experience; that is why \nshe does not deserve to be on the Federal court.\n  Pasco Bowman serves on the Eighth Circuit. He was confirmed in 1983. \nBefore his nomination--\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. He was criticized for his lack of experience because he \nhad been in private practice for 5 years out of law school, and the \nrest of that time he was a law professor. Now he is on the Eighth \nCircuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield? I want to agree with that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator. I do not think it is critical \nthat a person have prior trial experience to be nominated to the \nFederal bench.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. HATCH. There are many academics who have not had 1 day of trial \nexperience. There have been a number of Supreme Court Justices who have \nnot had 1 day of trial experience. I do criticize the Senator in one \nregard, and that is for bringing up the name of Randall Rader because \nRandy happened to be one of the best members of our Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. He is now one of the leading lights in all intellectual \nproperty issues as a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals judge. The fact \nis, he has a great deal of ability in that area. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield on that point? I am not \ncriticizing Randall Rader.\n  Mr. HATCH. I didn't think you were.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am saying here is a guy on the court, probably doing a \ngreat job for all I know, but he didn't have any courtroom experience \neither.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree with the Senator.\n  Let me just say this. I am in agreement with my friend and colleague \nfrom Iowa. I believe it is helpful to have trial experience, especially \nwhen you are going to be a trial judge. I do not think it is absolutely \nessential, however. I also believe some of the greatest judges we have \nhad, on the trial bench, the appellate bench, and on the Supreme Court, \nnever stepped a day into a courtroom other than to be sworn into law to \npractice.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with that.\n  Mr. HATCH. That isn't the situation.\n  Now, I have to say, I appreciate my two colleagues from Iowa in their \nvery earnest defense, and really offense, in favor of Bonnie Campbell. \nShe is a very nice woman and a very good person. Personally, I wish I \ncould have gotten her through. But it isn't all this side's fault. As \nthe Senator knows, things exploded here at the end because of continual \nfilibusters on motions to proceed and misuse of the appointments \nclause, holds by Democrats, by the Democrat leader, on their own \njudges, and other problems that have arisen that always seem to arise \nin the last days.\n  So I apologize to the distinguished Senator I couldn't do a better \njob in getting her through. But I agree with him, and I felt obligated \nto stand and tell him I agreed with him, that some of our greatest \njudges who have ever served have never had a day in court. I might add, \nsome of the worst who have ever served have never had a day in court \nalso. I think it is only fair to make that clear. But there are also \nsome pretty poor judges who have been trial lawyers, as well. So it \nisn't necessarily any particular experience.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just pointing out what the Senator from Alabama, who \nis a member of the Judiciary Committee, said.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was not saying anything about the Senator from Utah. I \nwas just pointing out, as he just did, some good judges on the \nappellate level never had trial experience.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would yield again, if we made that the \ncriterion, that you have to have a lot of trial experience, I am afraid \nwe would hurt the Federal Judiciary in many respects because there are \nsome great people----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree.\n  Mr. HATCH. Who have served in very distinguished manners who have not \nhad trial experience. I think it is helpful, but it does not \nnecessarily mean you are going to be a great judge.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I will note \nthe big difference between Judge Rader and Bonnie Campbell. I think \nJudge Rader is a very good judge. I supported him. Judge Rader got an \nopportunity to have a vote on his nomination, and he was confirmed. \nBonnie Campbell, who was nominated way back in March, has never been \ngiven a vote. There is a big difference.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is not trial experience. There is a big difference. She \ndeserved a vote just as much as anybody else. She never got the vote. \nHad she gotten the vote, then I think she would have been confirmed. It \nis not a question of Judge Rader, whom I happen to like, who is a close \npersonal friend of mine, and whom I supported; it is a question of who \ngets a vote around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from Iowa has \nexpired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I assumed the time of the Senator from Utah was coming \nfrom his side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yielded to him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield the Senator 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 2 more \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just point out, J. Harvie Wilkinson is another judge in \nthe Fourth Circuit. Again, he never had any courtroom experience \neither.\n  I am just pointing out, the Senator from Alabama yesterday, on the \nsame TV show, said Bonnie Campbell was nominated too late. Nonsense. \nGobbledy-gook.\n  Bonnie Campbell was nominated on March 2 of this year. The four \njudicial nominees who were confirmed just last week were nominated \nafter Bonnie Campbell. Why didn't Senator Sessions from Alabama stop \nthem from going out of committee? They were nominated after Bonnie \nCampbell. Three of them were nominated, received their hearings, and \nwere reported out of the committee during the same week in July. Bonnie \nCampbell had her hearing in May, and she has since been bottled up in \ncommittee.\n  I keep pointing out, in 1992 President Bush nominated 14 circuit \ncourt judges. Nine had their hearing, nine were referred, and nine were \nconfirmed--all in 1992. I guess it was not too late when the \nRepublicans had the Presidency, but it is too late if there is a \nDemocrat President.\n  Here is the year: 2000. Seven circuit court judges have been \nnominated; two have had their hearing, one has been referred, and one \nhas been confirmed--one out of seven.\n  So who is playing politics around this place?\n  The Senator from Alabama said the Judiciary Committee is holding \nhearings, just as they did in the past.\n  In 1992, there were 15 judicial hearings; this year, there have been \n8.\n  The Senator from Alabama also said some Republican Senators claim \nBonnie Campbell is too liberal.\n  But Bonnie Campbell has bipartisan support. Senator Grassley, law \nenforcement people, and victims services\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\ngroups also all support her. Is that the test?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. May I have 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time remains for the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 1 more minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thirty seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 30 seconds.\n\n\n      Unanimous Consent Request--Nomination Of Bonnie J. Campbell\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Since this may be my only opportunity today, I will do \nit, as I will every day we are in session.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of the nomination of Bonnie J. \nCampbell, that after the two rollcall votes at 4:30----\n  Mr. HATCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will wait until the Senator finishes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wanted to finish--that the Senate proceed to this \nnomination, with debate limited to 2 hours equally divided and, \nfurther, that the Senate vote on this nomination at the conclusion of \nthe yielding back of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I get a little tired of some of these \ncomments about judges when we put through 377 Clinton-Gore judges, only \n5 fewer than Ronald Reagan, the all-time high. I get a little tired of \nthe anguishing.\n  There has never been, to my recollection, in my 24 years here, a time \nwhere we have not had problems at the end of a Presidential year. \nWhether the Democrats are in power or we are in power, there is always \nsomebody, and others--quite a few people--who foul up the process. But \nthat is where we are. And to further foul it up is just not in the \ncards.\n  Senator Harkin has spoken at length about one nominee: Bonnie J. \nCampbell. Let me respond.\n  It always is the case that some nominations ``die'' at the end of the \nCongress. In 1992, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Congress \nadjourned without having acted on 53 Bush nominations. I have a list \nhere of the 53 Bush nominees whose nominations expired when the Senate \nadjourned in 1992, at the end of the 102nd Congress. By comparison, \nthere are only 40 Clinton nominations that will expire when this \nCongress adjourns. My Democratic colleagues have discussed at length \nsome of the current nominees whose nominations will expire at the \nadjournment of this Congress, including Bonnie Campbell. I ask \nunanimous consent that this list of 53 Bush nominations that Senate \nDemocrats permitted to expire in 1992 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 53 BUSH NOMINATIONS RETURNED BY THE DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED SENATE IN 1992\n                    AT THE CLOSE OF THE 102D CONGRESS\n \n                  Nominee                               Court\n \nSidney A.

I would note that the Reagan and Bush nominations that \nSenate Democrats allowed to expire Congresses included the nominations \nof minorities and women, such as Lillian BeVier, Frederic Moreno, and \nJudy Hope.\n  I do not have any personal objection to the judicial nominees who my \nDemocratic colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks. I am \nsure that they are all fine people. Similarly, I do not think that my \nDemocratic colleagues had any personal objections to the 53 judicial \nnominees whose nominations expired in 1992, a the end of the Bush \npresidency.\n  Many of the Republican nominees whose confirmations were blocked by \nthe Democrats have gone on to great careers both in public service and \nthe private sector. Senator Jeff Sessions, Governor Frank Keating, and \nWashington attorney John Roberts are just a few examples that come to \nmind.\n  I know that it is small comfort to the individuals whose nominations \nare pending, but the fact of the matter is that inevitably some \nnominations will expire when the Congress adjourns. I happens every two \nyears. I personally believe that Senate Republicans should get some \ncredit for keeping the number of vacancies that will die at the end of \nthis Congress relatively low. As things now stand, 13 fewer nominations \nwill expire at the end this year than expired at the end of the Bush \nPresidency.\n  Madam President, I rise today to express my pride and gratitude that \nthe Violence Against Women Act of 2000 will pass the Senate today and \nsoon become law. This important legislation provides tools that will \nhelp women in Utah and around the country who are victims of domestic \nviolence break away from dangerous and destructive relationships and \nbegin living their lives absent of fear.\n  I commend all of my fellow Senators and colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives with whom I worked to ensure the Violence Against Women \nAct is reauthorized through the year 2005. The Republican and \nDemocratic Senators and Representatives who worked to make sure that \nthis legislation passed understood and understand that violence knows \nno boundaries and it can affect the lives of everyone.\n  This has been a truly bipartisan effort of which everyone can be \nextremely proud. Specifically, I thank Senator Joseph Biden for his \nunyielding commitment to this bill. His leadership and dedication has \nensured VAWA's passage. I must say, though, that all along I remained \nmore optimistic than he that we would pass this bill I promised him we \nwould.\n  I want to take a moment to briefly summarize some of the important \nprovisions in this legislation. First, the bill reauthorizes through \nfiscal year 2005 the key programs included in the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act, such as the STOP and Pro-Arrest grant programs. The \nSTOP grant program has succeeded in bringing police and prosecutors, \nworking in close collaboration with victim services providers, into the \nfight to end violence against women. The STOP grants were revised to \nengage State courts in fighting violence against women by targeting \nfunds to be used by these courts for the training and education of \ncourt personnel, technical assistance, and technological improvements.\n  The Pro-Arrest grants have helped to develop and strengthen programs \nand policies that mandate and encourage police officers to arrest \nabusers who commit acts of violence or violate protection orders. These \ngrants have been expanded to include expressly the enforcement of \nprotection orders as a focus for the grant program funds. The\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nchanges also make the development and enhancement of data collection \nand sharing systems to promote enforcement of protection orders a \nfunding priority. Another improvement requires recipients of STOP and \nPro-Arrest grant funds, as a condition of funding, to facilitate the \nfiling and service of protection orders without cost to the victim in \nboth civil and criminal cases.\n  Additionally, the legislation reauthorizes the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline and rape prevention and education grant programs. It \nalso contains three victims of child abuse programs, including the \ncourt-appointed special advocate program. The Rural Domestic Violence \nand Child Abuse Enforcement Grants are reauthorized through 2005. This \ndirect grant program, which focuses on problems particular to rural \nareas, will specifically help Utah and other states and local \ngovernments with large populations living in rural areas.\n  Second, the legislation includes targeted improvements that our \nexperience with the original Act has shown to be necessary. For \nexample, VAWA authorizes grants for legal assistance for victims of \ndomestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. It provides funding \nfor transitional housing assistance, an extremely crucial complement to \nthe shelter program, which was suggested early on by persons in my home \nstate of Utah. It also improves full faith and credit enforcement and \ncomputerized tracking of protection orders by prohibiting notification \nof a batterer without the victim's consent when an out-of-state order \nis registered in a new jurisdiction. Another important addition to the \nlegislation expands several key grant programs to cover violence that \narises in dating relationships. Finally, it makes important revisions \nto the immigration laws to protect battered immigrant women.\n  There is no doubt that women and children in my home state of Utah \nwill benefit from the improvements made in this legislation. Mr. \nPresident, this is the type of legislation that can effect positive \nchanges in the lives of all Americans. It provides assistance to \nbattered women and their children when they need it the most. It \nprovides hope to those whose lives have been shattered by domestic \nviolence.\n  I am proud to have worked with the women's groups in Utah and \nelsewhere in seeing that VAWA is reauthorized. With their help, we have \nbeen able to make targeted improvements to the original legislation \nthat will make crucial services better and more available to women and \nchildren who are trapped in relationships of terror. I am proud of this \nachievement and what it will do to save the lives of victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  In closing, I again want to thank Senators Biden and Abraham, \nCongressman Bill McCollum, and Congresswoman Connie Morella for their \nleadership on and dedication to the issue of domestic violence. \nLegislators from both sides of the aisle in both Houses of Congress \nhave been committed to ensuring that this legislation becomes law. I am \nproud to have worked with my fellow legislators to achieve this goal, \nwhich will bring much needed assistance to the victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  Madam President, I am not just talking about violence against women \nlegislation and the work that Senator Biden and I have done through the \nyears to make it a reality. I actually worked very hard in my home \nState to make sure we have women-in-jeopardy programs, battered women \nshelters, psychiatric children programs, and other programs of \ncounseling, so that they can be taken care of in conjunction with the \nViolence Against Women Act and the moneys we put up here. In fact, we \nhold an annual charitable golf tournament that raises between $500,000 \nand $700,000 a year, most of which goes for seed money to help these \nwomen-in-jeopardy programs, children's psychiatric, and other programs \nin ways that will help our society and families.\n  I believe in this bill. I believe it is something we should do. I \nthink everybody ought to vote for it, and I hope, no matter what \nhappens today, we pass this bill, get it into law, and do what is right \nfor our women and children--and sometimes even men who are also covered \nby this bill because it is neutral. But I hope we all know that it is \nmostly women who suffer. I hope we can get this done and do it in a way \nthat really shows the world what a great country we live in and how \nmuch we are concerned about women, children, families, and doing \nsomething about some of the ills and problems that beset us.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, let me use 1 more minute, and I will make \na couple more comments. I want to express my strong support for the \nunderlying bill in this conference report dealing with victims of sex \ntrafficking. I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on the \nForeign Relations Committee, led by Senators Brownback and Wellstone \nfor much of this past summer, on the significant criminal and \nimmigration provisions in this legislation. This is an important \nmeasure that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement to combat \ninternational sex trafficking and provide needed assistance to the \nvictims of such trafficking. I think we can all be very proud of this \neffort.\n\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to thank all of the \ncommitted staff members on both sides of the aisle and on several \ncommittees for their talented efforts to get this legislation done.\n  First, on Senator Biden's staff, I thank Alan Hoffman, chief of Staff \nfor his tireless commitment, as well as current counsel Bonnie Robin-\nVergeer and former counsel Sheryl Walters. They are truly \nprofessionals.\n  On Senator Abraham's staff, I'd like to thank Lee Otis, and her \ncounterpart on Senator Kennedy's staff, Esther Olavarria.\n  On the Foreign Relations Committee, I'd like to express my thanks to \nstaff Director Biegun and the committed staffs of Senator Brownback and \nWellstone, including Sharon Payt and Karen Knutson.\n  And finally, Mr. President, there are many dedicated people on my own \nstaff who deserve special recognition. I thank my chief counsel and \nstaff director, Manus Cooney, as well as Sharon Prost, Maken Delrahim, \nand Leah Belaire.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a joint managers' statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, we are very pleased that the Senate has \n     taken up and passed the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women \n     Act of 2000 today. We have worked hard together over the past \n     year to produce a bipartisan, streamlined bill that has \n     gained the support of Senators from Both sides of the aisle.\n       The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 \n     signaled the beginning of a national and historic commitment \n     to the women and children in this country victimized by \n     family violence and sexual assault. Today we renew that \n     national commitment.\n       The original Act changed our laws, strengthened criminal \n     penalties, facilitated enforcement of protection orders from \n     state to state, and committed federal dollars to police, \n     prosecutors, battered women shelters, a national domestic \n     violence hotline, and other measures designed to crack down \n     on batterers and offer the support and services that victims \n     need in order to leave their abusers.\n       These programs are not only popular, but more importantly, \n     the Violence Against Women Act is working. The latest \n     Department of Justice statistics show that overall, violence \n     against women by intimate partners is down, falling 21 \n     percent from 1993 (just prior to the enactment of the \n     original Act) to 1998.\n       States, counties, cities, and towns across the country are \n     creating a seamless network of services for victims of \n     violence against women--from law enforcement to legal \n     services, from medical care and crisis counseling, to \n     shelters and support groups. The Violence Against Women Act \n     has made, and is making, a real difference in the lives of \n     millions of women and children.\n       Not surprisingly, the support for the bill is overwhelming. \n     The National Association of Attorneys General has sent a \n     letter calling for the bill's enactment signed by every state \n     Attorney General in the country. The National Governors' \n     Association support the bill. The American Medical \n     Association. Police chiefs in every state Sheriffs. District \n     Attorneys. Women's groups. Nurses, Battered women's shelters. \n     The list goes on and on.\n       For far too long, law enforcement, prosecutors, the courts, \n     and the community at large treated domestic abuse as a \n     ``private family matter,'' looking the other way when women \n     suffered abuse at the hands of their supposed loved ones. \n     Thanks in part to the original Act, violence against women is \n     no longer a\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n     private matter, and the time when a woman has to suffer in \n     silence because the criminal who is victimizing her happens \n     to be her husband or boyfriend has past. Together--at the \n     federal, state, and local levels--we have been steadily \n     moving forward, step by step, along the road to ending this \n     violence once and for all. But there is more that we can do, \n     and more that we must do.\n       The Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 \n     accomplishes two basic things:\n       First, the bill reauthorizes through Fiscal Year 2005 the \n     key programs included in the original Violence Against Women \n     Act, such as the STOP, Pro-Arrest, Rural Domestic Violence \n     and Child Abuse Enforcement, and campus grants programs; \n     battered women's shelters; the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline; rape prevention and education grant programs; and \n     three victims of child abuse programs, including the court-\n     appointed special advocate program (CASA).\n       Second, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 makes some \n     targeted improvements that our experience with the original \n     Act has shown to be necessary, such as--\n       (1) Authorizing grants for legal assistance for victims of \n     domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault;\n       (2) Providing funding for transitional housing assistance;\n       (3) Improving full faith and credit enforcement and \n     computerized tracking of protection orders;\n       (4) Strengthening and refining the protections for battered \n     immigrant women;\n       (5) Authorizing grants for supervised visitation and safe \n     visitation exchange of children between parents in situations \n     involving domestic violence, child abuse, sexual assault, or \n     stalking; and\n       (6) Expanding several of the key grant programs to cover \n     violence that arises in dating relationships.\n       Although this Act does not extend the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund, it is the managers' expectation that if \n     the Trust Fund is extended beyond Fiscal Year 2000, funds for \n     the programs authorized or reauthorized in the Violence \n     Against Women Act of 2000 would be appropriated from this \n     dedicated funding source.\n       Several points regarding the provisions of Title V, the \n     Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000, bear special \n     mention. Title V continues the work of the Violence Against \n     Women Act of 1994 (``VAWA'') in removing obstacles \n     inadvertently interposed by our immigration laws that many \n     hinder or prevent battered immigrants from fleeing domestic \n     violence safely and prosecuting their abusers by allowing an \n     abusive citizen or lawful permanent resident to blackmail the \n     abused spouse through threats related to the abused spouse's \n     immigration status. We would like to elaborate on the \n     rationale for several of these new provisions and how that \n     rationale should inform their proper interpretation and \n     administration.\n       First, section 1503 of this legislation allows battered \n     immigrants who unknowingly marry bigamists to avail \n     themselves of VAWA's self-petition procedures. This provision \n     is also intended to facilitate the filing of a self-petition \n     by a battered immigrant married to a citizen or lawful \n     permanent resident with whom the battered immigrant believes \n     he or she had contracted a valid marriage and who represented \n     himself or herself to be divorced. To qualify, a marriage \n     ceremony, either in the United States or abroad, must \n     actually have been performed. We would anticipate that \n     evidence of such a battered immigrant's legal marriage to the \n     abuser through a marriage certificate or marriage license \n     would ordinarily suffice as proof that the immigrant is \n     eligible to petition for classification as a spouse without \n     the submission of divorce decrees from each of the abusive \n     citizen's or lawful permanent resident's former marriages. \n     For an abused spouse to obtain sufficient detailed \n     information about the date and the place of each of the \n     abuser's former marriages and the date and place of each \n     divorce, as INS currently requires, can be a daunting, \n     difficult and dangerous task, as this information is under \n     the control of the abuser and the abuser's family members. \n     Section 1503 should relieve the battered immigrant of that \n     burden in the ordinary case.\n       Second, section 1503 also makes VAWA relief available to \n     abused spouses and children living abroad of citizens and \n     lawful permanent residents who are members of the uniformed \n     services or government employees living abroad, as well as to \n     abused spouses and children living abroad who were abused by \n     a citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse or parent in \n     the United States. We would expect that INS will take \n     advantage of the expertise the Vermont Service Center has \n     developing in deciding self-petitions and assign it \n     responsibility for adjudicating these petitions even though \n     they may be filed at U.S. embassies abroad.\n       Third, while VAWA self-petitioners can include their \n     children in their applications, VAWA cancellations of removal \n     applicants cannot. Because there is a backlog for \n     applications for minor children of lawful permanent \n     residents, the grant of permanent residency to the applicant \n     parent and the theoretical available of derivative status to \n     the child at that time does not solve this problem. Although \n     in the ordinary cancellation case the INS would not seek to \n     deport such a child, an abusive spouse may try to bring about \n     that result in order to exert power and control over the \n     abused spouse. Section 1504 directs the Attorney General to \n     parole such children, thereby enabling them to remain with \n     the victim and out of the abuser's control. This directive \n     should be understood to include a battered immigrant's \n     children whether or not they currently reside in the United \n     States, and therefore to include the use of his or her parole \n     power to admit them if necessary. The protection offered by \n     section 1504 to children abused by their U.S. citizen or \n     lawful permanent resident parents is available to the abused \n     child even though the courts may have terminated the parental \n     rights of the abuser.\n       Fourth, in an effort to strengthen the hand of victims of \n     domestic abuse, in 1996 Congress added crimes of domestic \n     violence and stalking to the list of crimes that render an \n     individual deportable. This change in law has had unintended \n     negative consequences for abuse victims because despite \n     recommended procedures to the contrary, in domestic violence \n     cases many officers still makes dual arrests instead \n     of determining the primary perpetrator of abuse. A \n     battered immigrant may well not be in sufficient control \n     of his or her life to seek sufficient counsel before \n     accepting a plea agreement that carries little or no jail \n     time without understanding its immigration consequences. \n     The abusive spouse, on the other hand, may understand \n     those consequences well and may proceed to turn the abuse \n     victim in to the INS.\n       To resolve this problem, section 1505(b) of this \n     legislation provides the Attorney General with discretion to \n     grant a waiver of deportability to a person with a conviction \n     for a crime of domestic violence or stalking that did not \n     result in serious bodily injury and that was connected to \n     abuse suffered by a battered immigrant who was not the \n     primary perpetrator of abuse in a relationship. In \n     determining whether such a waiver is warranted, the Attorney \n     General is to consider the full history of domestic violence \n     in the case, the effect of the domestic violence on any \n     children, and the crimes that are being committed against the \n     battered immigrant. Similarly, the Attorney General is to \n     take the same types of evidence into account in determining \n     under sections 1503(d) and 1504(a) whether a battered \n     immigrant has proven that he or she is a person of good moral \n     character and whether otherwise disqualifying conduct should \n     not operate as a bar to that finding because it is connected \n     to the domestic violence, including the need to escape an \n     abusive relationship. This legislation also clarifies that \n     the VAWA evidentiary standard under which battered immigrants \n     in self-petition and cancellation proceedings may use any \n     credible evidence to prove abuse continues to apply to all \n     aspects of self-petitions and VAWA cancellation as well as to \n     the various domestic violence discretionary waivers in this \n     legislation and to determinations concerning U visas.\n       Fifth, section 1505 makes section 212(i) waivers available \n     to battered immigrants on a showing of extreme hardship to, \n     among others, a ``qualified alien'' parent or child. The \n     reference intended here is to the current definition of a \n     qualified alien from the Personal Responsibility and Work \n     Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, found at 8 U.S.C. \n     1641.\n       Sixth, section 1506 of this legislation extends the \n     deadline for a battered immigrant to file a motion to reopen \n     removal proceedings, now set at 90 days after the entry of an \n     order of removal, to one year after final adjudication of \n     such an order. It also allows the Attorney General to waive \n     the one year deadline on the basis of extraordinary \n     circumstances or hardship to the alien's child. Such \n     extraordinary circumstances may include but would not be \n     limited to an atmosphere of deception, violence, and fear \n     that make it difficult for a victim of domestic violence to \n     learn of or take steps to defend against or reopen an order \n     of removal in the first instance. They also include failure \n     to defend against removal or file a motion to reopen within \n     the deadline on account of a child's lack of capacity due to \n     age. Extraordinary circumstances may also include violence or \n     cruelty of such a nature that, when the circumstances \n     surrounding the domestic violence and the consequences of the \n     abuse are considered, not allowing the battered immigrant to \n     reopen the deportation or removal proceeding would thwart \n     justice or be contrary to the humanitarian purpose of this \n     legislation. Finally, they include the battered immigrant's \n     being made eligible by this legislation for relief from \n     removal not available to the immigrant before that time.\n       Seventh, section 1507 helps battered immigrants more \n     successfully protect themselves from ongoing domestic \n     violence by allowing battered immigrants with approved self-\n     petitions to remarry. Such remarriage cannot serve as the \n     basis for revocation of an approved self-petition or \n     rescission of adjustment of status.\n       There is one final issue that has been raised, recently, \n     which we would like to take this opportunity to address, and \n     that is the eligibility of men to receive benefits and \n     services under the original Violence Against Women Act and \n     under this reauthorizing legislation. The original Act was \n     enacted in 1994 to respond to the serious and escalating \n     problem of violence against women. A voluminous legislative \n     record compiled after four years of congressional hearings \n     demonstrated convincingly that certain violent crimes, such \n     as domestic violence and sexual assault, disproportionally \n     affect women, both in terms of the sheer number of assaults \n     and the seriousness of the injuries inflicted. Accordingly, \n     the Act, through several complementary grant programs, made \n     it\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\n     a priority to address domestic violence and sexual assault \n     targeted at women, even though women, of course, are not \n     alone in experiencing this type of violence.\n       Recent statistics justify a continued focus on violence \n     targeted against women. For example, a report by the U.S. \n     Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics issued in \n     May 2000 on Intimate Partner Violence confirms that crimes \n     committed against persons by current or former spouses, \n     boyfriends or girlfriends--termed intimate partner violence--\n     is ``committed primarily against women.'' Of the \n     approximately 1 million violent crimes committed by intimate \n     partners in 1998, 876,340, or about 85 percent, were \n     committed against women. Women were victims of intimate \n     partner violence at a rate about 5 times that of men. That \n     same year, women represented nearly 3 out of 4 victims of the \n     1,830 murders attributed to intimate partners. Indeed, while \n     there has been a sharp decrease over the years in the rate of \n     murder of men by intimates, the percentage of female murder \n     victims killed by intimates has remained stubbornly at about \n     30 percent since 1976.\n       Despite the need to direct federal funds toward the most \n     pressing problem, it was not, and is not, the intent of \n     Congress categorically to exclude men who have suffered \n     domestic abuse or sexual assaults from receiving benefits and \n     services under the Violence Against Women Act. The Act \n     defines such key terms as ``domestic violence'' and ``sexual \n     assault,'' which are used to determine eligibility under \n     several of the grant programs, including the largest, the \n     STOP grant program, in gender-neutral language. Men who have \n     suffered these types of violent attacks are eligible under \n     current law to apply for services and benefits that are \n     funded under the original Act--and they will remain eligible \n     under the Violence Against Women Act of 2000--whether it be \n     for shelter space under the Family Violence Protection and \n     Services Act, or counseling by the National Domestic Violence \n     Hotline, or legal assistance in obtaining a protection order \n     under the Legal Assistance for Victims program.\n       We anticipate that the executive branch agencies \n     responsible for making grants under the Act, as amended, will \n     continue to administer these programs so as to ensure that \n     men who have been victimized by domestic violence and sexual \n     assault will receive benefits and services under the Act, as \n     appropriate.\n       We append to this joint statement a section by section \n     analysis of the bill and a more detailed section by section \n     analysis of the provisions contained in Title V.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that two section-\nby-section summaries of the Violence Against Women Act be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nDivision B, The violence Against Women Act of 2000--Section-by-Section \n                                Summary\n\n     Sec. 1001. Short Title\n       Names this division the Violence Against Women Act of 2000.\n     Sec. 1002. Definitions\n       Restates the definitions ``domestic violence'' and ``sexual \n     assault'' as currently defined in the STOP grant program.\n     Sec. 1003. Accountability and Oversight\n       Requires the Attorney General or Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services, as applicable, to require grantees under any \n     program authorized or reauthorized by this division to report \n     on the effectiveness of the activities carried out. Requires \n     the Attorney General or Secretary, as applicable, to report \n     biennially to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on \n     these grant programs.\n\nTitle I--Strengthening Law Enforcement to Reduce Violence Against Women\n\n     Sec. 1101. Improving Full Faith and Credit Enforcement of \n         Protection Orders\n       Helps states and tribal courts improve interstate \n     enforcement of protection orders as required by the original \n     Violence Against Women Act of 1994. Renames Pro-Arrest Grants \n     to expressly include enforcement of protection orders as a \n     focus for grant program funds, adds as a grant purpose \n     technical assistance and use of computer and other equipment \n     for enforcing orders; instructs the Department of Justice to \n     identify and make available information on promising order \n     enforcement practices; adds as a funding priority the \n     development and enhancement of data collection and sharing \n     systems to promote enforcement or protection orders.\n       Amends the full faith and credit provision in the original \n     Act to prohibit requiring registration as a prerequisite to \n     enforcement of out-of-state orders and to prohibit \n     notification of a batterer without the victim's consent when \n     an out-of-state order is registered in a new jurisdiction. \n     Requires recipients of STOP and Pro-Arrest grant funds, as a \n     condition of funding, to facilitate filing and service of \n     protection orders without cost to the victim in both civil \n     and criminal cases.\n       Clarifies that tribal courts have full civil jurisdiction \n     to enforce protection orders in matters arising within the \n     authority of the tribe.\n     Sec. 1102. Enhancing the Role of Courts in Combating Violence \n         Against Women\n       Engages state courts in fighting violence against women by \n     targeting funds to be used by the courts for the training and \n     education of court personnel, technical assistance, and \n     technological improvements. Amends STOP and Pro-Arrest grants \n     to make state and local courts expressly eligible for funding \n     and dedicates 5 percent of states' STOP grants for courts.\n     Sec. 1103. STOP Grants Reauthorization\n       Reauthorizes through 2005 this vital state formula grant \n     program that has succeeded in bringing police and prosecutors \n     in close collaboration with victim services providers into \n     the fight to end violence against women. (``STOP'' means \n     ``Services and Training for Officers and Prosecutors''). \n     Preserves the original Act's allocations of states' STOP \n     grant funds of 25 percent to police and 25 percent to \n     prosecutors, but increases grants to victim services to 30 \n     percent (from 25 percent), in addition to the 5 percent \n     allocated to state, tribal, and local courts.\n       Sets aside five percent of total funds available for State \n     and tribal domestic violence and sexual assault coalitions \n     and increases the allocation for Indian tribes to 5 percent \n     (up from 4 percent in the original Act).\n       Amends the definition of ``underserved populations'' and \n     adds additional purpose areas for which grants may be used.\n       Authorization level is $185 million/year (FY 2000 \n     appropriation was $206.75 million (including a $28 million \n     earmark for civil legal assistance)).\n     Sec. 1104. Pro-Arrest Grants Reauthorization\n       Extends this discretionary grant program through 2005 to \n     develop and strengthen programs and policies that mandate and \n     encourage police officers to arrest abusers who commit acts \n     of violence or violate protection orders.\n       Sets aside 5 percent of total amounts available for grants \n     to Indian tribal governments.\n       Authorization level is $65 million/year (FY 2000 \n     appropriation was $34 million).\n     Sec. 1105. Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse \n         Enforcement Grants Reauthorization\n       Extends through 2005 these direct grant programs that help \n     states and local governments focus on problems particular to \n     rural areas.\n       Sets aside 5 percent of total amounts available for grants \n     to Indian tribal governments.\n       Authorization level is $40 million/year (FY 2000 \n     appropriation was $25 million).\n     Sec. 1106. National Stalker and Domestic Violence Reduction \n         Grants Reauthorization\n       Extends through 2005 this grant program to assist states \n     and local governments in improving databases for stalking and \n     domestic violence.\n       Authorization level is $3 million/year (FY 1998 \n     appropriation was $2.75 million).\n     Sec. 1107. Clarify Enforcement to End Interstate Battery/\n         Stalking\n       Clarifies federal jurisdiction to ensure reach to persons \n     crossing United States borders as well as crossing state \n     lines by use of ``interstate or foreign commerce language.'' \n     Clarifies federal jurisdiction to ensure reach to battery or \n     violation of specified portions of protection order before \n     travel to facilitate the interstate movement of the victim. \n     Makes the nature of the ``harm required for domestic \n     violence, stalking, and interstate travel offenses consistent \n     by removing the requirement that the victim suffer actual \n     physical harm from those offenses that previously had \n     required such injury.\n       Resolves several inconsistencies between the protection \n     order offense involving interstate travel of the offender, \n     and the protection order offense involving interstate travel \n     of the victim.\n       Revises the definition of ``protection order'' to clarify \n     that support or child custody orders are entitled to full \n     faith and credit to the extent provided under other Federal \n     law--namely, the Parental Kidnaping Prevention Act of 1980, \n     as amended.\n       Extends the interstate stalking prohibition to cover \n     interstate ``cyber-stalking'' that occurs by use of the mail \n     or any facility of interstate or foreign commerce, such as by \n     telephone or by computer connected to the Internet.\n     Sec. 1108. School and Campus Security\n       Extends the authorization through 2005 for the grant \n     program established in the Higher Education Amendments of \n     1998 and administered by the Justice Department for grants \n     for on-campus security, education, training, and victim \n     services to combat violence against women on college \n     campuses. Incorporates ``dating violence'' into purpose areas \n     for which grants may be used. Amends the definition of \n     ``victim services'' to include public, nonprofit \n     organizations acting in a nongovernmental capacity, such as \n     victim services organizations at public universities.\n       Authorization level is $10 million/year (FY 2000 STOP grant \n     appropriation included a $10 million earmark for this use).\n       Authorizes the Attorney General to make grants through 2003 \n     to states, units of local government, and Indian tribes to \n     provide improved security, including the placement and use of \n     metal detectors and other deterrent measures, at schools and \n     on school grounds.\n       Authorization level is $30 million/year.\n     Sec. 1109. Dating Violence\n       Incorporates ``dating violence'' into certain purposes \n     areas for which grants may be used under the STOP, Pro-\n     Arrest, and Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse \n     Enforcement grant programs. Defines ``dating violence'' as \n     violence committed by a person:\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\n     (A) who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic \n     or intimate nature with the victim; and (B) where the \n     existence of such a relationship shall be determined based on \n     consideration of the following factors: (i) the length of the \n     relationship; (ii) the type of relationship; and (iii) the \n     frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the \n     relationship.\n\n        Title II--Strengthening Services to Victims of Violence\n\n     Sec. 1201. Legal Assistance to Victims of Domestic Violence \n         and Sexual Assault\n       Building on set-asides in past STOP grant appropriations \n     since fiscal year 1998 for civil legal assistance, this \n     section authorizes a separate grant program for those \n     purposes through 2005. Helps victims of domestic violence, \n     stalking, and sexual assault who need legal assistance as a \n     consequence of that violence to obtain access to trained \n     attorneys and lay advocacy services, particularly pro bono \n     legal services. Grants support training, technical \n     assistance, data collection, and support for cooperative \n     efforts between victim advocacy groups and legal assistance \n     providers.\n       Defines the term ``legal assistance'' to include assistance \n     to victims of domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault \n     in family, immigration, administrative agency, or housing \n     matters, protection or stay away order proceedings, and other \n     similar matters.

Adds three areas of training \n     eligible for grant use.\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\n     Sec. 1407. Domestic Violence Task Force\n       Requires the Attorney General to establish a task force to \n     coordinate research on domestic violence and to report to \n     Congress on any overlapping or duplication of efforts among \n     the federal agencies that address domestic violence.\n       Authorization level is $500,000.\n\n                   Title V--Battered Immigrant Women\n\n       Strengthens and refines the protections for battered \n     immigrant women in the original Violence Against Women Act. \n     Eliminates a number of ``catch-22'' policies and unintended \n     consequences of subsequent changes in immigration law to \n     ensure that domestic abusers with immigrant victims are \n     brought to justice and that the battered immigrants Congress \n     sought to help in the original Act are able to escape the \n     abuse.\n\n                        Title VI--Miscellaneous\n\n     Sec. 1601. Notice Requirements for Sexually Violent Offenders\n       Amends the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and \n     Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act to require sex \n     offenders already required to register in a State to provide \n     notice, as required under State law, of each institution of \n     higher education in that State at which the person is \n     employed, carries on a vocation, or is a student. Requires \n     that state procedures ensure that this registration \n     information is promptly made available to law enforcement \n     agencies with jurisdiction where the institutions of higher \n     education are located and that it is entered into appropriate \n     State records or data systems. These changes take effect 2 \n     years after enactment.\n       Amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require \n     institutions of higher education to issue a statement, in \n     addition to other disclosures required under the Act, \n     advising the campus community where law enforcement agency \n     information provided by a State concerning registered sex \n     offenders may be obtained. This change takes effect 2 years \n     after enactment.\n       Amends the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of \n     1974 to clarify that nothing in that Act may be construed to \n     prohibit an educational institution from disclosing \n     information provided to the institution concerning registered \n     sex offenders; requires the Secretary of Education to take \n     appropriate steps to notify educational institutions that \n     disclosure of this information is permitted.\n     Sec. 1602. Teen Suicide Prevention Study\n       Authorizes a study by the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services of predictors of suicide among at-risk and other \n     youth, and barriers that prevent the youth from receiving \n     treatment, to facilitate the development of model treatment \n     programs and public education and awareness efforts.\n       Authorization is for such sums as may be necessary.\n     Sec. 1603. Decade of Pain Control and Research\n       Designates the calendar decade beginning January 1, 2001, \n     as the ``Decade of Pain Control and Research.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n Title V, the Battered Immigrant Women Protection Act of 2000--Section-\n                           by-Section Summary\n\n       Title V is designed to improve on efforts made in VAWA 1994 \n     to prevent immigration law from being used by an abusive \n     citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse as a tool to \n     prevent an abused immigrant spouse form reporting abuse or \n     living the abusive relationship. This could happen because \n     generally speaking, U.S. immigration law gives citizens and \n     lawful permanent residents the right to petition for their \n     spouses to be granted a permanent resident visa, which is the \n     necessary prerequisite for immigrating to the United States. \n     In the vast majority of cases, granting the right to seek the \n     visa to the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse makes \n     sense, since the purpose of family immigration visas is to \n     allow U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents to live \n     here with their spouses and children. But in the unusual case \n     of the abusive relationship, an abusive citizen or lawful \n     permanent resident can use control over his or her spouse's \n     visa as a means to blackmail and control the spouse. The \n     abusive spouse would do this by withholding a promised visa \n     petition and then threatening to turn the abused spouse in to \n     the immigration authorities if the abused spouse sought to \n     leave the abuser or report the abuse.\n       VAWA 1994 changed this by allowing immigrants who \n     demonstrate that they have been battered or subjected to \n     extreme cruelty by their U.S. citizen or lawful permanent \n     resident spouses to file their own petitions for visas \n     without the cooperation of their abusive spouse. VAWA 1994 \n     also allowed abused spouses placed in removal proceedings to \n     seek ``cancellation of removal,'' a form of discretionary \n     relief from removal available to individuals in unlawful \n     immigration status with strong equities, after three years \n     rather than the seven ordinarily required. Finally, VAWA 1994 \n     granted similar rights to minor children abused by their \n     citizen or lawful permanent resident parent, whose \n     immigration status, like that of the abused spouse, would \n     otherwise be dependent on the abusive parent. VAWA 2000 \n     addresses residual immigration law obstacles standing in the \n     path of battered immigrant spouses and children seeking to \n     free themselves from abusive relationships that either had \n     not come to the attention of the drafters of VAWA 1994 or \n     have arisen since as a result of 1996 changes to immigration \n     law.\n     Sec. 1501. Short Title.\n       Names this title the Battered Immigrant Women Protection \n     Act of 2000.\n     Sec. 1502. Findings and Purposes\n       Lays out as the purpose of the title building on VAWA \n     1994's efforts to enable battered immigrant spouses and \n     children to free themselves of abusive relationships and \n     report abuse without fear of immigration law consequences \n     controlled by their abusive citizen or lawful permanent \n     resident spouse or parent.\n     Sec. 1503. Improved Access to Immigration Protections of the \n         Violence Against Women Act of 1994 for Battered Immigrant \n         Women.\n       Allows abused spouses and children who have already \n     demonstrated to the INS that they have been the victims of \n     battery or extreme cruelty by their spouse or parent to file \n     their own petition for a lawful permanent resident visa \n     without also having to show they will suffer ``extreme \n     hardship'' if forced to leave the U.S., a showing that is not \n     required if their citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse \n     or parent files the visa petition on their behalf. Eliminates \n     U.S. residency as a prerequisite for a spouse or child of a \n     citizen or lawful permanent resident who has been battered in \n     the U.S. or whose spouse is a member of the uniformed \n     services or a U.S. government employee to file for his or her \n     own visa, since there is no U.S. residency prerequisite for \n     non-battered spouses' or children's visas. Retains current \n     law's special requirement that abused spouses and children \n     filing their own petitions (unlike spouses and children for \n     whom their citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse or \n     parent petitions) demonstrate good moral character, but \n     modifies it to give the Attorney General authority to find \n     good moral character despite certain otherwise disqualifying \n     acts if those acts were connected to the abuse.\n       Allows a victim of battery or extreme cruelty who believed \n     himself or herself to be a citizen's or lawful permanent \n     resident's spouse and went through a marriage ceremony to \n     file a visa petition as a battered spouse if the marriage was \n     not valid solely on account of the citizen's or lawful \n     permanent resident's bigamy. Allows a battered spouse whose \n     citizen spouse died, whose spouse lost citizenship, whose \n     spouse lost lawful permanent residency, or from whom the \n     battered spouse was divorced to file a visa petition as an \n     abused spouse within two years of the death, loss of \n     citizenship or lawful permanent residency, or divorce, \n     provided that the loss of citizenship, status or divorce was \n     connected to the abuse suffered by the spouse. Allows a \n     battered spouse to naturalize after three years residency as \n     other spouses may do, but without requiring the battered \n     spouse to live in marital union with the abusive spouse \n     during that period.\n       Allows abused children or children of abused spouses whose \n     petitions were filed when they were minors to maintain their \n     petitions after they attain age 21, as their citizen or \n     lawful permanent resident parent would be entitled to do on \n     their behalf had the original petition been filed during the \n     child's minority, treating the petition as filed on the date \n     of the filing of the original petition for purposes of \n     determining its priority date.\n     Sec. 1504. Improved Access to Cancellation of Removal and \n         Suspension of Deportation under the Violence Against \n         Women Act of 1994.\n       Clarifies that with respect to battered immigrants, \n     IIRIRA's rule, enacted in 1996, that provides that with \n     respect to any applicant for cancellation of removal, any \n     absence that exceeds 90 days, or any series of absences that \n     exceed 180 days, interrupts continuous physical presence, \n     does not apply to any absence or portion of an absence \n     connected to the abuse. Makes this change retroactive to date \n     of enactment of IIRIRA. Directs Attorney General to parole \n     children of battered immigrants granted cancellation until \n     their adjustment of status application has been acted on, \n     provided the battered immigrant exercises due diligence in \n     filing such an application.\n     Sec. 1505. Offering Equal Access to Immigration Protections \n         of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 for All \n         Qualified Battered Immigrant Self-Petitioners\n       Grants the Attorney General the authority to waive certain \n     bars to admissibility or grounds of deportability with \n     respect to battered spouses and children. New Attorney \n     General waiver authority granted (1) for crimes of domestic \n     violence or stalking where the spouse or child was not the \n     primary perpetrator of violence in the relationship, the \n     crime did not result in serious bodily injury, and there was \n     a connection between the crime and the abuse suffered by the \n     spouse or child; (2) for misrepresentations connected with \n     seeking an immigration benefit in cases of extreme hardship \n     to the alien (paralleling the AG's waiver authority for \n     spouses and children petitioned for by their citizen or \n     lawful permanent resident spouse or parent in cases of \n     extreme hardship to the spouse or parent); (3) for crimes of \n     moral turpitude not constituting aggravated felonies where \n     the crime was connected to the abuse (similarly paralleling \n     the AG's waiver authority for spouses and children petitioned \n     for by their spouse or parents); (4) for health related \n     grounds of inadmissibility (also paralleling the AG's waiver \n     authority for spouses and children petitioned for by their \n     spouse or parent); and\n\n[[Page S10196]]\n\n     (5) for unlawful presence after a prior immigration \n     violation, if there is a connection between the abuse and the \n     alien's removal, departure, reentry, or attempted reentry. \n     Clarifies that a battered immigrant's use of public benefits \n     specifically made available to battered immigrants in PRWORA \n     does not make the immigrant inadmissible on public charge \n     ground.\n     Sec. 1506. Restoring Immigration Protections under the \n         Violence Against Women Act of 1994\n       Establishes mechanism paralleling mechanism available to \n     spouses and children petitioned for by their spouse or parent \n     to enable VAWA-qualified battered spouse or child to obtain \n     status as lawful permanent resident in the United States \n     rather than having to go abroad to get a visa.\n       Addresses problem created in 1996 for battered immigrants' \n     access to cancellation of removal by IIRIRA's new stop-time \n     rule. That rule was aimed at individuals gaming the system to \n     gain access to cancellation of removal. To prevent this, \n     IIRIRA stopped the clock on accruing any time toward \n     continuous physical presence at the time INS initiates \n     removal proceedings against an individual. This section \n     eliminates application of this rule to battered immigrant \n     spouses and children, who, if they are sophisticated enough \n     about immigration law and has sufficient freedom of movement \n     to ``game the system'', presumably would have filed self-\n     petitions, and more likely do not even know that INS has \n     initiated proceedings against them because their abusive \n     spouse or parent has withheld their mail. To implement this \n     change, allows a battered immigrant spouse or child to file a \n     motion to reopen removal proceedings within 1 year of the \n     entry of an order of removal (which deadline may be waived in \n     the Attorney General's discretion if the Attorney General \n     finds extraordinary circumstances or extreme hardship to the \n     alien's child) provided the alien files a complete \n     application to be classified as VAWA-eligible at the time the \n     alien files the reopening motion.\n     Sec. 1507. Remedying Problems with Implementation of the \n         Immigration Provisions of the Violence Against Women Act \n         of 1994\n       Clarifies that negative changes of immigration status of \n     abuser or divorce after abused spouse and child file petition \n     under VAWA have no effect on status of abused spouse or \n     child. Reclassifies abused spouse or child as spouse or child \n     of citizen if abuser becomes citizen notwithstanding divorce \n     or termination of parental rights (so as not to create \n     incentive for abuse victim to delay leaving abusive situation \n     on account of potential future improved immigration status of \n     abuser). Clarifies that remarriage has no effect on pending \n     VAWA immigration petition.\n     Sec. 1508. Technical Correction to Qualified Alien Definition \n         for Battered Immigrants\n       Makes technical change of description of battered aliens \n     allowed to access certain public benefits so as to use \n     correct pre-IIRIRA name for equitable relief \n     from deportation/removal (``suspension of deportation'' \n     rather than ``cancellation of removal'') for pre-IIRIRA \n     cases.\n     Sec. 1509. Access to Cuban Adjustment Act for Battered \n         Immigrant Spouses and Children\n       Allows battered spouses and children to access special \n     immigration benefits available under Cuban Adjustment Act to \n     other spouses and children of Cubans on the basis of the same \n     showing of battery or extreme cruelty they would have to make \n     as VAWA self-petitioners; relatives them of Cuban Adjustment \n     Act showing that they are residing with their spouse/parent.\n     Sec. 1510. Access to the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \n         American Relief Act for Battered Spouses and Children\n       Provides access to special immigration benefits under \n     NACARA to battered spouses and children similarly to the way \n     section 509 does with respect to Cuban Adjustment Act.\n     Sec. 1511. Access to the Haitian Refugee Fairness Act of 1998 \n         for Battered Spouses and Children\n       Provides access to special immigration benefits under HRIFA \n     to battered spouses and children similarly to the way section \n     509 does with respect to Cuban Adjustment Act.\n     Sec. 1512. Access to Services and Legal Representation for \n         Battered Immigrants\n       Clarifies that Stop grants, Grants to Encourage Arrest, \n     Rural VAWA grants, Civil Legal Assistance grants, and Campus \n     grants can be used to provide assistance to battered \n     immigrants. Allows local battered women's advocacy \n     organizations, law enforcement or other eligible Stop grants \n     applicants to apply for Stop funding to train INS officers \n     and immigration judges as well as other law enforcement \n     officers on the special needs of battered immigrants.\n     Sec. 1513. Protection for Certain Crime Victims Including \n         Victims of Crimes Against Women\n       Creates new nonimmigrant visa for victims of certain \n     serious crimes that tend to target vulnerable foreign \n     individuals without immigration status if the victim has \n     suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of \n     the crime, the victim has information about the crime, and a \n     law enforcement official or a judge certifies that the victim \n     has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be \n     helpful in investigating or prosecuting the crime. The crime \n     must involve rape, torture, trafficking, incest, sexual \n     assault, domestic violence, abusive sexual contact, \n     prostitution, sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation, \n     being held hostage, peonage, involuntary servitude, slave \n     trade, kidnapping, abduction, unlawful criminal restraint, \n     false imprisonment, blackmail, extortion, manslaughter, \n     murder, felonious assault, witness tampering, obstruction of \n     justice, perjury, attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the \n     above, or other similar conduct in violation of Federal, \n     State, or local criminal law. Caps visas at 10,000 per fiscal \n     year. Allows Attorney General to adjust these individuals to \n     lawful permanent resident status if the alien has been \n     present for 3 years and the Attorney General determines this \n     is justified on humanitarian grounds, to promote family \n     unity, or is otherwise in the public interest.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The sex trafficking conference report also contains \nlegislation known as ``Aimee's law.'' The purpose of Aimee's law is to \nencourage States to keep murderers, rapists, and child molesters \nincarcerated for long prison terms. Last year, a similar version of \nAimee's law passed the Senate 81 to 17, and Aimee's law passed the \nHouse of Representatives 412 to 15.\n  This legislation withholds Federal funds from certain States that \nfail to incarcerate criminals convicted of murder, rape, and dangerous \nsexual offenses for adequate prison terms. Aimee's law operates as \nfollows: In cases in which a State convicts a person of murder, rape, \nor a dangerous sexual offense, and that person has a prior conviction \nfor any one of those offenses in a designated State, the designated \nState must pay, from Federal law enforcement assistance funds, the \nincarceration and prosecution cost of the other State. In such cases, \nthe Attorney General would transfer the Federal law enforcement funds \nfrom the designated State to the subsequent State.\n  A State is a designated State and is subject to penalty under Aimee's \nlaw if (1) the average term of imprisonment imposed by the State on \npersons convicted of the offense for which that person was convicted is \nless than the average term of imprisonment imposed for that offense in \nall States; or (2) that person had served less than 85 percent of the \nprison term to which he was sentenced for the prior offense. In \ndetermining the latter factor, if the State has an indeterminate \nsentencing system, the lower range of the sentence shall be considered \nthe prison term. For example, if a person is sentenced to 10-to-12 \nyears in prison, then the calculation is whether the person served 85 \npercent of 10 years.\n  The purpose of Aimee's law is simple: to increase the term of \nimprisonment for murderers, rapists, and child molesters. In this \nrespect, Aimee's law is similar to the Violent-Offender-and-Truth-in-\nSentencing Program and the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Since 1995, \nthe Truth-in-Sentencing Program has provided approximately $600 million \nper year to States for prison construction. In order to receive these \nfunds, States had to adopt truth-in-sentencing laws that require \nviolent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. As a \nresult of such sentencing reforms, the average time served by violent \ncriminals in State prisons increased more than 12 percent since 1993. \nSimilarly, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 created the Federal \nsentencing guidelines and increased sentences for Federal inmates. I am \nproud to have supported both of these initiatives to increase prison \nterms for violent and repeat offenders.\n  Some will say that Aimee's law violates the principles of federalism, \nand in many respects, I am sympathetic to these arguments. However, I \nwould note that Aimee's law does not create any new Federal crimes, nor \ndoes it expand Federal jurisdiction into State and local matters. \nInstead, this law uses Federal law enforcement assistance funds to \nencourage States to incarcerate criminals convicted of murder, rape, \nand dangerous sexual offenses for adequate prison terms.\n  In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of Senator \nSantorum. He has been a tireless champion of Aimee's law. Without his \nleadership, Aimee's law would not have been included in the sex \ntrafficking conference report. The State of Pennsylvania should be \nproud to have such an able and energetic Senator.\n  My friend and colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, has expressed frustration with certain legislative \nitems being added to the sex trafficking conference report. I respect \nhim for voicing his concerns. I too would have preferred to have each \nof the measures\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\nthat were included in this sex trafficking conference report considered \non their own. But we have witnessed, during this session of Congress, \ndilatory procedural maneuvering of the like I have never witnessed \nbefore in the Senate.\n  Several bills which have passed both the House and the Senate are \nbeing held up with threats to filibuster the appointment of conferees. \nMotions to proceed to legislation are routinely objected to. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I was not even given the courtesy \nof being told that there was a Democratic hold on my interstate alcohol \nbill until after I sought to include it in the sex trafficking \nconference report. The public even witnessed the spectacle of the \nminority joining with the majority to limit debate on, and the \namendments to, the Hatch H-1B bill and then turning around to \nrepeatedly try to add non-relevant amendments to the bill in clear \nviolation of the Senate rules.\n  Just so the record is clear, there has been--and continues to be--an \neffort on the part of the minority to tie the Senate up in procedural \nknots and then accuse the majority of being unable to govern. That is \ntheir right under the rules. I do not recall engaging in similar \ntactics when Republicans were in the minority but I am confident there \nare instances where one could accuse of having engaged in similar \ndilatory tactics. But, I believe we eventually reached the point where \nour fidelity to the institution and our oaths of office transcended the \nshort-term interests of ballot box legislating.\n  The Senate has previously passed the interstate alcohol bill and the \nAimee's law legislation by overwhelming votes. Ironically, the one \npiece of legislation included in this bill which my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle do not object to having been added is the \nViolence Against Women Act. This legislation has not been considered by \nthe Senate, although I am confident had it been, it would have passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  In short, no one respects the rules of the Senate more than me, In \nthe end, I hope the minority will rethink its tired and belabored \nefforts to prevent the Senate from doing the public's work. Then we can \nadjourn and return to our respective states where the intervening \nadjournment can be spent with the real people of America--the workers, \nthe teachers, and students--instead of the pollsters and spin doctors \nwhich seem to be of paramount attention to too many of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, today I am pleased by the likely passage tonight of S. \n577, the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act. Originally introduced \non March 10, 1999, this legislation provides a mechanism that will \nfinally enable states to effectively enforce their laws prohibiting the \nillegal interstate shipment of beverage alcohol.\n  At the outset, I should note that S. 577 has enjoyed overwhelming \nsupport on both sides of the aisle and in both the Senate and the House \nof Representatives.\n  Originally passed by the Senate as an amendment by Senator Byrd to \nthe Juvenile Justice bill, S. 254, on a lopsided vote of 80-17 on May \n18, 1999, a revised version of S. 577 bill passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a 17-1 vote on March 2, 2000. As of the time of final \npassage, there were 23 cosponsors of the bill in the Senate--12 \nRepublicans and 11 Democrats.\n  In the House, the companion legislation to S. 577, H.R. 2031, \nsponsored by my friend from Florida, Representative Joe Scarborough, \npassed the House initially by a vote of 310-112 on August 3, 1999. H.R. \n2031 was backed by a coalition of 45 cosponsors in the House.\n  What is included in the conference report is the version of S. 577 as \npassed by the Judiciary Committee in March. It is important to note \nthat the legislation, as revised with some amendments in the Committee \nto address both the Wine Institute's and the American Vintners \nAssociation's concerns, even got the support of Senators Feinstein and \nSchumer, the two most vocal early opponents of the legislation. We \nworked hard with representatives of the wineries on language to further \nclarify that this bill does not, even unintentionally, somehow change \nthe balancing test employed by the Courts in reviewing State liquor \nlaws. We were able to reach agreement and incorporated those changes in \nthe bill. The Wine Institute and the Vintners Association both have \nwritten us that they are no longer oppose the legislation.\n  Let me get to the substance of the legislation, the purpose behind it \nand the history of this issue--both legislative and constitutional. I \nthink it is important to fully understand this history to appreciate \nthis legislation.\n  The simple purpose of this bill is to provide a mechanism to enable \nStates to effectively enforce their laws against the illegal interstate \nshipment of alcoholic beverages. Interstate shipments of alcohol \ndirectly to consumers have been increasing exponentially--and, while I \ncertainly believe that interstate commerce should be encouraged, and \nwhile I do not want small businesses stifled by unnecessary or overly \nburdensome and complex regulations, I do not subscribe to the notion \nthat purveyors of alcohol are free to avoid State laws which are \nconsistent with the power bestowed upon them by the Constitution. \nUnfortunately, that is exactly want is happening, and that is what this \nlegislation will address.\n  All States, including the State of Utah, need to be able to address \nthe sale and shipment of liquor into their State consistent with the \nConstitution. As my colleagues know, the Twenty First Amendment ceded \nto the States the right to regulate the importation and transportation \nof alcoholic beverages across their borders. States need to protect \ntheir citizens from consumer fraud and have a claim to the tax revenue \ngenerated by the sale of such goods. And of the utmost importance, \nStates need to ensure that minors are not provided with unfettered \naccess to alcohol. Unfortunately, indiscriminate direct sales of \nalcohol circumvent this State right.\n  Let me emphasize that there are many companies engaged in the direct \ninterstate shipment of alcohol who do not violate State laws. In fact, \nmany of these concerns look beyond their own interests and make \ndiligent efforts to disseminate information to others to ensure that \nState laws are understood and complied with by all within the \ninterstate industry. This legislation only reaches those that violate \nthe law.\n  Now, I would like to say a few words on the history of this issue. As \nmany of my colleagues know, debate over the control of the distribution \nof beverage alcohol has been raging for as long as this country has \nexisted. Prior to 1933, every time individuals or legislative bodies \nengaged in efforts to control the flow and consumption of alcohol, \nwhether by moral persuasion, legislation or ``Prohibition,'' others \nwere equally determined to repeal, circumvent or ignore those barriers. \nThe passage of state empowering federal legislation such as the Webb-\nKenyon Act and the Wilson Act were not sufficient, in and of \nthemselves, to provide states with the power they needed to control the \ndistribution of alcohol in the face of commerce clause challenges. It \ntook the passage of a constitutional amendment--and the re-enactment of \nthe Webb-Kenyon Act in 1935--to give states the power they needed to \ncontrol the importation of alcohol across their borders.\n  The Twenty-First Amendment was ratified in 1933. That amendment ceded \nto the States the right to regulate the importation and transportation \nof alcoholic beverages across their borders. By virtue of that grant of \nauthority, each State created its own unique regulatory scheme to \ncontrol the flow of alcohol. Some set up ``State stores'' to effectuate \ncontrol of the shipment into, and dissemination of alcohol within, \ntheir State. Others refrained from direct control of the product, but \nset up other systems designed to monitor the shipments and ensure \ncompliance with its laws. But whatever the type of State system \nenacted, the purpose was much the same: to protect its citizens and \nensure that its laws were obeyed.\n  With passage of the ``Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act,'' the \nStates will be empowered to fight illegal sales of alcohol--let me \nemphasize illegal. This legislation is particularly well-timed in that \nit comes on the heels of a powerful opinion uphold state rights under \nthe 21st Amendment in the case of Bridenbaugh v. Freeman-Wilson, by \nrespected jurist Frank Easterbrook and the Seventh Circuit\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\nCourt of Appeals. In an opinion upholding a state's right to regulate \nthe importation of alcohol and prohibit illegal sales, Judge \nEasterbrook cogently articulated the role of the 21st Amendment in the \nConstitutional framework:\n\n       . . . the twenty-first amendment did not return the \n     Constitution to its pre-1919 form. Section 2 . . . closes the \n     loophole left by the dormant commerce clause, . . . No longer \n     may the dormant commerce clause be read to protect interstate \n     shipments of liquor from regulation; sec. 2 speaks directly \n     to these shipments . . . No decision of the Supreme Court \n     holds or implies that laws limited to the importation of \n     liquor are problematic under the dormant commerce clause.\n\n  Some who would seek to avoid state and federal laws have erroneously \ncomplained that S. 577 will allow states to enforce discriminatory \nstate laws. These complaints are without merit. In actuality, failure \nto pass this bill would have had the effect of discriminating against \nin-state distributors by effectively giving out-of-state distributors \nde facto immunity from state regulation. Congress and the Constitution \nhave recognized that States have a legitimate interest in being able to \ncontrol the interstate distribution of alcohol on the same terms and \nconditions as they are able to control in-state distribution. As Judge \nEasterbrook pointed out:\n\n       Indeed, all ``importation'' involves shipments from another \n     state or nation. Every use of sec. 2 could be called \n     ``discriminatory'' in the sense that plaintiffs use that \n     term, because every statute limiting importation leaves \n     intrastate commerce unaffected. If that were the sort of \n     discrimination that lies outside state power, then sec. 2 \n     would be a dead letter. . . . Congress adopted the Webb-\n     Kenyon Act, and later proposed sec. 2 of the twenty-first \n     amendment, precisely to remedy this reverse discrimination \n     and make alcohol from every source equally amenable to state \n     regulation.\n\n  That is exactly what S. 577 accomplishes. It simply ensures that all \nbusinesses, both in-state and out-of-state, are held accountable to the \nsame valid laws of the state of delivery.\n  It is important to note that the Webb-Kenyon Act already prohibited \nthe interstate shipment of alcohol in violation of state law. \nUnfortunately, that general prohibition lacked an appropriate \nenforcement mechanism, thus thwarting the states' ability to enforce \ntheir laws--those same laws they enacted pursuant to valid \nConstitutional authority under the Twenty-First Amendment--in state \ncourt proceedings through jurisdictional roadblocks. The legislation \npassed today removes that impediment to state enforcement by simply \nproviding the Attorney General of a State, who has reasonable cause to \nbelieve that his or her State laws regulating the importation and \ntransportation of alcohol are being violated, with the ability to file \nan action in federal court for an injunction to stop those illegal \nshipments.\n  This bill is balanced to ensure due process and fairness to both the \nState bringing the action and the company or individual alleged to have \nviolated the State's laws. The bill:\n  1. Assures defendants of due process by requiring that no injunctions \nmay be granted without notice to the defendants or an opportunity to be \nheard;\n  2. Assures defendants of due process by requiring that no preliminary \ninjunction may be issued without proving: (a) irreparable injury, and \n(b) a probability of success on the merits;\n  3. Clarifies that injunctive relief only may be obtained--no damages, \nattorneys fees or other costs--may be awarded;\n  4. Assures that cases brought are truly interstate/federal in \ncharacter by clarifying that in-state licensees and other authorized \nin-state purveyors, readily amenable to state proceedings, may not be \nsubjected to federal injunctive actions;\n  5. Allows actions only against those who have violated or are \ncurrently violating state laws regulating the importation or \ntransportation of intoxicating;\n  6. Notes that evidence from an earlier hearing on a request for a \npreliminary injunction--but from no other state or federal proceedings, \nmay be used in subsequent hearings seeking a permanent injunction--\nconserving court resources but protecting a defendant's right to \nconfront the evidence against him;\n  7. Ensures that S. 577 may not be construed to interfere with or \notherwise modify the Internet Tax Freedom Act;\n  8. Provides for venue where the violation actually occurs--in the \nstate into which the alcohol is illegally shipped.\n  9. Protects innocent interactive computer services (ICS's) and \nelectronic communications services (ECS's) from the threat of \ninjunctive actions as a result of the use of those services by others \nto illegally sell alcohol;\n  10. Prohibits injunctive actions involving the advertising or \nmarketing (but not the sale, transportation or importation) of alcohol \nwhere such advertising or marketing would be lawful in the jurisdiction \nfrom which the advertising originates;\n  11. Requires that laws sought to be enforced by the states under S. \n577 be valid exercises of authority conferred upon the states by the \n21st Amendment and the Webb-Kenyon Act.\n  Madam President, contrary to some of the erroneous claims of some in \nthe narrow opposition, I want to reemphasize that S. 577 is intended to \nassist the states in the enforcement of constitutionally-valid state \nliquor laws by providing them with a federal court forum. We are not \nstopping Internet or for that matter, any, legal sales of alcohol. \nIndeed, there is no objection to this legislation by a host of \ncompanies who sell wine over the Internet, such as Vineyards. The sole \nremedy available under the bill is injunctive relief--that is, no \ndamages, no civil fines, and no criminal penalties may be imposed \nsolely as a result of this legislation.\n  We specifically included rules of construction language in subsection \n2(e) stating that this legislation ``shall be construed only to extend \nthe jurisdiction of Federal courts in connection with State law that is \na valid exercise of power invested in the States'' under the Twenty-\nFirst Amendment as that Amendment has been interpreted by the U.S. \nSupreme Court ``including interpretations in conjunction with other \nprovisions of the Constitution.'' This bill is not to be construed as \ngranting the States any additional power beyond that.\n  Consequently, the state power vested under the Twenty-First \nAmendment, as I have discussed above, is appropriately interpreted with \nand against other rights and privileges protected by the Constitution, \nas the Supreme Court does in every case. It should also be made clear \nthat by enacting S. 577, we are not passing on the advisability or \nlegal validity of the various state laws regulating alcoholic \nbeverages, which continue to be litigated in the courts, and should \nappropriately be a matter for the courts to decide.\n\n\n               colloquy on 21st amendment enforcement act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have strong misgivings about one part \nof the conference report we are about to consider. The provisions \nrelating to interstate sales of alcoholic beverages, known as the 21st \nAmendment Enforcement Act, would dramatically reduce the ability of \nsmall wineries in my state to market their products across the country.\n  These wineries are small, independent, often family-owned, \noperations. They are the ``little guys'' in the winemaking industry. \nThey need to sell their products directly to consumers around the \ncountry, and the Internet, especially, holds great promise for their \nfuture economic success.\n  Already, some of them have been hurt by state laws banning interstate \nsales of wine. The Matanzas Greek Winery in Sonoma County estimates \nthat it is turning away around $8,000 a month in direct sales from \nconsumers who had visited the winery and hoped to place orders from \ntheir homes in other states.\n  I am very concerned that the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act will make \nit even more difficult for these ``little guys'' to compete in the wine \nbusiness.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, whether he would consider the impact of this \nlegislation on my small wineries. Would the senator be willing, after \nthe legislation has been on the books for a year or so, the review its \nimpact on small wineries and to work with me to make such amendments as \nare necessary to take care of them?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would be happy to consider this issue \nafter next year and examine the legislation's impact on small wineries. \nI respect my colleagues from California's commitment to their \nconstituents. I\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nmust reemphasize, however, that this legislation does nothing to hurt \nthe so-called small wineries in competing or marketing their products \nin the wine business. I worked hard for over a year with the wine \nindustry to ensure that the legislation does not have any unintended \nconsequences, and want to reassure my colleague from California that \nthe version of the legislation that is included in the conference \nreport incorporates revisions made in the committee to address both the \nWine Institute's and the American Vintners Association's concerns. We \nalso included language to further clarify that this bill does not, even \nunintentionally, somehow change the balancing test employed by the \ncourts in reviewing state liquor laws. I should also not that the Wine \nInstitute and the Vintners Association, as well as numerous Internet \ncommerce companies, have written us that they no longer oppose the \nlegislation.\n  The simple purpose of this bill is to provide a mechanism to enable \nStates to effectively enforce their laws against the illegal interstate \nshipment of alcoholic beverages. I hope the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia knows that while I certainly believe that interstate \ncommerce should be encouraged, and while I do not want small businesses \nstifled by unnecessary or overly burdensome and complex regulations, I \ndo not subscribe to the notion that purveyors of alcohol are free to \navoid State laws which are consistent with the power bestowed upon them \nby the Constitution--and I should add that I don't think that Senator \nBoxer subscribes to that notion either.\n  Let me emphasize that there are many companies engaged in the direct \ninterstate shipment of alcohol who do not violate State laws. In fact, \nmany of these concerns look beyond their own interests and make \ndiligent efforts to disseminate information to others to ensure that \nState laws are understood and complied with by all within the \ninterstate industry. This legislation only reaches those that violate \nthe law, and only allows the attorney general of a state to go to \nFederal court to enforce its laws. It is just a jurisdictional \nlegislation and does not allow or prohibit any sales or marketing by \nany winery, large or small.\n  Having said that, I do hear the concerns by Senator Boxer and am \nwilling to consider the impact of this legislation after the law has \nbeen on the books for a year or so, as my colleague has asked. I look \nforward to working with her to insure that this legislation does not \nharm small wineries which comply with the law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his interest and concern, and for \nhis commitment to review the impact of the 21st Amendment Enforcement \nAct on small wineries in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                              aimee's law\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act conference report, H.R. 3244, which \nin addition to seeking to end the trafficking of women and children \ninto the international sex trade, slavery and force labor also includes \nmajor provisions reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, \nproviding justice for victims of terrorism, and Aimee's law.\n  One of the most disturbing human rights violations of our time is \ntrafficking of human beings, particularly that of women and children, \nfor purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor. Every year, the \ntrafficking of human beings for the sex trade affects hundreds of \nthousands of women throughout the world. Women and children whose lives \nhave been disrupted by economic collapse, civil wars, or fundamental \nchanges in political geography have fallen prey to traffickers. \nAccording to the Department of State, approximately 1-2 million women \nand girls are trafficked annually around the world.\n  I commend Senator Sam Brownback and Senator Paul Wellstone for their \nbipartisan leadership on the International Trafficking of Women and \nChildren Victim Protection Act. The bill specifically defines \n``trafficking'' as the use of deception, coercion, debt bondage, the \nthreat of force, or the abuse of authority to recruit, transport, \npurchase, sell, or harbor a person for the purpose of placing or \nholding such person, whether for pay or not, in involuntary servitude \nor slavery-like conditions. Using this definition, the legislation \nestablishes within the Department of State an Interagency Task Force to \nMonitor and Combat Trafficking. The Task Force would assist the \nSecretary of State in reporting to Congress the efforts of the United \nStates government to fight trafficking and assist victims of this human \nrights abuse. In addition, the bill would amend the Immigration and \nNationality Act to provide for a non-immigrant classification for \ntrafficking victims in order to better assist the victims of this \ncrime.\n  Senator Orrin Hatch and Senator Joe Biden introduced S. 2787, the \nViolence Against Women Act. This bipartisan bill would reauthorize \nfederal programs which have recently expired for another five years to \nprevent violence against women. It seeks to strengthen law enforcement \nto reduce these acts of violence, provide services to victims, \nstrengthen education and training to combat violence against women and \nlimit the effects of violence on children. I am an original cosponsor \nof this important legislation which has been endorsed by the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National Governor's Association, \nand the American Medical Society. On September 26, the House of \nRepresentatives passed its version of the Violence Against Women Act, \nH.R. 1248, by a vote of 415 to 3. I am pleased that this important \nlegislation is included in the Sex Trafficking conference report which \npassed the House of Representatives on October 6 by a 371-1 vote \nmargin.\n  The reauthorization legislation also creates new initiatives \nincluding transitional housing for victims of violence, a pilot program \naimed at protecting children during visits with parents accused of \ndomestic violence, and protections for elderly, disabled, and immigrant \nwomen. The bill also would provide grants to reduce violent crimes \nagainst women on campus and extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust \nFund. It authorizes over $3 billion over five years for the grant \nprograms. As a Member of the House of Representatives in the 103rd \nCongress, I supported H.R. 1133, the original Violence Against Women \nAct, offered by Representative Pat Schroeder of Colorado. Since FY1995, \nVAWA has been a major source of funding for programs to reduce rape, \nstalking, and domestic violence. I am also very pleased that my own \nlegislation to strengthen incentives for violent criminals, including \nrapists and child molesters, to remain in prison and hold states \naccountable is included in the conference report.\n\n  Aimee's law was prompted by the tragic death of a college senior \nAimee Willard who was from Brookhaven, Pennsylvania near Philadelphia. \nArthur Bomar, a convicted murderer was early paroled from a Nevada \nprison. Even after he had assaulted a woman in prison, Nevada released \nhim early. Bomar traveled to Pennsylvania where he found Aimee. He \nkidnapped, brutally raped, and murdered Aimee. He was prosecuted a \nsecond time for murder for this heinous crime in Delaware County, PA. \nAimee's mother, Gail Willard, has become a tireless advocate for \nvictims' rights and serves as an inspiration to me and countless \nothers.\n  This important legislation would use federal crime fighting funds to \ncreate an incentive for states to adopt stricter sentencing and truth-\nin-sentencing laws by holding states financially accountable for the \ntragic consequences of an early release which results in a violent \ncrime being perpetrated on the citizens of another state. Specifically, \nAimee's law will redirect enough federal crime fighting dollars from a \nstate that has released early a murderer, rapist, or child molester to \npay the prosecutorial and incarceration costs incurred by a state which \nhas had to reconvict this released felon for a similar heinous crime. \nMore than 14,000 murders, rapes, and sexual assaults on children are \ncommitted each year by felons who have been released after serving a \nsentence for one of those very same crimes. Convicted murderers, \nrapists, and child molesters who are released from prisons and cross \nstate lines are responsible for sexual assaults on more than 1,200 \npeople annually, including 935 children.\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\n  Recidivism rates for sexual predators are the highest of any category \nof violent crime. Despite this, the average time served for rape is \nonly five and one half years, and the average time served for sexual \nassault is under four years. Also troubling is the fact that thirteen \npercent of convicted rapists receive no jail time at all. We have more \nthan 130,000 convicted sex offenders right now living in our \ncommunities because of the leniency of these systems. The average time \nserved for homicide is just eight years. Under Aimee's law, federal \ncrime fighting funds are used to create an incentive for states to \nadopt stricter sentencing and truth-in-sentencing laws.\n  This legislation is endorsed by Gail Willard, Aimee's mother, Marc \nKlass, Fred Goldman, and numerous organizations such the National \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Rifle Association, and the Law \nEnforcement Alliance of America. 39 victims' rights organizations also \nsupport Aimee's law including Justice For All, the National Association \nof Crime Victims' Rights, the Women's Coalition, and Kids Safe. These \ngroups consider Aimee's law one of their highest priority bills. It \nsends a message that if a state has very lenient sentencing it impacts \nother states and crime victims in those states as well.\n\n  I first offered Aimee's law as an amendment to the juvenile justice \nbill on May 19, 1999, which passed the Senate by a 81-17 vote margin. \nCongressman Matt Salmon also offered the legislation as an amendment in \nthe House of Representatives on June 16, 1999, which passed by a 412-15 \nvote. Due to a lack of progress on the conference report it became \nnecessary to move the legislation separately. On May 11, I joined \nAimee's mother Gail at a hearing of the U.S. House Subcommittee on \nCrime, to urge the House to approve legislation separately to keep \nsexual predators behind bars. The House of Representatives subsequently \npassed the legislation again by a unanimous voice vote.\n  Aimee's law is an appropriate way to protect the citizens of one \nstate from inappropriate early releases of another state. One of the \nforty plus national organizations supporting Aimee's law, the National \nFraternal Order of Police, said the following.\n\n       One of the most frustrating aspects of law enforcement is \n     seeing the guilty go free and, once free, commit another \n     heinous crime. Lives can be saved and tragedies averted if we \n     have the will to keep these predators locked up. Aimee's Law \n     addresses this issue smartly, with Federalizing crimes and \n     without infringing on the State and local responsibilities of \n     local law enforcement by providing accountability and \n     responsibility to States who release their murders, rapists, \n     and child molesters to prey again on the innocent.\n\n  We have made several modest changes to address implementation \nconcerns by the states in the effort to achieve the best protection \npossible for our citizens. These include (1) Definitions: utilizing the \ndefinitions for murder and rape of part I of the Uniform Crime Reports \nof the FBI and for dangerous sexual offenses utilizing the definitions \nof chapter 109A of title 18- to provide for uniform comparisons across \nthe states; (2) Sentencing Comparisons: Eliminating the additional 10 \npercent requirement and utilizing a national average for sentencing \nonly as a benchmark; (3) Study: Also building into the process a study \nevaluating the implementation and effect of Aimee's Law in 2006; (4) \nSource of Funds: Provides states the flexibility to choose the source \nof federal law enforcement assistance funds (except for crime victim \nassistance funds); (5) Implementation: Delays the implementation of \nAimee's Law to January 1, 2002 to allow states the opportunity to make \nany modifications that they would choose to do; and (6) Indeterminate \nSentencing States: Safe harbor for states with sentencing ranges allows \nfor the use of the lower number in the calculation (e.g. if sentencing \nguideline is 10-15 years, 10 years will be utilized.)\n  We are sending a clear message with Aimee's law. We want tougher \nsentences and we want truth in sentencing. A child molester who \nreceives four years in prison, when you consider the recidivism rate, \nis an abomination. Murders, rapists, and child molesters do not deserve \nearly release; our citizens deserve to be protected. In this \nlegislation we are protecting one state's citizens from the complacency \nof another state, and appropriate role for the federal government. I \nwant to thank my colleagues for their support and urge the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of Gail \nWillard be printed in the Record, along with the list of endorsements.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Testimony of Gail Willard Before the Crime Subcommittee\n\n       It has been one thousand four hundred twenty one days since \n     Aimee's murder. This nightmare began on June 20, 1996. At \n     4:45 AM, I was awakened by a phone call--something every \n     parent dreads and hopes will never happen to them. I was told \n     that the police had found my car on the ramp of a major \n     highway. The car engine was running; the driver's side door \n     was open; the headlights were on; the radio was playing \n     loudly; and there was blood in front of and next to the car. \n     Who was the driver? Where was the driver? That night, my \n     beautiful twenty-two year old daughter, Aimee, had my car. \n     She had gone to a reunion with high school friends, and now \n     she was missing. Late that afternoon Aimee's body was found \n     in a trash-strewn lot in the ``badlands'' of North \n     Philadelphia. She had been raped and beaten to death.\n       Aimee was a wonder, a delight, a brilliant light in my \n     life. With dancing blue eyes and a bright, beautiful smile, \n     she drew everyone who knew her into the web of her life. She \n     would light up a room just by walking into it. She could run \n     like the wind, and she enjoyed the game--every game. She had \n     friends and talents and dreams for a spectacular future, so \n     it seemed only natural and right to believe that she would \n     live well into old age. Never one to complain when things \n     didn't go her way, Aimee always worked and played to the best \n     of her ability, happy with her successes, taking her failure \n     in stride. Aimee lived and loved well. She never harmed \n     anyone; in fact, Aimee rarely ever spoke ill of anyone. She \n     was almost too good to be true. On June 20, 1996, at age \n     twenty-two years and twelve days. Aimee was robbed of her \n     life, and our family was robbed of the joy and love and \n     innocent simplicity that were Aimee's special gift to us. We \n     will never be the same. There is an ache deep within each one \n     of us--and ache that cries out, ``Why God? Why?''\n       ``Just Do It'' was Aimee's motto. She never worried about \n     what she could not do well; she put her energy into doing \n     what she could do well. In athletics, Aimee took her God-\n     given talents and worked them to perfection. For college \n     Aimee accepted a scholarship to play soccer for George Mason \n     University in Fairfax, Virginia. In her sophomore year, she \n     joined the lacrosse team. A two sport Division 1 athlete, \n     Aimee was on her way to becoming a legend at George Mason \n     University. In the spring of 1996, the spring before she was \n     murdered, Aimee led her lacrosse conference, scoring fifty \n     goals with twenty-nine assists. In fact, 1995-96 was a banner \n     year for Aimee. She was named to the Colonial Athletic \n     Association All-Conference Team in both soccer and lacrosse, \n     and to the All-American team for the Southeast region in \n     lacrosse.\n       Aimee's athletic success is only part of her glory. Her \n     friends describe her as a quiet presence, a fun-loving kid, a \n     good listener, a loyal friend. They used words like shy, \n     modest, kind, strong, focused, intense, caring, sharing \n     and loving when they speak about Aimee. They tell of \n     Aimee's magic with people. So that you will understand the \n     impact her murder had on them, I want to share an excerpt \n     from a letter one of her friends wrote to me.\n       ``For the past few weeks my heart has been breaking for all \n     of us in our devastating loss, but more recently I think my \n     heart has been hurting a bit more for those who will never \n     get the chance to know the woman who played two Division 1 \n     sports, making the all-conference teams in both, and All-\n     American in one. They will never meet the girl who was always \n     being named `Athlete of the Week' and had no idea that she \n     was half the time. These people will never get the chance to \n     argue with her over things like Nike vs. Adidas, Bubblicious \n     vs. Bubble Yum, Coke vs. Cherry Coke, or whether certain \n     professional athletes were over-rated. I am one of the \n     fortunate ones. I have volumes of Aimee's memories. I know \n     the beauty of those big blue eyes under a low brim of a Nike \n     hat. I know the carefree serenity that gave birth to the \n     goofy laugh. I witnessed her grace with grit, her passion \n     with patience, her pride without arrogance, her speed without \n     exhaustion, and her sweat that was enough to start an ocean. \n     If I was given the opportunity to trade in all my present \n     pain in exchange for never being able to say, `Aimee was my \n     teammate; Aimee was my friend,' I'd stick with the pain. The \n     memory of her is so wonderful.''\n       It is impossible to adequately describe the impact of \n     Aimee's murder on the countless people who knew her and loved \n     her. We are all trying to survive the pain and emptiness of \n     this great loss. How often I turn to tell Aimee something \n     silly or dumb when I'm watching one of our favorite \n     television shows, or a basketball or football game, but she \n     isn't there. I'm out shopping and I say, ``Aimee would look \n     great in that outfit. I'll buy if for her.'' But Aimee will \n     never wear a\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\n     new outfit again. I will never have the joy of holding Aimee \n     in my arms again, or of seeing her sparkling blue eyes, \n     freckled nose and bright smile. I will never know the \n     children Aimee dreamed of having, or the children Aimee \n     dreamed of coaching.\n       I do have wonderful memories of Aimee. Her life was wrapped \n     in my love, and mine was wrapped in her love. Because of evil \n     incarnate in Arthur Bomar, I now also have horrible \n     nightmares of the fear, the absolute terror, Aimee must have \n     known, and of the dreadful pain she was forced to endure. I \n     who had been with Aimee in every facet of her life, every \n     event big and small, was not there to protect her from the \n     fear and the pain. I never had the chance to say good-bye. \n     This despicable individual had condemned me, my other two \n     children, the rest of our family and all of Aimee's friends \n     who live with an ache deep in our hearts. The void can never \n     be filled. The pain of the loss of Aimee is forever.\n       Aimee's life was ended on June 20, 1996, a night of total \n     madness. She was kidnaped from her own car, raped, and then \n     beaten to death--beaten so badly around the head and face \n     that she was identified by the Nike swoosh tattoo on her \n     ankle--beaten so badly that she had an empty heart when she \n     was found. Every pint of blood had spilled from her body. The \n     person who did this to Aimee is a convicted felon who was on \n     parole.\n       Arthur Bomar was released from Nevada's prison system after \n     serving only twelve years of a life sentence for murdering a \n     man. While he was awaiting trial for the murder charge, he \n     shot a woman. While he was in prison serving time for both \n     these crimes, he assaulted a woman who was visiting him \n     there. Despite all these violent crimes, and sentences \n     even beyond the life sentence, Nevada released him after \n     only twelve years. Did they think he was reformed? All \n     they had to do was read his record to know that he wasn't. \n     A reformed, contrite prisoner sentenced to life doesn't \n     beat up a woman visitor. But he was released by Nevada, \n     and he came to Pennsylvania and murdered my Aimee.\n       On October 1, 1998, Arthur Bomar was convicted of first \n     degree murder, kidnaping, rape and abuse of a corpse. After \n     the jury announced their decision for the death penalty, this \n     reformed felon from Nevada raised his hand with his middle \n     finger extended and shouted, ``F - - - you, Mrs. Willard, her \n     brother and her sister.''\n       This kidnapper, rapist and murderer should never have been \n     on the street in June of 1996. And Aimee Willard should be \n     teaching and coaching, living and loving, spreading her joy \n     among us. But she isn't. Her legacy will live on, however, in \n     scholarship funds, aid to those in need, and a beautiful \n     memorial garden on that lot in the ``badlands'' of North \n     Philadelphia. Her legacy will live on because of Aimee's Law, \n     the ``No Second Chances'' law proposed by Matt Salmon from \n     Arizona and co-sponsored by Curt Weldon from Pennsylvania and \n     many other Congressmen and Senators.\n       Our entire justice system, as I see it, cries out for \n     reform. Our system lacks real truth in sentencing. Life in \n     prison does not mean life. Murderers are returned to the \n     streets to murder again. Willful murderers do not deserve a \n     second chance. If ``Aimee's Law'' is passed in 2000, the \n     States will have strong incentive to reform their parole \n     systems and to keep predators in prison actually for life. If \n     not, they will risk a reduction of federal funds if their \n     paroled murderers cross state lines and commit another \n     violent crime.\n       I am asking you, the members of the Sub-Committee on Crime, \n     to support the passage of ``Aimee's Law'' if you want to stop \n     the nightmare or convicted murderers continuing to murder. If \n     this law is passed, our streets will be a little safer, some \n     families will be spared the heartache we have suffered, and \n     Aimee Willard's name, not the name of her killer, will be \n     remembered forever. Please remember that Aimee has no second \n     chance at life.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              Aimee's law\n\n       Protects Americans from convicted murders, rapists, and \n     child molesters by requiring states to pay the costs of \n     prosecution and incarceration for a previously convicted \n     criminal who travels to another state and commits a similar \n     violent crime. The payment would come from federal law \n     enforcement assistance funds chosen by the state. The \n     legislation is designed to keep violent criminals with high \n     recidivism rates in prison for most of their sentences \n     consistent with the principles of truth in sentencing. The \n     federal government needs to be involved to protect the \n     citizens of one state from inappropriate early releases of \n     another state such as occurred with Aimee Willard from the \n     Philadelphia area, a college senior, who was kidnapped and \n     brutally raped and murdered by a man who was released early \n     from prison in Nevada.

In conclusion, Madam President, I thank Senator \nBrownback for his great work and perseverance in bringing this crime-\nfighting package to the Senate to pass it and turn it into law quickly. \nAimee's law was debated and considered here in the Senate during this \nsession of Congress. It passed 81-17. It has passed the House with over \n400 votes. It is a provision that has very broad support. It is one of \nthe No. 1 legislative provisions that the victims rights organizations \nin America would like to see done.\n  This is a piece of legislation that targets three types of \noffenders--murderers, rapists, and sex offenders, child molesters in \nparticular. What this does is focus on those three because, obviously, \nthey are three of the most heinous crimes on the books, but they are \nalso crimes that have the highest incidence of repeat offenders, \nparticularly the sexual crimes.\n  Aimee's law is given that name for Aimee Willard. She was a college \nstudent outside of Philadelphia who was\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\nraped and murdered by Arthur Bomar. Arthur Bomar was released from a \nNevada prison after serving only a small fraction of his sentence for a \nsimilar crime. He was released, and within a few months he found his \nway to Philadelphia, where Aimee was out one evening. She was attacked, \nraped, and murdered. It was a case that sent shockwaves through \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania and the whole Delaware Valley. Aimee's \nmother, Gail, has been on a crusade since then to do something to make \nsure convicted rapists and murderers and other sex offenders serve \ntheir full sentences.\n  If you look at the sentences that are meted out for these crimes, it \nis somewhat chilling to realize that if you look at the sentences that \nare served for murder, for example, the average sentence for murder is \n8 years. The average sentence for rape is 5\\1/2\\ years. This is the \nactual time they serve, and the actual time served for a sex or child \nmolestation offense is 4 years.\n  We believe that you have a high incidence of recidivism in these \ncrimes, and people need to serve longer sentences so they are not a \nthreat to our communities. In fact, more than 14,000 murders, rapes, \nand sexual assaults on children are committed each year by felons who \nhad been released after serving a sentence on one of those very same \ncrimes. So 14,000 of these crimes are committed by people who have \ncommitted these crimes in the past, who were let go to commit a crime \nagain.\n  What we believe and what we have suggested is, frankly, very modest. \nIt is modest in the sense that it is, I argue, even for those 81 \nSenators who voted for this legislation the last time around--and some \nexpressed concern that this was going to be too tough on the States--\nnot as tough as it was before. We have changed it in ways that have \nmade it a little less onerous on States to have to keep up with these \nprovisions. We tightened the definitions more. We created flexibility \nfor the States for them to choose which funds they would use.\n  This is basically what this proposal does. It says if you release \nsomeone from prison who has not served 85 percent of their sentence, or \nhas served a sentence below the national average for the crimes that we \nenumerate, and that person goes out and commits a crime in another \nState, then the State in which the person has committed the second \ncrime--the released felon commits a second crime--then it has a right \nto go to the original State who let this person out early and seek \ncompensation for all the costs associated with the prosecution, \nconviction, and incarceration of that criminal.\n\n  That hardly seems like the overbearing Federal Government dictating \nto States how to run their criminal justice system. These are Federal \nfunds. States can choose which Federal funds they can allocate for this \npurpose. But what it says is we need to get tougher in having tougher \nsentences and making sure that those sentences, when given, are served.\n  I don't believe that is too much to ask for this Congress, and I very \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this measure, and recognize that \nif this measure is not supported this bill will be dead and will have \nto start over again in the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes. I want to \nrecognize the leadership of my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum, in this provision. This is something he fought for to put in \nthis overall package, to keep in this overall package, and it was \nsomething when we started down this road, frankly, I was saying I want \na little, clean, simple bill to deal with sex trafficking. And several \nMembers on the House side, and Senator Santorum on this side, fought to \nput this in.\n  The more I studied this, the consistency of the flow was there with \nthis. This is dealing with trying to protect people who have been \nsubject to domestic crimes, domestic violence, to protect people who \nhave been subject to trafficking and protect people who have been \nsubject to, frankly, early release and high recidivism offenders in \nother States, such as what happened, unfortunately, in his State in the \ncase of Aimee Willard.\n  I applaud my colleague's work. I note one other thing. Other \ncolleagues look at this and raise questions about does this really fit \nwithin the overall package, and one can make their decision one way or \nthe other. But the point is, if this is pulled out, the bill has to go \nback to the House. We don't have time, so it effectively kills the \nbill. The House has already voted 371-1 for this package. It is a \npackage and if this gets pulled out, it has to go back to the House. \nThe House is going out on Friday for a funeral of one of its Members. \nTomorrow, it has its calendar set up. It kills the bill, so everything \nelse gets killed as well, regardless of what the arguments are. I plead \nwith colleagues and say let's look at this and go ahead and support the \nentire package and not support the motion to strike the Aimee's law \nprovision.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, off whose time is the quorum call \ncharged?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the understanding of the Chair that, \nunder the previous order, all quorum calls are being charged today to \nboth sides equally.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I note for the record, as we put it in, it was charged \nagainst all sides equally because there are four people who have \nseparate allotted time. It should be allocated equally to all of those.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's understanding is correct. It \nwill be so allocated.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I note that we are planning on a vote \nat 4:30. Senator Thompson has the time reserved from 3:30 to 4:30. I \nnote for my colleagues that if anybody wishes to speak on this \nparticular bill, Senator Thompson has an entire hour reserved. Under \nthe unanimous consent order, we immediately go to both votes--the vote \non the appeal of the ruling of the Chair for Senator Thompson, and \nimmediately we will go to a vote on final passage of the conference \nreport.\n  If anybody seeks to speak on this bill, they should do so at the \npresent time because otherwise it will be allocated to Senator \nThompson.\n  I will use a couple of minutes of my time at this point. I note that \nwithin the bill there is the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that \nhas been spoken of by Senator Lautenberg and Senator Mack, which seeks \njustice for victims of terrorism that is taking place. That is in the \nbill. I think it is an important part of the legislation. I hope we \nwill have some discussion taking place on that as well.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time, if \nany, is under the control of the Senator from Delaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes 48 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask the ranking member whether or not he is willing to \nyield additional time if I need it?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the 6 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, what a difference a year makes. Last year, \nI came to the floor and indicated I thought in light of the resistance \ntaking place regarding the Violence Against Women Act and its \nreauthorization and the Violence Against Women II Act, it would be a \ntough fight to renew and strengthen the Violence Against Women Act. \nThanks to\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nthe help and support of a number of folks in and out of this Senate--\nfrom attorneys general in the various States, to police, to victims \nadvocates, doctors, nurses, Governors, women's groups--I am proud to \nsay we finally arrived at a point where the Violence Against Women Act \n2000 is on the verge of passing the Senate as part of the sex \ntrafficking conference report.\n  I thank particularly my good friend from Minnesota. Since he has \narrived in the Senate, he has been the single strongest supporter I \nhave had. Along with his wife, who is incredible, she has been the \nsingle most significant outside advocate for the Violence Against Women \nAct in everything that surrounds and involves it.\n  I dealt him a bit of advice. When I went to a conference on a bill he \nwas working very mightily for, along with our friend and Republican \ncolleague, the sex trafficking bill, which is a very important bill in \nand of itself--by itself it is important--if we were doing nothing else \nbut passing that legislation that he and Senator Brownback have worked \nso hard on, it would be a worthy day, a worthy endeavor for the Senate \nand the U.S. Government.\n  I realize people watching this on C-SPAN get confused when we use the \n``Senate speak.'' We talk of conferences and conference reports and \nvarious types of legislation. The bottom line is, I was part of that \nagreement where we sat down with House Members and Senate Members to \ntalk about the sex trafficking legislation. I didn't surprise him--I \ntold him ahead of time, but I am sure I created some concern--by \nattempting to add the Violence Against Women Act to that legislation. \nWe ultimately did.\n  It is the first time in the 28 years I have been in the Senate that I \nhave gone to a conference and added a major piece of legislation in \nthat conference, knowing that it might very well jeopardize the passage \nof the legislation we were discussing. And it is worthy legislation. I \nam a cosponsor. I can think of nothing--obviously, you would expect me \nto say that, being the author of this legislation--I can think of \nnothing of more consequence to the women of America and the children of \nAmerica than our continuing the fight--and I am sure my friend from \nMinnesota agrees with me--regarding violence against women.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for working so hard with me to pass this \nlegislation. This legislation was not a very popular idea on the other \nside of the aisle 8 years ago when we wrote this, and 6 years ago when \nwe got close to passing it, and 5 years ago when we passed it. Senator \nHatch stood up and led the way on the Republican side. And I thank my \nRepublican colleagues, about 25 of whom--maybe more now--cosponsored \nit. I attribute that to Senator Hatch's leadership, and I thank him for \nthat.\n\n  This legislation is very important. I will try as briefly as I can to \nstate why it is important.\n  First of all, it reauthorizes the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, \nreferred to as landmark legislation. I believe it is landmark \nlegislation. It is the beginning of the end of the attitude in America \nthat a woman is the possession of a man, that a woman is, in fact, \nsubject to a man's control even if that requires ``physical force.'' \nThis clearly states, and we stated it for the first time on record in \n1994, that no man has a right under any circumstance other than self-\ndefense to raise his hand to or to use any physical force against a \nwoman for any reason at all other than self-defense.\n  One might think: Big deal; we all knew that. No, we didn't all know \nthat. It has begun to shape societal attitudes. What has happened is \nthat we have seen a decline of 21 percent in the violent acts committed \nby significant others against their spouses and/or girlfriends and/or \nmate. That is a big deal. What happens if we don't pass this today? The \nViolence Against Women Act goes out of existence. It is no longer \nauthorized. So this is a big deal, a big, big deal.\n  No. 2, I promised when I wrote this legislation in 1994 that, after \nseeing it in operation, I would not be wedded to its continuation if it \nwasn't working, and that I would propose, along with others, things \nthat would enhance the legislation. That is, places where there were \ndeficiencies we would change the law and places where the law in place \nwas useless or counterproductive, we would eliminate that provision of \nthe law. We have kept that promise.\n  This legislation does a number of things. It makes improvements in \nwhat we call full faith and credit of enforcement orders. Simply \nstated, that means if a woman in the State of Maryland goes to court \nand says, ``This man is harassing me,'' or ``He has beaten me,'' or \n``He has hurt me,'' and the court says that man must stay away from \nthat woman and cannot get within a quarter mile--or whatever the \nrestriction is--and if he does, he will go to jail, that is a \nprotection order, a stay away order.\n  What happens in many cases when that woman crosses the line into the \nState of Delaware or into the State of Pennsylvania or into the \nDistrict of Columbia and that man follows her, the court in that \ndistrict does not enforce the stay away order from the other State for \na number of reasons: One, they don't have computers that they can \naccess and find out whether there is such an order; two, they are blase \nabout it; or three, they will not give full faith and credit to it.\n  This creates a development and enhancement of data collection and \nsharing system to promote tracking and enforcement of these orders. Big \ndeal.\n\n  Second, transition housing. This is a change. We have found that we \nhave provided housing for thousands and thousands and thousands of \nwomen who have gotten themselves into a dilemma where they are \nvictimized but have no place to go. So we, all of us in the Congress, \nhave provided moneys for building credible and decent and clean \nshelters, homes for women where they can bring their children.\n  I might note parenthetically the majority of children who are \nhomeless, on the street, are there because their mothers are the victim \nof abuse and have no place to go. So they end up on the street. We are \nrectifying that.\n  We found out there is a problem. There is a problem because there are \nmore people trying to get into this emergency housing and there is no \nplace for some of these women to go between the emergency housing--and \nthey can't go back to their homes--and having decent housing. So we \nprovide for a transition, some money for transition housing. In the \ninterest of time, I will not go into detail about it.\n  Third, we change what we call incorporating dating violence into the \npurposes that this act covers, where there is a pro-arrest policy, \nwhere there are child abuse enforcement grants, et cetera. The way the \nlaw was written the first time, an unintended consequence of what I did \nwhen I wrote the law is, a woman ended up having to have an extended \nrelationship with the man who was victimizing her in order to qualify \nfor these services. That is an oversimplification, but that is the \nessence. If a woman was a victim of date rape, the first or second time \nshe went out with a man of whom she was a victim, she did not qualify \nunder the law for those purposes. Now that person would qualify.\n  We also provide legal assistance for victims of domestic violence and \nsexual harassment. We set aside some of the money in the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, hopefully through the trust fund which, hopefully, \nthe Presiding Officer will insist on being part of this. We provide for \nwomen getting help through that system. We provide for safe havens for \nchildren, pilot programs.\n  As my friend from Minnesota knows, most of the time when a woman gets \nshot or killed in a domestic exchange, it is when she is literally \ndropping off a child at the end of the weekend. That is when the \nviolence occurs. So we provide the ability for the child to be dropped \noff in a safe place, under supervised care--the father leaves, and then \nthe mother comes and picks the child up and regains custody--because we \nfind simple, little things make big, giant differences in safety for \nwomen. This also provides pilot programs relating to visitation and \nexchange.\n  We put in protective orders for the protection of disabled women from \ndomestic violence. Also, the role of the court in combating violence \nagainst women engages State courts in fighting violence by setting \naside funds in one of the grant programs.\n  And we provided a domestic violence task force. We also provide \nstandards, practices, and training for sexual forensic examinations \nwhich we have\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\nbeen doing in my State, and other States have done, but nationwide they \nare not being done. So much loss of potential evidence is found when \nthe woman comes back into court because they did not collect the \nnecessary evidence at the time the abuse took place.\n  Also, maybe the single most important provision we add to the \nViolence Against Women Act is the battered immigrant women provision. \nThis strengthens and refines the protections for battered immigrant \nwomen in the original act and eliminates the unintended consequence of \nsubsequent charges in immigration law to ensure that abused women \nliving in the United States with immigrant victims are brought to \njustice and the battered immigrants also escape abuse without being \nsubject to other penalties.\n  There is much more to say.\n  We have worked hard together over the past year to produce a strong, \nbipartisan bill that has gained the overwhelming support of the \nSenate--with a total of 74 cosponsors. All of my Democratic colleagues \nare cosponsors, along with 28 of my Republican friends.\n  Passage of this bill today would not have been possible without the \neffort and commitment of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my \nfriend Orrin Hatch, who has dedicated years to addressing the scourge \nof violence against women.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to thank our committee's ranking \nmember, Senator Leahy, for his constant support of my efforts to bring \nthis bill to a vote, and my friends in the House, Representatives John \nConyers, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, and Connie \nMorella, for their leadership on this important legislation.\n  The need for this law is as clear today as it was more than a decade \nago when I first focused on the problem of domestic violence and sexual \nassault.\n  Consider this: In my state of Delaware, I regret to report that more \nthan 30 women and children have been killed in domestic violence-\nrelated homicides in the past three years.\n  No area or income-bracket has escaped this violence. To stop domestic \nviolence beatings from escalating into violent deaths, more than one \nthousand police officers throughout Delaware--in large cities and \nsmall, rural towns alike--have received specialized training to deal \nwith such cases.\n  Every State in this country now has similar police training, and the \nViolence Against Women Act is providing the necessary funding.\n  To ensure these officers collect evidence that will stand up in \ncourt, they are being armed with state-of-the-art instant cameras and \nvideo cameras.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is providing the necessary funding for \nthese cameras--nationwide.\n  The National Domestic Violence Hotline handles 13,000 calls from \nvictims per month and has fielded over half a million calls since its \ninception. The Violence Against Women Act is providing the necessary \nfunding.\n  We are also working hard to create an army of attorneys nationwide \nwho have volunteered to provide free legal services to victims--from \nfiling a protection order, to divorce and custody matters. But many, \nmany more women need legal assistance. The Violence Against Women Act \nof 2000, which is before us today, authorizes and provides the \nnecessary funding to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, and \nsexual assault obtain legal assistance at little to no cost.\n  Don't take my word for the need for this legislation. You have heard \nfrom folks in your states. Listen to their stories and the programs \nthey've put into place over the past five years since we passed the \nViolence Against Women Act in 1994--with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Unless we act now--and renew our commitment to stopping violence \nagainst women and children--our efforts and successes over the past \nfive years will come to a screeching halt. The Violence Against Women \nAct expired September 30.\n  If the funding dries up--make no mistake--the number of domestic \nviolence cases and the number of women killed by their husbands or \nboyfriends who profess to ``love'' them--will increase.\n  Domestic violence has been on a steady decline in recent years. U.S. \nDepartment of Justice statistics show a 21 percent drop since 1993.\n  Why?\n  From Alabama to Alaska--New Hampshire to New Mexico--Michigan to \nMaine--California to Kentucky--Delaware to Utah--police, prosecutors, \njudges, victims' advocates, hospitals, corporations, and attorneys are \nproviding a seamless network of ``coordinated response teams'' to \nprovide victims and their children the services they need to escape the \nviolence--and stay alive.\n  In National City, California, family violence response team \ncounselors go directly to the scenes of domestic violence cases with \npolice.\n  Violence Against Women Act funds have facilitated changes from \nsimple, common sense reforms--such as standardized police reporting \nforms to document the abuse . . . to more innovative programs, such as \nthe Tri-State Domestic Violence Project involving North Dakota, \nMontana, and Wyoming. This project includes getting the word out to \neveryone from clergy to hairdressers to teachers--anyone who is likely \nto come into contact with a domestic violence victims--so that they can \ndirect victims to needed housing, legal, and medical services. And the \nservices and protections are offered across State lines.\n  Such coordinated projects have different names in different States--\nin Oregon, they have domestic violence intervention teams.\n  In Vermont they have ``PAVE.'' The Project Against Violent \nEncounters.\n  Washington State has developed ``Project SAFER''--which links \nattorneys with victims at battered women shelters to ``Stop Abuse and \nFear by Exercising Rights.''\n  In Washington, D.C. they formed Women Empowered Against Violence--\nknown as WEAVE--which provides a total package for victims, from legal \nassistance to counseling to case management through the courts.\n  Utah has developed the ``CAUSE'' project, or the Coalition of \nAdvocates for Utah Survivors' Empowerment. It is a statewide, nonprofit \norganization that has created a system of community support for sexual \nassault survivors.\n  In Kansas, they've funded a program called ``Circuit Riders,'' who \nare advocates and attorneys who travel to rural parts of the State to \nfill the gaps in service.\n  Different names for these programs but the same funding source and \ninspiration--the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Experience with the act has also shown us that we need to strengthen \nenforcement of protection from abuse orders across state lines.\n  Candidly, a protection from abuse order is just one part of the \nsolution. A piece of paper will not stop a determined abuser with a \nfist, knife, or gun.\n  But look at what states like New York and Georgia are doing to make \nit easier--and less intimidating--for women to file for a protection \nfrom abuse order.\n  They have implemented a completely confidential system for a victim \nto file for a protection from abuse order without ever having to walk \ninto a courtroom.\n  It is all on-line over the internet. After the victim answers a \nseries of questions and describes the abuse, the information is deleted \nonce transmitted to the court--with no information stored \nelectronically.\n  This project is part of specialized domestic violence courts \nestablished in many states--where one judge handles the entire case--\nfrom protection orders, to divorce, custody, and probation issues.\n  The Center for Court Innovation is working with the New York courts \nto develop customized computer technology that will link the courts, \npolice, probation officers, and social service agencies--so that \neveryone is on the same page, and knows exactly what's happening with a \ndomestic violence case.\n  We need to take this technology nationwide. And the Violence Against \nWomen Act of 2000 before us today will provide funding to states for \nsuch technology. and not all our solutions are high-tech.\n  To help victims enforce protection orders, states and cities across \nthis country have teamed up with the cellular phone industry to arm \nvictims with cell phones.\n  In my state of Delaware, I spearheaded a drive to collect two \nthousand\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\nused cell phones, so that every person with a protection from abuse \norder can get a cell phone programmed to automatically dial 9-1-1 if \nthe abuser shows up at her house, place of work, at the school yard \nwhen she picks up her child, the bus stop or the grocery store.\n  Commonsense solutions--all sparked by the Violence Against Women Act \nthis body passed overwhelmingly in 1994.\n  Again, listen to the voices of victims we have helped.\n  Phyllis Lee from Tennessee says she is alive today thanks to the \nbattered women shelter in Dayton. Without it, she is certain her \nabusive husband would have killed her with his violent beatings. After \nenduring 17 years of torturous abuse, including severe beatings to her \nhead and body, rape, and the withholding of needed medical care, \nPhyllis finally escaped.\n  After a particularly severe beating, she hid in the woods for 20 \nhours, paralyzed with fear that her husband would find her. She crawled \nto a nearby farmhouse and asked for help.\n  With the help of the woman who lived there, she contacted Battered \nWomen, Inc.--an organization that assists victims of domestic violence. \nThis program, which includes a hotline, counselors, and a shelter, is \nheavily funded by the Violence Against Women Act. It provided a way out \nfor Phyllis and her children, whose lives were in grave danger.\n  Battered Women, Inc. also helped Phyllis get her GED and she is now \nworking as an advocate for other battered women. She says that without \nthis program, she never would have known that the option to live \nwithout abuse existed.\n  States with large Indian reservations--such as California and \nNevada--have formed Inter-Tribal Councils so that Native American women \nno longer have to suffer in silence at the hands of their violent \nabusers. One victim in California writes:\n\n       If it were not for the Inter-Tribal Council's efforts, I \n     would be dead, homeless or living in my car, with my children \n     hungry.\n\n  In California, the Inter-Tribal Council has reached out to Native \nAmerican communities to establish the ``Stop and Take Responsibility'' \nprogram.\n  First, and foremost, this program is about education--educating \nNative American men that hitting your spouse is a serious crime, and \neducating mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters--that no man has a \nright to lay a hand on them.\n  This past May, the shooting of Barry Grunnow, an English teacher in \nLake Worth, Florida--by a seventh grade honor roll student named \nNathaniel Brazil--shocked the nation.\n  Recently, Lake Worth police released reports showing a history of \ndomestic violence in the Brazil home.\n  As the Palm Beach Post wrote recently in an editorial--\n\n       While violence in the home can hardly be directly blamed \n     for the tragic shooting . . . this case does demonstrate the \n     way in which domestic violence affects society at large, how \n     violence in the home increased the likelihood for violence in \n     the surrounding community. It is about time that we push for \n     bipartisan Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization in \n     Congress to combat domestic violence and its horrible \n     consequences.\n\n  And if any of you doubt the link between children growing up in a \nhome watching their mother get the living hell beat out of her--and \nthat child growing up to be violent as well, consider this recent case \ntwo months ago in San Diego.\n  A prosecutor was in her office, interviewing a mother who was \npressing charges against her husband after suffering years of abuse. As \nthe questioning stretched on, the woman's 8-year-old son grew restless.\n  Just as little kids do--the boy tugged at his mother's sleeve, \nsaying, ``Let's go. I'm hungry . . . can we leave yet.''\n  He became even more agitated and said: ``Come on, Mom, I want to \ngo.''\n  Finally, the 8-year-old boy shouted: ``I'm talking to you?'' Then, he \ncurled up his fist and punched her.\n  Now, where did he learn that?\n  That prosecutor not only had a victim in her office. She had a future \ndomestic violence abuser.\n  But states are not giving up on these kids. For example, in Pasco \nCounty, Florida the Sheriff's Office has developed a special program \njust to focus on the children in homes with domestic violence.\n  It's called KIDS, which stands for Kids in Domestic Situations. The \nsheriff hired four new detectives, a supervisor, and a clerk. They \nreview every domestic violence call to see if a child lives in the \nhome. They are specially trained to interview that child and get him or \nher the needed counseling--to break the cycle of violence.\n  Unfortunately, the abuse does not stop for women once they are \ndivorced--particularly when the father uses the children to continue \nthe harassment. All too often, Kids caught in the crossfire of a \ndivorce and custody battle need safe havens.\n  One woman in Colorado had to confront her former husband and abuser \nat her son's soccer games--to exchange custody for the weekend. She had \nto endure continued mental and emotional abuse, putting herself in \nphysical harms-way. Finally a visitation center opened. Now she drops \noff her son into the hands of trained staff in a secure environment.\n  In Hawaii, Violence Against Women Act funding has allowed officials \nto open three new visitation centers in the island's most rural \ncounties.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 adds new funding for safe \nhavens for children to provide supervised visitation and safe \nvisitation exchange in situations involving domestic violence, child \nabuse, sexual assault, or stalking.\n  Of course, there are also the battered women's shelters. Over the \npast five years, every State in this country has received funding to \nopen new and expand existing shelters. Two thousand shelters in this \ncountry now benefit from this funding.\n  In my State of Delaware we have increased the number of shelters from \ntwo to five, including one solely for Hispanic women.\n  For as much as we've done, so much more is needed. Our bipartisan \nBiden-Hatch bill increases funding for tens of thousands of more \nshelter beds. It also establishes transitional housing services to help \nvictims move from shelters back into the community.\n  And let's not forget the plight of battered immigrant women, caught \nbetween their desperate desire to flee their abusers and their \ndesperate desire to remain in the United States. A young Mexican woman \nwho married her husband at the age of 16 and moved to the United States \nsuffered years of physical abuse and rape--she was literally locked in \nher own home like a prisoner. Her husband threatened deportation if she \never told police or left the house. When she finally escaped to the \nHouston Area Women's Center in Texas, she was near death.\n  That shelter gave her a safe place to live, and provided her the \nlegal services she needed to become a citizens and get a divorce.\n  Our bipartisan bill expands upon the protections for battered \nimmigrant women.\n  Thanks to nurses and emergency room doctors across this country--we \nhave made great strides in helping victims who show up at the emergency \nroom, claiming they ran into a door or fell down the stairs.\n  The Kentucky General Assembly has made it mandatory for health \nprofessionals in emergency rooms to receive three hours of domestic \nviolence training.\n  The National Hospital Accreditation Board is encouraging all \nhospitals to follow Kentucky's lead.\n  The SANE program, sexual assault nurse examiners, are truly angels to \nvictims. They are specially trained to work with police to collect \nneeded evidence in a way that is sensitive and comforting to victims.\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 facilitates these efforts by \nensuring that STOP grants can be used for training on how to conduct \nrape exams and how to collect, preserve, and analyze the evidence for \ntrial.\n  Finally, I am very pleased to report, this legislation expands grants \nunder the Violence Against Women Act to states, local governments, \ntribal governments, and universities to cover violence that arises in \ndating relationships. Hopefully, this important change will help \nprevent tragedies like the death of Cassie Diehl, a 17-year-old high \nschool senior from Idaho, killed by a boyfriend who left her for dead \nafter the truck he was driving plunged 400 feet of a mountain road.\n  What is especially tragic about this story is the great lengths to \nwhich Cassie's parents went, before her death,\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\nto seek help from local law enforcement agencies and local prosecutors \nin putting an end to the boyfriend's constant abuse of their child, \neven seeking a protection order from a judge. All of these efforts \nfailed because Cassie was a teenager involved in an abusive dating \nrelationship. Law enforcement officials believed that because Cassie \nwas a 17-year-old high school student living at home she could not be \nabused by a boyfriend, that she was not entitled to protection under \nthe law.\n  The legislation we will vote on today will help avoid future horror \nstories like Cassie's by providing training for law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors to better identify and respond to violence \nthat arises in dating relationships and by expanding victim services \nprograms to reach these frequently young victims.\n  Thanks in part to the landmark law we passed in 1994, violence \nagainst women is no longer regarded as a private misfortune, but is \nrecognized as the serious crime and public disgrace that it is. We have \nmade great strides to putting an end to the days when victims are \nvictimized twice--first by their abuser, then by the emergency response \nand criminal justice systems. We are making headway.\n  I have given you plenty of examples, but there are hundreds more.\n  In addition to the battered women's shelters, the STOP grants, the \nNational Domestic Violence Hotline, and other grant programs I have \nmentioned, the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act of 2000 \nreauthorizes for five years the Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic \nViolence and Child Abuse Enforcement grants, campus grants, the rape \nprevention and education grant program, and three victims of child \nabuse programs, including the court-appointed special advocate program \n(CASA).\n  So, let us act now to pass the Biden-Hatch bill.\n  There is one thing missing, I must point out, from this legislation. \nUnfortunately, the conference report does not extend the Violent Crime \nReduction Trust Fund that would guarantee the funding for another five \nyears--so that these innovative, effective projects can continue.\n  I believe that extending the trust fund is critical. Remember, none \nof this costs a single dime in new taxes. It's all paid for by reducing \nthe federal government by some 300,000 employees. The paycheck that was \ngoing to a bureaucrat is now going into the trust fund. So I will \ncontinue to work to extend the trust fund to ensure that these programs \nactually receive the funding we have authorized.\n  Let me just close by saying that it has been a tough fight over the \npast 22 months to get my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to focus \non the need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. But we have \nfinally done it.\n  I greatly appreciate the support, daily phone calls, letters, and e-\nmails of so many groups--who are the real reason we have been able to \nget this done this year. The National Association of Attorneys General, \nevery law enforcement organization, all the many women's groups, the \nNational and 50 individual State Coalitions Against Domestic Violence, \nthe American Medical Association, the National Governors Association, \nnurses, the list goes on and on--more than 150 groups total.\n  If you'll allow me one more point of personal privilege, this act--\nthe Violence Against Women Act--is my single greatest legislative \naccomplishment in my nearly 28 years in the United States Senate.\n  Why? Because just from the few examples provided above--it's having a \nreal impact in the lives of tens of thousands of women and children. \nYou see it and hear the stories when you're back home.\n  So let us today pass the bipartisan Biden-Hatch Violence Against \nWomen Act now, and renew our national commitment to end domestic \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, I am happy now to yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. May I have 30 seconds of the time I yielded to the \nSenator?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will speak more on this in another venue, but I think it \nis safe to say VAWA would not be voted on today had it not been for the \npersistence of the Senator from Delaware. That persistence is something \nthe public has not seen as much as those of us who have been in private \nmeetings with him, where his muscle really counted. We would not have \nthis vote today, and I suspect it will be an overwhelmingly supportive \nvote--that vote would not have been today were it not for the total and \ncomplete persistence of the Senator from Delaware, just as the vote on \nsex trafficking is to the credit of the Senators from Kansas and \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that. The \nbeginning of my comments was a polite way of apologizing for my being \nso persistent. I have been here 28 years. I have never threatened a \nfilibuster. I have never threatened to hold up legislation. I have \nnever once stopped the business on the floor--not that that is not \nevery Senator's right. I have never done that. I care so much about \nthis legislation that I was prepared to do whatever it would take. I \napologize for being so pushy about it. But there is nothing I have done \nin 28 years that I feel more strongly about than this. I apologize to \nmy friends for my being so persistent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know my colleague, Senator Brownback, wants to speak \nas well. Let me thank Senator Biden for his great leadership as well. \nWe are very proud we were able to work this out and do trafficking and \nthe reauthorization for the Violence Against Women Act together. Let me \nthank him for safe visas. He was kind enough to mention my wife Sheila. \nThat was really an initiative on which she has been working. I was so \npleased to see that in this bill.\n  Let me also say to my colleague, as much as I appreciate the work of \nthe Senator from Tennessee, I want to make the point that this is not \nabout the rule 28 scope of conference. I think the Chair will rule \nagainst my colleague from Tennessee. I think the Chair will rule \nagainst him with justification.\n  Most importantly, I want colleagues to know the majority of you voted \nfor Aimee's law. I voted against it. But if the Senator from Tennessee \nshould succeed--I know this is not his intention--that is the end of \nthis conference report, that is the end of this legislation on \ntrafficking, that is the end of reauthorization of VAWA, and it would \nbe a tragic, terrible mistake.\n  I hope colleagues will continue to support it. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I note the hour of 3:30 approaches. \nSenator Thompson has a lot of time.\n  If we are able to pass this legislation today, we still have a hurdle \nleft to go. This is a major victory for women and children subject to \nviolence here and abroad. This is a major piece of legislation for us \nto be able to pass through this body. It is late in the session. We are \nalready past the time scheduled for adjournment. To be able to get this \nlegislation passed at this time is a significant accomplishment. The \nSenator from Delaware pushed aggressively and hard on VAWA, as a number \nof people did on other items.\n  This is a good day, a great day for the Senate to stand up and do \nsome of the best work we can to protect those who are the least \nprotected in our society, to speak out for those who are the least \nprotected here and around the world.\n  This is a great day for this country, and it is a great day for this \nbody.\n  I am pleased we are wrapping up this portion of the debate. I think \nwe have had a good discussion. We will have the vote on the appealing \nof the point of order by the Chair. I plead with my colleagues, with \nall due respect to my colleague from Tennessee, to vote against my \ncolleague from Tennessee so we can proceed to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I have 20 seconds, with the \nindulgence of my colleague from Tennessee, I thank Senator Brownback \nagain. I also thank a whole lot of people, a whole lot of human rights \norganizations, women's organizations, grassroots organizations, \nreligious organizations, who have been there for the bill, \norganizations of others who have really worked hard for reauthorization \nof the Violence Against Women Act. Thank you for your grassroots work.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTennessee is recognized to make a point of order against the conference \nreport. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the \nconferees included matters not in the jurisdiction of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. I am referring specifically to Aimee's law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's point of order is not well \ntaken.\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 1 hour of debate. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the manner in which this has \nbeen handled and the opportunity this affords me to make the statement \nI am going to make today.\n  This is an objection to the conference report. There are many good \nthings in this conference report. Unfortunately, Aimee's law is a part \nof it. I prefer to have the consideration of that independently, \nseparate and apart from the conference report, but that is not to be.\n  Historically, of course, Aimee's law did pass as a part of a much \nlarger bill, the juvenile justice bill, some time ago but was never \nsigned into law. When I voiced my objection to it at that point, it was \nput into this conference report. I cannot let it go without raising my \nobjection to something that I think has to do with an important \nprinciple.\n  It is very unfortunate, when we have tragic circumstances that happen \nin this country, such as young people being killed, all the violence \nand abuse that goes on in this country, we take that and use the \nemotionalism from it to make bad law.\n  I do not think anybody within the sound of my voice can accuse me of \nbeing soft on crime. I ran in 1994 on that issue. I ran again in 1996 \non that issue. My position is clear. But my position is also clear that \nwe are continuing the trend toward the centralization of decisionmaking \nin this country. In other words, if we do not like what a State is \ndoing with regard to its criminal laws, we tend to find a way around \nit.\n  I do not like the idea that some States let prisoners out sooner than \nthey should, but if we really do not like that and we really do not \nhave any concerns about taking over the criminal jurisdiction in this \ncountry, things that have been under the purview of States for 200 \nyears, why don't we just pass a Federal law using the commerce clause \nand state that it affects interstate commerce?\n  Perhaps the Supreme Court will allow it; maybe they will not. Why \ndon't we just pass a Federal law on murder? Why don't we just have a \nFederal law that says anyone convicted of murder has to serve so much \ntime and just get on with it? Even the people pushing things such as \nAimee's law apparently recognize there is a principle that causes us \nproblems, and that is, we are set up with a Federal system.\n  Every kid learns in school that we have a system of checks and \nbalances, one branch against another, also Federal versus State and \nlocal law. It is a diffusion of power. It is time honored. It is in the \nConstitution. It is in the 10th amendment. Some things the States do \nand some things the Federal Government does.\n  If we do not believe in that anymore, if we are going to say every \ntime there is some tragic circumstance, such as the drive-by shootings \nin 1992--we federalized the crime of drive-by shootings. In 1997, there \nwas not one Federal prosecution for drive-by shootings, but yet it was \nin the headlines, and we could not help ourselves because we wanted to \nexpress our outrage at this crime that was being taken care of at the \nState level.\n  No one has ever accused these States with high-profile crimes of not \njumping in and taking care of the situation, sometimes imposing the \ndeath penalty. You cannot do much more than that. Yet we feel the \nnecessity to pass Federal laws that will ultimately create a Federal \npolice force to do things we have left to the purview of the States for \n200 years. That is a serious matter.\n  Nobody wants to vote against something called Aimee's law as a result \nof a tragedy of some young woman getting killed, for goodness' sake. \nUnfortunately, it happens all across this country all the time. But we \nhave greater responsibilities when we take the oath of the office we \nhold. We are supposed to uphold the Constitution. Is the relationship \nbetween the State and Federal Government the one we studied in school, \nthe one the courts tell us is still in effect, and, more fundamentally, \ndo we need States anymore? States do not behave the way we want them to \nsometimes. States do not do what the Federal Government wants them to \ndo. States do different things.\n  People in Tennessee might not look at something exactly the same way \npeople in New York might look at it. People in New York might not look \nat something the same way people in California do. We have certain \nbasic things on which we agree in our Federal Constitution, but the \nFounding Fathers gave us leeway to experiment.\n  Nobody I know of inside Washington, DC, has the answers to all these \nproblems. We all have the same motivation: No one wants crime, no one \nwants these terrible tragedies, but we certainly do not have a monopoly \non what to do about it. That is why we have States to experiment, to do \ndifferent things.\n  Too often, under the glare of the headlines, we want one solution; we \nwant one answer; we want one Federal answer with our name on the \nlegislation so we ``did something'' about some tragic murder that \nhappened in one of the States, which is prosecuted by the State and the \nperson has long been sent to the penitentiary or death row.\n  We need to concentrate on the fact that we do not seem to think we \nneed the States anymore. We had this fundamental disagreement at the \nfounding of our country between Jefferson and Hamilton. Hamilton wanted \na strong Federal Government, we all remember from our schooldays. \nJefferson said: No, that is too much centralization of power; remember \nwhat happened to us earlier in our history. We need to diffuse that \npower, and the States need certain rights, so we need to balance that \nout.\n  One of my House colleagues said: The problem with Congress is we are \nJeffersonians on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and Hamiltonians on \nTuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. We give lipservice to the \nproposition of limited Government, decentralization, giving more power \nback to the States, getting things out of Washington. We all run on \nthat platform, and as soon as we get here, we can't wait to pass some \nsweeping Federal law that, in many cases, supersedes State law and the \ndifferent ways States have chosen to handle a different problem.\n\n  We preempt State law. We pass Federal laws all the time. The \nConstitution allows us, under the supremacy clause, to do that. We will \nnot even say when we are preempting. The courts have to decide that. We \npass laws all the time, and the courts have to take a look at them \nlater on to decide to what extent we are preempting State laws, and so \nwe strike down those State laws.\n  We continue to criminalize State law. Five percent of the criminal \nprosecutions in this country are Federal. Yet last year there were over \n1,000 pieces of legislation introduced in this Congress having to do \nwith criminal law. It clogs the courts. Justice Rehnquist on a regular \nbasis comes over here and pleads with us to stop this: You are not \ndoing anything for law enforcement--he tells us--by trying to \ncriminalize everything at the Federal level that is already covered at \nthe State level; you are clogging the courts.\n  The Judicial Conference reports to us from time to time: You are \nclogging the courts with all this stuff that should not be in Federal \ncourt; the States are already taking care of that. Nobody is claiming \nthey are not. So for the same offense, we have this array of State laws \nand this array of criminal laws, and the prosecutor can use that \nagainst a defendant however he might choose. It is not something that \nwill enhance our system of justice but something that only enhances our \nown stature when we believe we are able to say we passed some tough \ncriminal law. We are doing more to harm criminal justice by doing this \nthan we are doing to help it.\n\n  My favorite last year was the legislation that was considered in \nCongress to prohibit videos of animal abuse using stiletto heels. That \nis not a joke. Unfortunately, we have bills such as that introduced in \nCongress all the time.\n  We, from time to time, try to get around the commerce clause. We want \nto federalize things, such as guns in schools. Every State in the Union \nhas a tough law they deal with in their own way as to what to do about \na terrible problem--guns in schools. We get no\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nheadlines out of that, so we had a Federal law to which the Supreme \nCourt said: No, that does not affect interstate commerce. Then we just \ntry to basically directly force States to enforce Federal laws and \nregulations that we make--background checks for guns, when judges \nshould retire, Federal regulations. Finally, the Supreme Court said: \nNo, we cannot do that. The 10th amendment prohibits us from doing that. \nSo we have a steady array of our attempting to figure out ways in and \naround the Constitution in order to impose our will because ``we know \nbest.''\n  The latest, of course, now is the use of the spending clause. The \ncourts have said, basically, if Congress sends the money, they have the \nright to attach strings. States blithely go along many times--not all \nthe time, but many times. Oftentimes they accept that free Federal \nmoney and learn that they are getting 7 percent of their money for \ntheir problem and 75 percent of the regulations and redtape, the \nrequirements that go along with it.\n  So this is the context in which we find ourselves when we consider \nAimee's law. This is all just a little bit of history we have been \ndealing with to which not many people pay much attention. But it has to \ndo with our basic constitutional structure. It has to do with the \nfundamental question in this country and, I think, our fundamental job; \nthat is, What should the Federal Government do, or what should \nGovernment do, and at what level should Government do it? What is more \nfundamental than that? What is more important than that, as we hastily \npass out and introduce these thousands of bills up here? If they sound \ngood, do it--all the while eroding a basic constitutional principle \nthat we all claim we believe in.\n  So this Aimee's law came about because of another tragic set of \ncircumstances. We have seen them: The dragging death in Texas, the \ndrive-by shooting case in 1992, the situation that produced Aimee's \nlaw. There is always something in the headlines of a tragic nature in \ncriminal law.\n  Under Aimee's law, if Tennessee, for example, tries somebody--let's \nsay for murder or rape--and convicts them, and that person serves their \nsentence under State law, under Tennessee law, and then they are \nreleased, and that person goes to Kentucky and commits another similar \ncriminal offense, here is where the Federal Government comes into play. \nThe Attorney General does this calculation and says, basically, that \nunless Tennessee's law under which this guy was convicted provides for \nthe average term of imprisonment of all the States--you look at all the \nStates and say: What is the average term of imprisonment for murder?--\nif Tennessee has a little less than the average of all the other \nStates, and he goes to Kentucky and kills somebody else, then Tennessee \nhas to pay Kentucky to apprehend the guy, to try the guy, and to \nincarcerate him for however long Kentucky wants to incarcerate him.\n\n  That is basically what Aimee's law is. So this is moving the ball a \nlittle bit farther down the road for those who want Washington to \ndecide all the criminal laws in this country.\n  Here we have a standard not that Congress has set. A lot of times we \nwill say: We want everybody on the highways to be driving under the old \n.08 rule because we believe that ought to be the intoxication limit. We \nare going to withhold funds if you don't. It is a Federal standard. You \ncan argue with it or you can agree with it.\n  But that is not what we have here. This is not a standard that \nCongress has had hearings on and has determined that Tennessee has to \nlive up to. It is a standard that is based upon a calculation of what \nthe average is among all the other States.\n  What if Tennessee looks at it a little differently? They ought to \nhave the right to have a little more stringent laws or a little more \nlenient laws. They have the people of Tennessee to answer to. They have \ntheir own legislature. They have their own Governor. These are things \nthat Tennessee has been deciding for 200 years. If they do not do what \nthe average of other States do, when it is totally within their \nprerogative, should they be penalized?\n  There are several problems with this law. Some of them are \nconstitutional because it has ex post facto concerns. I do not know, \nfor example, in reading this law, whether it intends to apply to people \nwho have already been sentenced or whether it applies to people who \nwill be sentenced after this law comes into effect.\n  I wish one or any of the sponsors of this bill would come to the \nfloor and tell us whether or not the intent of this law is to have this \nlaw apply to people who have already been sentenced maybe 5 years ago, \nmaybe 10 years ago. If so, then what can a State do about that to avoid \nbeing penalized the way I just described?\n  Secondly, if a person is still serving time, and the State knows it \nis going to be penalized if he is released under the State law because \nother States might have a little more stringent law, what is going to \nhappen next time that person comes up to the parole board? Are they \ngoing to be looking at it objectively?\n  Or, better still, the question is, to the sponsors of this \nlegislation: What about people who have already been convicted and \nalready served their time and have been out of jail now for 15, 20 \nyears, and they go to Kentucky and kill somebody else? Does this apply \nto them? If that is the case, there are thousands and thousands and \nthousands of people in every State who have been convicted of crimes \nand are now out of jail and going to other States. Are we going to go \nback and calculate what the average law provided for incarceration for \nall of those people? I think it is silent.\n  If the intent is, in fact, to catch all of those people and, if they \ndo something else, have this law apply, it has ex post facto \nramifications with regard to the State. You are not doing anything to \nthe individual, but you are forcing the State to either lose money or \nto try to extend the time these people stay in jail.\n  Can you imagine the litigation you are going to have with regard to \nthese parole board hearings, when a person apparently looks as though \nhe is eligible for parole, but the parole board has discretion, and \nthey know if they release this person, he is going to be one of these \npeople caught under the law? Can you imagine the litigation that is \ngoing to come about as a result?\n  If, on the other hand, it is not meant to be ex post facto, if, in \nfact, this law only applies to those who are convicted of crimes after \nthe effective date of this law, then this law is going to be a nullity \nfor the most part, I imagine, for many years, if people serve out terms \nin prison for horrendous crimes.\n  I would like to know, seriously, what the intention of the law is \nbecause it is not clear from the legislation itself. As Fred Ansell has \nsaid:\n\n       If it applies retroactively, then the law could apply \n     retroactively in different ways. It could mean that the law \n     applies only if an offender is released from a State after \n     2002 after having served a less than average sentence, and \n     then commits a crime. Or it could even mean that a person \n     commits a crime as early as January 1, 2002, who was released \n     from prison many years ago.\n       If the State is liable for what an already-released \n     offender does in the future, and it accepts the Federal funds \n     with these conditions, then the State has agreed to accept an \n     unlimited future liability. It will be liable for the crimes \n     that thousands of offenders might commit, as measured by the \n     costs of apprehension, prosecution, and incarceration. This \n     is not losing 5 percent of transportation funds for not \n     enacting a 21-year-old drinking age, as was upheld in South \n     Dakota v. Dole. This is where Federal ``pressure turns into \n     compulsion.'' Moreover, the funds are not attached to a new \n     program. The conditions are attached to funds that States \n     have already satisfied conditions to receive now and are \n     being used for law enforcement purposes now. Prisons under \n     construction now might have to be abandoned if the States can \n     no longer receive Federal funds for prisons unless they \n     lengthen their sentences. Drug task forces, police \n     assistance, prosecutorial assistance, all of which are \n     currently functional, would be jeopardized, causing possible \n     loss of life and limb to the citizenry, if States did not \n     adopt Washington's sentencing policy in order to be sure to \n     continue receiving the money. That is coercion, not \n     inducement.\n       If the measure is retroactive only with respect to people \n     who are released after 2002 for earlier committed crimes, the \n     compulsion is not as great, but is still very strong, as the \n     State still faces unlimited liability for any prisoners for \n     future crimes committed over many years. To avoid that, a \n     State seeking to retain Federal funding might essentially, in \n     the Supreme Court's words, be ``induced . . . to engage in \n     activities which would themselves be unconstitutional,'' such \n     as lengthening the sentences of those who would otherwise be \n     released, violating the ex post facto clause.\n\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\n\n  This wouldn't be a direct lengthening, but it would certainly have a \npotential effect with regard to, for example, parole board activities. \nSo not only do you have an ex post facto problem, you have a spending \nloss problem. The Supreme Court has held that Congress can withhold \nmoney, unless the States engage in the behavior that Congress wants \nthem to as they receive the money. They don't have to take the money, \nbut if they do, they have to take the strings attached to it. The \nSupreme Court has basically upheld that. The Supreme Court also said \nthe conditions that the Federal Government places on the use of the \nmoney must be unambiguous. The States must know what they have to do in \norder to get this money.\n  I submit that under the present case, Aimee's law, the States could \nnot tell what they have to do in order to get this money because they \nare always dealing with a moving target. If you remember what I said a \nwhile ago, the name of the game is for the States to keep ratcheting up \ntheir incarceration time so they are within the national average. If \nthey fall below that for their own good purposes, whatever the reasons \nand circumstances--they want to devote more money to prevention, or \nthey want to devote more to rehabilitation instead of prisons, whatever \ntheir decisions might be--if they fall a little below, they are going \nto lose their money. If they want to keep their money, how high are \nthey supposed to raise their incarceration rates? Because by the time \nthey change their law and raise their incarceration rates for these \nvarious offenses, other States, presumably, could be doing the same \nthing. You are always going toward a moving target. Each State is \ntrying to outstrip each other, and each State, if it wants to keep its \nmoney and not have to pay for 40 or 50 years for somebody in another \nState--their incarceration expense--the safe thing for it to do is \nratchet up the time. The safest thing for it to do would be to give \nlife sentences without parole.\n\n  For some people, I think that is a good idea anyway. But is that \nsomething we ought to be forcing States to do with regard to any and \nall prisoners who come before them who are charged with this particular \nlist of crimes? It is a list that this Congress has decided is the \nprotected list--not anything else, just this protected list. If the \nStates don't comply, then they lose their Federal money. So the States \ncan't tell what they are supposed to do in order to keep their money. \nIt is a very ambiguous, bad piece of legislation.\n  There are policy reasons in addition to what I have described and in \naddition to the constitutional problems. It pits one State against \nanother. We are supposed to be doing things to unify this country--I \nthought. The Supreme Court and this Congress spends a lot of time and \nattention on implementing the commerce clause, designed to make sure \nthere is the free flow of goods and people and information one State to \nanother.\n  The Supreme Court strikes down laws that States might want which \nmight say another State can't come in, or where they are trying to \nimpose their will on another State outside their boundary. The commerce \nclause promotes a free flow of commerce, but under this particular law \nyou are pitting one State against another, calculating to see if they \ncan get some money from another State because they have a different \ncriminal law than this other State had, and the Attorney General of the \nFederal Government is the referee and she keeps the books on all of \nthat. That is a terrible idea.\n  Another policy reason is that Aimee's law defeats the very purpose \nthat it is trying to carry out. Much of the money that will be \nwithheld, if a State doesn't comply with this Federal mandate, will go \nfor prisons. One of the reasons, presumably, why some States have to \nturn people out before we would like is because of a lack of prison \nspace. They are getting this Federal money in order to help them with \nmore prisons.\n  This is a very circular kind of situation the Federal Government is \ncreating. We are cutting them off from money to do the very thing that \nis the reason we are cutting them off because they didn't do it in the \nfirst place. It makes no sense whatsoever. There is no additional \ninducement--is the next policy reason--under Aimee's law for the \nStates--other than to keep their Federal money--for the States to \ncomply with this Federal rule.\n  We are concerned about people getting out of jail and committing \nother crimes. We are all concerned about that. But seven out of eight \ncrimes that are committed by people who have gotten out of jail happen \nin the States in which they were confined. So the State of Tennessee \nhas every reason in the world to want to have laws that are reasonable \nfor the protection of its own citizens and to keep people confined for \na reasonable period of time for these crimes for the protection of \ntheir own citizens. Do they need any inducement because one out of \neight might go somewhere else and commit a crime and that State might \ncome back on them?\n  You have a situation here of particular crimes. Murder, as defined \nunder Federal law, could mean anything from vehicular homicide on up. \nSo, presumably, someone could be convicted of vehicular homicide in \nTennessee and go to California and be convicted of first-degree murder; \nthey are both murder under the meaning of this law. California could \nget Tennessee's Federal money to incarcerate this guy for the next \nhowever many years for murder when he was only convicted of vehicular \nhomicide in Tennessee.\n  This has not been thought through.\n  The Federal Government simply should not be setting the standards for \nState crimes. They ought to set the standards for Federal crimes. \nStates ought to have the flexibility to choose with their limited \nresources.\n  We tax the citizens of the States at a rate unprecedented since World \nWar II. We put mandates on States with which we have been struggling, \nand we are trying to back off that a little bit. We have all of these \nregulations we put on the States. They have limited resources most \nyears. They are doing a little better these days. They ought to have \nthe right to decide for themselves--the people who elect their \nofficials--how they use those resources.\n  If they want to spend more money for education, if they want to spend \nmore money for health care, if in the criminal area they want to spend \nmore money for prevention, if they want to spend more for \nrehabilitation, those are different things that different States are \ndoing all across the country. We can see who has been successful and \nwho has not been successful.\n  That is the reason we have States. That is the reason our Founding \nFathers set up States. If we don't allow them to do that, what is the \nuse of having them? Why do we have them? Why don't we just go ahead and \npass a Federal law for everything and abrogate the States, if we don't \nneed that kind of diversity and if we don't need that kind of \nexperimentation?\n  The Federal Government would have States keep people--let's say the \nelderly--and have to make the tradeoff of using limited resources to \nkeep people in jail who are, say, elderly and long past the time when \nyou would think they would be dangerous to people, but keep them there \non the off chance that they might get out and commit a crime in another \nState, and so forth. It doesn't make any sense.\n  This is simply an indirect attempt by the Federal Government--by us, \nby the Congress--to get States in a bidding war as to who can pass the \nmost stringent laws in all of these areas. That is OK in and of itself. \nBut it shouldn't be done because we are threatening them to do it. We \nthink we have the answers to these problems, and we don't.\n  I served on the Judiciary Committee a while back, and I was chairman \nof the Juvenile Justice Subcommittee for a while. For anybody who deals \nin criminal law, the first thing they have to come away with, if they \nare being fair about it, is a sense of great humility.\n  There is so much we do not know about what causes crime--why young \npeople commit crimes, what the best solution is, and so forth. My own \nview is that we should spend a lot more time, money, and research, and \nwe should spend a lot more time, money, and effort in finding out what \nis going on in these various communities around the country with the \nvarious approaches communities and States have had and the various \nkinds of problems. It is very complex and very controversial. But that \ndoesn't stop us. Last time I checked, we had 132 programs on juvenile \ncrime alone at the\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nFederal level without a clue as to whether or not any of them are \nworking or doing any good. My guess is that some of them are probably \ncounterproductive.\n  A lot of people want to pass, as a part of a bill, to have youthful \noffenders sentenced as adults. In some cases, if States want to do \nthat, that is fine with me. But we were going to impose a requirement \nthat all States sentence youthful offenders as adults within certain \ncategories until we found out that the way it plays out in some cases \nis they would get less time as an adult than they would in a juvenile \nfacility.\n\n  There is just an awful lot we don't know.\n  Why should we be forcing States to adhere to some kind of a national \nstandard as to how long a person ought to serve for a list of crimes? \nIf we really believe we ought to do that, why don't we just go ahead \nand do it directly?\n  We have seen the benefit of a system our Founding Fathers established \nover and over and over again. This is not just textbook stuff. It has \nto do with power, and the use of power, and who is going to use power, \nand how concentrated you want it. It has to do with innovation. It has \nto do with experimentation. It has to do with good competition among \nthe States. We have seen welfare reform, education choice, competitive \ntax policies, and public-private partnerships all thrive at the State \nlevel. Good things are happening.\n  This law is another step away from all of that, another step toward \nFederal centralization and the monopolizing of criminal policy in this \ncountry. I could not let this go and could not let this pass without \nmaking that abundantly clear once again.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the vote on the adoption of the HUD-VA bill on Thursday, the \nmotion to proceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4516 was not agreed to be \nimmediately agreed to, and the vote occur on the conference report \nimmediately, without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto \nmessage with respect to the conference report accompanying H.R. 4733 be \nconsidered as having been read, printed in the Record and spread in \nfull upon the Journal, and the message then be referred to the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Before the Chair grants this request, I would like to say to my \ncolleagues that, unfortunately, the Senate does not have the votes to \noverride this veto. I still believe strongly that the energy and water \nappropriations conference report should not have been vetoed and that \nthere is a real threat of danger as a result of the provisions that are \nin controversy. The vote in the Senate was 57-37, which is a very \nstrong vote. But at this point it appears there certainly would not be \nsufficient votes to override the President's veto.\n  I regret the veto. The Senate needs to proceed now to complete these \nappropriations bills, and therefore we have had to go through the \nprocess as just be outlined in these previous unanimous consent \nrequests. Therefore, this consent addresses the immediate concern of \nthe veto message entering the Senate Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, while Senator Daschle is here, he may want \nto make comments. I thank him again for working to help get this \nagreement worked out, as Senator Reid certainly has been helpful, and \nSenator Bond, chairman of the committee, and Senator Mikulski, ranking \nmember of the HUD-VA appropriations subcommittee; they have done good \nwork.\n  As a result of these agreements, we will be able to act tomorrow on \nthe HUD-VA appropriations bill, the energy and water appropriations \nbill, as will be modified to put in the agreed-to language with regard \nto section 103, and we also will then have the Treasury-Postal \nappropriations bill included in this process.\n  We will continue to work after this vote at 4:30 to get an agreement \nwith regard to the time and a vote on the Defense authorization bill. \nWe are working through the difficulties which are probably on this \nside; maybe on both sides. We will try to work that out, and also a \ntime when a vote will occur on the Agriculture appropriations \nconference report.\n  I will have to communicate some more. I thought it important to go \nahead and get these agreements lined up.\n  I remind Members, we have two votes scheduled at 4:30.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I commend the majority leader for his work in reaching \nthis agreement and compliment and thank Members on both sides of the \naisle.\n  We have to be realists as we try to finish our work at the end of \nthis session. Being realists means we don't get it exactly the way we \nwant it. Obviously, many Members have serious problems about the way we \nare proceeding. We, nonetheless, realize we have to get the work done. \nWhile it may not be pretty, it will get the work done. That is \nultimately what we are here to do.\n  To clarify what this agreement does with regard to some of the \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\nthat some Members have raised, first and foremost, this allows for the \ncompletion of the Treasury-Postal bill because we address the IRS \nconcern raised by the administration. We are very pleased that issue \nhas been resolved and we are now able to go forth at least from the \npoint of view of the administration. Senator Byrd had the same concern \nI did about procedure. This allows us technically to have taken up TPO \non the floor, as Senator Byrd has strongly suggested we do and as some \nMembers proposed be done. This allows us to do that, and we will do it \nin concert with the consideration of HUD-VA.\n  Obviously, as I think everyone now knows, section 103 of the energy \nand water bill is very problematic for the administration and for some \nof us. This understanding takes out section 103.\n  We have accommodated a lot of the concerns in reaching this \nagreement. We will have a couple of amendments offered by Senator Boxer \nwho has concerns about the HUD-VA bill. This reaches the level of \nunderstanding we have with regard to her concerns, as well.\n  Clearly, this is a compromise taking into account both the procedural \nas well as the substantive concerns many Senators have had on both \nsides of the aisle, and it accommodates those concerns as best we can \nunder these circumstances.\n  Again, I end where I began by complimenting the majority leader, by \nexpressing my appreciation for his work in trying to reach an \naccommodation of some of these issues. I hope we can do more on other \nbills that are yet to be considered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. While the two leaders are on the floor, there is so much \nacrimony on the Senate floor, and there will be more in the future. At \na time when we have accomplished a great deal procedurally, you two \nshould be commended. It has been difficult to arrive at this point. \nThis is one of the times where we worked with some cooperation. There \nwill be more difficulties before the session ends, but the two leaders \nare to be commended for the work done today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10211-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10211-S10228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nVICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING AND VIOLENCE PROTECTION ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE \n                           REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I know under the unanimous consent \nagreement Senator Thompson would have the time until 4:30 when it was \nagreed the vote would be set. I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nsex trafficking bill for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, rather than not using the time, I \nthought it wise to go ahead and use this time to visit about this \nimportant vote that will be taking place. There may be some people who \nare just now focusing on what is happening.\n  We have a base bill with sex trafficking. The Violence Against Women \nAct is the base of the bill, and it is put together in an overall piece \nof legislation with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, \nAimee's law, Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, and the 21st \nAmendment Enforcement Act. This is the combined bill soon to be voted \non.\n  A point of order has been raised and ruled against by the Chair, and \nwe will be voting on appealing the ruling of the Chair. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of the Chair and we will go to the final \nbill for a vote. To vote against the Chair and subtract Aimee's law, \nsends the bill back to the House, and we don't have time to get this \ndone.\n  This is an important day for women and children subject to violence, \nboth domestically and abroad. It is an important day that this body is \ngoing to follow the House and put in place needed protections for \npeople, women and children, subject to this violence, both domestically \nand abroad.\n  It is an important day for those who have worked as advocacy groups \nand defenders of the defenseless, including people trafficked across \ninternational borders, with their papers burned and told: You owe.\n  This is important also for women in abusive relationships, physically \nabusive, who need help.\n  This addresses both of those issues. I think it is important this \nbody, in the waning days of this session, go out with a strong \nstatement that we are there with you; we are supporting those who are \nvictimized in these situations, domestically and abroad. We are \nspeaking out for those who, in many cases, have no voice.\n  I can still see the girls I met in Nepal who were trafficked at 11 \nand 12 years of age, coming back to their home country and to their \nvillages, 16, 17 years of age, in terrible condition, having been \nsubjected to sex trafficking, beaten by brothel owners, in some cases \nlocked up at night, raped repeatedly, and told, ``You have to work this \noff; I own you,'' and then released to go home when they contract \nhorrible diseases. In not all cases that works that way, but in too \nmany cases it does work that way.\n\n  This body is speaking today. We are speaking on behalf of those who \nare so defenseless in these particular types of situations.\n  I want to recognize some people who have been particularly helpful on \nthis. Senator Leahy has worked very hard with us on this, through many \nof the issues he has had on this. Senator Wellstone and I have worked \non the trafficking. Senator Biden and Senator Hatch have worked on the \nViolence Against Women Act. This has been a true bipartisan and \nbicameral effort. Chris Smith and Sam Gejdenson in the House, \nRepublican and Democrat, have worked with us to get this through. \nChairman Hyde of the Judiciary Committee in the House has worked to get \nthis on through. My staff, Karen Knudsen and Sharon Payt, have worked \nvery hard. The outside advocacy groups range from Gloria Steinem to \nChuck Colson in support of this legislation, saying this is something \nwe need to speak out about; this is something we need to do.\n  I want to recognize the leader, Trent Lott. In these waning hours of \nthe session, there are about 150 different bills that want to get to \nthe floor. Senator Lott has said this one is coming to the floor. Not \nonly did he say it is coming to the floor, he gave us all day on \nOctober 11 to be able to carry this on through and get this through. \nThis is precious time. It could have been spent and was being pushed to \nbe spent on a number of different issues. Instead, Senator Lott said, \nno; we will go ahead and let this issue come forward. We will take the \nwhole day debating it. People can be heard on this particular issue. \nThen we will have two votes at the end of the day.\n  That is a great statement on his part in support of women and \nchildren who are subject to these horrifying conditions, both \ndomestically and abroad. I applaud his effort and his leadership and \nhis work getting this done.\n  I just came from a press conference with Senator Santorum on Aimee's \nlaw, an important piece of legislation concerning what happened to \nAimee Willard, an act perpetrated by a person was released early from \nprison in Nevada and went to Pennsylvania. She was an all-American \nlacrosse player at George Mason University. She was traveling, her car \nwas taken over by this guy who had been previously convicted and \nreleased early out of a Nevada prison, then he takes her, kidnaps her, \nrapes her, and murders her.\n  This is legislation that does not federalize crimes, but it \nencourages States to step up and say: If a person is convicted of one \nof these crimes, keep him in for at least 85 percent of what he was \nsentenced for; or if they go to another State and commit this \nrecidivism crime, then the State that has to prosecute and incarcerate \nthis person, the criminal who did this, they can get part of the \nFederal moneys from the State that let the person go free early.\n  I think it is a sensible approach to try pushing this on forward. It \nis a good piece of legislation. It is something that deserves passage. \nHere in these waning hours of this session, I would just say I am very \npleased to be a part of this body that would stand up\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nand speak out and step forward on important legislation like this for \nthe defenseless, for the voiceless, for those who are in harm's way. I \napplaud that. I hope my colleagues will vote as the House did, \noverwhelmingly, for this legislation. It passed in the House 371-1.\n  If I can encourage you any more, I say pull out a picture from your \nbillfold, pull out a picture of a child or grandchild. Those are the \nages, somewhere between 9 and 15, who are the most frequently \ntrafficked victims. Young ages. Aimee Willard was a young age--not \nquite that young. But you get young ages of people who are subjected to \nthis. We are stepping up and doing something on their behalf.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the time I have been able to \nuse for this. I urge the President to sign this legislation when it \ngets to his desk. I am hopeful he will. I do not know of any reason he \nwould not sign this legislation. This will be a major accomplishment of \nthis Congress that is going to be completed at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is an interesting precedent being set \nas the Senate considers adopting Aimee's law as part of the conference \nreport on the Sex Trafficking Act. The supporters of Aimee's law argue \nthat states have a financial responsibility regarding the protection, \nor lack of protection, offered by state law.\n  I have expressed my concerns about Aimee's law and I want to put my \ncolleagues on notice. If Congress and the President determine that this \nAct will become law, there are important ramifications that should be \nreflected in future legislation on many issues.\n  For example, the application of the Aimee's law standard to state \nresponsibility should also be applied to pollution and waste that also \ncrosses state borders. I think it will be interesting to see in the \nfuture whether supporters of Aimee's law will also support efforts to \nmake states responsible for air pollution that is generated in their \nstates but falls downwind on other states to damage the environment and \nendanger the health of children and individuals who suffer from asthma.\n  My colleagues in the Northeast will all recognize this issue--we are \ncollectively suffering from the damage inflicted on our forests, \nwaterways, and public health every day by the tons of uncontrolled \npollution emitted from power plants in the midwest. In 1997, out of the \n12,000,000 tons of acid-rain causing sulfur dioxide emitted by the \nUnited States, Vermont was the source of only ten--or 0.00008%. Yet my \nstate suffers disproportionately from the ecological and financial \ndamage of acid rain, from stricken sugar maple trees to fishless lakes \nand streams. Vermont, like many other New England states, spends \nsignificant funds to test fish for mercury and issue fish advisories \nwhen levels are too high--mercury that also has its source at \nuncontrolled midwestern plants. All of our hospitals also spend money \nfor tests for respiratory problems for children exposed to ozone-thick \nair, air that drifts into Vermont from the urban centers to the south \nand west.\n  I would like to put the Senate on notice that when the Senate \nconsiders any amendments to the Clean Air Act, I will consider offering \nan amendment that will hold states responsible for the cost of the \npollution they generate and which falls downwind. It will be \ninteresting to see whether the supporters of the logic behind Aimee's \nlaw will support a Federal Government mandate that Vermont be paid by \nmidwestern states for every ton of uncontrolled pollution that crosses \ninto our state and results in costs to our environment and our \ncitizens.\n  I provide this background to highlight the underlying problems with \nAimee's law. While done with the best of intentions, the solution \nachieved with this provision is on questionable constitutional ground \nand has the potential to set a precedent that will have far reaching \nimplications for many issues Congress will address in the future.\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this conference report is a splendid \nexample of Congress reasserting its moral underpinning in U.S. foreign \npolicy. It will effectively combat the disgrace of women and children \nbeing smuggled, bought and sold as pathetic commodities--most often for \nthe human beasts who thrive on prostitution.\n  The conference report deals with all aspects of sex trafficking, from \nhelping victims to punishing perpetrators.\n  Significantly, the legislation calls on the executive branch to \nidentify clearly the nations where trafficking is the most prevalent. \nFor regimes that know there is a problem within their borders, but \nrefuse to do anything about it, there will be consequences.\n  No country has a right to foreign aid. The worst trafficking nations \nmust have such U.S. aid cut off. And if they don't receive U.S. \nbilateral aid, then their officials will be barred from coming onto \nAmerican soil. Our principles demand these significant and important \nsymbolic steps.\n  Some may complain that this is another ``sanction'' in the alleged \nproliferation of sanctions Congress passes. But denying taxpayer-\nsupported foreign aid is not a ``sanction.'' Foreign aid is not an \nentitlement.\n  I commend Senator Brownback for his unyielding efforts to help the \nvictims of sex trafficking, which is nothing less than modern-day \nslavery. The inevitable controversies over differences between House \nand Senate bills were ironed out because of Senator Brownback's \nleadership.\n  Time and again, Senator Brownback personally intervened with \nconferees, with our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, and with the \nHouse and Senate leadership in order to obtain agreement on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Sam Brownback is devoted to helping less fortunate citizens, whether \nthey are farmers struggling to keep their farms in Kansas or the \nhelpless women and children caught up in the trafficking of human \nbeings. I salute Senator Brownback for his remarkable efforts.\n  Also of particular significance is a provision authored by \nCongressman Bill McCollum of Florida, which will assist victims of \nterrorism. Senator Mack and others who have had a longstanding interest \nin this issue were instrumental in helping this provision find a place \nin the conference report. The provision helps families struck by the \nhorrors such as the attack on Pan Am 103 get fair restitution, coming \nin part from the frozen assets of terrorist states.\n  The conference report is a solid and effective measure to help the \nvictims of violence and abuse, the kind of abuse which is nothing short \nof evil. Those victims are most often women and children, and this \nlegislation goes a long way to protect them.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Victims \nof Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 conference report. \nWhile I have some reservations of some parts of the conference report, \nI am pleased that a number of important provisions have been included.\n  I would like to focus my comments today on three specific provisions \nof this report: the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, the Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act, and the Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement \nAct.\n  I strongly supported the Violence Against Women Act when we passed it \n6 years ago. VAWA was the most comprehensive bill ever passed by \nCongress to deal with the corrosive problem of domestic violence. I \nbelieved then and believe now that this legislation was long overdue.\n  For far too long, there has been an attitude that violence against \nwomen is a ``private matter.'' If a woman was mugged by a stranger, \npeople would be outraged and demand action. However, if the same woman \nwas bruised and battered by her husband or boyfriend, they would simply \nturn away.\n  Attitudes are hard to change. But I believe that VAWA has helped.\n  In the last 5 years, VAWA has enhanced criminal penalties on those \nwho attack women, eased enforcement of protection orders from State to \nState, and provided over $1.6 billion over 6 years to police, \nprosecutors, battered women's shelters, a national domestic violence \nhotline, and other provisions designed to catch and punish batterers \nand offer victims the support they need to leave their abusers.\n  The Violence Against Women Act works. A Department of Justice study \nrecently found that, during the 6-year period that VAWA has been in \neffect, violence against women by intimate partners fell 21 percent.\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\n  However, the same study found that much more work remains to be done. \nFor example:\n  Since 1976, about one-third of all murdered women each year have been \nkilled by their partners;\n  Moreover, women are still much more likely than men to be attacked by \ntheir intimate partners. During 1993-1998, women victims of violence \nwere more than seven times more likely to have been attacked by an \nintimate partner than male victims of violence.\n  VAWA 2000 will help us complete that work. This legislation would do \nthree things.\n  First, the bill would reauthorize through fiscal year 2005 the key \nprograms in the original Violence Against Women Act. These include STOP \ngrants, pro-arrest grants, rural domestic violence and child abuse \nenforcement grants, the national domestic violence hotline, and rape \nprevention and education programs. The bill also reauthorizes the \ncourt-appointed and special advocate program, CASA, and other programs \nin the Victims of Child Abuse Act.\n  Second, the bill makes some improvements to VAWA. These include:\n  Funding for grants to help victims of domestic violence, stalking, \nand sexual assault who need legal assistance because of that violence;\n  Assistance to states and tribal courts to improve interstate \nenforcement of civil protection orders, as required by the original \nViolence Against Women Act;\n  Funding for grants to provide short-term housing assistance and \nshort-term support services to individuals and their dependents fleeing \ndomestic violence who are unable to find quickly secure alternative \nhousing;\n  A provision providing supervised visitation of children for victims \nof domestic violence, sexual assault, and child abuse to reduce the \nopportunity for additional domestic violence during visitations;\n  A provision strengthening and refining protections for battered \nimmigrant women; and\n  An expansion of several of the primary grant programs to cover \nviolence that arises in dating relationships.\n  I was disappointed that the conference did not agree to extend the \nrecently expired Violent Crime Reduction Fund. The money for the trust \nfund comes from savings generated by reducing the Federal workforce by \nmore than 300,000 employees, and it was the primary source of money for \nVAWA programs. This will mean that VAWA will likely be funded directly \nby tax revenues.\n  However, I am pleased that the conference agreed to restore language \nthat would allow grant money to be used to deal with dating violence. \nWithout this language, women could not benefit from VAWA unless they \ncohabited with their abusers. That makes no sense. In fact, the \nDepartment of Justice study on intimate partner violence found that \nwomen between the ages of 16 and 24--prime dating ages--are the most \nlikely to experience violence within their relationships.\n\n  VAWA has been particularly important to my own state of California. \nVAWA funds have trained hundreds of California police officers, \nprosecutors, and judges. They have provided California law enforcement \nwith better evidence gathering and information sharing equipment.\n  VAWA funds have also hired victims' advocates and counselors in \nscores of California cities. They have provided an array of services to \nCalifornia women and children--from 24-hour hotlines to emergency \ntransportation to medical services.\n  I have heard numerous stories from women in California who have \nbenefitted from VAWA. For instance, one woman wrote to me to how she \nfled from an abusive relationship but was able to get food, clothing, \nand shelter for her and her four children from a VAWA-supported center. \nIf it was not for VAWA, she wrote, ``I would have lost my four children \nbecause I didn't have anywhere to go. I was homeless with my \nchildren.''\n  And the head of the Valley Trauma Center in Southern California wrote \nme about another tragic case. Four men kidnaped a woman as she walked \nto her car and raped her repeatedly for many hours. Incredibly, because \nthe men accused the victim of having sex with them voluntarily and one \nof the men was underage, the woman herself was charged with having sex \nwith a minor. As a result, the woman lost her job. Fortunately, the \ncenter, using VAWA funds, was able to intervene. They helped get the \ncharges against the victim dismissed and assisted the woman through her \ntrauma.\n  There is no question that VAWA has made a real difference in the \nlives of tens of thousands of women and children in California. Let me \ngive you some more examples:\n  Through VAWA funding, California has 23 sexual assault response \nteams, 13 violence response teams, and scores of domestic violence \nadvocates in law enforcement agencies throughout the state. These teams \nhave responded to hundreds of incidents of domestic violence, saving \nlives and helping protect California women and children from abuse.\n  Since 1997, eight counties in California have developed stalking and \nthreat assessment teams, STATs. Since VAWA was enacted, there has been \na 200-percent increase in the number of felony stalking cases filed by \nthe Los Angeles District Attorney.\n  Within 2 weeks of launching an antistalking educational campaign \nusing VAWA money, the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, \nLACAAW, received about 40 calls to its crisis hotline. These calls \nresulted in numerous investigations by the local STAT.\n  Since LACAAW receive VAWA money in 1997, it has seen a 64 percent \nincrease in the number of victims served. Moreover, its rape prevention \neducation program services have doubled in this period.\n  In the last 5 years, Women Escaping a Violent Environment, WEAVE, a \nvictim service provider in Sacramento, has doubled its legal advocacy \nefforts and crisis and referral services. It responds to over 20,000 \ndomestic violence and sexual assault calls to its crisis line annually \nand 35 requests for legal services daily.\n  In Alameda County, the district attorney's office has used VAWA funds \nto institute comprehensive training regarding the investigation and \nprosecution of domestic violence and stalking cases. Two hundred sixty \nprosecutors in Alameda and Contra Costa county and 350 police officers \nin Alameda country have been trained. The result: 30 new stalking cases \nand numerous new domestic violence cases being investigated and \nprosecuted just in 3 months.\n  Lideres Campasinas has used VAWA money to establish itself in 12 \ncommunities in California and has trained 25,000 immigrant and migrant \nwomen. Before it received this money, Lideres Campasinas did not \naddress the problem of domestic violence among farmworker women. Now, \nthree tribal organizations and 4 States have contacted it about setting \nup similar programs in their jurisdictions.\n  The California Coalition Against Sexual Assault's Rape Prevention \nResource Center has, using VAWA money, assembled over 4,000 items \nfocused exclusively on issues related to violence against women in the \nU.S. Over 4,000 items are currently available in its lending library.\n  In short, VAWA 2000 renews our commitment to fighting violence \nagainst women and children. I am delighted to support its passage \ntoday.\n  Let me also say a few words about the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act, which is also in the conference report.\n  I strongly support this bill, which will help American victims of \nterrorism abroad collect court-awarded compensation and ensures that \nthe responsible State sponsors of terrorism pay a price for their \ncrimes.\n  Just let me talk about one example of why this new law is necessary.\n  In 1985, David Jacobsen was residing in Beirut, Lebanon, and was the \nchief executive officer of the American University of Beirut Medical \nCenter. His life would soon take a dramatic and irreversible change for \nthe worse, and he would never again be the same.\n  Shortly before 8:00 a.m. on May 28, 1985, Jacobsen was crossing an \nintersection with a companion when he was assaulted, subdued and forced \ninto a van by several terrorist assailants. He was pistol-whipped, \nbound and gagged, and pushed into a hidden compartment under the floor \nin the back of the van.\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\n  Jacobsen was held by these men, members of the Iranian-backed \nHizballah, for 532 days--nearly a year and a half. He was held in \ndarkness and blindfolded during most of that time, chained by his \nankles and wrists and wearing nothing but undershorts and a t-shirt. He \nhas said in the past that he was allowed to see sunlight just twice in \nthose 17 months.\n  The food during his captivity was meager--sometimes the guards would \neven spit in his food before handing it over.\n  Jacobsen was subjected to regular beatings, and often threatened with \nimmediate death. He was forced to listen as fellow captives were \nkilled.\n  As a result of this physical and mental torture, Jacobsen has been \nunder continuous treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder since his \nrelease in November of 1986--nearly 13 years ago.\n  In August of 1998, David Jacobsen was awarded $9 million by a U.S. \nFederal Court. The judgement was against the Government of Iran, and \npursuant to a bill that Congress signed in 1996 allowing victims of \nforeign terrorism to recover against terrorist nations.\n  But David Jacobsen has collected nothing. He cannot go to Iran to ask \nfor the verdict. And our own Government has essentially turned its \nback. Some have estimated the United States Government has frozen more \nthan a billion dollars of Iranian assets. Yet not one cent has been \npaid to David Jacobsen. The administration has invoked waiver after \nwaiver--even as Congress has modified the 1996 bill to clarify our \nintent.\n  The same has been true for others victimized by agents of designated \nterrorist-sponsoring nations, including Alisa Flatow, Terry Anderson, \nJoseph Ciccippio, Frank Reed, Matthew Eisenfeld, Sarah Duker, Armando \nAlejandre, Carlos A. Costa, and Mario de la Pena.\n  The legislation included in this conference report replaces the \nwaiver authority in current law to make it both more clear, and more \nnarrow. It is my hope that once Congress has again spoken on this \nissue, money frozen from terrorist nations will finally begin to flow \nto the victims of those terrorist acts.\n  The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act also contains an amendment \nauthored by Senator Leahy and myself that will offer more immediate and \neffective assistance to victims of terrorism abroad, such as those \nAmericans killed or injured in the embassy bombings in Kenya and \nTanzania and in the Pam Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. This \namendment does not involve any new funding; all the money for victims \nwould come out of the existing emergency reserve fund for the \nDepartment of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime, OVC.\n  The Leahy-Feinstein amendment aims to provide faster and better \nassistance to victims of terrorism abroad. Under current Federal law, \nif there is a terrorist attack against Americans abroad, the victims \nand their families must generally go to the victims' services agencies \nin their home States to receive assistance and compensation. However, \nvictims' services vary widely from State to State, and some overseas \nvictims receive no relief at all because they cannot establish \nresidency in a particular State.\n  Let me give you a couple of real-life examples created by current \nlaw:\n  Two American victims, standing literally yards apart, were injured in \nthe bombing at the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Each received severe \ninjuries, was permanently disabled, and spent 7 months recovering at \nthe same hospital. However, because the two were residents of different \nStates, they received very different victims' assistance: one received \n$15,000 in compensation and one $100,000. And one waited a week for a \ndecision on the money and the other 5 months.\n  Another American was also severely injured in the embassy bombings. \nBecause he was not able to establish residency in a particular State, \nhe could not receive any victims' assistance or compensation at all. In \nfact, because he lacked health insurance, he had to pay his medical \nbills himself.\n  The Office for Victims of Crime has been able to get around the \nproblem in certain cases by transferring money to the FBI or U.S. \nattorney's offices, which then transfer the money to victims. However, \nthis cannot be done in some situations. Moreover, even where such \ntransfers can be done, OVC and the victims have run into a lot of \nredtape and delays. An example:\n\n  Because of current law, OVC was not able to respond directly to the \nneeds of victims of the embassy bombings. So they transferred money to \nthe Executive Office of the U.S. attorneys, which then transferred the \nmoney to the State Department, which then transferred the money to the \nvictims. This triple transfer took 8 months. In the meantime, the \nvictims and their families had to pay medical bills, transportation \ncosts, funeral expenses, and other expenses themselves.\n  The Leahy-Feinstein amendment will immediately benefit terrorist \nvictims. For example, the amendment ensures that the OVC can assist \nvictims directly with regard to the upcoming trial in New York City of \nthe individuals who allegedly bombed our embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania.\n  The Leahy-Feinstein amendment fixes the problem in three ways.\n  First, it creates a single, centralized agency to help victims of \nterrorism abroad. This agency--OVC--has more expertise and resources to \nhelp overseas terrorism victims than a typical State victims' services \nagency. For example, OVC can much more easily get information from U.S. \nand foreign government agencies to process victims' claims than, say, \nthe Wyoming Victim Services Division.\n  Second, it eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies in Federal and \nState victims' services statutes that result in disparate treatment of \nsimilarly situated victims of terrorism. The amendment provides OVC \nwith much more flexibility to assist victims of terrorism directly, \navoiding unfair results.\n  Third, it cuts redtape that has unnecessarily delayed services to \nvictims of terrorism.\n  Specifically, the Leahy-Feinstein amendment:\n  Authorizes OVC to establish a terrorism compensation fund and to make \ndirect payments to American citizens and noncitizen U.S. Government \nemployees for emergency expenses related to terrorist victimization. \nThe money would be used to pay emergency travel expenses, medical \nbills, and the cost of transporting bodies.\n  Allows OVC to pay for direct services to victims, regardless of where \na terrorist attack occurs. This includes counseling services, a \nvictims' website, and closed-circuit TV so victims and their families \ncan monitor trial proceedings.\n  Raises the cap on OVC's emergency reserve fund from $50 million to \n$100 million. This would enable OVC to access additional funds in the \nevent of a terrorist attack involving massive casualties.\n  Makes it easier for OVC to replenish its emergency reserve fund with \nmoney that it de-obligates from its other grant programs.\n  Expands the range of organizations that OVC may fund to include the \nDepartment of State, Red Cross, and others.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy for his leadership on this issue. \nWhile he and I have sometimes disagreed on how to address the lack of \nvictims' rights in this Nation, I am glad that we were able to work \ntogether to pass this important amendment.\n  Finally, I would like to discuss one last provision of this \nconference report. Specifically, I want to address the so-called \nTwenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, S. 577, now included as part of \nthis conference report. I want it to be perfectly clear that this \nprovision is simply a jurisdictional statute with a very narrow and \nspecific purpose. The bill is not intended to allow the enforcement of \ninvalid or unconstitutional State liquor laws in the Federal courts, \nand is certainly not intended to allow States to unfairly discriminate \nagainst out-of-State sellers for the purposes of economic \nprotectionism.\n  The Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act would add a new section \n(section 2) to the Webb-Kenyon Act, granting Federal court jurisdiction \nto injunctive relief actions brought by State attorneys general seeking \nto enforce State laws dealing with the importation or transportation of \nalcoholic beverages. It is important to emphasize that Congress is not \npassing on the advisability or legal validity of the\n\n[[Page S10215]]\n\nmany State laws dealing with alcoholic beverages. Whether a particular \nState law on this subject is a valid exercise of State power is, and \nwill continue to be, a matter for the courts to decide.\n  As you know, the powers granted to the States under section 2 of the \n21st amendment are not absolute. As the Supreme Court has made clear \nsince 1964, State power under the 21st amendment cannot be read in \nisolation from other provisions in the Constitution. In Hostetter v. \nIdlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corporation, 377 U.S. 324 (1964), the Court \nbegan to use a ``balancing test'' or ``accommodation test'' to \ndetermine whether a state liquor law was enacted to implement a ``core \npower'' of the 21st amendment or was essentially an effort to unfairly \nregulate or burden interstate commerce with an inadequate connection to \nthe temperance goals of the second section of the 21st amendment.\n  The Court said in Hostetter that ``[B]oth the 21st amendment and the \ncommerce clause are parts of the same Constitution. Like other \nprovisions of the Constitution, each must be considered in the light of \nthe other, and in the context of the issues and interests at stake in \nany concrete case.'' The Court in that case also emphasized that to \ndraw the conclusion that the 21st amendment has repealed the commerce \nclause, would be ``patently bizarre'' and ``demonstrably incorrect.''\n  Subsequently, in a series of other decisions over the last 35 years, \nthe Supreme Court has held that the 21st amendment does not diminish \nthe force of the supremacy clause, the establishment clause, the \nexport-import clause, the equal protection clause, and, again, the \ncommerce clause; nor does it abridge rights protected by the first \namendment.\n  In case after case (Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U.S. \n691, 712 (1984) (supremacy clause); Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 \nU.S. 116, 122 (1982) (establishment clause); Department of Revenue v. \nJames Beam Co., 377 U.S. 341 (1964) (export-import clause); Craig v. \nBoren, 429 U.S. 190, 209 (1976) (equal protection); Bacchus Imports, \nLtd. v. Dias, 468 U.S. 263, 275 (1984) (commerce clause); 44 \nLiquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 516 (1996) (first \namendment)), the Court has made it clear that the powers granted to the \nStates under the 21st amendment must be read in conjunction with other \nprovisions in the Constitution.\n  In Bacchus Imports, the Court stated that the 21st amendment was not \ndesigned ``to empower States to favor local liquor industries by \nerecting barriers to competition.'' Nor are State laws that constitute \n``mere economic protectionism . . . entitled to the same deference as \nlaws enacted to combat the perceived evils of an unrestricted traffic \nin liquor.'' The Bacchus decision stands for the legal principle that \nthe 21st amendment cannot be used by the States to justify liquor laws \nwhich, by favoring instate businesses, discriminate against out-of-\nstate sellers or otherwise burden interstate commerce. Economic \ndiscrimination is not a core purpose of the 21st amendment.\n  Earlier this year, when the Senate Judiciary Committee considered S. \n577, I offered an amendment to the ``Rules of Construction'' section of \nSenator Hatch's substitute to S. 577. The amendment was intended to \nclarify that Congress recognizes the important line of cases I have \ndescribed today and does not intend to tip or alter the critical \nbalance between the 21st amendment and other provisions in the \nConstitution, such as the commerce clause. I also thought it was \nimportant that we make it clear that, in passing this jurisdictional \nstatute, we are neither endorsing any existing State liquor laws nor \nprejudging the validity of any State liquor laws. In making a decision \nas to whether to issue an injunction, the Federal judge will look at \nthe underlying State statute and determine whether or not it has been \nviolated and whether it is a constitutionally permissible exercise of \nState authority.\n  The committee adopted my amendment by a unanimous voice vote and the \nlanguage of subsection 2(e) now reflects the committee's intent. It \nstates that this legislation is to be construed only to extend the \njurisdiction of the Federal courts in connection with a State law that \nis a valid exercise of State power: (1) under the 21st amendment of the \nU.S. Constitution as such an amendment is interpreted by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, including interpretations in conjunction \nwith other provisions of the U.S. Constitution; and (2) under the first \nsection of the Webb-Kenyon Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. Further, S. 577 is not to be construed as granting \nthe States any additional power.\n  The legislative history of both the Webb-Kenyon Act and the second \nsection of the 21st amendment reflect the fact that Congress intended \nto protect the right of the individual States to enact laws to \nencourage temperance within their borders. So both before the \nestablishment of nationwide prohibition and after its repeal, the \nStates have been free to enact statewide prohibition laws, and to enact \nlaws allowing the local governments (i.e. counties, cities, townships, \netcetera) within their borders to exercise ``local option'' \nrestrictions on the availability of alcoholic beverages. Further, the \nStates are also free to enact laws limiting the access of minors to \nalcoholic beverages under their police powers.\n  The language in subsection 2(e) reinforces the Supreme Court \ndecisions holding that the 21st amendment is not to be read in \nisolation from other provisions contained in the U.S. Constitution. \nThese cases have recognized that State power under section 2 of the \n21st amendment is not unlimited and must be balanced with the other \nconstitutional rights protected by commerce clause, the supremacy \nclause, the export-import clause, the equal protection clause, the \nestablishment clause and the first amendment.\n  The substitute to S. 577 offered in the Judiciary Committee by \nSenator Hatch also made a number of other positive changes in this \nlegislation.\n  Federal court jurisdiction is granted only for injunctive relief \nactions by State attorneys general against alleged violators of State \nliquor laws. However, actions in Federal court are not permitted \nagainst persons licensed by that State, nor are they permitted against \npersons authorized to produce, sell, or store intoxicating liquor in \nthat State.\n\n  The Hatch substitute also made other changes ensuring that the bill \ntracks the due process requirements of rule 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure concerning suits for injunctive relief in Federal \ncourt. Under subsection 2(b), a State attorney general must have \n``reasonable cause'' to believe that a violation of that State's law \nregulating the importation or transportation of intoxicating liquor has \ntaken place. Further, under subsection 2(d)(1) the burden of proof is \non the State to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a \nviolation of State law has occurred. Similarly, subsection 2(d)(2) \nmakes it clear that no preliminary injunction may be granted except \nupon evidence: (A) demonstrating the probability of irreparable injury; \nand (B) supporting the probability of success on the merits. Also, \nunder subsection 2(d)(3) no preliminary or permanent injunction may be \nissued without notice to the adverse party and an opportunity for a \nhearing on the merits. While the legislation makes it clear that an \naction for injunctive relief under this act is to be tried before the \nCourt without a jury, at the same time a defendant's rights to a jury \ntrial in any separate or subsequent State criminal proceeding are \nintended to be preserved.\n  The amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee bring both balance \nand fairness to this legislation. As amended, the Twenty-First \nAmendment Enforcement Act will assist in the enforcement of legitimate \nState liquor laws that are genuinely about encouraging temperance or \nprohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors. At the same time, the \namended bill reflects a recognition on the part of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the Senate, and the Congress that S. 577 is solely a \njurisdictional statute and is not intended to allow the enforcement of \ninvalid or unconstitutional State liquor laws in the Federal \ncourts.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \ntwo very important pieces of legislation to the women of this country: \nthe Violence Against Women Act and the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Treatment Act.\n  Combating domestic violence and child abuse has been a top priority \nfor\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\nme. I am an early cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act of 2000 . \n. . And I joined with my colleagues in 1994 to pass the Violence \nAgainst Women Act, making it clear that violence against women is \nunacceptable.\n  Changing our laws and committing $1.6 billion over six years to \npolice, prosecutors, and battered women shelters has helped America \ncrack down on abusers and extend support to victims.\n  My home state of Arkansas has received almost $16 million in \nresources to help women who have been or are being abused. This money \nhas made a tremendous difference to women and their families in \nArkansas.\n  According to the Department of Justice, fewer women were killed by \ntheir husbands or boyfriends in the first two years after the Act's \npassage than in any year since 1976. We cannot stop this progress now.\n  By voting to continue the Violence Against Women Act, we send a \nsignal to women across the country that they and their children will \nhave options to chose from and a support network to rely on when they \nleave an abusive relationship. It also reinforces the message to \nabusers that their actions will not be tolerated or ignored.\n  I am also glad to see the Act expanded to include funding for \ntransitional housing for women and children who are victims of \nviolence, as well as resources for specific populations such as Native \nAmericans and the elderly . . . Mr. President, I'd also like to take a \nminute to recognize National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and to call \non the House to pass the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nAct.\n  This bill will provide treatment to low-income women screened and \ndiagnosed through the CDC National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program.\n  Since 1990, the Centers for Disease Control's National Breast and \nCervical Cancer Early Detection Program screens and diagnoses low-\nincome women for breast and cervical cancer, but does not guarantee \nthem treatment once diagnosed.\n  Nationwide, thousands of women are caught in a horrible federal \nloophole--they are told they have a deadly disease with no financial \nhope for treatment.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that in the year 2000, 400 \nwomen in Arkansas will die of breast cancer, and 1,900 women will be \ndiagnosed with it.\n  Luckily, my home state is currently administering an effective breast \ncancer screening program for uninsured women. This program has helped \nimprove the rate of early diagnosis and also provides financial \nassistance for treatment.\n  However, right now, the CDC program reaches only 15 percent of \neligible women . . .\n  Through the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act, Arkansas would \nbenefit from being able to free up resources for education and \noutreach, to help more women across the state.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the fight to enact this legislation is \nnot over.\n  After a 421-1 passage in the House in May, this critical bill passed \nthe Senate on Wednesday, October 4, 2000 by unanimous consent. It now \nmust go back to the House of Representatives for a vote on the Senate-\npassed version and then be sent to the President for his signature. I \nurge my colleagues in the House to move on this legislation, so that \nthe President can sign it into law.\n  And I also urge all of the women in my state to get screened this \nmonth. Every three minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer, and \nevery 12 minutes a woman dies from breast cancer. Early detection is \nkey.\n  I hope the women of Arkansas, especially if they have a family \nhistory of the disease, will take time during National Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month to take a step that could save their lives.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe one item I \nwas very pleased to see included in this legislation. The item to which \nI refer is a proposal of mine, the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act. I \nwould like to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Biden for their \ncooperation in getting this proposal included in the Violence Against \nWomen Act, which has now been incorporated into the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act.\n  The purpose of this provision is to guarantee that, when a convicted \nsex offender enrolls or begins employment at a college or university, \nmembers of the campus community will have the information they need to \nprotect themselves. Put another way, my legislation ensures the \navailability to students and parents of the information they would \nalready receive--under Megan's Law and related statutes--if a \nregistered sex offender were to move into their own neighborhood.\n  Current law requires that those convicted of crimes against minors or \nsexually violent offenses to register with law enforcement agencies \nupon their release from prison and that communities receive \nnotification when a sex offender takes up residence. The Campus Sex \nCrimes Prevention Act provides that offenders must register the name of \nany higher education institution where they enroll as a student or \ncommence employment. It also requires that this information be promptly \nmade available to law enforcement agencies in the jurisdictions where \nthe institutions of higher education are located.\n  Here is how this should work. Once information about an offender's \nenrollment at, or employment by, an institution of higher education has \nbeen provided to a state's sex offender registration program, that \ninformation should be shared with that school's law enforcement unit as \nsoon as possible.\n  The reason for this is simple. An institution's law enforcement unit \nwill have the most direct responsibility for protecting that school's \ncommunity and daily contact with those that should be informed about \nthe presence of the convicted offender.\n  If an institution does not have a campus police department, or other \nform of state recognized law enforcement agency, the sex offender \ninformation could then be shared with a local law enforcement agency \nhaving primary jurisdiction for the campus.\n  In order to ensure that the information is readily accessible to the \ncampus community, the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act requires \ncolleges and universities to provide the campus community with clear \nguidance as to where this information can be found, and clarifies that \nfederal laws governing the privacy of education records do not prevent \ncampus security agencies or other administrators from disclosing such \ninformation.\n  The need for such a clarification was illustrated by an incident that \noccurred last year at Arizona State University when a convicted child \nmolester secured a work furlough to pursue research on campus. \nUniversity officials believed that the federal privacy law barred any \ndisclosure of that fact.\n  Without a clear statement that schools are free to make this \ninformation available, questions will remain about the legality of \nreleasing sex offender information. The security unit at Arizona State \nand its counterparts at a number of other colleges asked for this \nauthority, and we should give it to them.\n  The House of Representatives passed a similar provision--authored by \nCongressman Matt Salmon--earlier this year. Since then, I--along with \nCongressman Salmon--have worked to address the concerns that some in \nthe higher education community had about possible unintended \nconsequences of this legislation. I am pleased to report that, in the \ncourse of those negotiations, we were able to reach agreement on \nlanguage that achieved our vital objectives without exposing colleges \nto excessive legal risks.\n  For the helpful role they played in those discussions, I must thank \nnot only Senator Hatch, Senator Biden, and Congressman Salmon, but \nSenators Jeffords and Kennedy, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  I appreciate the opportunity briefly to describe what I have tried to \naccomplish with this amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today will vote \non legislation to reauthorize the landmark Violence Against Women Act. \nThe legislation is part of a larger bill that also helps end the \ntrafficking of women and children into international sex trades, \nslavery, and forced labor.\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\n This bill passed the House of Representatives last week, and I am \nconfident the President will sign it into law.\n  I have been involved in the campaign to end domestic violence in our \ncommunities dating back to 1983 when I introduced legislation in the \nSouth Dakota State Legislature to use marriage license fees to help \nfund domestic abuse shelters. At that time, thousands of South Dakota \nwomen and children were in need of shelters and programs to help them. \nHowever, few people wanted to acknowledge that domestic abuse occurred \nin their communities, or even their own homes.\n  In 1994, as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, I helped \nget the original Violence Against Women Act passed into law. Since the \npassage of this important bill, South Dakota has received over $8 \nmillion in funding for battered women's shelters and family violence \nprevention and services. Nationwide, the Violence Against Women Act has \nprovided over $1.9 billion toward domestic abuse prevention and \nvictims' services.\n  In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic \nviolence were provided assistance last year, and over 40 domestic \nviolence shelters and outreach centers in the state received funding \nthrough the Violence Against Women Act. Shelters, victims' service \nproviders, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these \nfunds to provide assistance to these women and children. Some of these \nexamples include:\n  The Mitchell Area Safehouse started the first Family Visitation \nCenter in the state with these funds. The center ensures that children \nreceive safe and monitored visits with their parents when violence has \nbeen a factor in their home environment. Now there are 9 such centers \nin the state.\n  The Winner Resource Center for Families received funding to provide \nemergency shelter, counseling services, rent assistance, and clothing \nto women and children in south-central South Dakota.\n  Violence Against Women Act funding has also allowed Minnehaha County \nand Pennington County to hire domestic court liaisons to assist with \nthe Protection Order process.\n  In Rapid City, Violence Against Women Act funding also allowed \nWorking Against Violence Inc. (WAVI) to develop a Sexual Assault \nProgram and provide specialized crisis intervention and follow-up for \nchild and adult survivors of rape.\n  On the Crow Creek reservation, Violence Against Women Act funding \nhelped the tribal justice system to develop stalking, sexual assault, \nand sexual harassment tribal codes. Similar efforts have been realized \non the Rosebud and Sisseton-Wahpeton reservations through this program.\n  The original Violence Against Women Act expired last Saturday, \nOctober 1, and I once again led the fight in the Senate this year to \nreauthorize this legislation. The bill that the Senate will vote on \ntoday authorizes over $3 billion for domestic abuse prevention \nprograms. I am especially pleased that the bill includes a provision I \nsupported that targets $40 million a year in funding for rural areas.\n  The National Domestic Violence Hotline is also reauthorized in this \nlegislation. As you know, this hotline has received 500,000 calls from \nwomen and children in danger from abuse since its creation in 1994. The \nhotline's number is 1-800-799-SAFE, and I encourage any woman or child \nwho is in an abusive environment to call for help.\n  The original Violence Against Women Act increased penalties for \nrepeat sex offenders, established mandatory restitution to victims of \ndomestic violence, codified much of our existing laws on rape, and \nstrengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. I \nam pleased to support efforts this year that strengthen these laws, \nexpand them to include stalking on the internet and via the mail, and \nextend them to our schools and college campuses.\n  Passage of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill is \nanother important step in the campaign against domestic violence. While \nI am pleased that this historic legislation will soon be on its way to \nthe President for his signature, the fact remains that domestic \nviolence remains a reality for too many women and children in our \ncountry and in South Dakota. I will continue to do all that I can, as a \nmember of the United States Senate and a concerned citizen of South \nDakota, to help victims of domestic violence and work to prevent abuse \nin the first place.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act and I want to commend my colleagues Senator \nBrownback and Senator Wellstone for their hard work on this \nlegislation.\n  Inge had hoped for a better life when she left her home in Veracruz, \nMexico--for legitimate work that would pay her well. She was hoping to \nearn money in a restaurant or a store and earn money to bring back to \nher family.\n  She never expected a smuggling debt of $2,200. She never expected to \nbe beaten and raped until she agreed to have sex with 30 men a day. She \nnever expected to be a slave--especially not in the United States--not \nin Florida.\n  So she got drunk before the men arrived. And when her shift was done, \nshe drank some more. Inge would soak herself in a bathtub filled with \nhot water--drinking, crying, smoking one cigarette after another--\ntrying any way she could to dull the pain. And she would go to sleep \ndrunk or pass out--until the next day when she had to do it all again.\n  Unfortunately, Inge's case is not unique. It is a horrific story \nplayed out every day in countries all over the world. In fact, at least \n50,000 women and children are trafficked into the U.S. each year and at \nleast 700,000 women and children are trafficked worldwide. These women \nand children are forced into the sex industry or forced into harsh \nlabor, often by well organized criminal networks. Traffickers \ndisproportionately target the poor, preying on people in desperate \neconomic situations. They disproportionately target women and girls--\nall of this for money.\n  Trafficking of women and children is more than a crime--it is an \nassault on freedom. It is an assault on that founding principle of our \nnation, ``. . . that all men are created equal, that they are endowed \nby their Creator with certain unalienable rights. . .'' It is an \nassault on the very dignity of humanity.\n  Yet the protections we have against trafficking are inadequate. That \nis why the Trafficking Victims Protection Act is so vital.\n  This legislation takes several approaches to address this human \nrights abuse. It requires expanded reporting by the State Department in \nits annual human rights report on trafficking, including an assessment \nand analysis of international trafficking patterns and the steps \nforeign governments have taken to combat trafficking. It also requires \nthe President to establish an interagency task force to monitor and \ncombat trafficking.\n  As a means of deterring trafficking, the President, through the \nAgency for International Development (AID) must establish initiatives, \nsuch as microlending programs to enhance economic opportunities for \npeople who might be deceived by traffickers' promises of lucrative \njobs. In addition, this legislation establishes certain minimum \nstandards for combating trafficking and authorizes funding through AID \nand other sources to assist countries to meet these standards. The \nPresident can take other punitive measures against countries that fail \nto meet these standards.\n  The bill also creates protections and assistance for victims of \ntrafficking, including a new nonimmigrant ``T'' visa. At the same time, \npunishments for traffickers are increased through asset seizure and \ngreater criminal penalties.\n  All of these provisions are important for strengthening U.S. and \nforeign law and for combating trafficking. I strongly support them.\n  It is a sad consequence of globalization that crime has become more \ninternational in its scope and reach. These seedy sex industries know \nno boundaries. Traffickers use international borders to trap their \nvictims in a foreign land without passports, without the ability to \ncommunicate in the local language, and without hope.\n  But just as trafficking has become global, so must our efforts to \nfight trafficking. That is why I also support an appropriation in the \nCommerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for $1.35\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\nmillion earmarked for the Protection Project. This legal research \ninstitute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies \nis a comprehensive analysis of the problem of international trafficking \nof women and children. Led by Laura Lederer, a dozen researchers have \nbeen documenting the laws of 190 independent states and 63 dependencies \non trafficking, forced prostitution, slavery, debt bondage, \nextradition, and other relevant issues. When it is complete, the \nProtection Project will produce a worldwide legal database on \ntrafficking, along with model legislation for strengthening protections \nand recommendations for policy makers.\n  At the moment, the Protection Project is at a critical phase of \nresearch and funding is crucial. For the last few years, the State \nDepartment's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement \nAffairs has been funding the project, along with private donations made \nto Harvard University, where the project was formerly housed. However, \nwith its transition to Washington and Johns Hopkins, the project has \nlost private funding and has suffered a nine-month delay in its \nresearch.\n  I urge my colleagues on the CJS conference to retain the Senate \nearmark for this project. The research that the project is producing is \ncritical to understanding, fighting, and ultimately winning the war \nagainst international trafficking of women and children.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the adoption of \nthe conference report to H.R. 3244, the Sexual Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act. This conference report contains two pieces of \nlegislation that are critically important for ensuring the safety of \nwomen and their children in our Nation as well as around the world, the \nReauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the \nSexual Trafficking Victims Protection Act. I am extraordinarily pleased \nthat the Senate is finally poised to join our colleagues in the House \nand pass both of these legislative proposals. Although it is \nunfortunate that Congress allowed the Violence Against Women Act to \nexpire at the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2000, today's \naction on this legislation goes a long way towards sending a message to \nbattered women and their children that domestic violence is a national \nconcern deserving the most serious consideration.\n  An important component of the Reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act that is contained in the conference report today is the \nprovision of resources for transitional housing. Due to the fact that \ndomestic violence victims often have no safe place to go, these \nresources are needed to help support a continuum between emergency \nshelter and independent living. Many individuals and families fleeing \ndomestic violence are forced to return to their abusers because of \ninadequate shelter or lack of money. Half of all homeless women and \nchildren are fleeing domestic violence. Even if battered women leave \ntheir abusers to go to a shelter, they often return home because the \nisolation from familiar surroundings, friends, and neighborhood \nresources makes them feel even more vulnerable. Shelters and \ntransitional facilities are often located far from a victim's \nneighborhood. And, if emergency shelter is available, a supply of \naffordable housing and services are needed to keep women from having to \nreturn to a violent home.\n  Due to the importance of ensuring that battered women may access \ntransitional housing, I remain concerned that the conference report \nprovides only a one-year authorization for the transitional housing \nprograms. Consequently, I intend to work closely with my colleagues \nthroughout next year to ensure the continued authorization and funding \nof these critical programs. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to strengthen transitional housing programs for battered \nwomen and their children and I hope they will lend their strong support \nto this effort.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I rise to express my strong support for this conference \nreport. It contains two very important measures: the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act, aimed at combating the scourge of sex \ntrafficking, and the Violence Against Women Act of 2000, aimed at \nreauthorizing and improving on federal programs and other measures \ndesigned to assist in the fight against domestic violence.\n  I would first of all like to extend my compliments to Senator \nBrownback, Congressman Smith, Senator Wellstone, Senator Helms, Senator \nHatch, and others, including their staff, who worked so hard on the \ntrafficking portion of this legislation. The problem of international \nsex trafficking that they have tackled is a particularly ugly one, and \nI commend them for all the work they have invested in devising \neffective means to address it.\n  I would like to concentrate my own remarks on the second half of this \nlegislation, the Violence Against Women Act of 2000. I was proud to be \nan original cosponsor of the Senate version of this bill, and I am very \npleased to see that the efforts of everyone involved are about to \nbecome law.\n  The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has been crucial in reducing \nviolence perpetrated against women and families across America. VAWA \n1994 increased resources for training and law enforcement, and \nbolstered prosecution of child abuse, sexual assault, and domestic \nviolence cases. States have changed the way they treat crimes of \nviolence against women; 24 States and the District of Columbia now \nmandate arrest for most domestic violence offenses.\n  States have also relieved women of some of the costs associated with \nviolence against them. For example, as a result of VAWA, all have some \nprovision for covering the cost of a forensic rape exam. Most notably, \nVAWA 1994 provided much-needed support for shelters and crisis centers, \nfunded rape prevention and education, and created a National Domestic \nViolence Hotline.\n  Nevertheless, much remains to be done. In Michigan alone, in 1998 we \nhad more than 47,000 incidents of domestic violence, including 46 \nhomicides. About 85 percent of the victims of those incidents were \nwomen. We must continue to do what we can to deter and prevent this \nkind of violence, and to make services available to its victims.\n  The legislation before us today continues the important work begun in \n1994 by reauthorizing these important programs. And make no mistake \nabout it, we must do so if we are to continue with the progress we have \nmade.\n  In Michigan, for example, despite our much heightened awareness of \nthe devastating impact of sexual abuse, in many communities VAWA grants \nare the only source of funding for services for rape victims. I am told \nthat this is true nationally as well. Forty-five shelters serving 83 \ncounties receive funding from VAWA grants. Reauthorizing VAWA is \ncritical so as to provide the assurance of continued congressional \ncommitment needed to ensure that these services do not dry up.\n\n  That is why I am so delighted that this conference report is about to \nbe enacted into law. I would especially like to note how pleased I am \nwith the results the conference reached on a couple of particular \nprovisions.\n  First, I would like to discuss the funding the bill provides for rape \neducation, services to victims, and prevention. This critical funding \nis used for, among other things, helping survivors of rape and sexual \nassault come to terms with what has happened to them so that they are \nable to get on with their lives and also assist in the prosecution of \nthe perpetrators of these crimes. It is also used to educate \ninvestigators and medical personnel on the best protocols to use to \ncollect evidence in these cases.\n  I would like to give a few examples of instances of how this is \nworking in Michigan. A 21-year-old single woman was raped. She became \npregnant as a result of the rape. She decided that she wanted to carry \nthe baby to term. She had to deal with her own very complex emotions \nabout her pregnancy, her changed relationship with her boyfriend, and \nthe enormous difficulties of raising a child as a single parent. The \nVAWA money for rape services funded the counseling to help her with \nthis overwhelmingly difficult set of decisions and circumstances.\n  VAWA rape money also funded services for a 63-year-old woman who was \nsexually assaulted. With that help, she was able to come to terms with \nwhat had happened, and testify against the rapist.\n  To give just one more example: VAWA rape money is being used right\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\nnow to fund a new sexual assault nurse examining program. This program \nprovides a sympathetic and expert place for survivors to go after they \nhave been assaulted where they will be treated with respect and \nunderstanding and where the evidence will be collected correctly.\n  The reason I have come to know so much about this particular aspect \nof VAWA is that when my wife Jane met with the Michigan Coalition \nAgainst Domestic and Sexual Violence in Oakland County on June 30 of \nthis year, its director, Mary Keefe, indicated to her that while she \nwas generally very pleased with the reauthorization legislation we were \nworking on here in the Senate, the $50 million we were proposing for \nthis particular aspect of VAWA, the rape education and prevention \ncomponent, just wasn't enough. She indicated her hope that we would be \nable to raise that to the $80 million figure in the House bill. Jane \npassed that along to me, and once I understood how this money was used \nand was able to explain how important it was, with Senator Hatch's and \nSenator Biden's assistance, the Senate proposal was increased to $60 \nmillion.\n  I continued to follow this matter as the bill was progressing through \nconference. Yesterday I was delighted to be able to tell my staff to \nlet Ms. Keefe know that the conference bill accommodates her request \nfully, and authorizes $80 million in funding for these grants for the \nnext 5 years. One important purpose for which I am sure some of these \nfunds will be used is educating our kids about relatively less well \nknown drugs like GHB, the date rape drug that claimed the life of one \nof my constituents and was the subject of legislation I worked on \nearlier this Congress.\n  Second, I am pleased that the conference report contains the new \nFederal law against cyberstalking that I introduced a few months ago. \nAs the Internet, with all its positives, has fast become an integral \npart of our personal and professional lives, it is regrettable but \nunsurprising that criminals are becoming adept at using the Internet as \nwell.\n  Hence the relatively new crime of ``cyberstalking,'' in which a \nperson uses the Internet to engage in a course of conduct designed to \nterrorize another. Stalking someone in this way can be more attractive \nto the perpetrator than doing it in person, since cyberstalkers can \ntake advantage of the ease of the Internet and their relative anonymity \nonline to be even more brazen in their threatening behavior than they \nmight be in person.\n  Some jurisdictions are doing an outstanding job in cracking down on \nthis kind of conduct. For example, in my own State, Oakland County \nSheriff Michael J. Bouchard and Oakland County Prosecutor Dave Gorcyca \nhave developed very impressive knowledge and expertise about how to \npursue cyberstalkers.\n  This legislation will not supplant their efforts. It will, however, \naddress cases that it is difficult for a single State to pursue on its \nown, those where the criminal is stalking a victim in another State. In \nsuch cases, where the criminal is deliberately using the means of \ninterstate commerce to place his or her victim in reasonable fear of \nserious bodily injury, my bill will allow the Federal Government to \nprosecute that person.\n  The existence of a Federal law in this area should also help \nencourage local authorities who do not know where to start when \nconfronted with a cyberstalking allegation to turn to Federal \nauthorities for advice and assistance. There is little worse than the \nfeeling of helplessness a person can get if he or she is being \nterrorized and just cannot get help from the police. Much of VAWA 2000 \nis aimed at helping the authorities that person turns to respond more \neffectively. That is a central function of the cyberstalking provisions \nas well.\n  Finally, I am very pleased that the conference report includes the \ncore provisions from the Senate bill that I developed along with \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and Senator Biden to address ways in \nwhich our immigration laws remain susceptible of misuse by abusive \nspouses as a tool to blackmail and control the abuse victim.\n  This potential arises out of the derivative nature of the immigration \nstatus of a noncitizen or lawful permanent resident spouse's \nimmigration status. Generally speaking, that spouse's right to be in \nthe U.S. derives from the citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse's \nright to file immigration papers seeking to have the immigration member \nof the couple be granted lawful permanent residency.\n  In the vast majority of cases, granting that right to the citizen or \nlawful permanent resident spouse makes sense. After all, the purpose of \nfamily immigration is to allow U.S. citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents to live here with their spouses and children. But in the \nunusual case of the abusive relationship, an abusive citizen or lawful \npermanent resident can use control over his or her spouse's visa as a \nmeans to blackmail and control the spouse. The abusive spouse can do \nthis by withholding a promised visa petition and then threatening to \nturn the abused spouse in to the immigration authorities if the abused \nspouse sought to leave the abuser or report the abuse.\n  VAWA 1994 changed this by allowing immigrants who demonstrate that \nthey have been battered or subject to extreme cruelty by their U.S. \ncitizen or lawful permanent resident spouses to file their own \npetitions for visas without the cooperation of their abusive spouse.\n  VAWA 1994 also allowed abused spouses placed in removal proceedings \nto seek ``cancellation of removal,'' a form of discretionary relief \nfrom removal available to individuals in unlawful immigration status \nwith strong equities, after three years rather than the seven \nordinarily required. Finally, VAWA 1994 granted similar rights to minor \nchildren abused by their citizen or lawful permanent resident parent, \nwhose immigration status, like that of the abused spouse, would \notherwise be dependent on the abusive parent.\n  The conference report follows the Senate VAWA reauthorization bill in \nbuilding on the important work of VAWA 1994 in these areas. I will not \ndescribe all of the provisions of title V of division B of this bill, \nbut I will discuss one of them, which I believe is the most important \none.\n  In this bill, we establish procedures under which a battered \nimmigrant can take all the steps he or she needs to take to become a \nlawful permanent resident without leaving this country. Right now, no \nsuch mechanism is available to a battered immigrant, who can begin the \nprocess here but must return to his or her home country to complete it.\n  VAWA 1994 created a mechanism for the immigrant to take the first \nstep, the filing of an application to be classified as a battered \nimmigrant spouse or child. But it did not create a mechanism for him or \nher to obtain the necessary papers to get lawful permanent residency \nwhile staying in the U.S. That is because at the time it was enacted, \nthere was a general mechanism available to many to adjust here, which \nhas since been eliminated. As a result, under current law, the battered \nimmigrant has to go back to his or her home country, get a visa, and \nreturn here in order to adjust status.\n  That is not true of spouses whose citizens or lawful permanent \nresident husband or wife is filing immigration papers for them. They do \nhave a mechanism for completing the whole process here. Section 1503 of \nthis bill gives the abused spouse that same right.\n  The importance of such a provision is demonstrated, for example, by \nthe case of a battered immigrant whose real name I will not use, but \nwhom I will instead call Yaa. I use her as an example because her case \narose in my own State of Michigan.\n  Yaa is a 38-year-old mother of two from Nigeria. She met her husband, \nwhom I will call Martin, while he was visiting family members in \nNigeria. After a long courtship, Martin persuaded Yaa to marry him and \njoin him in the United States. He told her he would help her further \nher education and file the necessary papers to enable her to become a \nlawful permanent resident.\n  Following their marriage, Martin assisted Yaa in obtaining a \nvisitor's visa. When she arrived in the United States, however, he did \nnot follow through on any of his promises. He refused to support her \ngoing to school, and indeed would not let her leave the house for fear \nthat other men might find her attractive and steal her away. He also \nrefused to file immigration papers for her\n\n[[Page S10220]]\n\nand threatened her with deportation if she ever disobeyed his orders.\n  After the birth of their first child, Martin began physically abusing \nYaa. He slapped her if she questioned his authority or asked about her \nimmigration status. He spat on her if she refused to have sex with him. \nHe used a hidden recording device to tape all of her phone \nconversations. As a result, she came to feel that she was a prisoner in \nher own home.\n  On one occasion, Martin beat Yaa with his fists and a bottle of \nalcohol. Yaa suffered severe facial injuries and had to be rushed to a \nhospital by ambulance for treatment. This incident resulted in Martin's \narrest and prosecution for domestic violence. Martin retaliated by \nrefusing to pay the mortgage, buy food, or other necessities. At that \npoint, with the help of her best friend, Yaa moved out, found a job, \nand filed a self-petition under VAWA. INS approved her self-petition, \nand Yaa has obtained a restraining order against Martin.\n  Unfortunately, she still has to go to Nigeria to obtain a visa in \norder to complete the process of becoming a lawful permanent resident. \nAnd this is a major problem. Martin's family in Nigeria blames her for \nMartin's conviction. They have called her from there and threatened to \nhave her deported because she ``brought shame'' to the family. They \nalso know where she lives in Nigeria and they have threatened to hurt \nher and kidnap the children if she comes back. She has no one in the \nU.S. to leave the children with if she were to return alone. She is \nalso frightened of what Martin's family will do to her if she sets foot \nin Nigeria.\n  Yaa should be allowed to complete the process of becoming a lawful \npermanent resident here in the United States, without facing these \nrisks. Our legislation will give her the means to do so.\n  Of all the victims of domestic abuse, the immigrant dependent on an \nabusive spouse for her right to be in this country faces some of the \nmost severe problems. In addition to the ordinary difficulties that \nconfront anyone trying to deal with an abusive relationship, the \nbattered immigrant also is afraid that if she goes to the authorities, \nshe risks deportation at the instance of her abusive spouse, and either \nhaving her children deported too or being separated from them and \nunable to protect them.\n  We in Congress who write the immigration laws have a responsibility \nto do what we can to make sure they are not misused in this fashion. \nThat is why I am so pleased that the final version of this legislation \nincludes this and other important provisions.\n  I would like to extend special thanks to Senator Kennedy and his \nstaff, especially Esther Olavarria, who has worked tirelessly on this \nportion of the bill; to Senator Hatch and his staff, especially Sharon \nProst, whose assistance in crafting these provisions and willingness to \ninvest time, effort and capital in making the case for them has been \nindispensable; to Senator Biden and his staff, especially Bonnie Robin-\nVergeer, whose commitment to these provisions has likewise been vital; \nto House Judiciary Committee Chairman Hyde and House Crime Subcommittee \nChairman Bill McCollum, for their support at key moments; to the \nindefatigable Leslye Orloff of the NOW Legal Defense Fund, whose \nability to come up with the ``one more thing'' desperately needed by \nbattered immigrants is matched only by her good humor and \nprofessionalism in recognizing that the time for compromise has come; \nand to the sponsors of H.R. 3244 and S. 2449, for allowing their bill \nto become the vehicle for this important legislation.\n  I would also like to thank all of the organizations in Michigan that \nhave been working so hard to help in the fight against domestic and \nsexual violence. I would like to extend particular thanks to a couple \nof the people there who have been particularly helpful to me, to my \nwife Jane, and to members of my office as we have been learning about \nthese issues: to Mary Keefe of the Michigan Coalition Against Domestic \nand Sexual Violence, whom I mentioned earlier; to Hedy Nuriel and \nDeborah Danton of Haven; to Shirley Pascale of the Council Against \nDomestic Assault; to Deborah Patterson of Turning Point, and to Valerie \nHoffman of the Underground Railroad.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with the passage of the Violence Against \nWomen Act in 1994, the Federal Government for the first time adopted a \ncomprehensive approach to combating violence against women. This bill \nincluded tough new criminal penalties and also created new grant \nprograms to help both women and children who are victims of family \nviolence.\n  Since that time, violence against women has significantly decreased. \nBut in spite of these improvements, far more needs to be done.\n  Every 20 seconds a woman is raped and/or physically assaulted by an \nintimate partner and nearly one-third of women murdered each year are \nkilled by a husband or boyfriend.\n  Domestic violence still remains the leading cause of injury to women \nages 15 to 44 and sadly, there are children under the age of twelve in \napproximately four out of ten houses that experience domestic violence.\n  Many victims of domestic violence are not recognized and therefore do \nnot get the help that they need.\n  I am happy to report that the conference report includes several \nprovisions that I authored with Senator Collins to assist both older \nand disabled women who are the victims of domestic violence. Those \nprovisions were part of S. 1987, the Older and Disabled Women's \nProtection from Violence Act.\n  Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. \nThose who perpetrate violence against their family members do not stop \nbecause the family member grows older. Neither do they stop because the \nfamily member is disabled. To the contrary, several studies show that \nthe disabled suffer prolonged abuse compared to non-disabled domestic \nviolence victims. Violence is too often perpetrated on those who are \nmost vulnerable.\n  In some cases, the abuse may become severe as the victim ages or as \ndisability increases and the victim becomes more isolated from the \ncommunity with their removal from the workforce. Other age-related \nfactors such as increased frailty may increase a victim's \nvulnerability.\n  It also is true that older and disabled victims' ability to report \nabuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser for \ncare or housing.\n  Every 7 minutes in Illinois, there is an incidence of elder abuse.\n  Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most \nunder reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than \nchild abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen \nincidents estimated to be reported.\n  National and State specific statistics are not available for domestic \nabuse against disabled individuals. However, several studies of \nspecific areas indicate that abuse is of longer duration for women with \ndisabilities compared to women without a disability. Canadian studies \nover the last decade indicate that the incidence in that country at \nleast of battery for women with disabilities was 1.5 times higher than \nfor women without a disability. 3 other independent studies indicated \nthat ``Regardless of age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or class, \nwomen with disabilities are assaulted, raped and abused at a rate of \nmore than two times greater than non-disabled women'' Sobsey 1994, \nCusitar 1994, DisAbled Women's Network 1988.\n  Older and disabled individuals who experience abuse worry they will \nbe banished to a nursing home or institutions if they report abuse.\n  Many older women were raised to believe that family business is a \nprivate matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed with \nanyone, especially strangers or counselors.\n  They also must struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse \nby their children to the authorities and thus increasing their child's \nlikelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they \nremain ``silent victims.''\n  Disabled women also wrestle with the fear that they may lose their \nchildren in a custody case if they report abuse.\n  This bill includes modifications of the STOP law enforcement state \ngrants program and the ProArrest grants program to increase their \nsensitivity to the needs of older and disabled women. These programs \nprovide funding for services and training for officers and prosecutors \nfor dealing with domestic\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\nviolence. This training needs to be sensitive to the needs of all \nvictims, young and old, disabled and non-disabled. The images portrayed \nin the media of the victims of domestic violence generally depict a \nyoung woman, with small children. Consequently, many people including \nlaw enforcement officers may not readily identify older or disabled \nvictims as suffering domestic abuse.\n\n  Only a handful of domestic abuse programs throughout the country are \nreaching out to older and disabled women and law enforcement rarely \nreceive training in identifying victims who are either older or \ndisabled.\n  The bill also sets up a new training program for law enforcement, \nprosecutors and others to appropriately identify, screen and refer \nolder and disabled women who are the victims of domestic violence.\n  Improvement in this program can be made with respect to identifying \nabuse among all age groups especially seniors who are often overlooked. \nWhen the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the part of law \nenforcement to deal with this person in the same way that they might \ndeal with a younger person. Who wants to send an ``old guy'' to jail? \nHowever, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because then the \nabuser has every reason to believe that there are no consequences for \ntheir actions. Another common problem is differentiating between \ninjuries related to abuse and injuries arising from aging, frailty or \nillness. Too many older or disabled women's broken bones have been \nattributed to disorientation, osteoporosis, or other age-related \nvulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure that \nthey are not the result of abuse.\n  With the graying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in \nall its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we \nneed to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence \nprograms and ensure that these programs serve seniors and are sensitive \nand knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse.\n  In addition, the disabled's injuries may be falsely attributed to \ntheir disability and the bill authorizes a new program for education \nand training for the needs of disabled victims of domestic violence.\n  I thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Biden for working with me to \ninclude these provisions that should help to ensure that Federal Anti-\nFamily Violence Programs are indeed available for all victims whether \nyoung or old, or whether able-bodied or a woman with a disability.\n  In just the past year, the Supreme Court offered an important ruling \non the Violence Against Women Act. The decision was certainly not one \nthat I would have hoped for.\n  In the case of U.S. v. Morrison, the Supreme Court struck down a \nprovision of the Violence Against Women Act that gave victims of rape \nand domestic violence the right to sue their attackers in federal \ncourt. Congress passed this law to give women an additional means of \npursuing justice when they are the victims of assault. We passed this \nlaw because the States themselves did not always adequately pursue \nrapists and assailants. And the States acknowledged this.\n  Thirty-six States had entered this suit on behalf of the woman who \nhad been victimized. They wanted victims of violence against women to \nretain the right to bring their attackers to court. But the Supreme \nCourt, in a narrow vote, decided otherwise. The vote: five to four.\n  This action by the Senate reauthorizing the Violence Against Women \nAct will overcome that court decision.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to offer my strong support \nfor the conference report on H.R. 3244, a bill that will strengthen our \nlaws in order to protect women, children and all victims of domestic \nviolence. The conference report that we will vote on today includes \nseveral sections, each of which provides additional protections for \nvulnerable members of society.\n  First, the bill contains the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nlegislation that has been the passion of the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback, and the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone. This \nlegislation will combat sexual trafficking of women and children--the \ndeepest violation of human dignity and an unspeakable tragedy. Second, \nthe conference report contains a bill that we have heard a lot about in \nthe last several weeks--the reauthorization of the Violence Against \nWomen Act--to provide funding for programs to combat domestic violence \nand assist victims of domestic violence--both male and female. The \noriginal Violence Against Women Act authorization expired on October 1, \n2000, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the reauthorization bill \nsponsored by Senators Hatch and Biden (S. 2787). The third main section \nof the bill contains anti-crime measures including provisions to \nencourage States to incarcerate, for long prison terms, individuals \nconvicted of murder, rape, and dangerous sexual offenses. Together, \nthese provisions form a comprehensive approach to fighting abuse \nagainst the most vulnerable members of society.\n  It is tragic that as we stand on the brink of the 21st Century the \nworld is still haunted by the practice of international trafficking of \nwomen and children for sex, forced labor and for other purposes that \nviolate basic human rights. The frequency of these practices is \nfrightening. For example, an estimated 10,000 women from the former \nSoviet Union have been forced into prostitution in Israel; two million \nchildren are forced into prostitution every year, half of them in Asia; \nand more than 50,000 women are trafficked into the United States every \nyear. Unfortunately, existing laws in the United States and other \ncountries are inadequate to deter trafficking, primarily because they \ndo not reflect the gravity of the offenses involved. Where countries do \nhave laws against sexual trafficking, there is too often no \nenforcement. For example, in 1995, the Netherlands prosecuted 155 cases \nof forced prostitution, and only four resulted in the conviction of the \ntraffickers. In some countries, enforcement against traffickers is \nhindered by indifference, corruption, and even official participation.\n  The conference report before us seeks to improve the lives of women \nand children around the world by providing severe punishment for \npersons convicted of operating trafficking enterprises within the \nUnited States and the possibility of severe economic penalties against \ntraffickers located in other countries. In addition, it provides \nassistance and protection for victims, including authorization of \ngrants to shelters and rehabilitation programs, and a limited provision \nfor relief from deportation for victims who would face retribution or \nother hardships if deported. The bill also creates an Interagency Task \nForce to monitor and combat trafficking, in order to facilitate and \nevaluate progress in trafficking prevention, victim assistance, and the \nprosecution of traffickers. I would like to thank the Senator from \nKansas for his tireless work on this issue, and am pleased to support \nthis legislation.\n\n  The second main section of this conference report, the Violence \nAgainst Women Act (VAWA) of 2000, reauthorizes the Violence Against \nWomen Act through Fiscal Year 2005. VAWA contains a number of grant \nprograms, including the STOP grants, Pro-Arrest grants, Rural Domestic \nViolence and Child Abuse Enforcement grants, the National Domestic \nViolence Hotline, and three programs for victims of child abuse, \nincluding the court-appointed special advocate program (CASA). In \naddition, there are targeted improvements to the original language that \nhave been made, such as providing funding for transitional housing \nassistance, expanding several of the key grant programs to cover \nviolence that arises in dating relationships, and authorizing grants \nfor legal assistance for victims of domestic violence, stalking, and \nsexual assault.\n  There is another issue that has been raised recently and that is the \neligibility of men to receive benefits and services under the original \nViolence Against Women Act and under this bill. It was the original \nintent of this legislation to direct federal funds toward the most \npressing problem--that of domestic violence against women, and violence \nagainst women in particular, since the statistics show that the \nmajority of domestic violence is perpetrated against women. But \nalthough women are more often victims of such violence than men, it \ndoes not mean that men are never victims, or that the problems of \ndomestic violence when men are victims should be ignored. It was not, \nand is not, the intent of Congress to exclude men who have suffered\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\ndomestic abuse or sexual assaults from receiving benefits and services \nunder the Violence Against Women Act. Maybe the bill should be renamed \nthe ``Stop Domestic Violence Act'' in order to more accurately reflect \nthe purposes of this bill. The Act defines such key terms as ``domestic \nviolence'' and ``sexual assault,'' which are used to determine \neligibility under several of the grant programs, in gender-neutral \nlanguage. Men who have suffered these types of violent attacks are \neligible under current law to apply for services and benefits that are \nfunded under the original Act--and they will remain eligible under the \nViolence Against Women Act of 2000--whether it be for shelter space \nunder the Family Violence Protection and Services Act, or counseling by \nthe National Domestic Violence Hotline, or legal assistance in \nobtaining a protection order under the Legal Assistance for Victims \nprogram. I am pleased that this clarification was added to this bill.\n  I am committed to confronting domestic violence because I believe \nthat all forms of violence and crime destroy lives, hopes, and \nopportunities. All citizens should be safe from violence at home, in \ntheir neighborhoods and at schools. Protecting public safety is a \nfundamental duty of government, and we must make it clear to criminals \nthat if they commit crime and violence, they will be punished swiftly \nand severely.\n  Domestic violence has been a problem in the State of Missouri. In \n1999, according to data from the Highway Patrol Criminal Records \nDivision, there were 754 incidents for every 100,000 Missourians. This \nnumber is too high, despite the fact that it has been falling from a \nhigh of 815/100,000 in 1997. The early nineties saw a disturbing rise \nin domestic violence reports, from 657 per 100,000 Missourians in 1993 \nto the high in 1997.\n\n  I have worked aggressively in the past, while in service to the state \nof Missouri, to confront domestic violence. As Governor, I established \na special Task Force on Domestic Violence. This task force conducted a \ncomprehensive review of domestic violence in Missouri and researched \nthe efficiency of various programs and services for victims of abuse. \nAdditionally, I supported the Adult Abuse Act of 1989, which provided \nnew protection against domestic violence as well as new services for \nvictims.\n  October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I would like \nto enter into the Record an article by Doctor Hank Clever, a well-known \npediatrician in St. Charles, Missouri. This article appeared in The St. \nCharles County Post, on October 2, 2000. Dr. Clever outlines the \nseverity of the problem of domestic violence and provides a checklist \nof behaviors that may help one distinguish if you or someone you know \nis being abused.\n  The conference report we are voting on today provides real tools to \ncombat violence against women and children, here in the United States \nand around the world, as well as new resources to curb domestic \nviolence of all types. I support this conference report and thank \nSenator Brownback for his leadership in the fight against sex-\ntrafficking, Senators Hatch and Biden for their work in the \nreauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and the other \nmembers of the Conference Committee for their success in fashioning \nsuch strong legislation.\n  There being no objections, this article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n         [From the St. Charles County (MO) Post, Oct. 2, 2000]\n\n  Domestic Violence, in All Forms, Is the Leading Cause of Injury for \n                            Women Ages 15-44\n\n                          (By Dr. Hank Clever)\n\n       Hank Clever is a well-known pediatrician in St. Charles. \n     Since retiring from private practice in 1998, Dr. Clever has \n     continued to speak to community groups and organizations \n     about a variety of health-related topics. The Doctor Is In \n     column runs each Monday in the St. Charles County Post.

Domestic violence affects everyone in the community--\n     abuser, victim, children, family, employers, co-workers and \n     friends. The U.S. surgeon general says domestic violence is \n     the leading cause of injury to women ages 15-44. Domestic \n     violence is more common than rapes, muggings and auto \n     accidents combined.\n       Domestic violence isn't limited by socioeconomic status, \n     race, ethnicity, age, education, employment status, physical \n     ability or marital status. And, although some men are abused \n     by women, the majority of domestic violence victims are \n     female, making domestic violence one of the most serious \n     public health issues facing women today.\n       Cathy Blair is with the AWARE program. AWARE stands for \n     Assisting Women with Advocacy, Resources and Education. She \n     is working with the staff at SSM St. Joseph Health Center, \n     SSM St. Joseph Hospital West and the Catholic Community \n     Services of St. Charles County to present a program called \n     ``Strengthening Our Response: The Role of Health Care \n     Provider in Ending Domestic Violence'' on Thursday, Oct. 12, \n     at St. Joseph Health Center.\n       ``Health care providers are often on the front lines to \n     recognize abuse. Their response to the victim and the abuser \n     can be crucial to proper treatment not only of the immediate \n     trauma, but also long-term problem of abuse,'' Blair told me.\n       When most people think of domestic violence, they think of \n     battered women. However, domestic violence can take many \n     forms, including psychological abuse, emotional abuse, \n     economic abuse, sexual abuse and even legal abuse when a \n     women tries to leave an unhealthy relationship.\n       ``Recognizing what behaviors are part of domestic violence \n     is not always easy, even for victims themselves,'' Blair \n     said. ``This is in part because domestic violence is much \n     more than physical abuse.''\n       Blair offers the following checklist of behaviors that may \n     help you distinguish if you or someone you know is being \n     abused:\n       Does your partner use emotional and psychological control--\n     call you names, yell, put you down, constantly criticize or \n     undermine you and your abilities, behave in an overprotective \n     way, become extremely jealous, make it difficult for you to \n     see family or friends, bad-mouth you to family and friends, \n     prevent you from going where you want to, or humiliate and \n     embarrass you in front of other people?\n       Does your partner use economic control--deny you access to \n     family assets such as bank accounts, credit cards or car, \n     control all the finances, make you account for what you \n     spend, or take your money, prevent you from getting or \n     keeping a job or from going to school, limit your access to \n     health, prescription or dental insurance?\n       Does your partner make threats--make you afraid by using \n     looks, actions or gestures, threaten to report you to the \n     authorities for something you didn't do, threaten to harm or \n     kidnap the children, display weapons as a way of making you \n     afraid, use his anger as a threat to get what he wants?\n       Does your partner commit acts of physical violence--carry \n     out threats to you, your children, pets, family members, \n     friends, or himself, destroy personal property or throw \n     things around, grab, push, hit, punch, slap, kick, choke, or \n     bite you, force you to have sex when you don't want to, \n     engage in sexual acts that you don't want to do, prevent \n     you from taking medications or getting medical care, deny \n     you access to foods, fluids or sleep?\n       If any of these things are happening in your relationship, \n     Blair wants you to know that you are not alone and you have a \n     right to be safe. ``Millions of women are abused by their \n     partners every year,'' she said. ``For free, safe and \n     confidential services, call AWARE at 314-362-9273.''\n       In addition to AWARE, many other domestic violence \n     resources, including shelters, support services and legal \n     services are available. The AWARE staff will be happy to give \n     you that information.\n       Physicians, nurses, social workers, risk managers, students \n     and Allied Health professionals who would like to learn more \n     about domestic violence and the important role they can play \n     in identifying and stopping it, should plan to attend the \n     program. The conference is free and includes complimentary \n     parking and lunch, but registration in required. Call 636-\n     947-5621 for more information and to register.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I rise to support the passage of \nH.R. 3244, a bill to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. \nIn 1994, when I voted in favor of the Violence Against Women Act I \nsupported the purposes of the legislation and I believed the grants \nauthorized in VAWA would provide the resources needed by New Mexico \norganizations, local governments and tribal governments to\n\n[[Page S10223]]\n\ntackle the growing problem of domestic violence. Now it is six years \nlater and I am pleased to report that I have witnessed first-hand the \nmany benefits of VAWA to New Mexico. I now realize how important VAWA \nwas to New Mexico and I fully appreciate the strides New Mexico was \nable to make as a result of this legislation. Women and families in New \nMexico have benefitted tremendously from VAWA and I rise today to lend \nmy support to passage of VAWA II.\n  In New Mexico, we now have several organizations that are devoted to \nstopping violence against women. One example is the PeaceKeepers \nDomestic Violence Program based at San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico. \nPeaceKeepers is a domestic violence program that serves individuals \nthat reside within the Eight Northern Pueblos which include the pueblos \nof Nambe, Picuris, Pojoaque, San Ildefonso, San Juan, Santa Clara, \nTesuque and Taos. Peacekeepers is a consortium of individuals and is \ncomprised of social workers, counselors, victims advocates, a civil \nattorney and a prosecutor. Because of VAWA grants, PeaceKeepers has \nbeen able to implement a comprehensive approach to address domestic \nviolence in Indian Country.\n  The social workers and counselors provide counseling to victims, \nbatterers and children of victims. Approximately twenty men have \ncompleted the 24 week batterers therapy program and are working to \nimprove their lives and the lives of their families. The victims \nadvocates provide support in court, assist with obtaining and enforcing \nprotection orders and aid victims with legal matters and basic housing \nneeds. The prosecutor on the Peacekeepers panel is made possible \nbecause of a VAWA Rural Victimization grant.\n  PeaceKeepers also provides training for tribal courts, law \nenforcement and tribal government personnel on domestic violence \nissues. The civil attorney also assists victims with legal assistance \non matters such as child support, custody issues and protection orders. \nSafety for victims and accountability for offenders is the primary goal \nof PeaceKeepers. In the end, PeaceKeepers is about providing \ninformation, options and advocacy to victims of domestic violence.\n  When VAWA passed in 1994, the States and local organizations were \nfinally provided with the resources they needed to implement programs \nto respond to the problem of violence against women. I am told \nrepeatedly by sheriffs in counties throughout New Mexico that their \nurgent calls are usually the result of a domestic violence situation \noccurring. While VAWA has not stopped domestic violence from occuring, \nit has provided law enforcement agencies and courts with the training \nand resources they need to respond to domestic violence cases. Most \nimportantly, VAWA has provided States and local organizations with the \nresources to begin tackling the underlying problems of domestic \nviolence and given them resources to develop innovative methods to \nstart breaking the cycle of violence in our communities.\n  Another organization in New Mexico that I am proud to support is the \nEsperanza Domestic Violence Shelter in northern New Mexico. I became \nacquainted with Esperanza a few years ago when they approached me \nbecause they were having trouble meeting the needs of their community. \nEsperanza operates in four counties and in 1998, Esperanza helped more \nthan 2,000 people, including 1,100 victims of domestic violence, 510 \nchildren and teens and 424 abusers. As the name indicates, Esperanza \noffers women and families hope. Hope that they can live in a safe home, \nhope that they can survive outside of an abusive relationship and hope \nthat they can offer a better life for their children. Esperanza has \nprovided the supportive services needed for victims that reside in the \nextensive rural areas of New Mexico--victims who were often overlooked \nbefore VAWA.\n  I am very disappointed that it has taken so long for the Senate to \ntake up and reauthorize VAWA. Last year when the reauthorization bill \nwas introduced by Senator Biden, I agreed to cosponsor the legislation \nbecause I understand the importance of VAWA to New Mexico. Since 1994, \nNew Mexico agencies have received over $17 million in VAWA grants. \nThese VAWA grants have reached all four corners of my state and they \nhave impacted the lives of thousands of New Mexicans.\n  One of the benefits of VAWA is that it authorized grants to address a \nvariety of problems associated with violence against women. In 1999, \nNorthern New Mexico Legal Services, Inc. received $318,500 under the \nCivil Legal Assistance grant program. In 1998, the City of Albuquerque \nreceived $482,168 under the Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies grant \nprogram. And between 1996 and this year, 20 New Mexico organizations \nreceived grants under the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse grant \nprogram--20 grants totaling over $6.5 million.\n\n  In addition, Indian tribes in New Mexico have benefitted \nsignificantly from the passage of VAWA. So far, nine tribal governments \nand tribal-related organizations received nearly $2 million in grants \nunder the Violence Against Women Discretionary Grants for Indian \nPrograms. I am pleased to see that the pueblos of Acoma, Jemez, Laguna, \nSan Felipe, Santa Ana and Zuni have been proactive and sought out these \nVAWA grants to make their pueblos a safer place for women and a better \nplace for families. The State of New Mexico has also benefitted \nenormously from VAWA. Since 1995, the New Mexico Crime Victims \nReparations Commission has been awarded over $6 million in VAWA funds.\n  Unless VAWA is reauthorized, domestic violence shelters in New Mexico \nwill be closed, rape crisis centers will be shut down and thousands of \nvictims of violence will be left without the options they have been \nprovided under VAWA. This isn't speculation. I have received calls from \npolice chiefs, shelter directors, church leaders, and other citizens \nwho have told me that they will have to shut down their programs unless \nVAWA is reauthorized. Moreover, many prosecutors in New Mexico will \nlose the resources they have utilized to prosecute crimes against \nwomen. Because of the objections to bringing up VAWA for debate in the \nSenate, the original VAWA was allowed to expire on September 30th. That \nshould not have happened. The House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly in favor of reauthorizing VAWA by a vote of 415-3 before \nVAWA expired. We need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and \nwe need to do it now.\n  While violence in the United States has fallen dramatically over the \npast 6 years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost one-\nthird of women murdered each year are killed by a husband or boyfriend. \nI believe the drop in crime we have experienced over the past 6 years \nis partly attributable to the passage of VAWA and the resources it made \navailable to combat violence against women. We should not turn back the \nclock and go back to the level of violence we experienced in 1993. We \nshould not go back to the days when people did not discuss domestic \nviolence and women in abusive relationships lacked options for them and \ntheir children.\n  I commend Senator Leahy and Senator Biden for their work on VAWA and \ntheir commitment to stopping domestic violence in this country. The \namendments to VAWA will take the program further and expand the number \nof people benefitting from VAWA grants. I am pleased that the amount \navailable for use by Indian tribal governments under the STOP grants \nwas increased from 4 percent to 5 percent. In addition, 5 percent of \nthe $40 million Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement \ngrants will be set aside for use by Indian tribal governments in the \nnew bill.\n  I am also pleased to see that institutions of higher education will \nbe provided with resources to address violence on college campuses. \nSchools will now be able to utilize $30 million in VAWA grants to \ninstall lighting and other deterrent measures to enhance the security \nof their campuses.\n  I also support the addition of transitional housing assistance to the \nVAWA. Many individuals who stay in abusive relationships often do so \nbecause they are financially dependent on their abuser. Transitional \nhousing assistance will provide these victims and their families with \ntemporary housing while they regain their financial independence.\n  The battered immigrant women provision is also important to many New\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\nMexico residents. No longer will battered immigrant women and children \nbe faced with deportation for reporting an abuser on whom they may be \ndependent on for an immigration benefit. No person residing in the \nUnited States should be immune from prosecution for committing a \nviolent crime because of a loophole in an immigration law.\n  Mr. President, VAWA is worthy legislation that is good for New Mexico \nand women and families across the country. VAWA should be reauthorized \nand passed in the form proposed today.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to enthusiastically support \nthis conference report which contains the important reauthorization of \nthe Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).\n  Over five years ago, Congress recognized the need for the Federal \nGovernment to take action and help combat domestic violence by passing \nVAWA. I was proud to be a cosponsor of that important legislation and \nhave been pleased with the positive impact it has had in Vermont and \naround the United States.\n  The Vermont Network Against Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault has \nbeen a leader in creating innovative and effective programs toward our \ngoal of eliminating domestic violence. Vermont has used funding under \nVAWA to provide shelter to battered women and their children and \n``wrap-around'' services for these victimized families. Through VAWA, \nVermont has also been able to help victims access legal assistance in \nthe form of trained attorneys and advocacy services. In addition to \nfully utilizing funding available to train and educate law enforcement \nand court personnel, I am proud to say that Vermont is a national \nleader in the education and training of health care, welfare and family \nservice workers who are likely to come in contact with victims of \ndomestic violence.\n  While we have made advances in combating domestic violence in Vermont \nand all around the United States by programs funded through VAWA, there \nis still more work to be done. Every nine seconds across the country an \nindividual falls victim to domestic violence. Recently, this statistic \nwas brought home when churches and town halls in Vermont rang their \nbells in recognition and to raise awareness of this tragic violence \nthat impacts so many lives. We must continue and strengthen our focus \non this important issue.\n  I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this reauthorization when \nit was introduced this June, and feel that this legislation made many \nimportant improvements and additions to the programs and funding of \nVAWA while ensuring the maintenance of its core focus of combating \ndomestic violence. Some important provisions of this legislation to \nVermont include:\n  Reauthorization of current domestic violence programs through the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and increasing funding for \nthese programs so they can provide more shelter space to accommodate \nmore people in need;\n  Extension of the discretionary grant program which mandates and \nencourages police officers to arrest abusers;\n  Creation of a five percent set aside towards State domestic violence \ncoalitions;\n  Extension of state programs that deal with domestic violence in rural \nareas; and\n  Establishment of a new grant program to educate and train providers \nto better meet the needs of disabled victims of domestic violence.\n  In addition, I want to thank Senator Hatch and Senator Biden for \nincluding a reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and \nServices Act in the Violence Against Women Act. As the primary source \nof funding for local shelters, the Family Violence Prevention and \nServices Act is a vital cornerstone in the Federal response to domestic \nviolence. This reauthorization ensures that this program can continue \nto grow with an increased authorization level. The Family Violence \nPrevention and Services Act is normally part of the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act reauthorization process which is scheduled \nto be completed next year. As Chairman of the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions, I will be working with domestic violence \norganizations to see what, if any, changes need to be made in the \nFamily Violence Prevention and Treatment Act to increase its capacity \nto serve the victims of family violence.\n  I am pleased with the fine work of Senators Biden and Hatch in \ncrafting the original VAWA, and that these two Senators were able to \nfurther formulate a bipartisan, compromise version of this \nreauthorization which I was happy to cosponsor.\n  Since July, I have both written and talked to the Majority Leader \ncalling for Senate consideration of this important legislation. While \nit was somewhat delayed, I am grateful that the Senate will be \nendorsing the reauthorization of VAWA today. While the reauthorization \nof VAWA is an important step, I remain committed to continuing to enact \nlegislation to eliminate domestic violence in Vermont and all around \nthe United States.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is taking up and voting on \nthe Trafficking Victims Protection Act Conference Report, which \nincludes the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. I \ncommend the sponsors of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. It is \nestimated that approximately 50,000 women and children are trafficked \nin the United States every year, many of whom are sexually exploited \nand forced into involuntary servitude. This bill will provide a \ncomprehensive approach to prevent trafficking as well as ensure \nvigorous prosecution of those involved in this deplorable practice.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes the Violence Against Women \nAct, VAWA, which has provided an unparalleled level of support for \nprograms to end domestic and sexual violence. VAWA grants have made it \npossible for communities across the nation to provide shelter and \ncounseling for hundreds of thousands of women and their children. Since \n1995, more than $1.5 billion has been appropriated under VAWA's grant \nprograms. Michigan has been awarded about $50 million in Federal grants \nunder VAWA. Those grants provided invaluable resources to survivors of \ndomestic and sexual violence in Michigan. For example, Rural grants \nhave permitted 12 rural counties in Michigan to hire full time \nadvocates for providing services to victims through outreach programs. \nVAWA Civil Legal Assistance Grants have allowed more than 5 Michigan \ncommunities to develop Civil Legal Assistance Programs, which provide \nquality legal assistance to hundreds of women and children. In \naddition, 35 Sexual Assault Services Programs and more than 20 Sexual \nAssault Prevention Programs have been created or strengthened in our \nstate as a direct result of VAWA.\n  Furthermore, VAWA has been tremendously successful in the training of \njudges, court personnel, prosecutors, police and victims' advocates. \nMary Keefe, Executive Director of the Michigan Coalition Against \nDomestic and Sexual Violence, explained in a letter to me that ``with \nthe heightened training of police, prosecutors, and other in the \ncriminal justice field, many of these systems are now routinely \nreferring the victims they encounter to domestic violence and rape \ncrisis programs.''\n  VAWA programs have been especially important to women in rural \ncommunities, where support networks had been limited due to distance. \nHere is just one case of such a victim--forwarded to me from the \nMichigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence--whose life was \npossibly saved by a VAWA grant.\n\n       ``Jamie'' (not her real name) was referred to the Domestic \n     Violence Program by the Prosecutor. Jamie had shared with the \n     prosecutor that she was ``afraid for life,'' and that she was \n     afraid to participate in prosecution because of repercussions \n     she may have to bear from her assailant. She soon fell out of \n     contact with the prosecutor and the case against her \n     assailant was on shaky ground.\n       The county prosecutor referred Jamie to the VAWA funded \n     advocate. She came to the program in January, reluctant and \n     fearful, but open to talking to the advocate. The advocate \n     was able to provide two full days of intensive interaction \n     with this survivor. Counseling her, preparing a safety plan \n     for her and her children, telling her how the legal system \n     works and preparing her for what she could expect each step \n     of the way.\n       The advocate was actually able to pick Jamie up, drive her \n     to court each time, sit by her, reassure her throughout the \n     process, listen to her when she was angry and fearful, \n     explain what was going on, and nurture her through the \n     process of being a witness to this case.\n       The perpetrator was eventually convicted on several counts, \n     and is serving time in the County jail.\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n       Jamie has begun picking up the pieces of her life and is \n     hopefully on the road to safety.\n\n  Despite the successes of VAWA, almost 900,0000 women continue to be \nvictims of domestic violence each year, making it the number one health \nrisk for women between the ages of 15 and 44. This Violence Against \nWomen Act Reauthorization will build on the successes of VAWA by more \nthan doubling the amount available for programs to support women and \nchildren subject to domestic abuse.\n  Although I support the underlying Trafficking Victims Protection Act, \nI am concerned about a provision in this bill referred to as Aimee's \nLaw. When the Senator from Pennsylvania introduced this provision as an \namendment to he juvenile justice bill, I was one of the few who voted \nagainst it. I understand the positive motive of those who support this \nprovision and I agree that we should act to limit the number of \ntragedies that occur when persons convicted of serious offenses are \nparoled and then subsequently commit the same offense, but I do not \nsupport this unworkable procedure.\n  I remain concerned that this bill will federalize state criminal \ncourt systems. Currently, the crimes covered in this bill are defined \ndifferently in different states, which is appropriate since the 50 \nstate court systems handle 95 percent of all criminal cases in this \ncountry. It is inappropriate to apply federal definitions and federal \nsentencing guidelines to criminal cases tried in state courts. I also \nremain concerned about how the penalties will be imposed since the \naverage terms of imprisonment imposed by states are different than \nactual lengths of imprisonment and the cost of incarceration can not be \nknown unless one can predict life expectancy.\n  On balance, I will vote for this Conference Report because I strongly \nsupport the Trafficking Victims Protection Act and Violence Against \nWomen Act.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act of 2000, which is included in the conference report \nfor the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (H.R. 3244). Current \nauthorization for these programs expired at the end of September, and I \nbelieve that we must take immediate action to ensure that these \nprograms are reauthorized before we go home. This bill has broad \nsupport on both sides of the aisle, with 73 cosponsors.\n  Domestic violence, no matter who commits it, is an extremely serious \nand tragically common crime that devastates families and takes a great \ntoll on our society. Moreover, domestic violence often goes unreported, \nin large part because the incident is seen as a private and personal \nissue or because of the fear of a repeated attack by the assailant.\n  In my view, Congress must continue to address domestic violence in a \ncomprehensive manner by providing resources for states and communities \nto disseminate education about domestic violence; provide counseling to \nthe victim, the aggressor, and any children in the family; and ensure \nshelter to every person and child who needs to leave their home due to \ndomestic violence. It is also important that health professionals are \ntrained to identify and treat the medical conditions arising from \ndomestic violence. This is a crime that we must put an end to and we \nmust let those people who are suffering know there is help on the way.\n  Violence knows no gender barriers, but we must not turn a blind eye \nto the fact that women are especially likely to be vulnerable to danger \nand crime. The Violence Against Women Act is a critical tool in our \nfight to combat domestic violence across America. It is an absolutely \nessential bill for our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, relatives, \nfriends, and co-workers.\n  One of the most important issues facing women today is the threat of \nviolence. Three to four million American women are battered by their \nhusbands or partners every single year. At least a third of all female \nemergency room patients are battered women. A third of all homeless \nwomen and children in the U.S. are fleeing domestic violence. At least \n5,000 women are beaten to death each year. A woman in the United States \nis more likely to be assaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a male \npartner than by any other assailant. And women are six times more \nlikely than men to be the victims of a violent crime.\n  This is more than just a nightmare for women. It is an America that \nmillions of women and girls must wake up to each day. It is a grim \nreality millions of women and girls must enter each day of their lives \njust to go to work or attend school. It is real life America for \nmillions of women and girls. And it is an unspeakable tragedy.\n  How many of us were shocked in June to read that women were attacked \nin New York City's Central Park in broad daylight following a parade? \nFor days afterward we read headlines entitled ``Defenseless in the \nPark'' . . . ``Six More Arrested in Sex Attacks in Park'' . . . \n``Police Study Central Park Mob's 35-Minute Binge of Sexual Assault.'' \nThe litany of tragedy and violence against the women assaulted that day \nin Central Park paints a full, stark and disheartening picture of a \nnation unable to protect a woman's safety.\n\n  One of the victims, Emma Sussman Starr, wrote the New York Times \nabout her attack and about the prevalence of violence against women in \nAmerica. She said: ``Women learn early which streets are safe to walk \non, when it's safe to be there and even how to walk (hands wrapped \naround keys, eyes straight ahead). We accept that we must pay for our \nsafety in the form of cabs and doorman buildings in more expensive \nneighborhoods.'' What a sad statement.\n  The threat of violence is pervasive, and as Ms. Starr writes, it \ninfluences every decision a woman makes. Every time a woman changes her \npattern of behavior--for example, when she walks home from work a \ndifferent way--in order to avoid potential violence such as rape, \nstalking, domestic assault, she is ultimately making a decision about \nhow to live her life.\n  The original Violence Against Women Act, enacted in 1994, was a \nlandmark piece of legislation. For the first time, Congress took a \ncomprehensive look at the problem of violence against women, created \nthe programs, and funded the shelters to help women out of these \nviolent situations. Since then, thousands of women across the country \nhave been given the opportunity to free themselves from violence.\n  But the problem of violence against women has not been solved in \nthese six years since the original bill was signed into law. We must \ncontinue to talk about ways in which we can guarantee women's safety, \nfurther secure women's rights, and strengthen our ability as a nation \nto protect those inalienable rights as guaranteed under the \nConstitution.\n  After all, how can we defend a woman's right to ``life, liberty, and \nthe pursuit of happiness'' when we cannot as a nation protect women \nfrom ``Rape, battery, and the onslaught of violence?''\n  The Violence Against Women Act of 2000 reauthorizes these fundamental \nprograms. The bill provides funding for grants to prevent campus crimes \nagainst women; extends programs to prevent violence in rural areas; \nbuilds on the progress we have made in constructing shelters for women \nwho are victims of violent crimes; and strengthens protections for \nolder women from violence.\n  I believe that no matter whatever else Congress does for women--from \nenacting public policies and designing specific programs aimed to \npromote women's health, education, economic security, or safety, we \nmust also ensure that women have equal protection under our country's \nlaw and in our constitution. Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women \nAct programs is an important step in this direction.\n  It isn't often that Congress can claim to enact a law that literally \nmay mean life or death for a person. The Violence Against Women Act is \nsuch a law, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we will not have the opportunity to vote \ntoday on the merits of Aimee's Law, but instead, on a jurisdictional \nissue regarding whether the bill was properly included in the Sex \nTrafficking Conference Report. Because I believe the jurisdictional \nobjection is unfounded and I am unwilling to jeopardize the passage of \nthe other significant pieces of legislation included in the Conference \nReport--most importantly, the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\nAct of 2000--I will vote against Senator Thompson's point of order.\n  I supported a similar version of Aimee's Law in the form of an \namendment to the Juvenile Justice bill last year. Upon reflection, \nhowever, I believe that my support was misplaced. I am troubled by this \nlegislation from both a practical and a constitutional perspective.\n  Aimee's Law requires the Attorney General, in any case in which a \nState convicts an individual of murder, rape, or a dangerous sexual \noffense, when that individual has a prior conviction for any one or \nmore of those offenses in another State, to transfer federal law \nenforcement assistance funds that have been allocated to the first \nState in an amount equal to the costs of incarceration, prosecution, \nand apprehension of that individual, to the second State. The bill \ncontains a ``safe harbor'' exempting from this substantial penalty \nthose States in which No. 1 the individual offender at issue has served \n85 percent or more of his term of imprisonment, and No. 2 the average \nterm of imprisonment imposed by the State for the prior offense at \nissue is at or above the average term of imprisonment imposed for that \noffense in all States.\n  As a practical matter, this bill can only promote a ``race to the \ntop,'' as States feel compelled to ratchet up their sentences--not \nnecessarily because they view such a shift as desirable public policy--\nbut in order to avoid losing crucial federal law enforcement funds. \nIronically, those States that are apt to benefit most from federal law \nenforcement assistance may well be those with the poorest record of \nkeeping dangerous offenders behind bars, the same States likely to lose \nthese valuable crime-fighting funds. Nor can States readily assess \nwhere they stand relative to other States since they are always \nstriving to hit a moving target and maintain sentences at or above an \nelusive average of all state sentences for various qualifying offenses.\n  The law also will spawn an administrative nightmare for the Attorney \nGeneral, who is charged under the legislation with the responsibility \nof constantly tabulating and retabulating the average sentences across \nthe nation for a host of different serious offenses, as well as with \nthe responsibility of keeping track of which State's federal funds \nshould be reallocated to which other States every time a released \noffender commits another qualifying crime. The law even requires the \nAttorney General to consult with the governors of those States with \nfederal funds at risk to establish a payment schedule. It's no wonder \nthat the nation's governors so strongly oppose this law.\n  As a constitutional matter, I have grave concerns about Aimee's Law's \nseeming disregard of basic principles of federalism. Congress's \nspending authority is undeniably broad. But I have serious reservations \nabout the wisdom and constitutionality of a law that, instead of \nclearly conditioning a federal grant upon a State's performance of a \nspecific and clearly stated task, penalizes a State for conduct that \noccurs after the fact and that is not entirely within the State's \ncontrol--the offender's commission of another serious crime in another \nState. In this sense, Aimee's Law is far more onerous and far less \nrespectful of fundamental principles of federal-state comity than a \nstraightforward law conditioning federal spending upon the States' \nadoption of more stringent sentencing laws--the likely result of this \nlegislation. In a climate in which the U.S. Supreme Court is quick to \nstrike down Acts of Congress that, in the Court's view, infringe upon \nthe States' prerogatives, Aimee's Law, I fear, presents an all too \ninviting target and needlessly risks creating bad precedent regarding \nthe scope of Congress's spending authority.\n  It is my hope that Congress and the President will monitor the \noperation of this law and revisit it if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to thank the Senator from \nTennessee for having the courage to speak out against this ill-advised \nlegislation known as Aimee's law. I say he has courage because there is \na lot of emotion involved in any debate concerning serious violent \ncrime such as murder, rape, or other sexual offenses. Some have said it \nis dangerous to vote against, much less speak against, any crime bill \nthat is named after a real person. That is certainly the case here in \nthis incredibly tragic case that underlies this legislation.\n  I also know that anything goes in a conference, including adding \nprovisions for political reasons that do not withstand even the most \nbasic scrutiny of whether they will work or can even be understood by \nthe people or the entities that are supposed to abide by them.\n  I am sorry to say that Aimee's law is bad law--perhaps well \nintentioned--but bad law. I will support the Thompson point of order in \norder to state my objection to this provision.\n  The young woman who inspired this bill was tragically raped and \nmurdered in Pennsylvania. A shocking crime was committed against her, \nagainst her family, and, indeed against all of us. All of us in this \nbody feel horrible about that crime and its consequences.\n  But that does not absolve us of the duty to analyze legislation that \ncomes before us, even if it bears the name of a child who was \ntragically killed. This legislation violates important principles of \nfederalism. It will handcuff our states in their fights against violent \ncrime. And most important, it just won't work. It won't accomplish what \nits sponsor and supporters say they want to accomplish. So I support \nSenator Thompson's point of order and hope my colleagues will as well.\n  Before turning to the bill itself, let me again compliment the \nSenator from Tennessee. He has shown time and time again that his \ncommitment to federalism is principled and real. He does not oppose \nfederal intrusion into state affairs as a political tactic, as I fear \nso many of my colleagues do. He truly believes that our states deserve \nautonomy and is willing to stand up for them, even when it is \npolitically unpopular, as it no doubt is here.\n  I want the Senator from Tennessee to know that I respect his \nprinciples as well as support them. We miss his judgment and restraint, \nI must say, in the Judiciary Committee on which he served until the \nbeginning of this Congress.\n  Here, of course, we are not preparing to pass a new federal murder, \nrape, or sexual offense statute. But we might as well do that because \nin Aimee's Law we are forcing the states through the use of federal law \nenforcement assistance funds to increase their penalties for these \noffenses. Since when is it the province of the federal government to \ndetermine the sentences for state crimes? That is what we are doing \nhere.\n  Mr. President, in addition to furthering the federalization of the \ncriminal law, this provision is very poorly thought out. As the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Council of State Governments and the Department of \nJustice have told us, it won't work. Even if states wish to comply with \nthis law they won't be able to do.\n\n  Here's why: Under this bill, if a person who has been convicted of a \nmurder, rape or dangerous sexual offense is released from prison and \ncommits a serious crime in another state, the original state becomes \nliable to the second state for all the costs of investigation, \nprosecution, and incarceration of the second crime. To avoid that \nliability, which the Attorney General must enforce through reallocation \nof the second states' federal law enforcement assistance funds, the \nsecond state must comply with two conditions.\n  First, it must make sure that persons convicted of these serious \noffenses serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. So far, so good. \nStates can comply with that federal sentencing requirement if they want \nto avoid risking their federal money. But the federal coercion doesn't \nstop there. The state must make sure that the average sentence for the \noriginal crime is greater than the average sentence for such crimes in \nall the states. This is a remarkable condition, Mr. President, that \nactually makes it impossible for all 50 states to be in compliance at \nany one time.\n  Now Mr. President, think about this. Suppose a state determines that \nits average sentence for rape is 20 years, but the average for all \nstates for that crime is 25 years. So the state raises its sentence to \n26 years. That act will\n\n[[Page S10227]]\n\nitself change the average sentence for all the states, possibly putting \nother states under the average and encouraging them to raise their \nsentences. The average sentence for all the states will therefore \nalmost never be constant or predictable. Every time a state changes its \nsentencing guidelines to try to get above the average, the average will \nchange and other states will be forced to revise their own sentences. \nWe will have rolling averages and no certainty in sentencing or in the \navailability of federal money for important state law enforcement \npurposes.\n  And that does not even take into account that the average sentence \nfor an individual state will even sometimes change as different \ncriminals are convicted and sentenced to slightly different terms. So \nthe averages that states are supposed to keep track of in order to keep \ntheir law enforcement assistance funds will literally change day by \nday. This bill is an administrative nightmare for our states, even if \nthey want to comply.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Secretary of the \nWisconsin Department of Corrections in opposition to this bill be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. After setting out a number of the difficulties of \ncomplying with this bill, Secretary Jon Litscher concludes the \nfollowing:\n\n       Given the complexity of administering this bill and pitting \n     one state against another, I don't believe this legislation \n     will enhance the criminal justice system.\n\n  I believe that Mr. Litscher's view is shared by criminal justice \nprofessionals all over the country, along with Governors and other \nelected officials, all of whom are working just as hard to reduce \nviolent crime as the sponsors of this bill.\n  I cannot leave this topic of how this provision creates a ``race to \nthe top'' in sentencing without commenting on how it will effect the \ndeath penalty. Currently, 38 states have the death penalty for some \ncrimes. That is more than half the states. Now I am not sure how you \ncalculate an average sentence when some jurisdictions use the death \npenalty. But there would certainly be a strong argument that the states \nthat do not use the death penalty will risk losing federal law \nenforcement assistance funds if a convicted murderer is let out on \nparole and commits another serious crime. Basically, this policy could \nforce states to either enact the death penalty or never release a \nperson convicted of murder on parole.\n  Now maybe that is what some people want. But I believe that whether \nto impose the ultimate penalty of death should be up to the states and \ntheir citizens. Federal coercion has no place in this question of \nconscience. A number of states, including my own, have long and proud \nhistories of opposition to the death penalty. We should not use federal \nfunds to force them to change their positions.\n  If this bill had gone through the Judiciary Committee, some of the \ndifficulties in interpreting and applying it might have been worked \nout. Here all the negotiating has gone on behind closed doors. This is \nwhat happens when the normal legislative process is circumvented as it \nhas been so often this year. It's now the norm for the majority to look \nfor conference reports as vehicles for bills that they want to enact \nwithout going through the legislative process.\n  We used to have a rule, as my colleagues know, that prevented items \nfrom being added to a conference report that were beyond the scope of \nthe conference. Last year, the minority leader offered an amendment to \nrestore the rule, but it was voted down on a near party line vote.\n  So now, anything goes in a conference, including adding provisions \nfor purely political reasons that don't withstand even the most basic \nscrutiny of whether they will work, or can even be understood by the \npeople or entities that are supposed to abide by them. I am sorry to \nsay that Aimee's law is bad law. Perhaps well-intentioned, but bad law. \nI will support the Thompson point of order in order to state my \nobjection to this provision.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               State of Wisconsin,\n\n\n                                    Department of Corrections,\n\n                                    Madison, WI, October 10, 2000.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: It has come to my attention that the \n     provisions of H.R. 894 (Aimee's Law) have been attached to \n     other legislation that may be considered by the United States \n     Senate on Wednesday, October 11th. I am very concerned about \n     the negative fiscal/policy ramifications on the Department of \n     Corrections and the State of Wisconsin.\n       Aimee's law provides that in any case in which a person is \n     convicted of a dangerous sexual offense, murder or rape, and \n     that person has been previously convicted of that offense in \n     another state, the state of the prior conviction will incur \n     fiscal liabilities. It will have deducted from its federal \n     criminal justice funds the cost of apprehension, prosecution \n     and incarceration of the offender. These funds will then be \n     transferred to the state where the subsequent offense \n     occurred.\n       This legislation has a very confusing array of provisions. \n     For example:\n       1. Retroactivity--While this bill has an effective date of \n     January 1, 2002, it doesn't appear to have an applicability \n     section that is normally drafted into bills introduced in the \n     Wisconsin legislature. Many states have passed truth-in-\n     sentencing laws that make them eligible for federal grant \n     money. However, a state cannot change the sentencing \n     structure for persons sentenced under a prior law. \n     Wisconsin's truth-in-sentencing law (TIS) applies to persons \n     who commit a felon on or after December 31, 1999 and inmates \n     must serve 100% of the term of imprisonment imposed by the \n     court.\n       2. Section (3)(a), ``the average term of imprisonment \n     imposed by State . . .'' does not specify the term nor time \n     period in which the averaging figure applies--does it apply \n     at the time of sentencing for a similar crime across all \n     states? Is the average for a specific time frame? Does the \n     sentencing average only apply to cases sentenced to prison, \n     or does it include persons sentenced to a jail term and \n     probation? We don't know what the nationwide average is now \n     and this figure will constantly be changing.\n       3. Determination of Comparable State Statutes--There is no \n     uniform criminal code for all states. It will be very \n     difficult to determine comparable state statutes to \n     ``Dangerous Sexual Offense,'' ``Murder,'' and ``Rape.'' This \n     will be subject to significant variation across the nation.\n       This bill pits each state against the others. The costs \n     associated with administration of the law, and the resulting \n     ``loss'' of funds may be greater than the grant funds to \n     which the state would otherwise be entitled. States may opt \n     to not administer the law (not ``charge'' another state) so \n     that another state will not charge them. Enforcement of this \n     law will be dependent upon each state agreeing to fully \n     implement its provisions.\n       If the intent of the bill is to insure that each state has \n     implemented TIS, retroactive application is unnecessary. You \n     only need to apply the bill to states that haven't passed TIS \n     and exempt those that have enacted laws that require at least \n     85% of a term of imprisonment to be served.\n       Given the complexity of administering this bill and the \n     pitting of one state against another, I don't believe this \n     legislation will enhance the criminal justice system.\n       Thank you for taking the time to consider my comments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jon E. Litscher,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate having received a veto message on \nH.R. 4733, under the previous order, the message is considered as \nhaving been read, the message will be printed in the Record and spread \nin full upon the Journal, and referred to the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  The veto message ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 4733, the ``Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations Act, 2001.'' The bill contains an \nunacceptable rider regarding the Army Corps of Engineers' master \noperating manual for the Missouri River. In addition, it fails to \nprovide funding for the California-Bay Delta Initiative and includes \nnearly $700 million for over 300 unrequested projects.\n  Section 103 would prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from revising \nthe operating manual for the Missouri River that is 40 years old and \nneeds to be updated based on the most recent scientific information. In \nits current form, the manual simply does not provide an appropriate \nbalance among the competing interests, both commercial and \nrecreational, of the many people who seek to use this great American \nriver. The bill would also undermine implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act by preventing the Corps of Engineers from funding \nreasonable and much-needed changes to the operating manual for the \nMissouri River. The Corps and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are \nentering a critical phase in their Section 7 consultation on the \neffects of reservoir project operations. This provision could prevent \nthe Corps from carrying out a necessary element of any reasonable and \nprudent alternative to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of \nthe endangered least tern and pallid sturgeon, and the threatened \npiping plover.\n  In addition to the objectionable restriction placed upon the Corps of \nEngineers, the bill fails to provide funding for the California-Bay \nDelta initiative. This decision could significantly hamper ongoing \nFederal and State efforts to restore this ecosystem, protect the \ndrinking water of 22 million Californians, and enhance water supply and \nreliability for over 7 million acres of highly productive farmland and \ngrowing urban areas across California. The $60 million budget request, \nall of which would be used to support activities that can be carried \nout using existing authorities, is the minimum necessary to ensure \nadequate Federal participation in these initiatives, which are \nessential to reducing existing conflicts among water users in \nCalifornia. This funding should be provided without legislative \nrestrictions undermining key environmental statutes or disrupting the \nbalanced approach to meeting the needs of water users and the \nenvironment that has been carefully developed through almost 6 years of \nwork with the State of California and interested stakeholders.\n  The bill also fails to provide sufficient funding necessary to \nrestore endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest, which would \ninterfere with the Corps of Engineers' ability to comply with the \nEndangered Species Act, and provides no funds to start the new \nconstruction project requested for the Florida Everglades. The bill \nalso fails to fund the Challenge 21 program for environmentally \nfriendly flood damage reduction projects, the program to modernize \nCorps recreation facilities, and construction of an emergency outlet at \nDevil's Lake. In addition, it does not fully support efforts to \nresearch and develop nonpolluting, domestic sources of energy through \nsolar and renewable technologies that are vital to American's energy \nsecurity.\n  Finally, the bill provides nearly $700 million for over 300 \nunrequested projects, including: nearly 80 unrequested projects \ntotaling more than $330 million for the Department of Energy; nearly \n240 unrequested projects totaling over $300 million for the Corps of \nEngineers; and, more than 10 unrequested projects totaling in excess of \n$10 million for the Bureau of Reclamation. For example, more than 80 \nunrequested Corps of Engineers construction projects included in the \nbill would have a long-term cost of nearly $2.7 billion. These \nunrequested projects and earmarks come at the expense of other \ninitiatives important to taxpaying Americans.\n  The American people deserve government spending based upon a balanced \napproach that maintains fiscal discipline, eliminates the national \ndebt, extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, provides \nfor an appropriately sized tax cut, establishes a new voluntary \nMedicare prescription drug benefit in the context of broader reforms, \nexpends health care coverage to more families, and funds critical \ninvestments for our future. I urge the\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\nCongress to work expeditiously to develop a bill that addresses the \nneeds of the Nation.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, we do have some additional consent requests \nwe have been working on. I have a couple here and Senator McCain has \nagreed to allow us to do these. Then he has a couple of unanimous \nconsents he wants to ask. The first has to do with the Defense \nDepartment authorization bill for the next fiscal year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10229-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 4516\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the DOD authorization conference report following the \nreconsideration vote on H.R. 4516 on Thursday, and the conference \nreport be considered as having been read and debated under the \nfollowing time agreement: 2 hours under the control of the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, 1 hour under the control of Senator \nGramm, 2\\1/2\\ hours under the control of Senator Levin, 30 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Wellstone; That following the debate just \noutlined, Senator Kerrey be recognized to make a point of order and \nthat the motion to waive the Budget Act be limited to 2 hours equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding back of time \non the motion to waive, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion and, \nif waived, a vote occur immediately on adoption of the conference \nreport, without any intervening action, motion, or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to the majority leader \nwe have no problem going to the bill. We have a problem with the time \nright now. There is one Senator over here trying to work something out \nwith both majority and minority staff. We feel confident that can be \ndone. But I think it would be to everyone's best interest if we stop \nthe unanimous consent agreement after the word ``read'' on the first \nparagraph.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am sure there is a good faith effort being \nmade here. So I will revise my unanimous consent request.\n  But let me emphasize to all the Members that this is a very important \nbill. Some people think: We have passed the Defense appropriations \nbill, the military construction appropriations bill; what do we need an \nauthorization bill for? This is the bill that makes the law that \nauthorizes things for our military men and women, including an increase \nin pay, including the very important, laboriously worked out provisions \nwith regard to health benefits for our active duty men and women and \ntheir families and our retirees. It also has the Department of Energy \nlanguage in which the Presiding Officer has had so much interest. This \nis really a big bill and an important bill. So I hope we can get \nagreement. I believe we will.\n  Also, I emphasize that by spending 6 hours on this bill, you know \nthat is time we could be spending on the Agriculture appropriations \nconference report or other conference reports that may be ready by \ntomorrow afternoon. So I hope we can get this locked up soon.\n  But, in view of the legitimate request that was made by the Senator, \nI modify my unanimous consent request and end it after the words \n``considered as having been read'' in the first paragraph.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to the \nmajority leader, I think the work done by Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin on this bill has been exemplary. They worked well together. This \nis a very important bill. We on this side, the minority, understand the \nimportance of this legislation. As we speak, we are working with one of \nour Members to get this worked out.\n  Maybe before the evening is over we can get back and put in the time \nagreement. We just are not able to do that right now. But we want to \nmake sure we underscore what the leader has said. This is an important \nbill. I really hope we can complete it before the end of the session.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I, first, thank the distinguished leader \nand distinguished Democratic whip, all of us who made this possible. We \nare within 1 millimeter of resolving this problem. It has just been \naddressed to me. This is the first time I heard it. I know the Senator \nvery well and we are going to see what we can do to work this thing \nout. So I think the Senate can assume that what the leadership has \npresented here, this unanimous consent request, can be accepted in the \ncourse of the day.\n  Mr. LOTT. OK.\n  Mr. WARNER. This will be the 39th consecutive authorization bill for \nthe Armed Forces of the United States by the Senate. And it is an \nabsolute must piece of legislation, as our distinguished leader and the \ndistinguished Democratic whip said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10229-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4461\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask consent that at 10 a.m. on Friday the \nSenate turn to the conference report to accompany H.R. 4461, the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report, and it be considered \nunder the following agreement, with the time equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  I ask consent that debate continue beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday \nand proceed through the day.\n  I ask consent the vote occur on adoption of the Agriculture \nconference report at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday and paragraph 4 of rule XII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have no \nobjection if we would move to this by a vote. We would agree to a voice \nvote. We do not believe we can do this by consent.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator to yield and make \nsure I understand what he is saying, did you say we could do this by \nvoice vote?\n  Mr. REID. We would be willing for you to move to proceed and we would \nvoice vote that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, we will keep working to try to get \nagreements accepted. I do not quite understand why the Agriculture \nappropriations bill cannot be debated tonight, now, and voted on \ntomorrow. And I do not understand why we cannot get an agreement to \nhave debate on it on Friday and Tuesday, and a vote on Wednesday. I \nknow there are Senators who want to talk on it. That is their right in \nthe Senate. But if we are ever going to get this process completed, we \nneed to get the Agriculture appropriations conference report done.\n  I am still holding out some hope that maybe the Commerce-State-\nJustice conference report and even the Labor-HHS conference report \ncould be agreed to and could be dealt with tomorrow in such a way we \ncould have a vote on them on Thursday or Friday. But we do not have \nthat yet.\n  Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, if I could just say before you withdraw the \nconsent request, we would be willing, tonight, to have you move to \nproceed to this measure.\n  As I said, we would be agreeable to move to proceed to this bill by a \nvoice vote and start the debate tonight. We are not in any way trying \nto delay the consideration of this very important bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think the Senator knows there is a great difference \nbetween moving to proceed and asking unanimous consent. For now, \nobviously, we cannot get the unanimous consent agreement, so we will \nnot be able to proceed.\n  In light of the discussions we have just had, and since we cannot get \nan agreement on taking up Agriculture now, the next votes will occur at \n12:30 p.m. tomorrow regarding HUD-VA and related issues, and additional \nvotes will occur late tomorrow afternoon regarding the DOD \nauthorization conference report if we can get this time agreement \nworked out, and I assume we will be able to.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in just a few minutes I will propound a \nunanimous consent request concerning the\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\nTransportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation \nAct. First, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I just received from \nthe Secretary of Transportation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 11, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the House acted early today \n     to pass H.R. 5164, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, \n     Accountability, and Documentation (TREAD) Act. This is \n     another important step toward resolving issues raised by the \n     National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) \n     ongoing Firestone tire investigation.\n       We strongly support enactment of H.R. 5164. The bill \n     provides increased penalties for safety defects and \n     noncompliances in motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment; \n     lengthens the period for free remedy of defects and \n     noncompliances; enhances the ability of NHTSA to obtain \n     information from foreign as well as domestic sources; and \n     authorizes increased appropriations to enable NHTSA to carry \n     out its additional responsibilities. These provisions were \n     sought by the Administration in its proposed legislation. \n     H.R. 5164 also directs NHTSA to review and report on its \n     procedures for opening defect investigations, a review which \n     the agency has already begun, and directs NHTSA to conduct \n     rulemaking to amend the safety standards on tires, an action \n     which is consistent with the agency's rulemaking plans.\n       The early warning section in H.R. 5164 enables NHTSA to \n     obtain information about potential defects earlier than under \n     current law. The agency will use the information in deciding \n     whether to open an investigation and will be able to release \n     information in the context of its investigation, as it does \n     today. Information that is not made a part of an \n     investigation could be released if NHTSA determines it would \n     assist in carrying out the agency's investigative \n     responsibilities. The bill contains a new section 30170 that \n     augments the penalties under section 1001 of title 18, United \n     States Code, if a person intentionally misleads the Secretary \n     concerning a safety defect that results in death or serious \n     injury. A ``Safe Harbor'' provision would excuse the person \n     from the augmented penalties, but would not excuse the person \n     from other penalties under section 1001. The Department of \n     Justice will communicate separately its views on the criminal \n     provisions.\n       The focus now turns to the Senate, where you have been \n     working diligently on passage of similar legislation, S. \n     3059, the Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Equipment Defect \n     Notification Improvement Act. Both of the bills contain \n     several key provisions proposed by the Clinton-Gore \n     Administration. We are committed to ensuring that NHTSA has \n     the authority to seek and receive information on potential \n     defects; receives sufficient funding to carry out its \n     expanded responsibilities; and has the authority to impose \n     stiffer penalties to ensure compliance with U.S. motor \n     vehicle safety laws.\n       Also, Senate confirmation of the President's nominee for \n     Administrator of NHTSA would help implementation of this \n     legislation immeasurably.\n       In the final days of the 106th Congress, we must not lose \n     the opportunity to save lives and prevent injuries. I urge \n     the full Senate to pass H.R. 5164 before the end of this \n     session. It is critically needed legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Rodney E. Slater.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will quote parts of the letter from \nSecretary Slater:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you know, the House acted early today \n     to pass H.R. 5164, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, \n     Accountability, and Documentation Act. This is another \n     important step toward resolving issues raised by the National \n     Highway Traffic Safety Administration's ongoing Firestone \n     tire investigation.\n       We strongly support enactment of H.R. 5164. The bill \n     provides increased penalties for safety defects and \n     noncompliances in motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment; \n     lengthens the period for free remedy of defects and \n     noncompliances; enhances the ability of NHTSA to obtain \n     information from foreign as well as domestic sources; and \n     authorizes increased appropriations to enable NHTSA to carry \n     out its additional responsibilities. These provisions were \n     sought by the Administration in its proposed legislation. \n     H.R. 5164 also directs NHTSA to review and report on its \n     procedures for opening defect investigations, a review which \n     the agency has already begun, and directs NHTSA to conduct \n     rulemaking to amend the safety standards on tires, an action \n     which is consistent with the agency's rulemaking plans.\n\n  I will not read the whole letter, except the last paragraph:\n\n       In the final days of the 106th Congress, we must not lose \n     the opportunity to save lives and prevent injuries. I urge \n     the full Senate to pass H.R. 5164 before the end of this \n     session. It is critically needed legislation.\n\n  Save lives and prevent injuries.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter that was sent \nfrom Ms. Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, and others to the \nHouse of Representatives on October 9.\n  That letter says:\n\n       Dear Representative: We are writing to urge the passage of \n     H.R. 5164, despite its serious deficiencies.\n\n  It ends up in the last part of the letter:\n\n       We urge you to vote to send this bill forward, to encourage \n     the House managers to work with the Senate managers to \n     improve the legislation, and to make sure the authority of \n     NHTSA to protect the public safety is not degraded.\n\n  Even though there may be objections from Ms. Claybrook and some of \nher colleagues, the fact is she wrote to the House urging a vote for \nthis legislation at this time. I think it should be an important part \nof the Record.\n  Finally, I do not view this as a panacea. The Presiding Officer has \nsignificant concerns. We had entered into a colloquy concerning his \nconcerns. Those concerns are legitimate. I assure the Senator from Ohio \nthat the Senator from South Carolina and I will continue to work on \nthis issue next year. I will tell the Senator from Ohio why: Because \nthere is going to be more people dying before this issue is resolved. \nJust this last weekend in Louisiana, a young boy, who was in a rollover \naccident from a tire that shredded, went into a coma.\n\n  I am pleased and gratified that the Senator from South Carolina, who \nhas some differing views, as I do, on this bill, wants to see it \nperfected, as does the Senator from Ohio. But I also agree with the \nSecretary of Transportation who says that this is an enormously \nimportant step forward to take.\n  I take this opportunity to thank Senator Hollings for his efforts and \nthe way we worked in a bipartisan fashion to report a bill by a vote of \n20-0 out of the Commerce Committee.\n  I will propound two unanimous consent requests, if the first one is \nobjected to. If the first one is objected to, then I will try another \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee has led the way on this tire safety measure on the Senate \nside. I just had an opportunity to look at the House provision. There \nis no question that there are two or three things in there that should \nbe cleared up. One, it has certain reporting requirements, but then the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration is supposed to keep them \ntop secret. I want that explained to me. We do not operate like the \nCIA. There is no reason to keep it from public knowledge. In fact, that \nis exactly why we have this entity--to collect reported defects that \ncome to the attention of the consumers in America.\n  Secondly, there is another provision with respect to criminal \npenalties. I have tire manufacturers in my State, and I wanted to be \nabsolutely clear that we did not unduly threaten fine, good businessmen \nwho are working to produce a safe product. Or make it so that they \nwould be faced with some kind of criminal charge by way of a mistake \nthat did not come to their knowledge. That was not the intent of the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from South Carolina as we worked \nthrough this.\n  Obviously, that was taken out of the Senate bill. Otherwise we would \nnever have had a unanimous vote in reporting this bill 20-0. But there \nis a provision in that House bill whereby if there has been a willful \nand malicious reporting to this agency--such as we saw in the tobacco \ncase where they all raised their hands and you knew they were lying at \nthe time--then there should be a criminal penalty. That ought to be \ncleared up in the House bill.\n  We are only asking that the Senate bill be considered so we can amend \nthe House bill and work this measure out under the leadership of \nSenator McCain.\n  The other provision with respect to the reporting of claims--after \nall that is the only way we found out about these recent deaths that \nnow approximate 100 killed on the highways. As\n\n[[Page S10231]]\n\nthey brought these claims down to a conclusion, the judge put them \nunder what we call a gag order where they were not allowed to consider \nor consult or even talk about the final settlement. It was more or less \nkept top secret from the press and media, and nobody knew it was going \non.\n  Of course, NHTSA has been practically dormant. They have not operated \nthe tire safety requirements since the year 1973, and this reflects on \nus in the committee. They have not had or ordered a single recall on \ntires in the last 5 years.\n\n  There have been 99 million overall safety vehicle recalls, but they \nhave all been voluntary on account of the threats of lawsuits. We know \nthat. It was only because of the word getting out about these lawsuits \nthat we finally have gotten to pay attention to this, bringing out a \nbill, unanimously reported under the leadership of the distinguished \nchairman of the Commerce Committee, which is totally bipartisan.\n  I join in the Senator's request, which I am confident he will make, \nthat we be able to bring the Senate bill up, amend the House bill, work \nthis out in the next few days--it could be worked out by tomorrow--and \nhave a good measure that would save lives in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina. I \nunderstand his concerns.\n  Let me quote from a letter from the Secretary of Transportation:\n\n       The early warning section of H.R. 5164, enables NHTSA to \n     obtain information about potential defects earlier than under \n     current law. The agency will use the information in deciding \n     whether to open an investigation and will be able to release \n     information in the context of its investigation, as it does \n     today. Information that is not made a part of an \n     investigation could be released if NHTSA determines it would \n     assist in carrying out the agency's investigative \n     responsibilities. The bill contains a new section 30170 that \n     augments the penalties under section 1001 of title 18, United \n     States Code, if a person intentionally misleads the \n     Secretary concerning a safety defect that results in death \n     or serious injury. A ``Safe Harbor'' provision would \n     excuse the person from the augmented penalties, but would \n     not excuse the person from other penalties under section \n     1001. The Department of Justice will communicate \n     separately its views on the criminal provisions.\n\n  I point out again, this is not a perfect bill. I want exactly what \ncame out of the Senate. The House passed, unanimously, by a voice vote, \nH.R. 5164.\n  The Secretary of Transportation says: ``We strongly support \nenactment.'' He finishes up by saying--and I hope my colleagues \nunderstand this--\n\n       In the final days of the 106th Congress, we must not lose \n     the opportunity to save lives and prevent injuries.\n\n  This is not a perfect piece of legislation but an awesome \nresponsibility, at least in the view of the Secretary of \nTransportation. An opportunity to save lives and prevent injuries is \noccurring here. I do not think we can let that pass by.\n  If there is objection, I will, again, ask that the Senator who \nobjects appear on the floor to object. We are not talking about a \npolicy decision here; we are talking about the fact that over 100 lives \nhave been taken on America's highways over a defect that, in the view \nof every expert, we are making significant progress in addressing.\n  So, Mr. President, I will begin with my first unanimous consent \nrequest, and I will follow it with a second unanimous consent request \nif it is objected to.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives \nH.R. 5164 from the House, it be held at the desk. I ask further that it \nbe in order for the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, to proceed to consideration of the bill, and that \nonly relevant amendments be in order to the bill, and that the bill \nthen, as amended, if amended, be advanced to third reading and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nArizona, I do not have a copy of the request, but it is my \nunderstanding, from hearing what the Senator read, it is a bill to come \nbefore the Senate with relevant amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes, that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder for the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic \nleader, to proceed to consideration of H.R. 5164 and that it be \nimmediately advanced to third reading and passed, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator read that \nunanimous consent request again, please?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, to \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 5164 and that it be immediately \nadvanced to third reading and passed, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from \nArizona, this has been signed off on by the ranking member of the \ncommittee and signed off on by the leadership over here. But we still \nhave two Senators who want to offer relevant amendments. We will work \non that and see what we can do. But at this stage, because of that, I \nam going to have to object unless the agreement allows for relevant \namendments. We would agree to time limits. We would agree to a very \nshort time limit on the relevant amendments, but we do have two \nSenators who wish to offer relevant amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I said on Friday, this is not an \nordinary piece of legislation. It is a piece of legislation that, in \nthe view of the Secretary of Transportation, has to do with saving \nlives and preventing injuries. Over 100 Americans have died on the \nhighways of America already.\n  After the completion of Senator Roberts' remarks, I will insist that \nthe two Senators come down and object in person. This is too serious a \nbusiness, I tell the Senator from Nevada, for them to assume a cloak of \nanonymity. If they want amendments, then I will be more than happy to \nhear their objections and see what their amendments are. But this is \nnot acceptable. It is not acceptable, when lives are at stake, for \nSenators--at least the Senator from Oklahoma objects and comes down and \ntakes the responsibility for the objection. It is not acceptable for \nMembers on the other side of the aisle to hide behind the Senator from \nNevada in their objections.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am asking the Senator from Arizona a question.\n  The unanimous consent request that you are now making is to take up \nand pass the bill that passed last night, without objection. It passed \nby a voice vote late last night, unanimously, through the House of \nRepresentatives, and is the bill that the Secretary of Transportation, \nMr. Slater, urged that the Senate and the Congress pass?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I might add, it has to do with saving lives and \npreventing injuries.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my friend from Arizona because, one, you \nare showing flexibility. I compliment you because you have stated what \nyour preference is. You have your preference in the bill that passed \nout of the Commerce Committee, of which you are the Chair and Senator \nHollings is the ranking member. But you are also saying, if I cannot \nget that, realizing that we are on overtime right now and we are \nrunning out of days, you are willing to say, let's take the House-\npassed bill. The House-passed bill passed unanimously. That does not \nhappen all that often around here for legislation that is this \nsignificant.\n  The Senator from Arizona is saying he is willing to take it and pass \nit. It is the same bill that the administration says they want. And it \nwill become law if we can get this consent agreed to.\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\n  So I compliment my colleague from Arizona. I hope our colleagues \nwould possibly even reconsider and let us pass this bill tonight or \ntomorrow.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under my reservation, I remind the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the Senator from Oklahoma that on Friday of last week \nwe agreed on this side to have the Senate bill brought before the \nSenate at that time, pursuant to the unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from Arizona, to have relevant amendments. We have no objection \nto that coming before the Senate and working on it that way.\n  This matter which has just passed the House, we just got it a matter \nof minutes ago--not hours ago; minutes ago--and we have two Senators \nwho want to look at this legislation. They have some idea that they \nwant to offer relevant amendments. We know that, come the light of day, \nthey may not want to offer those relevant amendments, but now they do.\n  So I say to my friend from Arizona that he can come back after \nSenator Roberts speaks, but the same objection will be there unless we \nhear in the interim that the Senators, for some unknown reason, \nwithdraw their objections.\n  On that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona retains the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just say that I will be here on the floor. If the \ntwo Senators who object from the other side of the aisle would like to \ncome down, I would be glad to discuss their concerns. I would be glad \nto commit to holding hearings, along with Senator Hollings, next year \nto try to perfect this bill.\n  I know my friend from South Carolina has serious concerns about the \nsafe harbor aspect of this bill. I intend to work with him to tighten \nit up. I much would have preferred the bill pass through the Senate, \nlet me tell you.\n  We inaugurated a little phrase called ``straight talk'' back when I \nwas seeking another office. I will tell you, in straight talk, what \nthis is all about. This is the trial lawyers against the automotive \ninterests. Trial lawyers do not want it because they do not like the \nprovisions. They want to be able to sue anybody for anything under any \ncircumstances. And the automotive industry wants this thing killed, \nfiguring that the publicity surrounding these accidents and these \ntragedies that are taking place will die out and they will be able to \nkill off this legislation next year.\n  Straight talk, Mr. President, that is really what it is all about. It \nis another compelling argument for campaign finance reform because \nneither the trial lawyers who want to make this bill untenable for the \nmanufacturers, nor the manufacturers who want to water down this bill \nso dramatically that it will have no effect, should be the ones who are \ndriving this problem.\n  This legislation is all about saving lives and preventing injuries. \nSo what we are seeing here is that special interests are winning again. \nI think it is wrong. I don't know how you go back to the American \npeople and say we didn't enact legislation--we could not get together \nafter a unanimous vote in the House--to resolve some concerns over an \nissue that ``would save lives and prevent injuries.''\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I say to my friend, he and I \ncame to Washington at the same time 18 years ago. I know he has more \npatience than I, but we have to have a little bit of patience. In this \ninstance, I don't think it is going to require a great deal of \npatience. We are going to be in session tomorrow, and I think there is \na very good possibility, as I see it, that the persuasive arguments \nSenators have made today and last week will prevail and this \nlegislation will pass.\n  As things now stand, we have people who haven't been able to read the \nbill. They may have some problems with it. The ranking member, the \nSenator from South Carolina, and some of our people over here--and, of \ncourse, the Senator from South Carolina works well with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, and we will see what we can do to get this wrapped up.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in closing, I appreciate the efforts on \nthe part of the Senator from Nevada. As he said, he and I came to \nCongress together many years ago, and we are good friends. I want to \nalso, again, pay great praise to Senator Hollings, who has really had \nto go a long way in compromising in order to see that this legislation \nis passed. I will be seeking unanimous consent tomorrow morning. I am \nnot exactly sure when, but it will be sometime in the morning when it \nfits in with the parliamentary procedures. I hope the unanimous consent \nrequest can be agreed to. I thank my friend from South Carolina and the \nSenator from Nevada. I know we will be working assiduously to try to \nget these objections solved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I don't want the Senator to take back \nhis praise, but let me clear the record relative to trial lawyers. \nTrial lawyers got us where we are. If it hadn't been for trial lawyers \nbringing the cases and filing some of the reports made on the \nrecoveries thereof, we would not have awakened, literally, and awakened \nour own Commerce Committee to have the hearings to put us on the floor \nthis evening.\n  I am intimate with the trial lawyer movement in this country. I can \ntell you that they have become a whipping boy for Tom Donahue and his \nblooming Chamber of Commerce, and any time you want to pass some \nmeasure like the Y2K bill, the trial lawyers had no objection \nwhatsoever.\n  I have to correct the record because the chairman said that is the \ncontest that is going on, about the right to sue and everything else. \nThey have the right. The right is there and neither the Senate bill nor \nthe House bill denies that right. We strengthen it with the reporting \nand then make the reports public so they can be attained, and they can \navoid going to court on cases and avoid trial lawyers. So this \nparticular bill is agreed to by this particular trial lawyer--either \nthe Senate or the House version this evening, right now. I would vote \nfor either one of them. But I think we can get a much better bill with \nthe Senate bill. I wanted to correct the comments made about the trial \nlawyers because they have been there bringing peace and justice and \nsafety to America's consumers. They got us this far, and I am proud to \ncommend the trial lawyers for doing their work and saving lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have one comment in response to my \nfriend. I knew any comment about trial lawyers would not go unnoticed \nby him. As always, I am very appreciative of his comments.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to join the Democratic whip in \npropounding the identical unanimous consent request with regard to the \nbringing up of the DOD conference report as stated to the Senate by the \ndistinguished majority leader just moments ago.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no objection. The staffs of Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner have worked out the problem.\n  Just a minute, Mr. President.\n  Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are not going to be \nable to do the agreement. There is a procedural problem with the \nAgriculture authorization, which goes first. We will work on that \nlater.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I handed the Senator a colloquy which \nSenator Levin signed. The Senator raising the objection signed the \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we have the Senator from Kansas speak, and we \nwill see if anything can be done.\n  Mr. WARNER. I withdraw the request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10232-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, today I come to the floor to offer a \ntribute to a humble man.\n  Yesterday, while I was in Minnesota, I received word that one of my \nformer colleagues from the House of Representatives, Congressman Bruce \nVento, had passed away after a battle with cancer.\n  My tribute cannot adequately communicate his successful career, \nbecause to Bruce, words always paled in comparison to acts.\n  Bruce was a tireless advocate for the residents of St. Paul, first in \nthe State Legislature and, for the past 24 years, in the U.S. Congress.\n  He was a man of his word and a man of principle.\n  He was a man committed to doing the right thing for the right reason, \nno matter how long it took.\n  Take for example his work on behalf of Hmong veterans--a large number \nof whom reside in his Congressional district.\n  He worked on it for over a decade: educating his colleagues about the \nneed to help their constituents and offering the compromises needed to \nget the job done.\n  I was pleased that after his tireless work Congress after Congress, \nyear after year, Bruce's effort paid off.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed and the President signed into law \nhis legislation to facilitate citizenship to Hmong veterans who served \nwith us in the Vietnam War.\n  Bruce was an effective Congressman for the St. Paul area.\n  We worked together on a number of fronts to support Minnesota and the \npeople of St. Paul such as improving senior and low-income housing in \nSt. Paul, supporting St. Paul's effort in becoming a Brownfields \nShowcase Community, and pursuing projects to improve the St. Paul \nCommunity.\n  Bruce is best known for his efforts to protect the environment and to \nimprove our national parks and wilderness areas.\n  All Minnesotans will benefit from his work to ensure the outdoor \nactivities we all enjoy will be there for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  That is his legacy, and we are all proud and grateful for his \nachievements.\n  Minnesotans were represented well by Bruce Vento, and he will be \nmissed.\n  To his family and friends, I extend my deepest sympathy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all in the Senate and the House have \nbeen saddened by the death of Bruce Vento. Congressman Vento came to \nthe Congress 2 years after I did. We served together and worked \ntogether on many issues. He belonged, proudly, to a sort of informal \nItalian-American caucus. We would talk about from which parts of Italy \nour families had come, and we became close friends.\n  I remember talking with Bruce when he was first diagnosed with \ncancer. I told him he was in my prayers, my wife's prayers, our \nfamily's prayers. He was a good man.\n  I was sad when I heard him announce he would not run for reelection \nbecause of his illness. Of course, we have been notified of his death.\n  There are Senators and House Members who come here who, under the old \nsaying, some are show horses and some are workhorses. He was a \nworkhorse. One of his priorities during his last year in Congress was \nthe plight of the Hmong people, many of whom settled in Minnesota. They \nare people from Laos who had fought with the United States and its \nallies in the Vietnam war and came to the United States afterwards. \nThey very much wanted to become citizens here but had great difficulty \nlearning English because they come from a culture that does not have a \nwritten language.\n  Bruce Vento was the primary House sponsor of the Hmong Veterans' \nNaturalization Act, a bill that passed the House and Senate earlier \nthis year and became law. This bill waives the English language \nrequirement for naturalization, and provides special consideration for \nthe civics requirement for Hmong veterans and their spouses and widows. \nIt has been a small concession on our part in return for the great \nsacrifices these men made in fighting for the American cause in \nSoutheast Asia. I am pleased that with the help of Senators Wellstone, \nFeingold, Hagel, McCain, and others the bill became law before the \nCongressman's untimely death earlier this week.\n  There is another bill that addresses an outstanding issue in the \nHmong Veterans' Naturalization Act. H.R. 5234, cosponsored by \nCongressman Vento, will extend the benefits of the new law to widows of \nHmong veterans who died in Laos, Thailand, or Vietnam. The bill was \npassed by voice vote in the House on September 25. The Senate companion \nbill is strongly bipartisan with seven Democrats and five Republicans \njoining Senator Wellstone as sponsors. I urge my friends on the other \nside of the aisle to lift the hold they have on this bill and allow it \nto pass so we can complete our work on this important issue. We can do \nthis in Bruce Vento's memory, but we can also rectify an injustice that \nhas been done to the Hmong people who have come to this country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I join my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, in paying tribute to the \nlife of our colleague, Congressman Bruce Vento. I learned of the \nCongressman's passing upon my return to Washington. I send my \ncondolences to his wife Sue and his family, along with all of the \npeople from the great state of Minnesota who mourn and who thank him \nfor his many years of service in the House of Representatives. He is \ndeserving of special praise in recognition of his tremendous efforts to \nuse his status as a federal legislator to bring a voice to the \nvoiceless and to defend such interests as environmental protection, \nhuman rights, working families and community building.\n  Congressman Vento's career was a truly a remarkable one. He and I \nshared a profound affection for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area \nWilderness, a place special to so many Wisconsinites and Minnesotans. \nCongressman Vento bravely agreed to chair the Ely field hearings on the \ncreation of the Boundary Waters wilderness in 1977, a courageous \ndecision for someone who was a Freshman member of the House at the \ntime, and was a vocal champion of that wilderness throughout his \ncareer. As I work on wilderness issues, I am often reminded of \nCongressman Vento's comments on the House floor during consideration of \nthe Boundary Waters bill. He said, ``there ought to be an opportunity \nwhere someone can go and have some solitude, where someone can go and \nhave an experience that is different.''\n  Congressman Vento used his career to work to protect that \n``different'' opportunity for all Americans in the Boundary Waters, the \nArctic Refuge, Southern Utah and many other special wilderness areas. \nThese places and the people who cherish them, myself included, owe him \na great debt.\n  I also had the privilege of working closely with Congressman Vento in \nthis session of Congress on the Hmong Veterans' Naturalization Act \nwhich is now federal law. Congressman Vento was actively involved in \ngetting that legislation through the House.\n  I join with the Senate in letting Congressman Vento's family know how \ngrateful we are for having known him, and how committed we are to \nensuring that the causes to which he gave his heart and his career \nremain protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10233-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10233-S10234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS \n                          COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks on a timely \nand important topic--our national celebration of Hispanic Heritage \nMonth.\n  Hundreds of years after the decline of the Spanish Empire, a new \nHispanic presence is making itself felt on the world stage. Democracy \nis taking deep root throughout much of Latin America. Mexico just \ncelebrated the selection of a new President in an election that is \nwidely viewed as the freest and fairest election in that country's \nhistory. Central America is largely at peace. Free trade has spread \nsouth of our border, and will continue to spread further south.\n  And Hispanic Americans are taking their rightful place in this \ncountry as an important part of our thriving economy, as a wonderful \ncontributor to the diversity of American culture, and as a powerful \npolitical force that deserves attention.\n  It is fitting, then--as National Hispanic Heritage Month is upon us--\nto recognize the Hispanic-American population for its many important \ncontributions to the traditions and history of this nation. Started 32 \nyears ago, this festive month acknowledges the great history of the \nHispanic people, celebrate their past achievements, and recognizes that \nthe Hispanic-American community is an essential component in the future \nof the United States.\n  Hispanics have immigrated to the United States for many different \npersonal reasons. They have taken the journey to America in hope of a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. They have persevered \nthroughout their struggle to maintain their own identity while learning \nto assimilate into American ways.\n  Today, the Hispanic population in the United States has expanded and \nbecome more diverse. It is now our fastest growing ethnic group, its \npopulation increasing almost four times as fast as the rest of the \npopulation. The Hispanic population is projected to account for 44 \npercent of the growth in the nation's population between 1995 and 2025. \nHispanics are literally changing the face of this nation.\n  The label ``Hispanic-American'' encompasses an enormous diversity of \nindividuals. Hispanics are not a single ethnic group but are comprised \nof people from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, and the countries of Central \nand South America. This diversity has brought a tradition of resilience \nand excellence to the United States, a country that derives its \nstrength from the diversity of its people.\n  There is an emerging awareness of the contributions and achievements \nHispanics have made. Hispanic individuals are prominent in every aspect \nof American life. In the business world, such names as Adolfo Marzol, \nexecutive vice-president of Fannie Mae and George Munoz, CEO of the \nOverseas Private Investment Corporation, are being recognized. Oscar \nHijuelos, the first American-born Hispanic to win the Pulitzer Prize \nfor fiction, is known as one of literature's award-winning authors. \nMaria Hinojosa, a CNN correspondent, was named one of the most \ninfluential Hispanic Americans by Hispanic Business magazine, and has \nreceived many awards for her reporting. These are just some of the \nextraordinary individuals who contribute to Hispanic-American culture \nin our country.\n  A few of the names of Hispanic-Americans from my home state of \nIllinois will resonate in history, like Luis Alvarez, the Nobel Price-\nwinning physicist, who studied at the University of Chicago before \ngoing on to become a central figure in the Manhattan project during \nWorld War II. Others are heroes on a quieter scale, like Raymond Orozco \nwho, until his retirement a few years back, headed the Chicago Fire \nDepartment with distinction, or Sandra Cisneros whose beautiful stories \nof women's courage in the midst of poverty have won her international \nacclaim. But most of all we benefit as a state and as a nation from the \nthousands of ordinary folks whose lives and dreams and everyday actions \nmake this a richer, stronger, more interesting place to live.\n  The emergence of a sizable Hispanic-American population has been \nparticularly notable in Illinois, to the great benefit of the state. \nMore than a million Illinoisans are of Hispanic heritage. They own \n20,000 businesses in the state and generate more than $2 billion in \ncommerce. More than a quarter of a million Hispanic-Americans are \nregistered to vote here, and the state can boast over 1,000 elected \nofficials--from school board members to members of Congress--of \nHispanic heritage.\n  While celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, we shouldn't blind \nourselves to the problems that still beset the Hispanic-American \ncommunity. The poverty rate among Hispanics is still unacceptably high, \nand Hispanic youth are graduating from high school at rates \nsignificantly lower than the general population. Thankfully, many of \nthese problems have abated in the last decade--unemployment among \nHispanics is at historically low levels, for example--but there's still \nplenty of work to be done.\n  That's why I support the ``2010 Alliance'' crafted by Hispanic-\nAmerican leaders and key policymakers, and announced by President \nClinton this June. The Alliance sets educational goals for Hispanic-\nAmericans in five key areas, such as increasing the rate of high school \ncompletion and increasing English language proficiency for students. \nThe President's budget for 2001 contains more than $800 million for \nprograms to enhance educational opportunities for Hispanic-Americans.\n  I am also hoping to see passage this session of the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. This important piece of legislation will insure \nthat all immigrants from Latin America are treated equally in the eyes \nof the law. The current system that treats immigrants from one country \ndifferently from those from another country is cumbersome, confusing \nand inherently unfair. This Act will also restore some important rights \nthat have historically been offered to the immigrant population, but \nthat are now denied to them due to the highly restrictive policies \nadopted in the past few years. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act as \nthe support of virtually every Democratic Senator as well as strong \nsupport from President Clinton and Vice President Gore. I am working \nhard to overcome Republican resistance to the bill so that it can \nbecome law.\n  The Hispanic population has become an integral part of the American \nmosaic. We have become united by the aspiration to make a better life \nfor ourselves and our children. We know that America and what it stands \nfor--freedom, prosperity, and hope--should extend to everyone the \nopportunity to achieve their dreams.\n  Through the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month we can deepen our \nunderstanding and appreciation for a culture that has been so \ninfluential in creating the America of today and that will help shape \nthe America of tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10234-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10234-S10236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the last several weeks I have \nlistened as some of my Democratic colleagues have taken the Senate \nfloor to complain about the Senate's work on judicial nominations. Some \nhave complained that there is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts. \nSome have complained that the Republican\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nSenate has not confirmed enough of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. Some have complained that the confirmation record of the \nRepublican Senate compares unfavorably to the Democrats' record when \nthey controlled this body. Some have accused the Republican Senate of \nbeing biased against female and minority judicial nominees. These \ncomplaints and accusations are wholly false and completely without \nmerit.\n  First, there is and has been no judicial vacancy crisis. In 1994, \nwhen Senate Democrats processed the nominations of President Clinton, \nthere were 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate. Today, when \nRepublicans control the Senate and process the nominations of President \nClinton, there are 63 vacancies and a 7.4 percent vacancy rate--exactly \nthe same as in 1994. Of the current vacancies, the President has failed \nto make a nomination for 25 of them--strong evidence that, in fact, \nthere is no vacancy crisis. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there \nare the same number of vacancies and the same vacancy rate now as in \n1994, Democrats continue to claim that there is a vacancy crisis.\n  Second, the Republican Senate has been fair with President Clinton in \nconfirming his nominees. In fact, the Senate has confirmed President \nClinton's nominees at almost an identical rate as it confirmed those of \nPresidents Reagan and Bush. President Reagan appointed 382 Article III \njudges. By comparison, President Clinton has appointed 377 Article III \njudges--only five fewer than were appointed by President Reagan. During \nthe Reagan presidency, the Senate confirmed an average of 191 judges \nper term. During the one-term Bush presidency, the Senate confirmed 193 \njudges. During the Clinton presidency, the Senate has confirmed an \naverage of 189 judges per term.\n  Third, the confirmation record of the Republican Senate compares \nfavorably to the Democrats' record when they controlled this body. \nComparing like to like, this year should be compared to prior election \nyears during times of divided government. In 1988, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate confirmed 41 Reagan judicial nominees. The Republican \nSenate this year has confirmed 39 of President Clinton's nominees--a \nnearly identical number.\n  The 1992 election year requires a bit more analysis. The Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate did confirm 64 Bush nominees that year, but this high \nnumber was due to the fact that Congress had recently created 85 new \njudgeships. Examining the percentage of nominees confirmed shows that \ncompared to 1992, there is no slowdown this year. In 1992, the \nDemocrat-controlled Senate confirmed 33 of 73 individuals nominated \nthat year--or 45 percent. This year, the Senate has confirmed 25 of 46 \nindividuals nominated in 2000--or 54 percent, almost 10 percent higher \nthan in 1992. Those who cite the 1992 high of 64 confirmations as \nevidence of an election-year slowdown do not mention these details. Nor \ndo they mention that despite those 64 confirmations, the Democrat-\ncontrolled Senate left vacant 97 judgeships when President Bush left \noffice--far more than the current 63 vacancies.\n  Senate Democrats often cite Chief Justice Rehnquist's 1997 remarks as \nevidence of a Republican slowdown. Referring to the 82 vacancies then \nexisting, the Chief Justice said: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such \nhigh levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal Judiciary.'' \nSenators who cite this statement, however, do not also cite the Chief \nJustice's similar statement in 1993, when the Democrats controlled both \nthe White House and the Senate: ``There is perhaps no issue more \nimportant to the judiciary right now than this serious judicial vacancy \nproblem.'' As the head of the Judicial Branch, the Chief Justice has \ncontinued to maintain pressure on the President and Senate to speedily \nconfirm judges. He has not singled out the Republican Senate, however.\n  The Chief Justice made additional comments in 1997, which also \nundermine the claim of a vacancy crisis. After calling attention to the \nexisting vacancies, he wrote: ``Fortunately for the Judiciary, a \ndependable corps of senior judges has contributed significantly to \neasing the impact of unfilled judgeships.'' The 63 current vacancies, \nin other words, are not truly vacant. There are 363 senior judges \npresently serving in the federal judiciary. Although judges' seats are \ntechnically counted as vacant, they continue to hear cases at reduced \nworkload. Assuming that they maintain a 25 percent workload--the \nminimum required by law--the true number of vacancies is less than \nzero.\n  Last week, Senator Harkin said that this year the Senate has \nconfirmed only one circuit court nominee nominated this year, and \nSenator Leahy said that this year the Judiciary Committee has reported \nonly three circuit court nominees nominated this year. The fact is, \nhowever, the Senate has confirmed eight circuit judges this year. By \ncomparison, the Democrat-controlled Senate confirmed seven of President \nReagan's circuit court nominees in 1988 and 11 of President Bush's \ncircuit court nominees in 1992.\n  It is true that of the eight circuit court nominees confirmed this \nyear, some were nominated during the first session and some were \nnominated during the second session of this Congress--just as the seven \nReagan circuit court nominees confirmed in 1988 and the 11 Bush circuit \ncourt nominees confirmed in 1992 were nominated in both the first and \nsecond sessions of those Congresses.\n  The fact that the Senate has confirmed eight circuit court nominees \nin this election year shows that we have been at least as fair to \nPresident Clinton with regard to appeals court nominees, as Democrats \nwere to Presidents Reagan and Bush. The Senate has confirmed one more \ncircuit court nominee in this last year of President Clinton's \nPresidency than Democrats confirmed in the last year of President \nReagan's presidency, and only three circuit judges fewer than Democrats \nconfirmed in the last year of President Bush's presidency--when \njudicial vacancies were at an all time high.\n  Fourth, allegations of race or sex bias in the confirmation process \nare absolutely false and are offensive. Over the last several months, I \nhave listened with dismay as some have, with escalating invective, \nimplied that Senate Republicans are biased against minority or female \njudicial nominees.\n  Just this month, President Clinton issued a statement alleging bias \nby the Senate. He said: ``The quality of justice suffers when highly \nqualified women and minority candidates are denied an opportunity to \nserve in the judiciary.'' The White House, though, also issued a \nstatement boasting of the high number of women and minorities that \nClinton has appointed to the federal courts: ``The President's record \nof appointing women and minority judges is unmatched by any President \nin history. Almost half of President Clinton's judicial appointees have \nbeen women or minorities.''\n\n  The Senate, obviously, confirmed this record number of women and \nminorities. That is hardly evidence of systemic bias. Indeed, it cannot \ncredibly be argued that President Clinton has appointed a diverse \nfederal bench and that Republicans simultaneously have prevented him \nfrom appointing a diverse federal bench.\n  Last November, Senator Joseph Biden, former Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, stated:\n\n       There has been argumentation occasionally made . . . that \n     [the Judiciary] Committee . . . has been reluctant to move on \n     certain people based upon gender or ethnicity or race. . . . \n     [T]here is absolutely no distinction made [on these grounds] \n     . . . [W]hether or not [a nominee moves] has not a single \n     thing to do with gender or race. . . . I realize I will get \n     political heat for saying that, but it happens to be true.\n\n  Why then have Democrats insisted on repeating the insidious mantra \nthat the Republican Senate is discriminating against women and \nminorities in the confirmation process? Why did John Podesta, the \nPresident's Chief of Staff appear on CNN yesterday to complain that \n``women and minority candidates for U.S. Court of Appeals are sitting, \nstuck in the Senate Judiciary Committee''? Why did Senator Robb take \nthe Senate floor to accuse Senate Republicans, in inflammatory \nlanguage, of ``standing in the courthouse door'' and refusing to \n``desegregate the Fourth Circuit''? Why did Senator Leahy take the \nSenate floor and list all the female nominees currently pending?\n  Why? Because Democrats have made the crass political decision to \nattempt to energize women and minority voters by claiming that Senate \nRepublicans are biased against women and minorities nominated for \nfederal judgeships. This coordinated overture to female and minority \nvoters by the White House, the Gore campaign and Senate Democrats is \nunseemly.\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\n  The President's determination to play politics with judicial \nnominations appears as if it will only intensify. Just last Friday, the \nPresident nominated African-American Andre Davis to a seat on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and it is my understanding \nthat he will nominate a woman, Elizabeth Gibson, to that Court today.\n  The President has persisted in making these nominations, even though \nI have made clear to him that the Judiciary Committee will not hold any \nadditional nominations hearing this year. The President nominated Mr. \nDavis and Ms. Gibson, knowing full well that they have no chance of \nbeing confirmed. Mr. Davis and Ms. Gibson are being used for political \npurposes, so the President and Democrats can argue that Senate \nRepublicans are biased against women and minorities.\n  Senate Republicans, however, are not biased against women and \nminority nominees. Data comparing the median time required for Senate \naction on male vs. female and minority vs. non-minority nominees shows \nonly minor differences. During President Bush's final two years in \noffice, the Democrat-controlled Senate took 16 days longer to confirm \nfemale nominees compared with males. This differential decrease to only \n4 days when Republicans gained control of the Senate in 1994. During \nthe subsequent 105th and 106th Congresses, it increased.\n  The data concerning minority nominees likewise shows no clear trend. \nWhen Republicans gained control in 1994, it took 28 days longer to \nconfirm minority nominees as compared to non-minority nominees. This \ndifference decreased markedly during the 105th Congress so that \nminorities were confirmed 10 days faster than non-minorities. The \npresent 106th Congress is taking only 11 days longer to confirm \nminority nominees than it is to confirm non-minority nominees.\n\n  These minor differences are a matter of happenstance. They show no \nclear trend. Senator Biden is right when he says that ``whether or not \n[a nominee moves] has not a single thing to do with gender or race.'' \nAnd even if there were actual differences, a differential of a week or \ntwo is insignificant compared to the average time that it takes to \nselect and confirm a nominee. On average, the Clinton White House \nspends an average of 315 days to select a nominee while the Senate \nrequires an average of 144 days to confirm.\n  Under my stewardship, the Judiciary Committee has considered \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees more carefully than the \nDemocratic Senate did in 1993 and 1994. Some individuals confirmed by \nthe Senate then likely would not clear the committee today. The \nSenate's power of advice and consent, after all, is not a rubber stamp.\n  There is no evidence, however, of bias or of a confirmation slowdown. \nThere is no evidence of bias because, in fact, the Senate is not biased \nagainst female and minority nominees--indeed, the Senate has confirmed \na record number of such nominees for judicial office. Furthermore, \nthere is no evidence of a confirmation slowdown because, in fact, the \nconfirmation process has been conducted in the normal fashion and at \nthe normal speed.\n  In conclusion, it always is the case that some nominations ``die'' at \nthe end of the Congress. In 1992, when Democrats controlled the Senate, \nCongress adjourned without having acted on 53 Bush nominations. I have \na list here of the 53 Bush nominees whose nominations expired when the \nSenate adjourned in 1992, at the end of the 102nd Congress. By \ncomparison, there are only 40 Clinton nominations that will expire when \nthis Congress adjourns. My Democratic colleagues have discussed at \nlength some of the current nominees whose nominations will expire at \nthe adjournment of this Congress. Madam President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this list of 53 Bush nominations that Senate Democrats \npermitted to expire in 1992 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n BUSH NOMINATIONS RETURNED BY THE DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED SENATE IN 1992 AT\n                     THE CLOSE OF THE 102D CONGRESS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  Nominee                               Court\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSidney A.

I would note that the Reagan and Bush nominations that \nSenate Democrats allowed to expire included the nominations of \nminorities and women, such as Lillian BeVier, Frederico Moreno and Judy \nHope.\n  I do not have any personal objection to the judicial nominees who my \nDemocratic colleagues have spoken about over the last few weeks. I am \nsure that they are all fine people. Similarly, I do not think that my \nDemocratic colleagues had any personal objections to the 53 judicial \nnominees whose nominations expired in 1992, at the end of the Bush \npresidency.\n  Many of the Republican nominees whose confirmations were blocked by \nthe Democrats have gone on to great careers both in public service and \nthe private sector. Senator Jeff Sessions, Governor Frank Keating and \nWashington attorney John Roberts are just a few examples that come to \nmind.\n  I know that it is small comfort to the individuals whose nominations \nare pending, but the fact of the matter is that inevitably some \nnominations will expire when the Congress adjourns. It happens every \ntwo years. I personally believe that Senate Republicans should get some \ncredit for keeping the number of vacancies that will die at the end of \nthis Congress relatively low. As things now stand, 13 fewer nominations \nwill expire at the end of this year than expired at the end of the Bush \nPresidency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10236-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10236-S10237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HAWAII'S PREPAREDNESS FOR A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION TERRORIST \n                                INCIDENT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to commend the joint efforts of the \nfederal Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, the Honolulu \nEmergency Services Department, and Hawaii's Department of Health, and \nNational Guard for establishing one of the Nation's premier weapons of \nmass destruction, WMD, containment, mitigation and response \ncapabilities. As the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and \nFederal Services, I follow Federal terrorism defense programs closely, \nespecially those that affect Hawaii.\n  Terrorism, particularly the threat of domestic terrorism, remains at \nthe forefront of concern for all of us. Although it has been 7 years \nsince the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center and 5 years since \nthe destruction of the Oklahoma City Federal Building, these \nunspeakable atrocities left an indelible mark in the hearts of all \nAmericans. In the intervening years, the threat of terrorism has become \nmore pronounced. The National Commission on Terrorism recently \nconcluded that ``. . . international terrorism poses an increasingly \ndangerous and difficult threat to America--today's terrorists seek to \ninflict mass casualties, and they are attempting to do so both overseas \nand on American soil. This was underscored by the December 1999 arrests \nin Jordan and at the U.S./Canadian border of foreign nationals who were \nallegedly planning to\n\n[[Page S10237]]\n\nattack crowded millennium celebrations.'' Fortunately, we have made \nsignifcant strides in enhancing our defense against and reducing our \nvulnerabilities to terrorism.\n  The Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996, Public \nLaw 104-201, Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment, authorized a coordinated \nFederal response to train, equip, and otherwise enhance the capability \nof Federal, State, and local emergency ``first responders,'' e.g., \nprimarily police, fire, and emergency medical officers, for terrorist \nincidents involving mass casualties, or nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons. Most of our current antiterrorism programs are \noutgrowths of this landmark legislation.\n  More than 40 Federal departments, agencies, and bureaus have some \nrole in combating terrorism. The Justice Department, through the FBI, \nis the lead Federal agency for domestic terrorism and provides on-site \nemergency law enforcement response to all incidents. However, State and \nlocal governments and emergency responders bear the primary \nresponsibility for responding to terrorist incidents, augmented by \nFederal resources. Therefore, Federal, State, and local coordination \nand cooperation is critical to ensuring that our population centers are \nproperly safeguarded. I am particularly pleased with terrorism \npreparedness efforts in Hawaii, which have been hailed by HHS as \n``exemplary'' and ``national models.''\n  Two little known, but essential components of the national \nantiterrorism program and support to local communities are Civil \nSupport Teams, CSTs, and Metropolitan Medical Response Systems, MMRS.\n  Hawaii's Civil Support Team is one of 27 Army and Air National Guard \nCSTs that will be deployed in 26 States by the spring of 2001. Each \nteam consists of 22 members who undergo 15 months of specialized \ntraining. Each team is equipped with a mobile analytical lab and a \ncommunications facility. Teams would be deployed to assist first \nresponders in the event of a WMD incident. The teams, under the command \nof a State's governor, provide support to civilian agencies to assess \nthe nature of an attack, provide medical and technical advice, and help \ncoordinate subsequent State and Federal responses. Hawaii's Weapons of \nMass Destruction Civil Support Team, the 93rd WMD-CST, is a composite \nArmy/Air National Guard Unit, and component of the Hawaii Army National \nGuard, Headquarters, State Area Command. The team is currently \nundergoing training at Fort Leonard Wood, MO, and is expected to be \nfully trained and deployed by May 2001.\n  In 1997, Honolulu was selected as one of the first 25 cities in the \nNation to contract with HHS to develop a Metropolitan Medical Response \nSystem and procure essential prophylactic pharmaceuticals and \nspecialized equipment. MMRS are multi-disciplinary medical teams \nconsisting of physicians, nurses, paramedics, emergency medical \ntechnicians, and law enforcement officers, who provide initial on-site \nresponse and care, provide for safe patient transportation to hospital \nemergency rooms, provide definitive medical and mental health care to \nvictims of various types of attack, and can prepare patients for onward \nmovement to other regions, should this be required In August 2000, the \nHHS expanded Hawaii's MMRS program by directing and funding an \nassessment of the unique needs of geographically isolated jurisdictions \nand an evaluation of long-term sustainment of the MMRS. Both studies \nwill serve as national models. This is a further testament of the \nquality of Hawaii's MMRS program and highly complimentary of the \npersonnel involved in its development.\n  Fortunately, terrorism involving the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction is likely to remain rare. Nevertheless, as in the case of \nother low probability/high consequence risks, it remains a very serious \nand highly complex national concern. The precautionary safeguards we \nhave taken thus far are essential and prudent, but offer no guarantees. \nWe need to remain vigilant and ensure that our antiterrorism and \ncounter terrorism programs continue to be properly funded, adequately \nmaintained, and adjusted to meet the ever evolving threat. The American \npublic demands no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10237-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10237-S10238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PIPELINE SAFETY\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I deeply regret that the House of \nRepresentatives failed yesterday to favorably approve S. 2438, the \nPipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000. That measure was taken up \nunder suspension of the rules in the House, and therefore, needed two-\nthirds of the members present and voting to support its passage. The \nfinal vote was 232 to 158.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate has worked long and hard to produce \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation. As a result of our \nbipartisan efforts, we unanimously approved S. 2438 nearly four weeks \nago. That measure includes the best provisions from four separate \nproposals pending in the Senate, including legislation introduced by \nSenators Murray and Gorton, the measure introduced by Senator Hollings \non behalf of the Administration, the bill introduced by Senator \nBingaman, and the bill I introduced along with Senators Murray and \nGorton. While the final bill may not be the preference of every member, \nit is a fair and balanced compromise piece of legislation and, to quote \nSecretary Slater, ``is critical to make much-needed improvements to the \npipeline safety program. It provides for stronger enforcement, \nmandatory testing of all pipelines, community right-to-know \ninformation, and additional resources.''\n  There is one and only one reason the Senate bill fell 28 votes short, \npreventing it from being on its way to the President at this moment: \nPartisan Politics.\n  I can understand the hesitation on the part of some to approve a \nmeasure that doesn't include every single provision they envision as \nnecessary to address pipeline safety improvements. But the Senate-\npassed bill is a good bill and would go a long way in promoting safety \nimprovements. Senator Murray said it best on the floor of the Senate \njust two weeks ago: ``Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'' \nBut instead of heeding that advise, the House has neither approved its \nown version of a pipeline safety bill nor has it approved the Senate's \nunanimously-passed bill. And now time is simply running out.\n  I do not relish voicing criticism toward the House opponents of S. \n2438. But because of their actions, we will most likely fail to make \nany advancement in pipeline safety this year. And if we are ultimately \nprevented from enacting pipeline safety legislation in these remaining \nfew days of the session, these and the other members working with them \nwill be even less pleased by the criticisms I will be directing their \nway if even one more life is lost because of our inaction. Be assured, \nI will be back on this floor reminding everyone of our missed \nopportunity to address identified pipeline safety shortcomings due to \nthe actions of these few members. They will be held accountable.\n  Mr. Inslee from the State of Washington testified before the Senate \nCommerce Committee in May on the need to pass comprehensive \nlegislation, noting that the ``opportunity to pass comprehensive, \nmeaningful legislation may not come again until there is another \ntragedy''. Sadly, since the time Mr. Inslee made those comments, two \nother accidents have occurred--claiming a total of 13 more lives. How \nmany more lives are going to be lost before Congress finally passes \npipeline safety legislation?\n  It is my understanding Mr. Inslee has urged the Administration, \nmembers of his House delegation, and leadership on the House side, not \nto support the Senate bill. It is also my understanding that he has \nignored advice from his own Senate colleague, Senator Murray, on this \nmatter. In doing so, he is dooming the months of effort that a member \nof his own party, a Senator from his own home state, has put into \ncrafting a bill that will undoubtably improve pipeline safety. His \nactions may have killed the only chance that pipeline safety \nlegislation will pass this year. And in doing so, he is ensuring that \neven more lives may be lost--and that the unacceptable status quo will \nremain.\n  I support passage of the strongest safety bill possible, and I know \nthe House members I have mentioned are fully aware of this fact. The \nstrongest bill possible at this time is the bill we approved in the \nSenate three weeks\n\n[[Page S10238]]\n\nago. Mr. Inslee's and others' claims that their efforts are driven by a \ndesire for a stronger bill sound well and good. But the reality is \nthose efforts only preclude any advancement in pipeline safety from \noccurring. The actions of these members not only ignore the substantial \nsteps we've made to reach a fair, balanced pro-safety bill, but also \ncould jeopardize the likelihood we'll make any progress on pipeline \nsafety for many years to come.\n  I urge those members obstructing action on pipeline safety \nlegislation to think carefully about the consequences of their \nobstructionist actions. Each day that passes without enactment of \ncomprehensive pipeline safety legislation places public safety at risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10238-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SITUATION IN THE IVORY COAST\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the alarming \nsituation in the Ivory Coast.\n  When General Robert Guei seized power in a coup last December, he \nindicated that he intended to hand over power to a civilian government \nquickly. Instead, and despite the urging of distinguished African heads \nof state from South Africa, Nigeria, and Senegal, Guei has chosen to \nrun for President from his position of illegitimate authority, in which \nhe can manipulate his own chances of electoral success.\n  Last Friday, the Ivory Coast's Supreme Court issued a ruling barring \nall but five of twenty candidates seeking to run in Presidential \nelections slated for later this month. The ruling disqualified popular \nopposition leaders, most notably Former Prime Minister Alassane \nOuattara, and the former ruling party's candidate, Emile Constant \nBombey. Notably, Guei's former legal advisor is now serving as the \ncourt's chief. The upcoming elections are looking more and more like \npolitical farce, and General Guei's credibility is in tatters.\n  Leading up to the Court's ruling, the General Guei's government took \nactions clearly intended to intimidate the opposition, instituting a \nstate of emergency, banning opposition politicians from international \ntravel, and executing sweeps to round up immigrants who have \nconsistently supported elements of the opposition. The junta that \nclaimed it stepped into power to save the country now appears committed \nto a course of destruction. One of Africa's most stable and important \neconomies is threatened by the instability exacerbated by the junta's \npolitical machinations, and General Guei's attempts to rally popular \nsupport have been characterized by misguided, xenophobic rhetoric aimed \nat threatening foreigners in a country that depends upon an immigrant \nworkforce.\n  The people of the Ivory Coast deserve far better than this. At its \ncore, democratic government is about trusting citizens to choose their \nown destiny, not about manipulating and restricting the choices \navailable to them. The West African region, currently engaged in a \nstruggle between the forces of democracy and those of thuggery, \ncertainly does not need another thinly disguised dictatorship in its \nranks. The only interests served by the junta's behavior are their own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10238-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10238-S10239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, CO-CHAIR OF THE NORTHEAST-\n                        MIDWEST SENATE COALITION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the excellent \nservice of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan as co-chair of the \nbipartisan Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition. Senator Moynihan, as we \nall know and regret, will be retiring from the United States Senate at \nthe end of this year. Many people have commented on his excellent \nservice to the nation and to New York State. I want to pay tribute to \nhis leadership on regional issues.\n  Senator Moynihan was elected co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate \nCoalition in April 1987. A bipartisan group of senators had formed the \nCoalition in 1978 with the goal of promoting regional economic and \nenvironmental interests. Senator Moynihan replaced Senator Alan Dixon, \nand served for several years with Senator John Heinz. Upon his election \nas co-chair, Senator Moynihan said, ``States in the frost belt have of \nlate shared a burden of heavy losses in manufacturing jobs, military \ninstallations and contracts. Environmental concerns, from the rising \nwaters of the Great Lakes to acid rain, occupy us all.''\n  Over the past seven Congresses, Senator Moynihan persistently has \nadvanced investments in our region's infrastructure, job-training and \neducation programs, and basic industries. A stickler for accurate and \ntimely data in order to judge our challenges and progress, he has \ndocumented the flow of federal funds from the Northeast and Midwest. \nWorking with both Republicans and Democrats, he also has been a \nchampion of the Great Lakes and the region's other great environmental \nassets.\n  Now, Lake Champlain may not be a great Lake to the rest of you, but \nin our part of the world, it is revered in the same way. And it is the \nreason behind my earliest work with Senator Moynihan.\n  In the summer of 1989, when I was a freshman Member of the minority \nparty and Senator Moynihan was Chair of the Environment Subcommittee on \nWater Resources, he scheduled a field hearing to gather information on \nthe water quality status of Lake Champlain. The hearing was split into \ntwo sessions, one on each side of the lake. We heard from Vermonters in \nBurlington, then enjoyed a boat ride across the lake to hear from \nupstate New Yorkers in Plattsburgh.\n  As his first act after commencing the hearing in Burlington, Chairman \nMoynihan graciously handed the gavel to me so that I might preside over \nthe Vermont portion of the hearing. That marked the first time I ever \nchaired a Senate hearing, and was made ever more memorable by the fact \nthat Daniel Patrick Moynihan had bestowed the honor.\n  We had an enjoyable, productive day, during the course of which \nChairman Moynihan entertained and enlightened the participants with his \nintimate knowledge of the history of Lake Champlain, one our nation's \nmost historic water bodies. Moreover, he demonstrated a keen knowledge \nof the science, hydrology and ecology of Lake Champlain. Senator \nMoynihan was bestowed a hero's welcome by his constituents upon \ndisembarking on the Adirondack coast of Lake Champlain that day. He \nearned an everlasting respect among all who participated in the \nhearing.\n  We returned to Washington to draft the Lake Champlain Special \nDesignation Act, in concert with Senators Leahy and D'Amato, and \npromptly moved the bill through the scrutiny of the Water Resources \nSubcommittee, then the full Environment Committee and on to the Senate \nfloor. Before the year had ended, that bill had become law. And it has \nproven to be a great success for the benefit of Lake Champlain, as well \nas a model for cooperation between different states, distinct federal \nregional jurisdictions and separate nations.\n  Senator Moynihan, I commend you for your leadership on this important \nlaw. And I thank you for the latitude you gave me, in my first year in \nthis United States Senate, to put my mark upon this legislation which \ncontinues to have a profound and positive influence on the ecology of \nLake Champlain and the quality of life for the hundreds of thousands of \npeople who live, work and recreate.\n  Aside from this example, there are many others. Senator Moynihan took \nhis assignment as co-chair of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coalition \nduring a time when our region was being less than affectionately \nreferred to as the ``rust belt.'' Manufacturing plants were closing, \nunemployment was high, and many workers needed to be retrained for new \nchallenges. Senator Moynihan led the Coalition in trying to identify \nand promote public policies that would take advantage of the region's \ncommon assets--its plentiful natural resources, distinguished \nuniversity and research centers, significant financial centers, and a \nhistory of entrepreneurship.\n  Although he would be the first to admit that challenges remain, this \nregion's progress over the past decade and a half results, in part, \nfrom Senator Moynihan's consistent leadership.\n  With Senator Moynihan's leadership, the Coalition has advanced \nnumerous policy initiatives. It authored the nation's first pollution \nprevention law and promoted the National Invasive Species Act to block \nthe proliferation\n\n[[Page S10239]]\n\nof biological pollution. The Coalition has protected the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, and achieved increased appropriations \nfor several energy efficiency programs. It held the first hearings and \ndeveloped legislation on brownfield redevelopments, as well as on \nleaking gasoline storage tanks. The Coalition advanced increased trade \nwith Canada, our nation's largest trading partner, and it spearheaded a \nrange of initiatives to enhance the region's and the nation's economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Mr. President, allow me to highlight a few other of Senator \nMoynihan's specific efforts to advance economic vitality and \nenvironmental quality in the Northeast-Midwest region. In recent days, \nfor instance, Senator Moynihan has helped lead the Coalition's efforts \nto prepare for this winter's pending fuel crisis. Noting the rise in \nprices for heating oil and natural gas, he argued effectively for an \nemergency allocation of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \nfunding. And he has been a consistent champion of Weatherization and \nenergy conservation programs that help our region and nation to use \nenergy more efficiently.\n  In order to block the introduction of invasive species in ballast \nwater, Senator Moynihan helped lead the charge for the National \nInvasive Species Act. He continues to work to expand that legislation \nbeyond aquatic nuisance species to address the array of foreign plants \nand animals that cause biological pollution and economic loss \nthroughout this country.\n  Senator Moynihan and the Northeast-Midwest groups have highlighted \nthe economic and environmental benefits of cleaning and redeveloping \nthe contaminated industrial sites that plague our communities. He has \nsponsored Capitol Hill conferences on brownfield reuse, and distributed \nscores of Northeast-Midwest publications, including case studies of \nsuccessful redevelopment projects. Senator Moynihan also has helped \npush several bills that would provide financial, regulatory, and \ntechnical assistance for brownfield reuse.\n  To help provide financing and technical assistance to manufacturers, \nwhich remain critical to our region's economy, Senator Moynihan and the \nNortheast-Midwest Coalitions have advanced the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership, trade adjustment assistance, and industrial technology \nprograms. He has sponsored an array of Capitol Hill briefings on \nrobotics, optoelectronics, machine tools, electronics, and other \nindustrial sectors.\n  In an effort to protect the Northeast and Midwest, Senator Moynihan \nhas been willing to face the criticism that comes from highlighting \negregious subsidies going to other regions. He has noted, for instance, \nthat taxpayers in the Northeast and Midwest subsidize the electricity \nbills of consumers in other regions, only to have those regions try to \nlure away our businesses and jobs with the promise of cheap \nelectricity.\n  Senator Moynihan has paid particular attention to the flow of federal \nfunds to the states, tracking both federal expenditures as well as \ntaxes paid to Washington. In his own annual reports and those by the \nCoalition, he documented the long-standing federal disinvestment in New \nYork State and throughout the Northeast and Midwest. The Northeast-\nMidwest groups, for instance, found that our region's taxpayers \nreceived only 88 cents in federal spending for every dollar in taxes \nthat they sent to the federal Treasury. In comparison, states of the \nSouth received a $1.17 rate of return, while western states obtained a \n$1.02 return. In fiscal 1998, the Northeast-Midwest region's subsidy to \nthe rest of the nation totaled some $76 billion. Senator Moynihan has \nled the effort to reverse this trend.\n  It has been a pleasure to work in a bipartisan coalition with Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan. He has demonstrated that good public policy \nresults from cooperation among Democrats and Republicans. His \nintellectual rigor and his demand for quality data have elevated policy \ndiscussions within both the Northeast-Midwest Coalition and throughout \nthe entire United States Senate.\n  My colleagues from northeastern and midwestern states join me in \nthanking Senator Moynihan for his consistent leadership and effective \nadvocacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10239-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10239-S10240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TIME TO STRENGTHEN HARDROCK MINING REGULATIONS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have strongly advocated strengthening \nso-called 3809 regulations, which governs hardrock mining on public \nlands. However, attempts to update these regulations have been subject \nto much debate.\n  I am pleased to see that the Interior conference report included a \ncompromise provision related to the regulations, which should allow the \nBLM to move forward with their efforts to better protect taxpayers and \nthe environment from the impacts of the hardrock mining industry.\n  However, I am concerned about recent statements made by my \ncolleagues, Senators Reid and Gorton, which I feel distort the intent \nof the provision and would weaken the 3809 regulations. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to clarify my understanding of the meaning of \nthis provision.\n  To paraphrase the language of the bill text included in the \nconference report, the mining provision permits the BLM to prevent \nundue degradation of public lands with a new and stronger rule \ngoverning hardrock mining on public lands. The only requirement is that \nthe rule be ``not inconsistent with'' the recommendations contained in \na study completed by the National Research Council, or NRC.\n  I agree with the Department of the Interior's interpretation that the \nkey phrase ``not inconsistent with'' means that so long as the final \nmining rule does not contradict the recommendations of the NRC report, \nthe rule can address whatever subject areas the BLM finds necessary to \nimprove environmental oversight of the hardrock mining industry.\n  For example, one of the recommendations made in the NRC report would \nclarify the BLM's authority to protect valuable natural resources not \nprotected by other laws. Given that recommendation, it would be ``not \ninconsistent with'' the report to issue a rule that would allow the \ndisapproval of a mine proposal if it would cause undue degradation of \npublic lands, even if the proposal complied with all other statutes and \nregulations. The final mining provision included in the report would \npermit such a rule.\n  However, during earlier negotiations of the hardrock mining \nprovision, mining proponents attempted to include language that would \nhave effectively undermined the ability of the BLM to strengthen the \n3809 regulations. This original language would have bound any final \nrule published by the BLM to the recommendations of the NRC report. \nThis means that a final rule could only address those recommendations \nmade by the report and nothing else, regardless of what actions the BLM \nidentified as necessary. The original language is as follows:\n\n\n                               bill text\n\n       None of the funds in this Act or any other Act shall be \n     used by the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate final \n     rules to revise 43 CFR subpart 3809, except that the \n     Secretary, following the public comment period required by \n     section 3002 of Public Law 106-31, may issue final rules to \n     amend 43 CFR Subpart 3809 which are not inconsistent with the \n     recommendations contained in the National Research Council \n     report entitled ``Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands'' so long \n     as these regulations are also not inconsistent with existing \n     statutory authorities. Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to expand the existing statutory authority of the \n     Secretary.\n\n\n                            report language\n\n       Section xxx allows the Bureau of Land Management to \n     promulgate new hardrock mining regulations that are not \n     inconsistent with the National Research Council Report \n     entitled ``Hardrock Mining on Federal Lands.'' This provision \n     reinstates a requirement that was included in Public Law 106-\n     113. In that Act, Congress authorized changes to the hardrock \n     mining regulations that are ``not inconsistent with'' the \n     Report. The statutory requirement was based on a consensus \n     reached among Committee Members and the Administration. On \n     December 8, 1999, the Interior Solicitor wrote an opinion \n     concluding that this requirement applies only to a few lines \n     of the Report, and that it imposes no significant \n     restrictions on the Bureau's final rulemaking authority. This \n     opinion is contrary to the intentions of the Committee and to \n     the understanding reached among the parties in FY2000. The \n     Committee clearly intended Interior to be guided and bound by \n     the findings and recommendations of the Report. Accordingly, \n     the statutory language is included again in this Report and \n     this action\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\n     should not be interpreted as a ratification of the \n     Solicitor's opinion. The Committee emphasizes that it intends \n     for the Bureau to adopt changes to its rules at 43 CFR part \n     3809 only if those changes are called for in the NRC report.\n\n  Fortunately, this original language did not stand because it was so \nlimiting. In fact, President Clinton threatened to veto the entire \nInterior Appropriations bill if the mining provision unduly restricted \nthe ability of the BLM to update the regulations. The improved, final \nlanguage indicates that the intent is not to limit the BLM's authority \nto strengthen the hardrock mining regulations.\n  The Interior Department has been working for years to update the 3809 \nregulations after numerous review and comments from BLM task forces, \ncongressional committee hearings, public meetings, consultation with \nthe states and interest groups, and public review of drafts of the \nproposed regulations. There is no longer any reason to delay improving \nthese regulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10240-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TERRORISM ACT\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, as we adopt this valuable legislation, \nI consider it important to clarify the history and intent of subsection \n1(f) of this bill, as amended, in the context of the bill as a whole.\n  This is a key issue for American victims of state-sponsored terrorism \nwho have sued or who will in the future sue the responsible terrorism-\nlist state, as they are entitled to do under the Anti-Terrorism Act of \n1996. Victims who already hold U.S. court judgments, and a few whose \nrelated cases will soon be decided, will receive their compensatory \ndamages as a direct result of this legislation. It is my hope and \nobjective that this legislation will similarly help other pending and \nfuture Anti-Terrorism Act plaintiffs when U.S. courts issue judgments \nagainst the foreign state sponsors of specific terrorist acts. I am \nparticularly determined that the families of the victims of Pan Am \nflight 103 should be able to collect damages promptly if they can \ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of a U.S. court that Libya is indeed \nresponsible for that heinous bombing.\n  More than 2 years ago, I joined with Senator Connie Mack to amend the \nfiscal year 1999 Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to help victims of \nterrorism who successfully sued foreign states under the Anti-Terrorism \nAct. That amendment, which became section 117 of the Treasury and \nGeneral Government Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999, made the \nassets of foreign terrorist states blocked by the Treasury Department \nunder our sanctions laws explicitly available for attachment by U.S. \ncourts for the very limited purpose of satisfying Anti-Terrorism Act \njudgments.\n  Unfortunately, when that provision came before the House-Senate \nConference Committee, I understand the administration insisted upon \nadding a national security interest waiver. The waiver, however, was \nunclear and confusing. The President exercised that waiver within \nminutes of signing the bill into law.\n  The scope of that waiver authority added in the Appropriations \nConference Committee in 1998 remains in dispute. Presidential \nDetermination 99-1 asserted broad authority to waive the entirety of \nthe provision. But the District Court of the Southern District of \nFlorida rejected the administration's view and held, instead, that the \nPresident's authority applied only to section 117's requirement that \nthe Secretaries of State and Treasury assist a judgment creditor in \nidentifying, locating, and executing against non-blocked property of a \nforeign terrorist state.\n  The bill now before us, in its amended form, would replace the \ndisputed waiver in section 117 of the fiscal year 1999 Treasury \nAppropriations Act with a clearer but narrower waiver of 28 U.S.C. \nsection 1610(f)(1). In replacing the waiver, we are accepting that the \nPresident should have the authority to waive the court's authority to \nattach blocked assets. But to understand how we intend this waiver to \nbe used, it must be read within the context of other provisions of the \nlegislation.\n  A waiver of the attachment provision would seem appropriate for final \nand pending Anti-Terrorism Act cases identified in subsection (a)(2) of \nthis bill. In these cases, judicial attachment is not necessary because \nthe executive branch will appropriately pay compensatory damages to the \nvictims from blocked assets or use blocked assets to collect the funds \nfrom terrorist states.\n  This legislation also reaffirms the President's statutory authority \nto vest foreign assets located in the United States for the purposes of \nassisting and making payments to victims of terrorism. This provision \nrestates the President's authority to assist victims with pending and \nfuture cases. Our intent is that the President will review each case \nwhen the court issues a final judgment to determine whether to use the \nnational security waiver, whether to help the plaintiffs collect from a \nforeign state's non-blocked assets in the U.S., whether to allow the \ncourts to attach and execute against blocked assets, or whether to use \nexisting authorities to vest and pay those assets as damages to the \nvictims of terrorism.\n\n  Let me say that again: It is our intention that the President will \nconsider each case on its own merits; this waiver should not be applied \nin a routine or blanket manner.\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\n  I hope future Presidents will use the waiver provision only as \nPresident Clinton will use other provisions of the current bill: to aid \nvictims of terrorism and make its state sponsors pay for their crimes.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank Senator Lautenberg for making a point with which I \nstrongly agree: the waiver authority in this legislation is intended to \nbe used on each case or for each asset, but not to be used as a de-\nfacto veto.\n  In drafting this language and negotiating with the administration \nover the past several months, we believe firmly that using blocked \nassets of terrorist states to satisfy judgments is completely \nconsistent with the intent of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996, and more \nsignificantly, is consistent with our national security interest. \nSimply stated, making the terrorists who harm or kill Americans in acts \nof international terrorism pay for their acts makes for good policy. It \nshould deter future acts of terrorism, as well as provide some small \nmeasure of justice to current victims.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senators Mack and Lautenberg for their leadership on \nthis issue. I would like to add that from the beginning of my \ninvolvement on this issue in 1998, I have sought to help Senator Mack \nprovide a mechanism which would not only help current victims, but also \nset in place a procedure to ensure future victims will be able to \nattain justice, provided blocked assets are held in the U.S. I would \ntherefore first like to associate myself with the interpretation of the \nwaiver as expressed by Senators Lautenberg and Mack. I do not \nappreciate seeing laws in effect vetoed through a waiver authority \ninterpreted overly broadly. Indeed, the waiver used in this language \nshould be exercised on a case-by-case basis only.\n  Second, I would also like to point out the precedent being set and \nthe reaffirmation of authority. The administration assures us via a \nprivate letter that the judgment creditors already holding final \njudgment will be paid their compensatory awards within 60 days of the \nenactment of this act. The administration will do so using executive \nauthority to vest and pay from blocked assets. In addition, the \nCongress statutorily reaffirms the President's authority to vest and \npay from blocked assets in the future to help future victims of \nterrorism. Let me state very clearly that there is no way, based upon \nthe procedure now in place, that future victims will be forced to \nsuffer the prolonged battle with their government that these first \nvictims were forced to bear. I am pleased with the justice being \ndelivered today; but I am especially pleased by the process in place to \nhelp any future victims. Hopefully, with this process, the deterrent \ncapability of this law will become more powerful.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am pleased have worked with Senators Lautenberg, \nMack, and Kyl in getting this legislation to this point. The national \nsecurity interest waiver should be used only when there is a specific \nnational security interest greater than the interest in taking \neffective action to combat terrorism against American citizens; and it \nshould be exercised on a case-by-case basis. The judiciary Committee \nnever intended to divide victims, helping some and not others. We must \nensure that all American victims of terrorism able to successfully hold \nforeign states responsible to the satisfaction of U.S. courts are \ntreated fairly and aided by this and future administrations to collect \ntheir damages.\n  Mr. HELMS. I congratulate Senators Mack, Kyl, Lautenberg, and \nFeinstein, for their fine work on getting this anti-terrorism \nlegislation through the Congress and passed.

CHAFEE. Mr. President, when the Senate passed the Water \nResources Development Act of 2000 (WRDA) on September 25th, a landmark \npiece of legislation was attached to the bill. This legislation--S. \n2797, Restoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act--was introduced \nby Senators Smith, Baucus, Voinovich, Graham and Mack earlier this \nsummer to restore the natural ecosystem of the Florida Everglades.\n  Historically, the Florida Everglades system consisted of a natural \nflow of 1.7 billion gallons of fresh water draining into the Gulf of \nMexico and the Atlantic Ocean on a daily basis. Beginning in 1948, the \nsystem has been adversely impacted by a series of Federal flood control \nprojects authorized by Congress to redirect water flows throughout the \nEverglades. Over a half-century of Army Corps of Engineers' water \ninfrastructure projects, consisting of a series of levees and canals, \nhave severely damaged the Everglades system. This substantial diversion \nof water resulting from the infrastructure construction, coupled with \nincreased development in the area, threaten the overall environmental \nhealth and sustainability of the Everglades National Park. In 1992 and \n1996, Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a \n``Restudy'' of the existing system and recommend changes to improve the \ncurrent state of the Everglades. The results of the restudy and \nrecommendations for restoring the system are incorporated into the \n``Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan''.\n  S. 2797 implements the Everglades Restoration Plan. The bill was \napproved by a bi-partisan majority of members of the Senate Committee \non Environment and Public Works and is strongly supported by the \nAdministration and the State of Florida. Restoring the Everglades, an \nAmerican Legacy Act is a $7.8 billion dollar package that includes a \nbroad framework for repairing the system's fragile ecosystem. \nAdditionally, the bill creates a new and significant partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and the State of Florida. S. 2797 \nincludes cost share provisions establishing a 50:50 Federal to non-\nFederal cost share requirement and providing that operation and \nmaintenance costs will also be split in half between the Federal and \nnon-Federal sponsors. Most importantly, the bill balances the benefits \nto the natural system, while providing for water supply and flood \nprotection needs.\n  I thank the Committee for moving forward with this important \nlegislation. I would particularly like to thank Chairman Bob Smith for \nhis leadership on restoring the Everglades and for crafting legislation \nthat will ensure the future preservation of this national treasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10241-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10241-S10242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COUNTY PAYMENTS BILL, H.R. 2389\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on Friday the Senate passed H.R. 2389, the \n``Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 1999.'' \nI have paid close attention to the bill because it has significant \nimplications for the State of California. H.R. 2389 is important to my \nState because it provides substantial and desperately-needed revenue to \nrural counties to be used for schools, roads, and other beneficial \npurposes. The bill also, however, creates unprecedented opportunities \nfor\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\nlocal stakeholders to play a role in decision-making on Federal lands. \nIt is this latter feature of the bill that has the potential to have a \nnegative impact on the health of our forests.\n  I am deeply disappointed at the version of the bill that was just \npassed. For months I worked closely with my Senate colleagues to \nnegotiate a compromise proposal that included safeguards to help ensure \nthat the bill would not lead to increased exploitation of our federal \ntimber resources. This earlier version of the bill (S. 1608), which \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent, benefitted greatly from changes \nthat clarified the appropriate role of local communities in Federal \nland management decisions and directed local projects funded under this \nbill towards environmentally beneficial activities rather than \ncommodity production. Unfortunately, many improvements that I fought \nfor in the Senate-passed bill have either been discarded or weakened in \nH.R. 2389.\n  I pledge to monitor closely implementation of this Act to see if it \nresults in local projects that involve unsustainable logging, salvage, \nand other types of environmentally damaging activities. I hope this \ndoes not materialize, but if it does, I will seek to make improvements \nto the Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10242-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEATH OF E.S. JOHNNY WALKER\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to advise Members of the Senate \nthat New Mexico lost a very distinguished citizen and a good friend \nwith the death of E.S. Johnny Walker on Sunday at the age of 89. His \nlife of public service began with 4 years in the Army in World War II. \nSubsequently, it included two terms in our State legislature in the \nHouse of Representatives in Santa Fe, followed by service as \ncommissioner of our public lands in New Mexico and commissioner of the \nbureau of revenue. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nin 1964 and served two terms here in Washington representing New Mexico \nin the House of Representatives.\n  Johnny is survived by his wife Polly, to whom he was married for 63 \nyears; also by their two children, Mike Walker and Janet Walker Steele; \nalso by grandchildren and great-grandchildren, colleagues, and, of \ncourse, many friends. I am proud to say that his friends included my \nfamily and, of course, me. We have known the Walkers for decades.\n  I fondly recall his friendship with my parents and with my uncle, \nJohn Bingaman, during the time when I was growing up in Silver City. He \nwas a ``man of the people'' in the very best sense of that phrase. He \nworked very hard for the interest of the people of New Mexico, and he \nwill be remembered warmly in our State for his humanity and for his \ngreat service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10242-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10242-S10243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RURAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views toward \nFederal implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and my \nsupport for a strong national rural telecommunications policy.\n  One of the most important responsibilities of a United States Senator \nis to exercise appropriate oversight of Federal regulatory agencies to \nensure sound policy and the wisest use of taxpayers dollars. Toward \nthis end, I have carefully monitored the Federal Communications \nCommission's implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in an \nattempt to ensure that this agency follows the intent of Congress in \ndeveloping a strong national rural telecommunications policy.\n  I am proud to have supported the historic 1996 Telecommunications Act \nwhich deregulated the telecommunications industry for the first time in \n62 years. I believe this Act has begun to reach its promise of a \ncompetitive marketplace, lower prices, and greater consumer choice in \nservices for every American. Since its passage, the telecommunications \nindustry has grown dramatically, creating 230,000 more jobs nationwide, \ngenerating an additional $57 billion in revenues, and fostering an \nenvironment in which billions of dollars has been invested in \ntelecommunications infrastructure. Despite this promising news, I am \nvery concerned that the FCC's implementation of the Act has stifled the \nexpansion of some of these benefits into rural parts of Minnesota.\n  As a former small businessman, I often hear about the regulatory \nburdens experienced by my state's entrepreneurs and businesses. As \nsomeone who spent 23 years in the broadcasting industry, I also \nunderstand their frustration with the far-reaching regulatory authority \nof the Federal Communications Commission. It has become very clear to \nme that the administrative and regulatory burdens imposed upon small \ntelecommunications providers reflect the Commission's neglect for the \nunique needs of rural telecommunications companies and their need for \nfairer regulatory treatment.\n  The concerns of rural telecommunications companies are underscored in \na letter sent to me by Farmers Mutual Telephone Company General Manager \nRobert Hoffman, who wrote, ``My concern with the FCC is all the \nadditional filings and requirements they are placing on small telephone \ncompanies. A couple of years ago we didn't have any filings with the \nFCC. Now we have about ten annual filings which are confusing and labor \nintensive, and thus expensive for companies of our size. The FCC has no \nsympathy for small rural telecommunications companies.''\n  As my colleagues know, this de-regulatory law has been the subject of \nlitigation from the moment it was enacted due to what many perceive to \nbe the FCC's over-regulatory approach to its implementation. Far too \noften, the Commission's rules have gone beyond Congressional intent. In \nparticular, I am disappointed by the Commission's implementation of \nsections of the Act which are intended to preserve universal service \nassistance and the deployment of advanced telecommunications services. \nI am sure that my colleagues would agree that universal service \nassistance is the cornerstone of an effective rural telecommunications \npolicy.\n  In implementing the 1996 Act, the Commission has thus far failed to \nadhere to the important universal service principles established by \nCongress under this law. The Act specifically required the joint board \non universal service and the FCC to base their universal service \npolicies upon the following principles: the ability of quality services \nto be provided at just, reasonable and affordable rates; that all \nregions of the country should have access to advanced \ntelecommunications services; that telecommunications services should be \ncomparable to services in urban areas; and that universal service \nshould be supported by specific and predictable funding mechanisms. \nCongress should clearly do more to hold the Commission's feet to the \nfire to ensure that there is proper implementation of universal service \nsupport.\n  I have worked hard in Congress to ensure that the decades-long policy \nof universal service is preserved and advanced and that there are \nadequate revenues to maintain rural networks. Earlier this Congress, I \nwrote to FCC Chairman Kennard to express my opposition to any proposal \nwhich would transfer authority over the Universal Service Fund to the \nDepartment of Treasury. I believe that such an approach would undermine \nuniversal service policy and could have an adverse impact upon small \ntelephone carriers and the communities they serve. More importantly, \nthis plan would place the Universal Service Fund at great risk of \nmanipulation by the federal government and the excessive spending \nhabits of Members of Congress. I am pleased that the Administration has \nfinally agreed that is not ``public money'' and has withdrawn this ill-\nadvised plan.\n  I also believe that the Rural Utilities Service telephone loan \nprogram is vital to the development of a strong rural \ntelecommunications infrastructure, and an essential component of our \nnational commitment to universal service. I have repeatedly written the \nSenate Appropriations Committee to urge funding for the Rural Utilities \nService telephone loan program. I firmly believe that RUS telephone \nloans have helped to improve telephone service in rural and high cost \nareas. Through RUS financing, telephone borrowers have made significant \nimprovements to telecommunications services throughout rural Minnesota.\n  My oversight of the FCC has also included efforts to make it easier \nfor\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\nrural telecommunications carriers to meet the requirements of the \nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA. In meeting \nwith small telephone carriers from Minnesota earlier this year, I \nlearned about the difficulty many carriers face in meeting the June 30, \n2000 CALEA compliance date. I agree that the FCC should grant a blanket \nextension of the compliance date so that rural carriers will not face a \n$10,000 penalty for each day that they were not in compliance with \nCALEA.\n  For these reasons, I was pleased to join this past April with twenty-\nfive of my Senate colleagues in a writing the Commission to urge that \nit extend the June 30, 2000 CALEA compliance date for software upgrades \nby small carriers by one year. I regret that the Commission has a \ndifferent interpretation of the needs of rural carriers in meeting this \ncompliance date. I expect that the Commission's new process by which \nindividual carriers could petition for and receive extensions to comply \nwith CALEA has been time consuming and burdensome for small telephone \ncarriers. I would be supportive of legislative action to address \nproblems with CALEA compliance.\n  During this Congress, I have also worked with the Minnesota \nAssociation for Rural Telecommunications and the Minnesota Telephone \nAssociation to encourage local phone competition in Minnesota by urging \nthe Commission to address the petition filed by the State of Minnesota \nin 1997 on whether its ``Connecting Minnesota'' proposal between the \nstate and a private company was consistent with the rights-of-way \ncriteria established through Section 253 of the Act. Not surprisingly, \nit took the Commission nearly two years to analyze and rule upon the \nState of Minnesota petition. Rural consumers may witness additional \nentrants into local television markets following the Federal \nCommunications Commission's decision to deny the petition.\n  Bringing technology to rural areas has always been a top priority for \nme. As a member of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I have supported \npolicies to address the growing concern in Minnesota about the \n``digital divide'' and access to the Internet. High-speed Internet \naccess is a key to improved economic development in rural communities \nand important to Minnesota's farmers, schools, small businesses, and \nhospitals. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the Commission's \ninterpretation of section 706 of the Act which requires the agency to \nencourage the deployment of high-speed Internet access and other \nadvanced communications services to rural Minnesota. In my view, \ninaction by the FCC in removing barriers to the deployment of advanced \ntelecommunications services can be overcome through the enactment of \nincremental proposals that complement marketplace solutions.\n  More specifically, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the ``Universal \nService Support Act'' introduced by Senator Conrad Burns and endorsed \nby the National Telephone Cooperative Association. This legislation \nwill lift the regulatory caps imposed upon the Universal Service Fund \nthat limit the amount of support that can be directed to rural \ntelephone companies that serve high-cost areas of our state. These \nregulatory caps are inconsistent with the de-regulatory framework \nestablished by the 1996 Act and an unnecessary barrier to allowing \nfurther the further deployment of advanced telecommunications services \nin rural communities.\n  I believe that we can also prevent rural communities from becoming \ntechnology ``have nots'' through repeal of the federal telephone excise \ntax. The 3 percent telephone excise tax was first established to fund \nthe Spanish-American War of 1898 but has since become an obstacle to \ncommunity investment in technology. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nlegislation to repeal this ``Tax on Talking'' and save taxpayers \nbillions annually.\n  There is no single solution to closing the digital divide and I also \nsupport S. 2572, the ``Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmission for \nNetworks, E-commerce and Telecommunications Act,'' also known as the \n``FASTNET Act.'' This legislation will relieve mid-size telephone \ncompanies of excessive reporting requirements that are a barrier to \nadditional company investment in Internet services that would serve \nrural communities. This legislation was passed unanimously by the House \nof Representatives and I hope that it will be considered by the Senate \nsoon. Congress should also consider proposals that will authorize the \nRural Utilities Service to provide low-interest loans to companies that \nare deploying broadband technology, as well as legislation that will \nanalyze the feasibility of allowing low power television stations to \nprovide data services to rural areas.\n  As we embark on the 21st Century, it is vital that Minnesota's high-\ntech businesses serving rural areas are not left behind in our new e-\ncommerce economy. During this session of Congress, I was an early and \nstrong supporter of the enactment of ``E-SIGN,'' electronic signature \nlegislation that will facilitate the growth of electronic commerce into \nrural Minnesota. This new law grants legal effect to electronic online \nelectronic signatures that will enhance the ability of rural companies \nto complete business transactions and compete in our emerging digital \neconomy. Rather than spend precious time and resources completing paper \ntransactions, the E-SIGN Act will also allow consumers to pay bills, \ntrade securities, and shop online for a home mortgage and complete the \ndeal by striking a few keys on their computer.\n  Finally, I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on the Senate \nBanking Committee to pass the ``Launching Our Communities Access to \nLocal Television Act of 2000.'' The LOCAL TV Act would establish a \n$1.25 billion loan guarantee program to facilitate access to local \ntelevision programming in rural Minnesota communities. I am very \npleased that the Senate unanimously passed my amendment that will \nensure that the National Cooperative Finance Cooperation is considered \nan eligible lender under the proposed loan guarantee program. The CFC \nis among several private sector lenders which have substantial \nexperience providing multi-million loans in a cooperative environment \nand which have a track record of projects of this size in rural areas. \nI am confident that this legislation will be signed into law later this \nmonth.\n  I am proud to have worked with consumers and Minnesota's rural \ntelecommunications companies on these issues and other initiatives that \nwill help our state and country to develop a strong rural \ntelecommunications policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10243-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10243-S10244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE YUGOSLAVIAN ELECTIONS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, ten years ago this October, a wall came \ndown in Eastern Europe which marked a renaissance for democracy in that \nregion of the world. I believe we all remember the dramatic pictures \nfrom Berlin, with crowds in celebration, and Beethoven's ``Ode to Joy'' \nbooming in the background. On the 10th Anniversary of that celebration, \nI believe we have seen that promise of democracy spread to one of the \nlast tyrannies in Europe. Last Thursday, we bore witness to similarly \ndramatic images of the Serbian people united in the cause of freedom.\n  Earlier in the week, I think we all realized something dramatic had \nhappened in Serbia. I joined with my friend and colleague, the junior \nSenator from Ohio to introduce a resolution commending the People of \nYugoslavia for the brave step they took in their elections. It showed \nthe kind of courage that a people must demonstrate if they are truly \ndetermined to establish the rule of law and the rule of the people.\n  We woke up to the wonderful news that the whole world acknowledges \nthe new Yugoslav President, Vojislav Kostunica. As in the Phillipines, \nIndonesia, Romania and even our nation, the will of an aroused people, \ndetermined to secure their freedom, proved irresistible. We will not \nsoon forget the sight of ordinary men and women storming the Yugoslav \nparliament--the people's house--to restore that symbol of democracy to \nits rightful owners.\n  While we congratulate and appreciate these dramatic developments in \nSerbia, it is important to reflect a little on our own democracy. This \nPresidential election marks the 54th time in our nation's history that \nexecutive power will change hands peacefully, and according\n\n[[Page S10244]]\n\nto the will of the people. In many respects, the amazing success of our \nindustry, our science and even our military might all rests on this \nsimple fact. Without a foundation of freedom, Americans could never \nhave achieved the boundless success we have known. We owe a great debt \nto men and women who founded our nation for their foresight and their \nsacrifice.\n  The Balkans are a land of tragic history. It provided the spark for \nthe First World War, and has been in turmoil ever since. I am reminded \nthat on the eve of the start of World War I, the British Foreign \nMinister looked out his window upon a worker putting out the street \nlights, and remarked:\n\n       The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see \n     them lit again in our lifetime.\n\n  For the first time in a very long time, the lamps of European freedom \nare lit across the entire continent. It is a vindication of the \nsacrifice of two generations of Americans who risked their lives in \nwar. It is a vindication of this nation's principles, and most of all, \nit is a vindication of the aspirations of the Yugoslavian people. I \nhope that this body, when we return next year, will act quickly and \ngenerously to welcome Serbia back to the community of nations. I also \nhope that we will take all necessary steps to secure a lasting peace in \nthe Balkans. I believe it is important that we place a particular focus \non the children of this region. Like so many other conflicts, the \nwounds of the Balkans will take time to heal. Our best hope for that \nhealing comes from the children. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues so that our best hopes might be realized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10244-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY'S POSITION ON THE PAIN RELIEF PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on October 4, 2000, I did not correctly \nstate the American Cancer Society's position on S. 1272, when I stated \nthat they ``. . . strongly opposed . . . the Pain Relief Promotion \nAct.'' Their actual position, taken directly from their recent \nstatement on the legislation, is as follows:\n\n       . . . The American Cancer Society appreciates the \n     commitment shown by the sponsors of the legislation to \n     address these issues, but unfortunately is unable to support \n     this legislation as written . . . Careful analysis of the \n     House-passed measure and a substitute version of the Senate \n     bill . . . have serious potential to exacerbate the current \n     problem of under treatment of pain. While there are \n     provisions to proactively address pain and symptom \n     management, the Society maintains that any benefit from such \n     provisions would not outweigh the potential threat posed by \n     the changes to CSA. Furthermore, neither section of the bill \n     comprehensively addresses the needs of providers, patients, \n     and families for ongoing support and education to counter the \n     current problem of under-treatment of pain--a problem that \n     often leads to requests for physician-assisted suicide . . . \n     Under the Act, all physicians and particularly physicians who \n     care for those with terminal illnesses will be made \n     especially vulnerable to having their pain and symptom \n     management treatment decisions questioned by law enforcement \n     officials not qualified to judge medical decision-making. \n     This can result in unnecessary investigation, and further \n     disincentives to aggressively treat pain.\n       Unfortunately, `intent' cannot be easily determined, \n     particularly in the area of medicine where effective dosage \n     levels for patients may deviate significantly from the norm. \n     The question of deciding intent should remain in the hands of \n     those properly trained to make such decisions--the medical \n     community and state medical boards. The Pain Relief Promotion \n     Act seeks to hold harmless any physician who treats a \n     patient's pain even if death occurs, and the measure attempts \n     to create a `safe harbor' provision in an effort to shield \n     physicians whose use of federally-controlled drugs \n     unintentionally hasten or cause death. However, this \n     provision does not change the fact that the DEA would now \n     explicitly be charged with overseeing the medical use of \n     controlled substances, resulting in a negative impact on \n     cancer pain treatment. . .\n\n  The American Cancer Society statement concluded with the following \nobservation:\n\n       The American Cancer Society has engaged in a deliberative \n     process to evaluate the impact of the Pain Relief Promotion \n     Act on our Quality of Life goals for all people living with \n     cancer. Its analysis included a review of existing Society \n     policies on pain and symptom management and opposition to \n     physician assisted suicide. We have concluded that as \n     written, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would ban the use of \n     federally controlled substances for physician-assisted \n     suicide at the expense of controlling pain and advancing \n     symptom management. These issues are both critically \n     important, but are separate issues. While the Society \n     strongly opposes all patient deaths stemming from assisted \n     suicides, we must give heavier weight to the more than 1500 \n     individuals who die of cancer every day in this country--more \n     than half of whom die in pain unnecessarily. Moreover, the \n     American Cancer Society believes that the best approach to \n     help cancer patients and reduce and prevent assisted suicide \n     is through the adoption of proactive policies and the \n     provision of resources to prevent and ameliorate pain and \n     suffering in people with cancer, especially for those at the \n     end-of-life.\n\n  I appreciate this opportunity to clarify the position of the American \nCancer Society on S. 1272.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10244-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE WILDLIFE AND SPORT FISH RESTORATION PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                 2000.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Their original bill passed the House with \ntremendous bi-partisan approval, garnering just two ``no'' votes.\n  Senator Crapo and I took the House bill and strengthened it by \nproviding a sensible level for grants for projects that affect more \nthan one state and strengthening the provision to ensure states use a \nreasonable portion of the Pittman-Robertson money to provide hunter \neducation programs. It was introduced as S. 2609 and garnered 14 \ncosponsors.\n  Senators Smith, Crapo, Baucus, and Boxer worked hard on Senate \nlegislation that everyone can agree on. I appreciate their dedication \nto that work, and we have produced an excellent product that will bring \naccountability to a program that represents one-third of the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service's budget, ensure the hunting and fishing community \nthat the money they pay in excise taxes is being used for its intended \npurpose, and that the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson programs \nwill continue to be this nation's premier wildlife and fisheries \nconservation programs.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this substitute, and I \nencourage the President of the United States to sign this important \npiece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10244-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10244-S10245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            KANSAN OLYMPIANS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nathletes from Kansas who participated in the 2000 Olympic Games in \nSydney, Australia. Each of these athletes contributed in his or her own \nway to the success of the American Team. It is my pleasure to recognize \nthe following athletes from Kansas for their efforts in the Olympic \nGames: Maurice Greene, Nathan Leeper, Passion Richardson, Christie \nAmbrosi, Sarah Noriega, Tara Nott, and Melvin Douglas.\n  Each of these athletes deserves to be commended on their perseverance \nand dedication to their respective sports. The devotion of these \nathletes has been rewarded with the opportunity to represent the United \nStates as Olympic Athletes. Not only have these athletes represented \nAmerica, but they have also made the citizens of their home State of \nKansas proud.\n  The spirit of these athletes is encouraging and is to be applauded. \nAmerica's team could not have finished on top without the help of these \nspecial Kansans. Every four years the world comes together in this \nultimate show of athleticism. These Kansan athletes will be forever a \npart of this honorable tradition. It gives me great pleasure to \nrecognize the accomplishments of these athletes.\n  Maurice Greene maintained his role as the fastest man on Earth by \nwinning the Men's 100 meter race. He also helped the 4x100 relay team \nrun their way to another gold medal for the American Team.\n  Nathan Leeper rose to high aspirations in the high jump competition. \nAfter leaving the sport for a short time, Nathan made the ultimate \ncomeback as a member of this Olympic Team.\n\n[[Page S10245]]\n\n  Passion Richardson helped the women's 4x100m Relay team run their way \nout of the rounds into the finals. this competition was Passion's \nOlympic debut and her participation in this event is the epitome of \nteamwork and dedication.\n  Christie Ambrosi helped the women's softball team grab the gold medal \nfor America. Her hard work as an outfielder and strong hitting skills \nbrought the team home with gold medals along with their gloves.\n  As a member of the Women's volleyball team, Sarah Noriega rose beyond \nthe expectations. Sarah helped launch the team into the medal round, \nproving that the team has a great future ahead.\n  Tara Nott made Olympic history as the first woman to go home with \ngold from a Women's Olympic Weightlifting competition. Christie had no \nproblem carrying her gold medal home to Kansas.\n  Melvin Douglas is no stranger to the Olympic games, as the Sydney \ncompetition as his second Olympic appearance. His perseverance in the \nsport has proven that great athletes can come at any age.\n  Again, Mr. President, I congratulate these Kansas Athletes on their \noutstanding accomplishments.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues a pair of statements I recently received from an exceptional \nyoung man in Colorado, Mr. Evan Todd of Littleton. Evan was one of the \nmany unfortunate victims of the horrific shooting that took place at \nColumbine High School on April 20, 1999. Evan was the first student \nshot in the library at Columbine High School, and despite his injuries \nhe assisted other students and administered first aid to a seriously \nwounded peer until emergency services could arrive. Evan, an active Boy \nScout, was awarded the prestigious Boy Scouts of America Honor Medal \nfor his inspiring actions. Still a Columbine student, Evan has \ndedicated a tremendous amount of time to speaking to other students and \nadults around the nation concerning the problems of youth violence and \nthe cultural influences on American youth. I am honored that Evan took \nthe time to write to me and I ask that a copy of Evan Todd's letter to \nhis fellow Scouts and a copy of a speech he delivered at ``The \nGathering,'' a meeting of victims of school violence, be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                                    Littleton, CO.\n       Dear Fellow Scouts: I have been told that into each life \n     some rain must fall. Some get rained on more than others. The \n     rain that came down on us at Columbine High School was a \n     cloudburst of epic proportions. This act was senseless, \n     tragic and without justification, whatsoever. 13 murdered 25 \n     wounded and 1,951 students youth destroyed. As a student who \n     was shot and wounded in the library, it has changed my life, \n     forever.\n       I believe that the children of a society are nothing more \n     than the reflection of the society that they are brought \n     into. The event here at Columbine in Littleton Colorado, and \n     the events at Moses Lake Washington, Pearl Mississippi, \n     Jonesboro Arkansas, Edinboro Pennsylvania, Fayetteville \n     Tennessee, Springfield Oregon, Richmond Virginia, Conyers \n     Georgia, Los Angeles California and elsewhere indicate to me \n     that our nation has a serious character flaw. Since the \n     Columbine tragedy, I have tried to stay abreast of the \n     ``adult society'' debate as to the ``why'' and ``how'' of \n     these terrible incidents. The adults debate and argue over \n     what constitutes good and what constitutes evil; what is \n     right and what is wrong. At the time of the Columbine \n     tragedy, our national leader, the President, stated the youth \n     of this nation need to learn to resolve our differences with \n     words, not weapons. At the time this statement was made, we \n     as a nation, were bombing Yugoslavia. They tell us that the \n     youth of this nation need to be more tolerant, kinder, \n     gentler, more understanding. Yet our entertainment, music, \n     TV, movies, games (and actions of) the adult world provides \n     for our consumption are all too often filled with violence, \n     sex, death and destruction. If we were to take into our lives \n     what is provided to us by our society, our actions would also \n     violate the Scout Oath & Law. Other solutions to school \n     violence have been nametags to be carried around our neck as \n     millstones, metal detectors, increased video surveillance, \n     etc. Our nation has always had guns. Our nation has always \n     had children. What our nation hasn't always had is children \n     murdering children and their parents, and parents murdering \n     their children. The ingregient that has made America \n     different is the last couple of `adult generations', and \n     their changes towards what is right & wrong, good & evil. It \n     appears to me that our society is confused. The adult world \n     seems as a ship with no rudder being cast around by the wind \n     and storms of our times, with no control or understanding as \n     to why. Many of these storms appear to have been caused by \n     their own accord. It's as if our adult society has no \n     compass, no bearing, no standards for our society. I have \n     found them confused. Even at our age, we can discern the \n     difference between what you say and what you do . . .\n       In regard to the solution of watching what comes out of us \n     by monitoring closely our world with surveillance cameras, \n     what we say, how we look, etc., our society needs to watch \n     carefully what goes into us. In my room is a picture of the \n     Grand Teton mountain range in Wyoming. Below the picture is \n     the following:\n\n                         The Essence Of Destiny\n\n       ``Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Choose your \n     words, for they become actions. Understand your actions, for \n     they become habits. Study your habits, for they will become \n     your character. Develop your character, for it becomes your \n     destiny.''\n       The good news for those of us that are Scouts is that we \n     are privileged to be a part of an organization that provides \n     us the tools and instructions to put into us that which \n     builds a better person, a better nation. Those tools are \n     called the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Robert Gates, former \n     Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and \n     our current President of the National Eagle Scout Association \n     (NESA) recently stated that there is a war going on for the \n     souls of our boys and young men in this nation. He sees \n     clearly. If you are to be a scout, don't be a scout in word \n     only. Learn and practice the Oath & Law in everything you \n     think, say and do. I understand well how hard that can be, \n     but ``Do Your Best.'' To the Boy Scouts of America, thank you \n     for defending our 90-year record and not allowing the Oath & \n     Law to be redefined. As you say, it has stood the test of \n     time. The generation that wants to change the Oath & Law has \n     not stood the test of time. To all the scouts across America \n     that sent me & my troop cards, letters, posters, your \n     thoughts and prayers, thank you from the bottom of my heart. \n     To you here tonight, I bid you vaya con Dios mi amigos, God \n     Bless you and God Bless the work you do.\n           Thank You.\n                                                        Evan Todd,\n\n     Eagle Scout Troop 989.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Remarks by Evan Todd at ``The Gathering''\n\n       I have been told that into each life some rain must fall. \n     Some get rained on more than others. The rain that came down \n     on us at Columbine and at Moses Lake Washington, Pearl \n     Mississippi, Jonesboro Arkansas, Edinboro Pennsylvania, \n     Fayetteville Tennessee, Springfield Oregon, Richmond \n     Virginia, Conyers Georgia, Los Angeles California and \n     elsewhere were cloudbursts of epic proportions. All of these \n     acts were senseless, tragic and without justification, \n     whatsoever. As a student who was shot and wounded in the \n     library at Columbine, who was literally trapped while 10 of \n     my classmates were murdered, 4 of them my friends and 16 more \n     of us were wounded, crippled, disfigured and paralyzed, it \n     has changed my life, forever.\n       I believe that the children of a society are nothing more \n     than the reflection of the society that they are brought \n     into. These events indicate to me that America has a serious\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\n     character flaw. Since the Columbine tragedy, I have tried to \n     stay abreast of the ``adult society'' debate as to the \n     ``why'' of these terrible incidents. The adults debate and \n     argue over what constitutes good, . . . and what constitutes \n     evil; what is right and what is wrong. Our nation has always \n     had guns. Our nation has always had children. I believe what \n     our nation hasn't had--is children murdering children--and \n     their parents, . . . and parents murdering their children. \n     The ingredient that has made American different is the last \n     couple of ``adult generations'' of Americans, and their \n     changes towards what is right & wrong, good & evil. Is God \n     now sending forth demons to America in the form of its \n     children, or have the demons occupied our adult society, by \n     invitation? How are we as kids treated differently than the \n     kids before us? As a generation, we are unique. We have been \n     slaughtered on our way into this world, we are murdered as we \n     live and try to grow in this world, and we are molested, \n     assaulted, sexualized and drugged. The adult society has \n     responded by creating entire new industries and professions \n     to repair their damage to us. Even as I speak to you our \n     adult society is setting the stage to murder us when we \n     become old. We are even taught that we evolved from slime. \n     (An interesting item that the public is not fully aware of is \n     that the two cold-blooded murderers in Littleton used the \n     theory of evolution as their foundation, ``Survival Of The \n     Fittest.'' You've all heard of their uniforms, the black \n     trenchcoats, but the real uniform that day was the T-shirt \n     Eric Harris had on that said ``NATURAL SELECTION'' Has our \n     adult society banned that?) It appears to me that we have \n     willingly become a culture of death and violence. Some adults \n     blame the jocks like me, the cheerleaders and others, . . . \n     even the trenchcoats, . . . and some even say if our country \n     only offered 9 round ammo clips instead of 10 or more, things \n     would be better.\n       At the time of the Columbine tragedy, our national leader, \n     the President, stated the youth of this nation need to learn \n     to resolve our differences with words, not weapons. At the \n     time this statement was made, we as a nation, were bombing \n     Yugoslavia. They tell us that the youth of this nation need \n     to be more tolerant, kinder, gentler, more understanding. Yet \n     our entertainment, music, TV, movies, games (and actions of) \n     the adult world provides for our consumption are all too \n     often filled with violence, sex, death and destruction. If I \n     were to take into my life what is provided to me by society, \n     my actions too would violate the Heavenly & Moral Laws my \n     family have taught me. Other solutions to school violence \n     have been nametags to be carried around our neck as \n     millstones, metal detectors, increased video surveillance, \n     etc. It appears to me that our society is confused. The adult \n     world seems as a ship with no rudder being cast around by the \n     wind and storms of our times, with no control or \n     understanding as to why. Many of these storms appear to have \n     been caused by their own accord. It's as if our adult society \n     has no compass, no bearing, no standards for our society. \n     Even at our age, we can discern the difference between what \n     you say and what you do. . . .\n       In regard to the solution of watching what comes out of us \n     by monitoring closely our world with surveillance cameras, \n     what we say, how we look, etc., our society needs to watch \n     carefully what goes into us. In my bedroom is a picture of \n     the Grand Teton mountain range in Wyoming. Below the picture \n     is the following:\n\n                         The Essence of Destiny\n\n       ``Watch your thoughts, for they become words. Choose your \n     words, for they become actions. Understand your actions, for \n     they become habits. Study your habits, for they will become \n     your character. Develop your character, for it becomes your \n     destiny.''\n       Even before Columbine, my father told me that when a \n     society opens the gates of hell for the pursuit of its' \n     happiness, for its' pleasures and for its' economy, the devil \n     will come out and have his dance with us. We here today were \n     the unfortunate ones who had to dance.\n       I believe I have found the problem within America. Each and \n     every citizen can too. All they have to do is look into the \n     mirror every day to find the demon. They can also find the \n     solution in that same mirror. Ask yourself daily, ``what am I \n     thinking, saying and doing in my life to call out the demons \n     on the youth of my nation?'' In the final analysis, a nation \n     is judged on how it treats its' young and its' old. Until we \n     return to respecting life as sacred, prepare yourself for \n     more dances, more heartbreak, more death, and more \n     destruction. It also would be wise to look into the future of \n     America. It's not that hard. The character a nation instills \n     into its youth today, will be the destiny of our nation \n     tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10246-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10246-S10247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TIM JOHNSON\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I rise to tell you about a man \nI have known for many years now who is a credit to his profession and \nto his community. He is a consummate professional and an even finer \nhuman being. Tim Johnson has been bringing the news to Brattleboro, VT \nand beyond for more than 20 years now. It is clear that Vermonters know \na good thing when they hear it.\n  Tim, now the news director at WTSA, is a Brattleboro institution. In \nthese times of huge media conglomerates and syndicated radio programs, \nTim Johnson knows Brattleboro--he is a graduate of Brattleboro Union \nHigh School--and residents have come to rely on him for the news they \ncare about. Time, on a typical day, will report on everything from lost \npets, to school closings and national affairs. As Vermont's Senator for \nmore than 20 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Tim \nthroughout the years and I have come to appreciate his keen insights \nand his dogged pursuit of the facts. Tim has demonstrated an unflagging \ncommitment to keeping his community informed and Brattleboro has been \nthe better for it. While we hear so much about what is wrong with the \nmedia today, Tim Johnson is a shining example of what is right.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a profile of Tim Johnson from The \nTimes Argus, dated October 1, 2000.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Sunday Rutland Herald, Oct. 1, 2000]\n\n       Tim Johnson: Radio Journalist Keeps an Ear on Brattleboro\n\n                          (By Susan Smallheer)\n\n       Brattleboro.--The studios of WTSA in Brattleboro are on the \n     second floor of an old Victorian home on Western Avenue. It's \n     Tim Johnson's home away from home, sometimes for as long as \n     18 hours a day. He's even slept on a pull-out futon at the \n     station.\n       When he's home, though, he's in bed by 10 p.m.--unless \n     there's a close Red Sox game--and up by 4 a.m., and at the \n     station before 5 to prepare for the morning newscast.\n       Johnson is the news director of Brattleboro's dominant \n     radio station, WTSA-AM and FM. He works exhausting hours, \n     both locked in the studio and then out on the streets getting \n     the news.\n       This is a radio newsman who gets a tan. (Well, a little \n     tan.)\n       Johnson, 43, has been on the air since he was a teenager at \n     Brattleboro Union High School, working at WTSA's cross-town \n     competition, WKVT. He was 17 and making $1.60 an hour when he \n     started working weekend shifts at the station, and gradually \n     left behind disc jockey chores for the newsroom.\n       Johnson is a self-taught radio expert who never went to \n     college, whose first broadcast challenge was to overcome a \n     stutter. Friends say he overcame it by simple determination. \n     ``The first word I stumbled over was Episcopal,'' he said. \n     ``I mispronounced it three times.''\n       His own name, Arsenault, and the problems he has \n     pronouncing it, helped persuade him to choose something \n     simpler for on-air.\n       Johnson has been chasing the news in southern Vermont for \n     more than 20 years. No Rolodex for him. He has a memory for \n     telephone numbers, perhaps a 1,000 or more. He goes to house \n     fires, car accidents, board meetings, governor's appearances \n     and homecoming football games.\n       ``It's the personal pride of putting a good product out \n     there,'' said Johnson, who puts the emphasis on community.\n       ``We're one of the few radio stations that still do lost \n     dog announcements,'' said Johnson, who fields telephone calls \n     on such topics ``Is there softball tonight?'' and ``Is there \n     school?'' and ``Is Brattleboro Bowl open tonight?''\n       He is also the technical wizard at the station, and the \n     `scanner head.' He taught himself as the station switched to \n     cyber. There is no such thing as a piece of tape in radio \n     now; it's all digital.\n       The high and mighty came calling at Western Avenue, or \n     rendezvous on the road. His ``Live Mike'' van allows him to \n     get news on the spot and broadcast it first. In the \n     competitive Brattleboro news market, WTSA rules.\n       ``You don't know how many people call me Mike,'' laughs \n     Johnson over soup and salad at the Jolly Butcher, a popular \n     see-and-be-seen restaurant a mile from the station.\n       With his distinctive deep voice, people instantly recognize \n     Johnson, and his relaxed personality invites conversation, \n     ``You can't brush anybody off; they might think you're a snob \n     and word gets around fast in a town like Brattleboro,'' said \n     Johnson, who seems to enjoy the attention.\n       At The Jolly Butcher, the jolly chef teases Johnson about \n     the station's recent lobster-eating contest, which raised \n     money for the Winston Prouty Center, a school and day care \n     center for handicapped children. As he leaves, Johnson is \n     hugged by Windham County Side Judge Trish Hain, who once \n     worked for him as an assistant news editor at WKVT. \n     Everybody, it seems, knows him.\n       He's chairman of the board of directors of BCTV, \n     Brattleboro's heavily watched community television station. \n     He's moderator for his hometown, serving Vernon as a steady \n     hand during marathon town meetings. He's also the Windham \n     County director of the emergency alert system, which accounts \n     for the second of two beepers on his belt. And he recently \n     became the moderator for the Brattleboro Union High School \n     district.\n       He's also a justice of the peace and Vernon's \n     representative to the Windham Regional Commission.\n       Johnson relishes the pace, but health problems have forced \n     him to scale back to 55-60\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\n     hour work weeks. He's devoting more time now to his wife, \n     family, and three grandchildren, not to mention their dog \n     Loretta. Both he and Sue, the activities programmer at the \n     special needs unit at the Vernon Green Nursing Home, were \n     married before, he said, and family means a great deal to \n     both of them.\n       Johnson divorced in his 20s, and his only child, 3-year-old \n     son Jeremiah, was murdered 18 years ago in Texas by his ex-\n     wife's drunken half-brother. Johnson says his grief almost \n     destroyed him.\n       But his renewed interest in his Christian religion has made \n     him forgive his former brother-in-law, who is out of prison \n     after serving most of a 10-year sentence. ``I forgive him. In \n     God's eyes he's forgiven. But do I think he's a nice person? \n     No.\n       ``I don't believe in the death penalty. I'm a death penalty \n     opponent,'' he says.\n       Religion helps him, he says, deal with his personal tragedy \n     and job stress. And he uses his voice--``I sing tenor''--in \n     the choir of the South Vernon Advent Christian Church, where \n     both his grandfathers were pastors.\n       Back after lunch, Johnson makes a few calls to get the \n     proverbial sound bite to flesh out a story from the AP about \n     an issue in the governor's race relating to homosexuality and \n     public education.\n       This afternoon, he will even do double duty, cueing up CDs \n     for a missing DJ, expertly flipping through the playlist, \n     selecting a song to fit the time slot and sliding it into the \n     stacked CD players, all with seconds to go.\n       He dashes between music and news, cueing up disks and \n     editing the sound bites he garnered from Vernon NEA President \n     Angelo Dorta, all at amazing speed.\n       He's in his element.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10247-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SUGAR BEETS\n\n Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, the year 2000 marks an occasion \nthat is worthy of recognition by the Senate. The Chamber of Commerce of \nHawaii celebrates its sesquicentennial, marking the 150th anniversary \nof its first meeting, on October 15, 1850, of a group of Honolulu \nbusinessmen at the behest of Hawaii's King Kamehameha III. They founded \nthe Hawaiian Chamber of Commerce, an organization that would lead the \nHawaiian Islands' growth in trade, commerce, economic and social \ndevelopment through the years. The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii is the \nsecond-oldest chamber of commerce west of the Rockies, and the only \nAmerican chamber founded under a monarchy.\n  The history of The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii includes many, many \naccomplishments. I wish to provide a glimpse of their more notable \nachievements which I believe merit recognition.\n  In 1867, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii initiated negotiations for \nthe first treaty of reciprocity in trade between the United States of \nAmerica and the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n  The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii authored the Hawaiian National \nBanking Act of 1884, allowing the establishment of the banking system \nthat has evolved into Hawaii's current system.\n  In 1898, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii began its successful \nadvocacy for a Hawaii-San Francisco TransPacific cable.\n  The Hawaii Visitors Bureau, today known as the Hawaii Visitors and \nConventions Bureau, was founded by the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii in \n1903. This agency has led the development of Hawaii's visitor industry, \nwhich today is the largest sector of Hawaii's economy.\n  In 1907, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii conducted a survey of the \nPearl River to facilitate the construction of a harbor and dry dock \nthat is now Pearl Harbor. The United States Pacific Command today \nprovides a strong, forward based U.S. defense in the Asia-Pacific \nregion from this great harbor.\n  In 1919, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii founded Aloha United Way, \nHawaii's leading charitable organization which annually collects \nmillions of dollars for the needy in Hawaii.\n  The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii became the trustee of Hawaii's \nPublic Health Fund in 1923. The Public Health Fund provides seed money \nfor approximately 20 public health projects each year.\n  In 1928, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii's aviation committee \nsought out airlines to provide the first interisland air service.\n  In 1929, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii drafted a plan to increase \nthe depth of Honolulu Harbor to accommodate modern ships and facilitate \ninternational trade. Today, Honolulu Harbor is our primary port of \nentry for the vast majority of all goods to Hawaii.\n  In 1941. The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii founded the Blood Bank of \nHawaii. Later that year, the services of the Blood Bank helped to save \nmany lives when Pearl Harbor was attacked on December 7th, 1941.\n  The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii was an active and vocal advocate \nfor statehood for Hawaii. In 1959, The Chamber joined other local \nadvocates in celebrating Hawaii's statehood.\n  In 1978, The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii played a leading role in \nHawaii's State Constitutional Convention.\n  Throughout its 150-year history, and continuing today, The Chamber of \nCommerce of Hawaii has helped to support a strong U.S. economic and \nmilitary presence in the Asia-Pacific region. As the economies of the \nregion grow, The Chamber's continued support for a strong, forward \nbased military presence that provides the stability prerequisite to \nprosperity will be important. The Chamber's continued work to promote \neconomic development in the region will play a vital role in aiding the \ngoals and interests of Hawaii and the United States in the Asia-Pacific \nregion.\n  Congratulations to The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii on its 150th \nanniversary, and best wishes for continued success in the years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10247-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10247-S10248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EDMUND F. BALL\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Hoosiers have been remembering and \ncelebrating the remarkable life and achievements of one of our greatest \ncitizens, Edmund F. Ball. I want to share with the nation a most \nappropriate tribute published in the Muncie Star Press of October 3, \n2000 by Phil Ball.\n  The article follows:\n\n       Ed Ball took his last flight Sept. 30. This was an \n     unscheduled flight but with a good pilot who probably let Ed \n     handle the controls for some of the trip.\n       This was a flight into history--a flight into legend.\n       Ed died in Ball Memorial Hospital. Just across the street \n     is the Edmund F. Ball Medical Education Center. And a half-\n     mile away stands the Edmund F. Ball Building on the Ball \n     State campus. A mile and a half away in Community Civic \n     Center (once the Masonic Temple) is an assembly room named \n     the Edmund Ball Auditorium. Those are just a few of the \n     monuments to this most important citizen who has ever lived \n     in our hometown of Muncie.\n       But Ed's life and times and image and achievements and \n     generosities were his most important monuments.\n       Ed wasn't one to brag. Those who knew him knew his modesty \n     and his tendency toward self-deprecating humor. One of Ed's \n     witticisms was to say that after his life was over, all he \n     had done was ``to cross the street.'' To explain this, he \n     pointed out that he was born on East Washington Street and \n     when he died he would be laid out and prepared for burial at \n     Meeks Mortuary across the other side of East Washington \n     Street.\n       But in almost 96 years between those two events, Ed \n     accomplished more than any 10 people and became a legend in \n     his own time, although he would be the first to deny any such \n     words of grandiloquence. This hometown of his and mine and \n     yours has been the beneficiary of countless works of his mind \n     and his generosity.\n       The last time I saw Ed was when he was hospitalized in June \n     1999 with a minor problem--heart trouble. I am glad that at \n     that\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\n     time I did something to boost his morale and help erase one \n     of his lifelong regrets. I made him an honorary member of my \n     Old and Original and Valid Muncie Ball family.\n       Many people in the past have thought that Ed might be \n     somehow related to me--it isn't really so. Ed's family were \n     frost-bitten immigrants from Buffalo in 1887, whereas my \n     family were already here and cultivating the soil in Delaware \n     County by 1830.\n       Ed wrote me on June 12, 1999, and said he was pleased that \n     he at long last had finally achieved good genealogic status--\n     even though it was just honorary.\n       His type of man will not be seen again anytime soon, if \n     ever. He was Muncie's man of the millennium.\n       Shakespeare said it best when he wrote the last words of \n     Hamlet, the Prince of Denmark, who lay dying. This is what \n     Hamlet said: ``The rest is silence.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10248-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OPERATION IVORY SOAP\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to the \nmen and women who participated in a little known covert operation in \nWorld War II--Operation Ivory Soap. During World War II, ``island \nhopping'' was a critical element in the U.S. Pacific strategy. The idea \nwas to capture Japanese held islands of tactical or strategic \nimportance and by-pass any far-flung or inconsequential bases. Once an \nisland was taken it was used as a forward airfield for aircraft \nreturning from long-range missions where they were repaired, rearmed, \nand made ready for the next vital mission.\n  General Henry H. ``Hap'' Arnold, Commander of the Army Air Forces, \nrecognized the need for forward-based, mobile air depots to support \nAmerican bombers and fighters in the Pacific war. General Arnold and a \npanel of military officers determined the need for converting naval \nrepair ships into hybrid aircraft depot ships. Eventually, six 440-\nfoot-long Liberty ships and 18 smaller 180-foot-long auxiliary vessels \nwould be modified into Aircraft Repair Units, carrying 344 men, and \nAircraft Maintenance Units, manned by 48 troops. Everything from the \nsmallest aircraft parts to complete fighter wings were carried on these \nships. The repair and maintenance facilities were manned 24-hours a day \nand the Liberty ships included platforms to land the ``new'' helicopter \nfor quick ship-to-shore repair transport.\n  The Army Air Force crews that manned these ships had to be trained to \nunderstand the nautical aspect of life at sea. Colonel Matthew Thompson \nof the Army Air Force was given the mission to turn airmen into seamen. \nCalled back from Anzio in Italy, the Colonel had less than two weeks to \norganize the training program.\n  The Grand Hotel in Point Clear, AL, was the focal point for \n``Operation Ivory Soap'' training. Colonel Thompson contacted the then \nowner, Mr. Strat White-Spunner, regarding the use of the hotel as his \nbase of operations where he intended to instill basic seamanship, \nmarine and aquatic training in the Army officers and men of the \naircraft repair and maintenance units. As a donation to the war effort, \nMr. Roberts turned the Grand Hotel and its facilities over to the US \nArmy Air Force to be used as its Maritime Training School. Operation \nIvory Soap training began on July 10, 1944.\n  Using the Grand Hotel, officers and men moved in and began living in \n``Navy style.'' All personnel referred to the floors as decks, kept \ntime by a ship's bell and indulged in the use of tobacco only when the \n``smoking lamp'' was lit. The courses included swimming, special \ncalisthenics, marching, drill, navigation, ship identification, \nsignaling, cargo handling, ship orientation, sail making, amphibious \noperations, and more. Two men from each ship were also trained to be \nunderwater divers. During a five month period, the school turned out \n5,000 highly-trained Air Force seamen. When they and their ships went \nto war, so did Colonel Thompson. The men of the operation participated \nin the landings in the Philippines, Guam, Tinian, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and \nOkinawa. Fighter aircraft and B-29s taking off from these bases flew \ncontinuous missions over Japan. Many lives, as well as aircraft, were \nsaved because of the men of the aircraft repair and maintenance units.\n  Perhaps the greatest tribute I can make to the exploits of these sea-\ngoing airmen is to paraphrase the Merchant Marines who worked with them \nand who praised them as ``equal to any sea-going combatants they had \never served with.'' This is a testament to their skill and \nprofessionalism and the ability of this nation to adjust its resources \nto defeat the enemy. The Grand Hotel still stands elegantly on the \nbanks of the Mobile Bay. A hotel whose rich southern history embodies \nthe best traditions of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10248-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     JUDGE ROMAN S. GRIBBS, JUDGE FOR THE MICHIGAN COURT OF APPEALS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to \nacknowledge a distinguished public servant, from my home state of \nMichigan, Judge Roman S. Gribbs, who will be retiring from the bench of \nthe Michigan Court of Appeals, at the close of this year. In November, \nhundreds of his colleagues, friends and family will celebrate the \ncareer of this gentleman of the bench who played a distinct role in \nshaping Michigan's history.\n  Judge Gribbs dedicated his academic and professional life to \nstudying, teaching, enforcing, practicing and interpreting the laws \nthat govern the citizens of Michigan. He excelled in his studies at the \nUniversity of Detroit where he received his Juris Doctorate in 1954, \ngraduating Magna Cum Laude. He taught at his alma mater from 1954 \nthrough 1956 and served as an Adjunct Professor and Faculty member at \nthe University of Michigan and the Thomas M. Cooley Law School. He \nimplemented the law as an Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor from 1956 \nthrough 1964 and in his service to the City of Detroit as presiding \nTraffic Court Referee.\n  In 1968, Roman Gribbs' career in the law took a new turn when he was \nappointed, then elected, Sheriff of Wayne County. His commitment to \nstrong and fair enforcement of the law earned him respect far beyond \nthe boundaries of Michigan's most populous county.\n  In 1969, Sheriff Gribbs was elected mayor of the city of Detroit, \njust 2 years after the city had endured one of the most destructive \ncivil disturbances in the Nation's history. Under his leadership, the \npeople of Detroit began to heal the city's wounds, to bridge their \ndifferences and to build their common future. As a newly elected member \nof Detroit's City Council in those years, I can testify with first hand \nknowledge to the debt this great American city owes to the calm, \ndetermined leadership of Mayor Roman Gribbs.\n  After stepping down as mayor, Roman Gribbs followed his love for the \nlaw and won a seat on the bench of the Third Judicial Circuit and then \non the Michigan Court of Appeals where he has served the people of \nMichigan with a high standard of ethics and courage.\n  In addition to being a dedicated man of the bench, Judge Gribbs also \nfinds solace in his involvement in the arts. His interest in the \nhumanities and the cultural arts is evidenced through his service as a \nmember of the Founders Society of the Detroit Institute of Art, the \nDetroit Historical Society and the Michigan Opera Theater.\n  Despite all that Judge Gribbs has accomplished in a life of service \nto others those of us fortunate enough to have enjoyed his friendship \nmay admire him most for the quiet qualities we have seen in him over \nmany years--his unyielding integrity, his uncommon decency and perhaps \nmost amazingly, given the tumultuous times he has lived in, his \ngentleness.\n  Judge Gribbs can take pride in his long career of service and \ndedication to the law and to the people of Michigan. I know my \ncolleagues will join me in saluting this man from Michigan, and in \nwishing him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10248-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10248-S10249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER CATHERINE A. WILSON\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the 106th Congress draws to a \nclose, I stand to pay tribute to a distinguished Navy officer who \nserved as a Congressional Science Detail on my staff during this \nCongress. Commander Catherine Wilson, United States Navy, was selected \nfor this highly coveted position as a result of her outstanding \ntraining, experience, and accomplishments. Her superb performance and \nimpeccable credentials earned her the respect and admiration of the \nSenate staff. She distinguished herself rapidly as a professional who \npossessed a pleasant demeanor, tremendous integrity, decisive\n\n[[Page S10249]]\n\nleadership style, political savvy, and unending energy. The ultimate \nNaval officer, Commander Wilson is a visionary thinker who has the \ninnate ability to implement these visions. Commander Wilson is the \nconsummate professional and nursing has never had a better ambassador \nnor patients a more devoted advocate.\n  Commander Wilson forged strong alliances and affiliations with staff \nfrom a myriad of Congressional offices, committees, and federal and \ncivilian agencies that fostered a cohesive approach to legislative \nproposals. She worked closely with staff members on the Appropriations \nSubcommittees on Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation in support of military health issues and national nursing and \nhealth care agendas.\n  As an advocate of Tri-Service nursing and military health issues, \nCommander Wilson championed independent practice for nurse \nanesthetists, the continuation of the Bachelor of Science degree as the \nminimum level of education for entry into military nursing practice, \ncontinued funding for a graduate school of nursing at the Uniformed \nServices University of the Health Sciences, and the Tri-Service Nursing \nResearch Program. She was instrumental in securing appropriations \nlanguage for a wide variety of health care initiatives including \ntelemedicine, advanced medical technologies, and distance learning.\n  More than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a military \nhospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. Commander \nWilson embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, dedicated \nprofessional leaders stepping to the forefront to serve our country and \ncommitted to caring for our Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Soldiers, and \ntheir family members during peacetime and at war.\n  Commander Wilson is an officer of whom the military and our nation \ncan and should be justifiably proud: a unique combination of talent and \ndevotion to duty. I want to personally acknowledge my sincere \nappreciation to Commander Wilson for her exemplary months of service, \nand to bid her a fond aloha and heartfelt mahalo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10249-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT OF THE VETO MESSAGE ON (H.R. 4733), ``ENERGY AND WATER \nDEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001''--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM \n                                  132\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval, H.R. 4733, the ``Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations Act, 2001.'' The bill contains an \nunacceptable rider regarding the Army Corps of Engineers' master \noperating manual for the Missouri River. In addition, it fails to \nprovide funding for the California-Bay Delta initiative and includes \nnearly $700 million for over 300 unrequested projects.\n  Section 103 would prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from revising \nthe operating manual for the Missouri River that is 40 years old and \nneeds to be updated based on the most recent scientific information. In \nits current form, the manual simply does not provide an appropriate \nbalance among the competing interests, both commercial and \nrecreational, of the many people who seek to use this great American \nriver. The bill would also undermine implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act by preventing the Corps of Engineers from funding \nreasonable and much-needed changes to the operating manual for the \nMissouri River. The Corps and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are \nentering a critical phase in their Section 7 consultation on the \neffects of reservoir project operations. This provision could prevent \nthe Corps form carrying out a necessary element of any reasonable and \nprudent alternative to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of \nthe endangered least tern and pallid sturgeon, and the threatened \npiping plover.\n  In addition to the objectionable restriction placed upon the Corps of \nEngineers, the bill fails to provide funding for the California-Bay \nDelta initiative. This decision could significantly hamper ongoing \nFederal and State efforts to restore this ecosystem, protect the \ndrinking water of 22 million Californians, and enhance water supply and \nreliability for over 7 million acres of highly productive farmland and \ngrowing urban areas across California. The $60 million budget request, \nall of which would be used to support activities that can be carried \nout using existing authorities, is the minimum necessary to ensure \nadequate Federal participation in these initiatives, which are \nessential to reducing existing conflicts among water users in \nCalifornia. This funding should be provided without legislative \nrestrictions undermining key environmental statutes or disrupting the \nbalanced approach to meeting the needs of water users and the \nenvironment that has been carefully developed through almost 6 years of \nwork with the State of California and interested stakeholders.\n  The bill also fails to provide sufficient funding necessary to \nrestore endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest, which would \ninterfere with the Corps of Engineers' ability to comply with the \nEndangered Species Act, and provides no funds to start the new \nconstruction project requested for the Florida Everglades. The bill \nalso fails to fund the Challenge 21 program for environmentally \nfriendly flood damage reduction projects, the program to modernize \nCorps recreation facilities, and construction of an emergency outlet at \nDevil's Lake. In addition, it does not fully support efforts to \nresearch and develop nonpolluting, domestic sources of energy through \nsolar and renewable technologies that are vital to America's energy \nsecurity.\n  Finally, the bill provides nearly $700 million for over 300 \nunrequested projects, including: nearly 80 unrequested projects \ntotaling more than $330 million for the Department of Energy; nearly \n240 unrequested projects totaling over $300 million for the Corps of \nEngineers; and, more than 10 unrequested projects totaling in excess of \n10 million for the Bureau of Reclamation. For example, more than 80 \nunrequested Corps of Engineers construction projects included in the \nbill would have a long-term cost of nearly $2.7 billion. These \nunrequested projects and earmarks come at the expense of other \ninitiatives important to taxpaying Americans.\n  The American people deserve Government spending based upon a balanced \napproach that maintains fiscal discipline, eliminates the national \ndebt, extends the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, provides \nfor an appropriately sized tax cut, establishes a new voluntary \nMedicare prescription drug benefit in the context of broader reforms, \nexpands health care coverage to more families, and funds critical \ninvestments for our future. I urge the Congress to work expeditiously \nto develop a bill that addresses the needs of the Nation.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., to the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n         MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill which is long \noverdue but now appropriate as our Nation prepares to face the \nchallenges of a new century.\n  During the 1960s, a young and gifted preacher from Georgia gave a \nvoice to the voiceless by bringing the struggle for freedom and civil \nrights into the living rooms of all Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. raised his voice rather than his fists as he helped lead our Nation \ninto a new era of tolerance and understanding. He ultimately gave his \nlife for this cause, but in the process brought America closer to his \ndream of a nation without racial divisions.\n  It has been said that, ``Those who do not understand history are \ncondemned to repeat it.'' America's history includes dark chapters--\nchapters in\n\n[[Page S10253]]\n\nwhich slavery was accepted and discrimination against African-\nAmericans, women and other minorities was commonplace. It is in \nacknowledgment of that history, and in honor of Dr. King's bright \nbeacon of hope which has lead us to a more enlightened era of civil \njustice, that I introduce the Martin Luther King Commemorative Coin Act \nof 2000.\n  This bill would instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of Dr. King's contributions to the United States. \nRevenues from the surcharge of the coin would be used by the Library of \nCongress to purchase and maintain historical documents and other \nmaterials associated with the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.\n  As we start the 21st Century, I cannot think of better way to honor \nthe civil and human rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Today, Dr. King's message goes beyond any one group, embracing all \nwho have been denied civil or human rights because of their race, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation or creed. This Congress, as well \nas previous Congresses, has taken important steps to put these beliefs \ninto civil code.\n  However, upholding Dr. King's dream is a continuing struggle. Just \nlast month, the House of Representatives passed hate crimes legislation \nmaking crimes based on race, religion, gender, and sexual orientation \nfederal offenses. Champions of hate crimes legislation in the Senate \nand our colleagues in the House of Representatives gave powerful \nexamples of the hatred that exists in our nation even today. As a \nsociety, we must always remember Dr. King's message, ``that one day \nthis nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \n`We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created \nequal.' ''\n  Dr. King's majestic and inspiring voice as he made this speech will \nremain in our collective memory forever. His writings and papers \ncompliment the visual history of his legacy. Keeping Dr. King's papers \navailable for public access will serve to remind us of what our country \nonce was, and how a solitary voice changed the path of a nation. It \nalso would be a constant reminder of the vigilance needed to ensure we \nnever return to such a time.\n  This legislation has been developed in consultation with the King \nfamily, the Library of Congress, the Citizens Commemorative Coin \nAdvisory Committee, and the U.S. Mint. Similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by the Chairman of the House \nBanking and Financial Services Committee, Congressman Jim Leach of \nIowa.\n  Although African-Americans have played a vital role in our Nation's \nhistory, African-Americans were included on only four out of 157 \ncommemorative coins:\n  Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball's color barrier and brought about \na cultural revolution with the courage and dignity in which he played \nthe great American pass time, and the way he lived his life.\n  Booker T. Washington, who founded Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and \nserved as a role model for millions of African-Americans who thought a \nformal education would forever be outside of their grasp.\n  George Washington Carver, whose scientific experiments began as a way \nto improve the lot in life of sharecroppers, but ended up \nrevolutionizing agriculture throughout the South.\n  And the Black Revolutionary War Patriots, a commemorative half-dollar \nwhich recognized the 275th anniversary of the birth of Crispus Attucks, \nwho was the first revolutionary killed in the Boston Massacre.\n  The Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Coin will give us the \nopportunity to recognize the valuable contributions of all Americans \nwho stood and were counted during our Nation's civil rights struggle.\n  Americans like the late Reverend Avery C. Alexander, who was a \npatriarch of the New Orleans' civil rights movement. He championed \nanti-discrimination, voter registration, labor rights, and \nenvironmental regulations as a six-term state legislator and as an \nadviser to Governor Morrison of Louisiana in the 1950s.\n  Heroes like Dr. C.O. Simpkins from Shreveport, LA, whose home was \nbombed simply because he dared to stand by Dr. King and demand that the \nbuses in Shreveport be integrated, and Reverend T. J. Jemison of Baton \nRouge, a front-line soldier and good friend of Dr. King who helped \ncoordinate one of the earliest boycotts of the civil rights movement.\n  Louisiana also was fortunate enough to have elected leaders such as \nmy father Moon Landrieu and Dutch Morial, both former mayors of New \nOrleans during those turbulent times. They led the way when the \npersonal and political stakes were very high.\n  These are just a few of the great civil rights leaders from my State. \nHowever, throughout Louisiana and all across America thousands of \ncitizens--black and white, young and old, rich and poor--listened to \nDr. King, followed his voice and dreamed his dreams. It is in memory of \nall of our struggles that I introduce this bill.\n  The great Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza said, ``If you want the \npresent to be different from the past, study the past.'' This \nlegislation not only ensures we are able to preserve and study our \npast, but also honors Dr. King, who played such an integral role in \nshaping both our present and our future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 3184. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire premarket consultation and approval with respect to genetically \nengineered foods, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                genetically engineered foods act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Genetically \nEngineered Foods Act. This legislation would strengthen consumer \nconfidence in the safety of genetically engineered foods, and in the \nability of the federal government to exercise effective oversight of \nthis important technology. This bill requires an FDA pre-market review \nof all genetically engineered foods, and grants FDA important \nauthorities to conduct oversight. In addition, the Genetically \nEngineered Foods Act creates a transparent process that will better \ninform and involve the public as decisions are made regarding the \nsafety of genetically engineered foods.\n  In the past five years, genetically engineered foods have become a \nmajor part of the American food supply. Many foods on the grocery store \nshelves now contain genetically engineered ingredients such as corn, \nsoy, and potatoes. These foods have been enhanced with important \nqualities that help farmers grow crops more efficiently. But they have \nalso raised significant concerns as to the safety of these new foods, \nand the adequacy of government oversight. These concerns were \nheightened by the recent recall of taco shells that contained a variety \nof genetically engineered corn that was not approved for human use.\n  Up until now, genetically engineered foods have been screened by the \nfederal Food and Drug Administration under a voluntary program. The \nGenetically Engineered Foods Act will make this pre-market review \nprogram mandatory, and strengthen government oversight in several \nimportant ways.\n  Mandatory Review: Companies developing genetically engineered foods \nwill receive approval from FDA before new foods could be marketed. FDA \nwill scientifically ensure that genetically engineered foods are just \nas safe as conventional foods before allowing them on the market.\n  Clear-cut Authority: FDA will be given authority to review all \ngenetically engineered foods, whether produced domestically or \nimported, including authority over genetically engineered food \nsupplements (such as ginseng extract, for example). Genetically \nengineered foods not approved for market will be considered \n``adulterated'' and subject to FDA recall.\n  Public Involvement: Scientific studies and other materials submitted \nto FDA in their review of genetically engineered foods will be \navailable for public review and comment. Members of the public can \nsubmit any new information on genetically engineered foods not \npreviously considered by FDA and request a new review of a genetically \nengineered food, even after the food is on the market.\n  Testing: FDA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, will be \ngiven the authority to conduct scientifically-sound food testing to \ndetermine whether genetically engineered foods are inappropriately \nentering the food supply (for instance, whether a food cleared for use \nonly as an animal feed is showing up in food for humans).\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n  Communication: FDA and other federal agencies will establish a \nregistry of genetically engineered foods for easy, one-stop access to \ninformation on which foods have been cleared for market, and what \nrestrictions are in place on their use. Federal agencies will report \nregularly to Congress on the status of genetically engineered foods in \nuse. The genetically engineered food review process will be fully \ntransparent so that the public has access to all non-confidential \ninformation.\n  Research: An existing genetically engineered foods research program \nwill be expanded to focus research on possible risks from genetically \nengineered foods, with a specific emphasis on potential allergens. \nResearch is also directed at understanding impacts, to farmers and to \nthe overall economy, of the growing use of genetically engineered \nfoods.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation. The American people should be assured that the \nfood they feed their families is the safest in the world. The \nGenetically Engineered Foods Act can help provide that assurance. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3184\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Foods \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) genetically engineered food is rapidly becoming an \n     integral part of the United States and international food \n     supplies;\n       (2) the potential positive effects of genetically \n     engineered foods are enormous;\n       (3) the potential for negative effects, both anticipated \n     and unexpected, exists with genetic engineering of foods;\n       (4) evidence suggests that unapproved genetically \n     engineered foods are entering the food supply;\n       (5) it is essential to maintain public confidence in the \n     safety of the food supplies and in the ability of the Federal \n     government to exercise adequate oversight of genetically \n     engineered foods;\n       (6) public confidence can best be maintained through \n     careful review of new genetically engineered foods, and \n     monitoring of the positive and negative effects of \n     genetically engineered foods as the foods become integrated \n     into the food supplies, through a review and monitoring \n     process that is scientifically sound, open, and transparent, \n     and that fully involves the general public; and\n       (7) since genetically engineered foods are developed \n     worldwide and imported into the United States, it is also \n     imperative to ensure that imported genetically engineered \n     foods are subject to the same level of oversight as domestic \n     genetically engineered foods.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREMARKET REVIEW OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOODS.\n\n       Chapter IV of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 414.

A bill to facilitate the protection of the critical \ninfrastructure of the United States, to enhance the investigation and \nprosecution of computer-related crimes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 CYBER SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Cyber Security \nEnhancement Act of 2000. This legislation is designed to enhance \nAmerica's ability to protect our critical infrastructures from attack \nby hackers, terrorists, or hostile nations. It is a result of many \nmeetings and hearings I have held as the Chairman of the Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information that \nfocused on cyber security and critical infrastructure protection.\n  As we all know, the Information Revolution has transformed virtually \nevery aspect of our daily lives. However, advancements in technology \nhave not been accompanied by adequate security. Today, our nation's \ncritical infrastructures have all become interdependent, with \nvulnerable computer networks as the backbone. These networks, and the \nvital services they support like transportation, electric power, air \ntraffic control, and telecommunications, are vulnerable to disruption \nor destruction by anyone with a computer and a modem. And an attack on \none sector can cascade to others, causing significant loss of revenue, \ndisruption of services, or loss of life.\n  The Cyber Security Enhancement Act seeks to remove some of the \nimpediments to effective cooperation between the private sector and the \ngovernment that prevent effective cyber security. Over the past three \nyears, Senator Feinstein and I have held seven hearings in our \nsubcommittee on cyber security issues. Although we received many \nrecommendations from experts at these hearings and from Executive \nBranch commissions, I have only included those ideas in this bill that \nI thought would clearly improve cyber security efforts.\n  In particular, this bill would allow companies to voluntarily submit \ninformation on cyber vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks to the \nfederal government, without this information being subject to Freedom \nof Information Act disclosure. The bill would also clarify anti-trust \nlaw to permit companies to share information with each other on these \ncyber security issues. In addition, the bill would authorize the \nAttorney General to issue administrative subpoenas in order to swiftly \ntrace the source of a cyber attack. It then requires the Attorney \nGeneral to report to Congress on a plan to standardize requests from \nlaw enforcement agencies to private companies for electronic \ninformation and records used during a cyber investigation. Finally, it \nrequires the Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce to report \non efforts to encourage the utilization of technologies that prevent \nthe use of false Internet addresses.\n  I would like to provide a brief background some of the actions by the \ngovernment that have helped to highlight the impediments addressed by \nthe Cyber Security Enhancement Act:\n  Because of my concern for America's new ``Achilles heel'', I authored \nan amendment to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, directing the \nPresident to submit a report to Congress ``setting forth the results of \na review of the national policy on protecting the national information \ninfrastructure against strategic attacks.''\n  In July 1996, the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure \nProtection, PCCIP, was established. It was required to report to the \nPresident on the scope and nature of the vulnerabilities and threats to \nthe nations critical infrastructures. It was also charged to recommend \na comprehensive national policy and implementation plan for critical \ninfrastructure protection and determine legal and policy issues raised \nby their proposals. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act implements some \nof their legal recommendations.\n  The Commission released its report in October of 1997. It called for \nan unprecedented partnership between the public and private sector to \nbetter secure our information infrastructure. This partnership is \nessential because approximately 90 percent of the critical \ninfrastructures are owned and operated by private industry.\n  In May 1998, the President issued Presidential Decision Directive 63, \nPDD 63, as a response to the Commissions recommendations. This \ndirective set 2003 as the goal for protecting our critical \ninfrastructures from attack. Among other provisions, PDD-63 created \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Centers, ISACs, for the private sector \nto share information on cyber vulnerabilities and attacks.\n  Finally, on January 7th, 2000, President Clinton released the first \nedition of the national plan to protect our critical infrastructures. \nThe plan was a modest first step towards addressing the cyber security \nchallenges before the nation. Like the PCCIP, its key element was the \ncall for a public-private partnership. In February of 2000, I chaired a \nhearing in my Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information on the national plan and its privacy \nimplications. I plan to hold additional oversight hearings on the plan \nin the future.\n\n  Overall protection from cyber attack necessitates that information \nabout cyber vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks be communicated among \ncompanies, and with government agencies. Two major legal obstacles \ntowards accomplishing this goal have been repeatedly identified.\n  A company which voluntarily submits cyber vulnerability and attack \ninformation to the federal government in order to help raise overall \nsecurity must be assured that this information is protected from \ndisclosure or they will not voluntarily submit such information. My \nlegislation provides a narrowly defined exemption from the Freedom of \nInformation Act for this purpose.\n  In its report, the PCCIP specifically addressed the legal impediments \nto information sharing. In that section, the Commission stated:\n\n       We envision the creation of a trusted environment that \n     would allow the government and private sector to share \n     sensitive information openly and voluntarily. Success will \n     depend upon the ability to protect as well as disseminate \n     needed information. We propose altering several legal \n     provisions that appear to inhibit protection and thus \n     discourage participation.\n       The Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, makes information in \n     the possession of the federal government available to the \n     public upon request. Potential participants in an information \n     sharing mechanism may require assurances that their sensitive \n     information will remain confidential if shared with the \n     federal government.\n       We recommend: The proposed Office of National \n     Infrastructure Assurance (now the Critical Infrastructure \n     Assurance Office) require appropriate protection of specific \n     private sector information. This might require, for example, \n     inclusion of a b(3) FOIA exemption in enabling legislation.\n\n  Currently, there are over 100 exemptions to FOIA that have been \ncreated by other laws. My legislation creates another so called \n``(b)(3)'' exemption that would ensure that Federal entities, agencies, \nand authorities that receive information submitted under the statute \ncan offer the strongest possible assurances that information received \nwill be protected from FOIA disclosure.\n  Our legislation would not allow submitters to hide information from \nthe public. If current reporting obligations require that certain \ninformation be\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\nsubmitted to a particular agency, this non-disclosure provision would \nnot alter that requirement. The legislation would only protect \nvoluntarily submitted information that the government would otherwise \nnot have.\n  There is tremendous support for this FOIA exemption. My subcommittee \nheld a hearing in March to address the impediments to information \nsharing. At that hearing, I asked Harris Miller, President of the \nInformation Technology Association of America (the largest and oldest \nassociation of its kind in the nation): ``With respect to FOIA, is it \nfair to say that we won't have adequate information sharing until we \noffer an exemption to FOIA for critical information infrastructure \nprotection?'' Mr. Miller responded: ``Absolutely. As long as companies \nbelieve that by cooperating with the government they're facing the risk \nof very sensitive and confidential information about proprietary \nsecrets or about customer records, however well intentioned, ending up \nin the public record, that is going to be, to use your phrase, a show \nstopper.''\n  FBI Director Louis Freeh testified at the same hearing. He was asked \nif he supported a FOIA exemption and said: ``I would certainly tend to \nfavor it in the limited area of trade secrets, proprietary information, \nintellectual property, much like my comments about the Economic \nEspionage Act, where that is carved out as an area that protects things \nthat are critical to conduct an investigation, but would be devastating \neconomically and otherwise to the owner of that property, if it was \ndisclosed or made publicly available.''\n  The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office has sponsored the \n``Partnership for Critical Infrastructure Security'', which is a \ncollaborative effort of industry and government to address risks to \nnational critical infrastructures and assure delivery of essential \nservices. It has representation from all sectors of private industry. \nDuring their meeting in February, five working groups were formed, one \nof which addressed legal impediments to information sharing. FOIA was \nraised as a primary impediment.\n\n  Former Senator Sam Nunn and Frank Cilluffo, of the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies, wrote an op-ed on cyber security \nin the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last month. In the article, they \nstated: ``We need to review and revise the Freedom of Information Act, \nwhich now constitutes an obstacle to the sharing of information between \nthe public and private sectors.''\n  We clearly need to assure private companies that information they \nshare with the government in order to improve cyber security and \nprotect our critical infrastructures will be protected from public \ndisclosure. This legislation provides that assurance.\n  Information-sharing activities between companies in the private \nsector is inhibited by concern over anti-trust violations. According to \nthe PCCIP, ``Potential contributors from the private sector are \nreluctant to share specific threat and vulnerability information \nbecause of impediments they perceive to arise from antitrust and unfair \nbusiness practice laws.''\n  The Cyber Security Enhancement Act includes an assurance that \ncompanies who share information with each other on the narrow issues of \ncyber threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks will not be subject to \nanti-trust penalties. This protection was similarly provided to \ncompanies during the preparation for Y2K. There is also a great deal of \nsupport for this provision.\n  David Aucsmith, Intel's chief security officer, testified at a \nScottsdale, AZ field hearing of my subcommittee on cyber security on \nApril 22. In reference to information sharing between companies, he \nstated, ``However, there are problems with that cooperation. We are now \nhaving a collection of industry competitors coming together to share \ninformation. This brings up anti-trust issues.''\n  In the op-ed by Nunn and Cilluffo, they stated, ``Likewise, we need \nto address legislatively the multitude of issues related to liability, \nincluding anti-trust exposure that may arise in sector-to-sector \ncooperation in cyberspace.''\n  Harris Miller, President of the ITAA, wrote an op-ed on cyber \nsecurity for the Washington Post in May. In his section on information \nsharing, he commented, ``Part of the answer will require new approaches \nto the Freedom of Information Act and the anti-trust laws so that \nsensitive information can be protected.''\n  Companies need assurance that their participation in information \nsharing activities about cyber vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks \nwill not result in punishment. The Cyber Security Enhancement Act \nprovides the assurance that such narrow areas of cooperation will not \nresult in unwarranted anti-trust prosecution.\n  Cyber attacks often leave no witnesses. When an attack does occur, \nits origin, scope, and objective are usually not obvious at first. Time \nis a critical factor in the pursuit of a cyber attacker, and new tools \nare needed to fight this problem. At the March hearing of my \nsubcommittee, FBI Director Louis Freeh testified about the need for law \nenforcement to have administrative subpoena authority in order to \nswiftly trace the source of a cyber attack. The Cyber Security \nEnhancement Act will permit law enforcement to use administrative \nsubpoenas to gain source information of an attack. Under current law, \nthe authority to issue administrative subpoenas is limited to cases \ninvolving violations of Title 21 (i.e. drug controlled substances' \ncases), investigations concerning a federal health care offenses, or \ncases involving child sexual exploitation or abuse.\n  The ``Love Bug'' virus investigation is an excellent example of where \nspeed is of the essence in catching a cyber criminal. Philippine \nauthorities investigating the ``Love Bug'' computer virus wanted to \nsearch the suspects' apartment sooner, but were unable to find a judge \nover the weekend. The delay apparently gave the apartment's residents \ntime to dispose of the personal computer and key evidence.\n  The administrative subpoena provision in my legislation is very \nnarrowly limited to cybercrime investigations involving violations of \nnine federal statues that address computer crimes. This provision is \nonly concerned with obtaining information about the source of the \nelectronic communication. It specifically protects privacy rights by \nprohibiting the disclosure of the contents of an electronic message. \nAdministrative subpoenas will provide law enforcement with the speed \nand the means to enhance the protection of our critical infrastructures \nfrom attack in cyberspace.\n  The Cyber Security Enhancement Act will remove roadblocks to \ninformation sharing and investigation of cyber attacks. It will foster \ngreater cooperation among the private sector and with the government on \ncyber security issues by providing limited protection from FOIA and \nanti-trust laws. It will take away the current ability of cyber \ncriminals to evade law enforcement's efforts to catch them by \nauthorizing administrative subpoenas. It will encourage standardization \nin requests for information by law enforcement to the private sector. \nIt will encourage the use of technologies that inhibit a cyber attacker \nfrom utilizing a false Internet address.\n  Ultimately, this legislation enhances the protection of our nation's \ncritical infrastructures from cyber attack by hackers, terrorists, or \nhostile nations. I am committed to doing what I can to secure our \nnation's way of life in the Information Age. This legislation is a \ncritical first step.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Kohl, Mr. L. Chafee, Mr. \n        Moynihan, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 3189. A bill to provide more child support money to families \nleaving welfare, to simplify the rules governing the assignment and \ndistribution of child support collected by States on behalf of \nchildren, to improve the collection of child support, to promote \nmarriage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 CHILD SUPPORT DISTRIBUTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Support \nDistribution Act. This is companion legislation to Congresswoman Nancy \nJohnson's bill in the House, which passed the House overwhelmingly on \nSeptember 7, 2000. I want to begin by thanking Senator Kohl for his \nleadership on child support issues; I am delighted to have been able to \nteam up with him again in this important area. The child support \nprovisions of this bill\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nclosely resemble his original legislation--the Children First Child \nSupport Reform Act--of which I am a proud cosponsor. I also want to \nthank Senator Bayh for his leadership on new fatherhood initiatives. I \nam pleased that we could work together and incorporate their ideas into \nthis vital legislation. I am pleased to have Senators Chafee, Moynihan, \nand Breaux as original cosponsors on this bill.\n  There is no question that children are the very future of our country \nand I believe fundamentally that every child has the right to grow up \nhealthy, happy, and safe. Throughout my career, promoting children's \nwell-being and keeping our children safe is a mission that has been \nclose to my heart. While we cannot expect the government to ensure that \nevery child receives parental love and attention, we can ensure that \nparents pay court-ordered child support, and we can ensure that the \ncustodial parent--not the government--receives this vital financial \nsupport.\n  Ending poverty and promoting self-sufficiency is an on-going national \ncommitment. Four years ago Congress restored welfare to a temporary \nassistance program, rather than a program that entangles and traps \ngeneration after generation. Today, the welfare caseload has fallen by \nsix million recipients from 12.6 million in 1996 to 6.6 million in \nSeptember 1999. This reflects a drop of 49 percent in just three years. \nWe also have the lowest percentage (2.4) of the American population on \nwelfare since 1967.\n  Unfortunately, while we are succeeding in promoting self-sufficiency \nand self-reliance through welfare reform, we are sending out a double-\nedged message on the need to pay child support. Current law regarding \nthe assignment and distribution of child support for families on \nwelfare is extremely complicated--depending on when families applied \nfor welfare, when the child support was paid, whether that child \nsupport was for current or past-due payments, and depending on how the \nchild support was collected, in other words, through direct payments, \nthrough garnishing wages or other government assistance programs, or \nthe federal income tax return intercept program.\n  The ``Child Support Distribution Act of 2000'' would provide more \nchild support money to families leaving welfare; would simplify the \nrules governing the assignment and distribution of child support \ncollected by States; would improve the collection of child support; \nwould authorize demonstration programs encouraging public agencies to \nhelp collect child support; and would implement a fatherhood grant \nprogram to promote marriage, encourage successful parenting, and help \nfathers find jobs and increase their earnings.\n  Under current law, when child support is collected for families \nreceiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, TANF, the money is \ndivided between the state and federal governments as payment for the \nwelfare the family has received. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act gave \nstates the option to decide how much, if any, of the state share of \nchild support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send to \nthe family.\n  The 1996 Welfare Reform law also required that in order to qualify \nfor TANF benefits, beneficiaries must ``assign''--or give--their child \nsupport rights to the state for periods before and while the family is \non welfare. This means that the State is allowed to keep (and divide \nwith the federal government) child support arrearages that were owed \neven before the family went on TANF if they are collected while the \nfamily is receiving welfare benefits.\n  The original intent of these assignment and distribution strategies \nwas to reimburse the state and federal governments for their outlays to \nthe welfare family. But how much sense does it make to tell a family \nthat is on welfare or trying to get off welfare that the State is \nentitled to the first cut of any child support payment, even if the \nabsent parent begins to pay back the child support that was owed before \nthe family went on welfare?\n  This means that the state gets the support before a parent can buy \nnew shoes for her child, before she can buy her child a new coat for \nthe approaching winter, before she can buy groceries for her family, or \npay the rent for the next month. So in the real world, not just a \npolicy-oriented world, our current law regarding child support payments \nprovides a disincentive for struggling parents to leave welfare, and it \ncertainly provides no incentive for the absent parent to pay, much less \ncatch up with, their child support bills. I wonder how we can \nrealistically expect to foster a positive relationship between a \ncustodial parent, and the parent paying child support, when the State \nis entitled to all of the support money.\n  The key provisions of the bill I am introducing today will allow \nstates to pass through the entire child support collected on their \nbehalf while a person is on welfare; will change how and when child \nsupport is ``owed'' to the states for reimbursement for welfare \nbenefits; and will expand the child support collection provisions such \nas revoking passports for past-due child support.\n  We must ensure both non-custodial and custodial parents that child \nsupport payments are directly benefitting their children. This bill \nwill enable families to keep more of the past-due child support owed to \nthem and it will further the goals of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act by \nhelping families to remain self-sufficient. This bill will give mothers \nleaving welfare an additional $4 billion child support collections over \nthe first five years of full implementation. It will also lead to the \nvoluntary payment by states of about $900 million over five years in \nchild support to families while they are still on welfare.\n  Children are the leaders of tomorrow; they are the very future of our \ngreat nation. We owe them nothing less than the sum of our energies, \nour talents, and our efforts in providing them a foundation on which to \nbuild happy, healthy and productive lives. And, when appropriate, we \nneed to help parents financially support and provide for their \nchildren. Because it simply makes little sense to ask people to be \nself-sufficient, to pay their child-support bills, and then to allow \nthe State to collect all of that child-support.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a serious look at this bill and \npass it before we adjourn.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with the hope that this \nimportant legislation will be addressed prior to the adjournment of \nthis Congress. As an original cosponsor of the ``Child Support \nDistribution Act of 2000,'' I strongly support the promotion of \nresponsible fatherhood and putting more money in the hands of families \nfor their children. The House of Representatives has done their part by \npassing a similar bill 405 to 18. It is time for the Senate to act.\n  This bill incorporates provisions from a bill I authored, S. 1364, \nthe ``Promoting Responsible Fatherhood Act,'' a bipartisan bill to help \nfathers and noncustodial parents provide emotional and financial \nsupport for their children. The provision in this bill to provide \nstates with grants for fatherhood programs is essential to ensure \nsmaller more localized programs receive funding and to provide each \nstate with seed money to expand upon current fatherhood initiatives.\n  With the inclusion of fatherhood and media grants, this bill strikes \nan appropriate balance to address ``dead-broke'' fathers and \n``deadbeat'' fathers. In order to help dead-broke fathers act \nresponsibly, this bill authorizes grants to fatherhood programs to \nprovide employment training and build upon parenting skills. Last year, \nI visited the Father Resource Program, run by Dr. Wallace McLaughlin in \nIndianapolis, Indiana. This program is a wonderful example of a local, \nprivate/public partnership that delivers results. It has served more \nthan 500 fathers, primarily young men between the ages of 15 and 25, by \nproviding father peer support meetings, premarital counseling, family \ndevelopment forums and family support services, as well as co-\nparenting, employment, job training, education, and life skills \nclasses.\n  The fathers there were eager to tell me when I asked about the \ndifference these programs have made in their lives and the lives of \ntheir children.\n  One said to me, ``After the six-week fatherhood training program, the \nsupport doesn't stop . . . I was wild before. The program taught me \nself-discipline, parenting skills, responsibility.''\n  Another said, ``As fathers, we would like to interact with our kids. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nthey grow into something, we want to feel proud and say that we were a \npart of that.''\n  And yet another, ``The program showed me how to have a better \nrelationship with my child's mother, and a better relationship with my \nchild. Before those relationships were just financial.''\n  While the program's emotional benefits to families are difficult to \nmeasure, we do know it is helping fathers enter the workforce. Over 80 \npercent of the men who have graduated from the program are currently \nemployed.\n  In addition, to grant programs that provide parenting skills, \nemployment related training, and encourage healthy child-parent \nrelationships there needs to be a cultural shift. This shift will only \ntake place when society deems it unacceptable to evade one's \nresponsibility as a father. This shift is necessary to motivate the \n``deadbeat'' fathers to take responsibility for their children. In an \neffort to achieve this cultural shift, the ``Child Support Distribution \nAct of 2000'' includes $25 million for a media grant program that will \nallow each state to air television ads that convey the importance of \nfatherhood.\n  In addition, this bill expands upon the provision in S. 1364 to \nencourage states to pass-through child support funds directly to \nfamilies that are currently on government assistance. This provision \nwould provide an additional $6.2 billion in the hands of families and \nchildren over the next ten years. In addition, it will increase the \nlikelihood that noncustodial parents will pay child support and allow \nchildren to benefit from their noncustodial parents' financial \ncontributions. Making families self sufficient through the \nparticipation of both parents in their children's lives is the next \nstep in welfare reform.\n  Society has been aware of the connection between fatherlessness and \nchildren experiencing social ills such as poverty, crime, and teen \npregnancy for sometime now. However, the Federal Government continues \nto spend billions of dollars to address these social ills and very \nlittle to address the root causes of such social ills. In order to \nbreak the cycle of poverty, government dependance, and crime Congress \nneeds to address fatherlessness and the breakdown of the family \nstructure.\n  The investment called for in this legislation is fiscally \nresponsible--it helps deal with the root causes, not just the symptoms, \nof many of the social problems that cost our society a great deal of \nmoney.\n  The cost to society of drug and alcohol abuse is more than $110 \nbillion per year.\n  The federal government spends $8 billion a year on dropout prevention \nprograms.\n  Last year we spent more than $105 billion on poverty relief programs \nfor families and children.\n  The social and economic costs of teenage pregnancy, abortion and \nsexually transmitted diseases have been estimated at more than $21 \nbillion per year.\n  All this adds up to a staggering price we pay for the consequences of \nour fraying social fabric, broken families and too many men not being \ninvolved with their kids.\n  The number of kids living in households without fathers has tripled \nover the last forty years, from just over 5 million in 1960 to more \nthan 17 million today. Children need positive role models.\n  The House overwhelmingly declared their support for child support and \nfatherhood measures. I urge the Senate to declare their support for \nthese measures and pass this legislation this year. I yield the \nremaining time to the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor of \nthis important legislation, the ``Child Support Distribution Act of \n2000,'' and am pleased to join with Senators Snowe, Bayh, Chafee, \nMoynihan and Breaux in this effort to help build stronger families and \nimprove our public child support system.\n  I want to thank and commend Senator Snowe and the other co-sponsors \nfor working with me to present this combined child support/fatherhood \nlegislative package, containing child support provisions that are \nsimilar to my legislation, S. 1036, the ``Children First Child Support \nReform Act.'' Both my bill and the legislation we are introducing today \ntake significant steps to increase child support collections and to \nincrease the support dollars that are delivered directly--or passed-\nthrough--to families involved in the public system.\n  In Fiscal Year 1998, the public child support system collected child \nsupport payments for only 23 percent of its caseload. This means that \nour nation's children are owed roughly $47 billion in over-due child \nsupport. Though every year we collect more, it is clear that our child \nsupport system is still not working as it should and that too many \nchildren still lack the support they need and deserve.\n  In 1997, I worked with my State of Wisconsin to institute an \ninnovative program of passing through child support payments directly \nto families--and they have with great success. Wisconsin has found that \nwhen child support payments are delivered to families, non-custodial \nparents are more apt to pay, and to pay more. In addition, Wisconsin \nhas found that, overall, this policy does not increase government \ncosts. That makes sense because ``passing through'' support payments to \nfamilies means they have more of their own resources, and are less apt \nto depend on public help to meet other needs such as food, \ntransportation or child care.\n  And since 1997, I have worked to promote expansion of this policy to \nthe other states. I contributed to the Administration's child support \nfinancing reform consultation process and urged the President to make \npass-through expansion part of his budget for fiscal year 2001, which \nhe agreed to do. I also worked to reach consensus on pass-through \nexpansion with the states, children's advocates and fatherhood groups. \nThese efforts led to my introducing bipartisan legislation last year on \nchild support financing reform, S. 1036, that advanced many of the \npolicies and principles incorporated into this legislation. I also \ntestified on child support pass-through policy at a hearing before the \nSenate Finance Committee on July 25, 2000.\n  Though we've come a long way since the 1997 beginning of an expanded \npass-through program in Wisconsin, we now have a key opportunity to \nencourage other states to follow Wisconsin's example. A House version \nof this child support/fatherhood legislation passed the House on \nSeptember 7th by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 405 to 18. On \nSeptember 25th, I sent a letter to the Senate leadership, a letter co-\nsigned by 21 of my Senate colleagues, urging the leadership to take \naction on child support and fatherhood policy reforms before the end of \nthis legislative session. And it is our goal and my sincere hope that \nthis bipartisan ``Child Support Distribution Act,'' which so closely \nresembles the House bill, will be approved by the Senate unanimously. \nThis legislation will deliver over $6 billion in increased child \nsupport payments to families over the next ten years. And as my 21 \nSenate colleagues and I emphasized in our letter, we can and should \nmove this legislation this year because our nation's children need and \ndeserve nothing less.\n  While we all agree that the level of over-due child support is \nunacceptable, we also know that poor collection rates don't tell a \nsimple story. There are many reasons why non-custodial parents may not \nbe paying support for their children. Some are not able to pay because \nthey don't have jobs or have fallen on hard times. Others may not pay \nbecause they are unfairly prevented from spending time with their \nchildren.\n  But other fathers don't pay because the public system actually \ndiscourages them from paying. As my colleagues may know, under the \ncurrent system, nearly $2 billion in child support is retained every \nyear as repayment for public assistance, rather than delivered to the \nchildren to whom it is owed. This policy has existed since 1975 when we \ndesigned the public child support system to recover the costs of \nwelfare assistance. Once collected, those support dollars are split \nbetween the state and federal governments as reimbursement for welfare \ncosts.\n  Since the money doesn't benefit their kids, fathers are either \ndiscouraged from paying support altogether or at least discouraged from \npaying through the formal system. And on the other side of the \nequation, mothers have no incentive to push for payment since the \nsupport doesn't go to them.\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\n  Our ``Child Support Distribution Act,'' just like my ``Children First \nChild Support Reform Act,'' attempts to address this problem. The \nlegislation reforms child support policy so that families working their \nway off--or just off--public assistance, keep more of their own child \nsupport payments. With this bill, the federal-state child support \npartnership will embark upon a new policy era with a mission focused \nboth on promoting self-sufficiency, rather than cost recovery, and on \nmaking child support payments truly meaningful for families.\n  We know that creating the right incentives for non-custodial parents \nto pay support and increasing collections has long-term benefits. \nPeople who can count on child support are more likely to stay in jobs \nand stay off public assistance.\n  Delivering or passing through child support directly to families \nwould simplify the job for states as well. The states currently devote \nsix to eight percent of what they spend to run the entire child support \nprogram--$250 million per year--on distributing collections. This has \ncreated an administrative nightmare. Right now, the states divvy up \nchild support dollars into as many as nine pots. Under my proposal, \nstates would have greater freedom to adopt a straightforward policy of \ncollecting child support and delivering it to families, without costly \nand burdensome regulations.\n  Moving towards a simpler child support system that puts greater \nemphasis on getting funds to families is the right and most fair \napproach --for fathers, mothers, and children, and for all of us \ninterested in making the child support program work. I urge my Senate \ncolleagues to support this legislation this year, and I look forward to \nour working to deliver more child support resources to the children to \nwhom they are owed so that all our communities benefit from healthier, \nhappier children and stronger, more stable families.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor the Child Support Distribution Act of 2000 introduced today in the \nSenate. I would also like to commend my colleagues on their efforts to \nreconcile the House-passed Child Support Distribution Act, H.R. 4678, \nwith similar bills introduced in the Senate. I agree that it is \nimperative for the Senate to join the House in passing strong \nbipartisan legislation to strengthen the child support system and \nassist low income families by allowing them to retain child support \npayments. I also believe that it is important to encourage noncustodial \nfathers to take responsibility for their children's well-being and I am \npleased that this legislation includes funding to states to develop \nprograms promoting responsible parenthood.\n  I feel so strongly about this legislation because of the significance \nof child poverty in the United States, and particularly in my own State \nof Louisiana. According to the Children's Defense Fund, there are \nalmost 366,000 children living in poverty in the State of Louisiana, \nalmost 30 percent of the state's children. Over 33 percent of families \nin Louisiana have no father in the home and 40 percent of babies are \nborn out-of-wedlock. Studies show that children who are raised with no \nfather are five times more likely to live in poverty and twice as \nlikely to commit a crime or commit suicide, as well as more likely to \nuse drugs and alcohol or to become pregnant. It is time to break this \ncycle of child poverty. Strengthening the child support system, \nensuring that money gets into the hands of the families that need it, \nand supporting programs that encourage responsible parenthood are \nimportant steps in addressing child poverty. I am pleased to cosponsor \nthe Child Support Distribution Act and encourage the Senate to act on \nit this Congress. Thank you for this opportunity to voice my support \nfor this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I rise on the Senate floor today to pay \ntribute and to really eulogize one of our colleagues from the House of \nRepresentatives and a personal friend. I am speaking of Herb Bateman, \nthe late Congressman from America's First District, the First District \nof Virginia.\n  As most of my colleagues know, Herb passed away last month following \na rich life of public service, family commitment, and 18 years of \ndistinguished service in the House of Representatives. Herb had \nannounced his retirement last January, and in doing so, he had received \nwell-deserved accolades and awards and letters of appreciation. They \nwere from virtually everyone whose life he touched--and he touched many \nfrom all walks of life. I might add, the letters of appreciation and \nthanks are still being sent to newspapers in his district.\n  From September 12 through 14, Members of the House paid a very \ndeserved tribute to Herb, and in doing so, really captured the essence \nof the man. The essence, simply put, is that Herb epitomized integrity \nin public service. I commend these moving and very accurate portrayals \nof Herb Bateman to the attention of my Senate colleagues.\n  Let me also say that the comments by our colleagues in the House also \nrepresented a most appropriate segue to the services that were held for \nHerb in his hometown of Newport News. I am compelled to say that I have \nnever attended services more appropriate, more moving, and more fitting \nin celebrating the life of someone so respected and so loved. I was \nprivileged to join many of Herb's colleagues and my former colleagues \nin the House; Senator Bunning; the distinguished senior Senators from \nVirginia, Senator Warner and Senator Robb; and hundreds of friends and \nrelatives who were in attendance.\n  There simply wasn't enough room in Our Lady of Carmel Catholic Church \nin Newport News last September 15 to hold all of Herb Bateman's friends \nand constituents who joined his wife Laura and their family, yes, to \nmourn his loss, but also to pay tribute and celebrate his life.\n  The remarks by Monsignor Michael D. McCarron were not only \nappropriate and especially uplifting in their religious context, \nproviding Herb and Laura's family and all of us in attendance the \nstrength and faith that we needed, but they also captured with humor \nand grace the perspective of one's life devoted to public service.\n  Herbert H. Bateman Jr., ``Bert'' Bateman, eulogized his Dad in moving \nremarks that only a loving son could give. Bert's eulogy was a gift of \nsolace and comfort to his mother, his family, his sister Laura and her \nfamily, to all\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\nof the relatives present--and with regard to that special father-son \nrelationship we all would hope for--it was a gift to us all.\n  The last speaker during the service for Herb Bateman, was his long \ntime Chief of Staff, Dan Scandling. And, it is Dan's eulogy that I am \ngoing to ask to be put in the Record today.\n  I do so for a special reason. Dan Scandling's remarks are not only a \nfitting tribute to his boss, Congressman Herb Bateman, they also speak \nfor all of the Bateman staff members during 18 years of Herb's \ndistinguished service. They speak for Dan, and they speak for his long-\ntime and valued executive assistant, Peggy Haar, and for all of the \nstaffers who served Herb so well during his 18 years in the House of \nRepresentatives. After hearing Dan speak, I believe his comments also \nrepresent that special relationship that most congressional staff \nmembers have with their congressman or their senator.\n\n  My appreciation for Dan Scandling's remarks, like others who are \nprivileged to serve in this body, are because I am a former staffer--or \nas we say in Kansas, a bucket toter, if you will, in my case working \nfor both a Senator and my predecessor in the House of Representatives. \nIn each case, my boss was the Senator or the Congressman. So it was and \nis for Dan and all of the Bateman staff. They admired and loved him and \ntheir work demonstrated that and in turn their work earned the respect \nand gratitude of the people of America's First District.\n  I am fond of saying that there are no self-made men or women in \npublic office; that it is your friends who make you what you are. In \nthis respect Herb was indeed a self-made man but also made better by \nhis friends, more particularly his staff. I am also fond of saying you \nare only as good--in terms of accomplishment and making a difference--\nas your staff. Herb accomplished much and made a difference.\n  Dan Scandling captured those thoughts and much more in his moving \ntribute to his boss, Congressman Herb Bateman. His personal tribute to \nLaura Bateman, a great lady, was especially appropriate and captured \nHerb's commitment and love for his wife.\n  Dan summed up the life of Herb Bateman and his public service \nattributes as only a trusted aid could do--Herb's credibility, \nintegrity, his hard work and commitment to his fellow man. He also \nreflects on their personal relationship with honor and affection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the eulogy given by Dan \nScandling on behalf of his friend, mentor and boss, Congressman Herb \nBateman be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       So many things come to mind when you think of Herb Bateman.\n       Congressman. State Senator. Colleague.\n       Statesman. Virginia Gentleman. Devoted Public Servant.\n       Boss. Golfing Partner. Friend.\n       And lest no one forget: ``America's First District.''\n       There also is the much more private side of Herb Bateman.\n       Husband. Father. Grandfather.\n       One of the first things that struck me about Mr. Bateman \n     when I came to work for him 10 years ago was his unwavering \n     devotion to Laura.\n       I can still vividly remember one of the first times she \n     came into the office. We were just wrapping up one of those \n     marathon meetings that all you Members so deeply cherish when \n     Laura walked in.\n       Herb got up from behind his desk, walked over to her, \n     reached for her hand, gave her a kiss on her cheek and then \n     asked how her day was.\n       I quickly learned this wasn't just a one-time thing.\n       Nothing was as important as making sure Laura had had a \n     good day.\n       I only wish I was half as attentive to the needs of my \n     wife.\n       Laura was the most important thing in Herb's life. The two \n     were inseparable. Wherever Herb went, Laura went. Whether it \n     was travel overseas, a trip to the Eastern Shore or back and \n     forth to Washington, the two of them were always together.\n       Laura was very important to Herb's political career--\n     particularly when it came to keeping names and faces \n     straight.\n       Herb was terrible with names. He always insisted on name \n     tags at every event he hosted.\n       Laura, on the other hand, is the master of remembering \n     names and faces. No matter where they were, or who they ran \n     into, it is like instant recall. She can always place a name \n     with a face. You politicians in the audience today should be \n     jealous.\n       I know one certain Chief of Staff who owes his \n     congressional career to Laura because she remembered his name \n     and face.\n       Bert and Laura, you have no idea how proud your father was \n     of you. Not a day went by that he wasn't telling me about how \n     one of you had gotten a better job, or a promotion, or had \n     landed a big, new account.\n       Bert, he was particularly proud of your desire--and \n     commitment--to make Newport News a better place to live and \n     work. He was proud that you were willing to give so much of \n     yourself to your community.\n       And he also was proud of how good a husband--and father--\n     you are.\n       Laura, nothing brought a bigger smile to your father's face \n     than for him to run into one of his former colleagues from \n     the Virginia Senate and have them tell him how great a job \n     you do in Richmond and beyond.\n       He was so proud of how successful you have become.\n       Then there is ``Poppy.'' Herb loved his grandchildren. \n     Emmy, Hank and Sam--you were the apples of his eye.\n       Just last week he was boasting how Emmy had won a tennis \n     tournament at the club and was so pleased that Hank had taken \n     up running cross country. Every summer I would get the \n     updates on all the ribbons the two of you would win at swim \n     meets.\n       Hank, I think your grandfather has high expectations from \n     you on the athletic field. I know you won't let him down.\n       Emmy, I know your ``Poppy'' wishes for you the same success \n     that his daughter has had.\n       Sam, your ``Poppy'' was so excited about your first day at \n     school. He was looking forward to getting home last weekend \n     to hear all about it first-hand.\n       I know this week has not been easy. It wasn't supposed to \n     happen this way. I know you feel somewhat cheated because \n     ``Poppy'' was finally going to be able to spend more than \n     just the weekends in Newport News. There would be no more of \n     this nomadic life of leaving for Washington every Monday \n     morning only to return home sometime Friday--then do it all \n     over again two days later.\n       But look around this church. Look how many people are here. \n     Everyone here loved your ``Poppy.''\n       It's like one huge ``thank you'' for sharing him with us.\n       Thank you for all those times he left you--his family--to \n     go work an 80-hour week in Washington;\n       To go to a parade somewhere at the other end of the \n     District on a Saturday morning;\n       To go to some god-awful chicken dinner fund raiser;\n       To go shake hands at the shipyard gates at 6 a.m. on some \n     rain-soaked morning in the dead of winter.\n       Thank you for sharing him with us. Thank you for the \n     sacrifices you made.\n       I worked for Herb Bateman for 10 years. Over that time we \n     grew to be pretty close. I think it would probably be fair to \n     say he considered me part of the family.\n       There aren't too many places in America's First District \n     that he and I haven't been to together, and there aren't too \n     many things we haven't discussed.\n       Of all the things that have been ingrained in my head over \n     the last 10 years, it's that credibility is everything.\n       Once you lose your credibility, you lose everything. If \n     people cannot take you at your word, then your word is \n     nothing.\n       Perhaps that explains why he was such an effective \n     legislator, and why when he announced his retirement last \n     January, letters, faxes and e-mails poured into his office \n     thanking him for his dedicated service.\n       He got letters from Admirals, Generals, captains of \n     industry and politicians on both sides of the aisle. He got \n     letters from long-time friends and associates. And most \n     significantly, he got letters from hundreds of his \n     constituents. All them were effusive in their praise.\n       Credibility meant everything to Herb Bateman. I know that \n     first hand. I know it guided each of his decisions, whether \n     it was on a controversial issue before Congress or a \n     contentious political issue.\n       He would have been pleased to hear how his colleagues \n     described him during Tuesday evening's tribute on the floor \n     of the House.\n       I couldn't help but smile as I saw Member after Member get \n     up and talk about his integrity.\n       Perhaps Congressman Burton said it best:\n       ``Herb was a man, who if he gave his word on anything, you \n     could take it to the bank. Herb was not one of those guys \n     that played both sides of the fence. He was a man of \n     integrity--impeccable integrity--and one that all of us \n     respected.''\n       More than anything else--any aircraft carrier, any \n     submarine, any bridge, any Corps of Engineers' project--Herb \n     would want to be known for his integrity.\n       Obviously, he has.\n       Herb had two vices in life. A good steak, and golf.\n       Man, did he love a good steak. New York Strip. Medium rare.\n       He always ordered french fries with his steak--extra crisp, \n     please or potato sticks if you have them.\n       If I was invited over to Shoe Lane for dinner it usually \n     meant a good steak on the grill--and potato sticks!\n       If I was invited out for a steak in Washington, it usually \n     meant someone in the office was in trouble.\n       I used to cringe when he would come up behind me, put his \n     hand on my shoulder and say, ``Dan, let's go have a steak.''\n       He always enjoyed his meal. I can't say the same.\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\n       The there was golf. Next to Laura, golf was his passion.\n       Like most us, he wasn't very good, but that didn't matter. \n     He just loved to play. He loved being outdoors. He loved \n     meeting new playing partners.\n       And he loved mulligans!\n       Herb played golf to relax. He didn't talk about work on the \n     golf course. He didn't take a cell phone. He never carried a \n     pager. Golf was for fun. If you were on the golf course, you \n     were there to enjoy yourself.\n       If Herb were ever elected President, I bet one of the first \n     things he would do would be to issue an Executive Order \n     prohibiting cell phones on the golf course.\n       For all those golfers here today, I have one special \n     request. The next time you play golf, as tribute to Herb, \n     leave your cell phones and pagers in the car.\n       Take the time to relax and enjoy the people you are playing \n     with. I have made a promise to myself never to take a cell \n     phone with me on the golf course again. I hope I can live up \n     to it.\n       Oh, and take a couple of mulligans too.\n       I want to close by touching on some of the things that Herb \n     did that no one knew about, that never made any headlines, \n     that never got him a vote.\n       Herb liked helping people. He always stressed to his staff \n     that constituent service was the most important part of his \n     job--and their job.\n       He always reminded us that he worked for the people of \n     America's First District and it was his job to help them when \n     they had a problem.\n       I could recount hundreds--if not thousands--of cases where \n     Herb got personally involved. One that always comes to mind \n     involved a woman from Williamsburg whose husband had died and \n     was buried in Arlington Cemetery. The woman's husband had \n     been an Air Force pilot and she asked that he be buried in \n     the section in Arlington where you could have different types \n     of tombstones.\n       Soon after his funeral she went about designing a tombstone \n     that she thought would be a fitting tribute. The cemetery \n     approved the design and she had the stone carved. When the \n     store arrived at the cemetery several weeks later, cemetery \n     officials did a complete 180 and told her she couldn't use \n     the stone.\n       Somehow, a columnist at the Washington Post caught wind of \n     the situation and a story appeared in the paper. Herb saw it \n     and asked me what I knew about it. After a few quick calls, \n     it was evident the woman hadn't contacted us. But to Herb, \n     that didn't matter.\n       Within a matter of minutes, Herb, me and another staffer \n     were in a car headed over to Arlington. We drove through the \n     cemetery where the woman's husband was buried, got out looked \n     at some of the other tombstones then headed back across the \n     river.\n       Upon returning to the office, Herb immediately called the \n     Superintendent at Arlington and presto, the issue was \n     resolved.\n       When I called the woman to tell her the cemetery officials \n     had relented, I asked why she didn't call us. She said she \n     didn't want to burden the Congressman with her problem.\n       To Herb, it wasn't a bother; it was a pleasure. It was all \n     about helping the people he represented.\n       The Congress has lost more than an outstanding Member, it \n     has lost a warm, caring individual who served his nation with \n     great honor and distinction.\n       God bless Herb, his family, and America's First District.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I commend his remarks to all Senators and \nmore especially all staff in both the House and Senate. It captures \nthat special relationship--the analogy might be--my boss, right or \nwrong--my boss. In the case of Herb Bateman and Dave Scandling the \nrightness of their work was 100 percent--there was no wrong.\n  In closing, I would like to quote Helen Steiner Rice to Laura \nBateman, to the family, to the staff, and to the friends and \nconstituents of Herb Bateman, my friend.\n\n     When I must leave you for a little while,\n     Please go on bravely with a gallant smile\n     And for my sake and in my name,\n     Live on and do all things the same--\n     Spend not your life in empty days,\n     But fill each waking hour in useful ways--\n     Reach out your hand in comfort and in cheer,\n     And I in turn will comfort you and hold you near.\n\n  I would be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply want to say to my very dear \nfriend, I ask that I be associated with his remarks. It was a privilege \nto be on the floor at the time the Senator from Kansas delivered his \nremarks. In my 22 years in this great institution, the Senate, I have \nnever known a Member of Congress who tried harder to work on personal \nrelationships than my good friend from Kansas.\n  He is so respected in this institution, as he was in the House. To \nhave him stand in tribute to one of our mutual friends of long standing \nfor all of these years I have been in the Senate--I think maybe Herb's \n20 years versus my 22 years. Whatever it is, it is inconsequential. I \nworked with him.\n  I was so pleased to go down to visit his lovely wife and his \nchildren. I have seen his children grow, as the Senator from Kansas \nhas, and I was privileged to be at the service with the Senator and \nsome others from the Congress of the United States. What a fine, fine \nperson he was, and most deserving of the outpouring of heartfelt \nexpressions at that memorial service. I spoke to his widow not too long \nago. She is a woman of great strength, as are the children, and it will \ncarry on.\n  I would like to work with my colleague and other Members of the House \nand the Senate at the appropriate time--which I think will have to be \nnext year--to name something related to defense in honor of our most \nrecently departed colleague and friend.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman, my \nfriend and colleague, for his comments.\n  I wasn't planning on doing this. But I might just provide the \nchairman with a reflection. As he knows, we were in conference on the \nDefense authorization bill--the bill we are trying to get finished \nhere. It is so essential to our Nation and our national security. There \nwas not anybody in Congress who worked harder or who was more effective \nin regard to national security than our dear friend, Herb Bateman.\n\n  The Subcommittee on Emerging Threats on the Senate side, of which I \nam accorded the privilege of being the chairman, was meeting with \nseveral other subcommittee chairmen because the House does not follow \nsuit in terms of our organization or duties and we think the Emerging \nThreats Subcommittee, which was largely formed out of the leadership of \nthe distinguished chairman, encompasses so many different things that \nare so important to our national security. We were meeting in \nconference. The distinguished gentleman from the First District of \nVirginia came in, and he was a tad late. The only amendment we had that \nwas still outstanding was the Bateman amendment. I asked Herb if it was \na little late for his tee time. He laughed and said: No, not today but \ntomorrow.\n  I informed all those present that the Senate had strong feelings \nabout Mr. Bateman's amendment--very strong feelings--and, despite that, \nwe would accept the amendment under one reservation. Herb was a little \nconcerned because it was a very fine amendment. He looked at me and \nsaid: Well, Mr. Chairman, Pat, friends and colleagues from the House, \nwhat would that reservation be? I said: Only if we call your amendment \nthe ``Herb Bateman Common Sense Amendment.'' Obviously, it was agreed \nto and passed.\n  That was on a Thursday. We lost Herb over that weekend--something I \ncould not believe as I came to work on Monday. But as I reflect back on \nthat, it was probably his last amendment, and it was ``common sense,'' \nas he always stood for.\n  So from that standpoint, I think the distinguished chairman's \nsuggestion about what we do in the next Congress is most appropriate. I \nappreciate his contribution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say to my good friend, Herb and \nI played a game of golf, which he dearly loved. He had his priorities--\nhis family, his church, and work in Congress. He was the only man I \nplayed with, as others have, and whom I ever knew of, who could miss a \n2-foot putt and still walk off the green with a smile on his face. He \nalways said, well, tomorrow, or the next putt on the green, it will be \na better day. But that was the sort of wonderful, even-tempered, \nabsolutely beautiful man he was in terms of his character.\n  I thank my colleague. I have enjoyed these few moments. He loved the \nNavy. He loved everything connected with the sea and maritime. How many \ntimes we heard him give the speech: And I'm the Congressman from the \nFirst Congressional District.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, in a few short weeks, it will have been \ntwo years since the people of Ohio elected me to represent them in the \nUnited States Senate. One of the main reasons I wanted to serve in this \nbody was to have an opportunity to bring fiscal responsibility to the \nnation's capital and eliminate the gigantic debt burden that we have \nput on the backs of our children and grandchildren.\n  As my colleagues know, for decades, successive Congresses and \nPresidents spent money on things that, while important, they were \nunwilling to pay for, or, in the alternative, do without. In the \nprocess, Washington ran up staggering debt, and mortgaged our future.\n  Today, we have a $5.7 trillion national debt that is costing us $224 \nbillion in interest payments a year, and that translates into $600 \nmillion per day just to pay the interest.\n  Out of every federal dollar that is spent, 13 cents will go to pay \nthe interest on the national debt. Think of that. In comparison, 16 \ncents will go for national defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense \ndiscretionary spending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. \nRight now, we spend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we \ndo on the entire Medicare program.\n  As the end of the 106th Congress draws near, I look back with mixed \nfeelings at the actions that this Congress has made towards bringing \nour financial house in order. While we have made some strides in paying \ndown the national debt, there is a lot more that we could have done. \nFor example, we could have done a much better job of reining-in federal \nspending. Regretfully, we have done the opposite.\n  What many Americans don't realize is the fact that Congress increased \noverall non-defense domestic discretionary spending in fiscal year 2000 \nto $328 billion. That's a 9.3 percent boost over the previous fiscal \nyear, and the largest single-year increase in non-defense discretionary \nspending since 1980.\n  In an effort to bring spending under control, my friend, Senator \nAllard, and I offered an amendment this past June to direct $12 billion \nof the FY 2000 on-budget surplus dollars toward debt reduction. While \nthat amendment passed by a vote of 95-3, the victory did not last \nlong--all but $4 billion of that $12 billion was used for other \nspending in the Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report.\n  Nevertheless, we have had reason to celebrate some good news. Just \nlast year, many of us fought to ``lock box'' Social Security. In spite \nof the fact that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndefeated the bill, Congress did, though, for the first time in three \ndecades, not spend a dime of the Social Security surplus.\n  I have to say that I take great offense at the fact that the Vice \nPresident is out there taking credit for ``lock boxing'' Social \nSecurity and Medicare. My colleagues--and indeed the American people--\nshould be aware that, in fact, it was this administration--the Clinton-\nGore administration--that sent a veto threat to the Senate regarding \nthe Abraham/Domenici Social Security ``lock box'' amendment that we \nconsidered in April of 1999.\n  Here is the direct quote from that veto threat: ``. . . If the \nAbraham/Domenici amendment or similar legislation is passed by the \nCongress, the President's Senior Advisors will recommend to the \nPresident that he veto the bill.'' I would presume that the term \n``Senior Advisors'' would include the Vice President.\n  Although Congress has agreed by consensus not to use the Social \nSecurity surplus for more spending, Congress, still has not been able \nto pass ``lock box'' legislation. And because Congress has not passed a \n``lock box'' bill, I am fearful that if things get tight in the future, \nCongress will revert to its old ways.\n  Probably the best news from fiscal year 2000 is that despite spending \nroughly $20 billion of the on-budget surplus this past summer, Congress \ndid not touch the additional $60 billion on-budget surplus that CBO \nannounced in July. In other words, when fiscal year 2000 came to an end \non September 30th, that $60 billion on-budget surplus had not been \nspent nor used for tax cuts. Instead, it will go towards reducing the \nnational debt.\n  When on-budget surplus funds are used to lower the debt, it sends a \npositive signal to Wall Street and to Main Street that the federal \ngovernment is serious about fiscal discipline. It encourages more \nsavings and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and continued \neconomic growth.\n  All the experts say that paying down the debt is the best thing we \ncould do with our budget surpluses. Indeed, CBO Director Dan Crippen \nsaid earlier this year: ``most economists agree that saving the \nsurpluses and paying down the debt held by the public is probably the \nbest thing that we can do relative to the economy.''\n  I would like to say Mr. President, in the last month or so, I have \nhad the opportunity to meet with director Crippen in my office a couple \nof times, including, most recently, this morning. He said that the only \nway we were going to be able to deal with the wave of Social Security \nand Medicare benefits that we will have to pay when the ``baby \nboomers'' start to retire, is to reform Social Security and Medicare, \nand most important, we should undertake policies that encourage a \nrobust, growing economy. And as far as I'm concerned, paying down the \nnational debt is the best way that we can foster a robust growing \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, in today's Washington Post, columnist David Broder, \ntouched on this same theme in reporting about the need to exhibit \nfiscal responsibility. In case my colleagues have not read the article, \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. In addition, just yesterday, the Congressional Budget \nOffice released its report, entitled ``The Long-Term Budget Outlook.''\n  That report states that, ``projected growth in spending on the \nfederal government's big health and retirement programs--Medicare, \nMedicaid and Social Security--dominates the long-run budget outlook. If \ncurrent policies continue, spending is likely to grow significantly \nfaster than the economy as a whole over the next few decades. By 2040, \nCBO projects those outlays will rise to about 17 percent of gross \ndomestic product--more than double their current share.''\n  The report goes on to say, `` `saving' most or all of the budget \nsurpluses that CBO projects over the next 10 years--using them to pay \ndown debt--would have a positive impact on the projections and \nsubstantially delay the emergence of a serious fiscal imbalance.''\n  I believe that each of my colleagues should read this report because \nit might make them consider the consequences of all the spending that's \ngoing on in this body and help make the argument for more fiscal \nrestraint in these last days of the 106th Congress. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I encourage my colleagues to look up the CBO report, ``The \nLong-Term Budget Outlook,'' at the CBO website, www.cbo.gov.\n  Mr. President, I am a firm believer in the phrase, ``prepare for \ntomorrow, today,'' and I believe that anytime we have an opportunity to \nenhance our future economic position, we cannot squander that \nopportunity. That is why I am deeply disappointed that the Senate is \nnot going to consider the Debt Relief Lock-Box Reconciliation Act for \nFiscal Year 2001, H.R. 5173. This is a bill that passed in the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 381-3, and which would have taken 90 \npercent of the fiscal year 2001 surplus and used it strictly for debt \nreduction.\n  As my colleagues know, the Congressional Budget Office has projected \nthat in fiscal year 2001, the United States will have a surplus of $268 \nbillion, including an on-budget surplus of $102 billion.\n  Under H.R. 5173--or the ``90-10'' bill as it has been called--$240 \nbillion of the $268 billion projected surplus would go toward paying \ndown the national debt. By using such a substantial amount of the \nsurplus for debt reduction, Congress would be officially ``lock \nboxing''\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\nnot only the Social Security surplus, but the Medicare surplus as well. \nThus, some $198 billion--the amount CBO predicts--will be in surplus \nfor those two funds.\n  In addition to ``lock-boxing'' Social Security and Medicare, the \nlegislation would appropriate $42 billion of the fiscal year 2001 on-\nbudget surplus projection toward debt reduction.\n  The remaining 10 percent--or $28 billion--would be divided and used \nto cover whatever tax cuts or necessary and reasonable spending \nincreases that needed to be made.\n  Even though it is not perfect legislation, I support H.R. 5173, \nbecause in my view, it is the best chance for Congress this year to \nmake another significant payment on the national debt while keeping a \ntight lid on spending. Unfortunately, the ``90-10'' bill has never \nachieved the same kind of support here in the Senate as it did in the \nHouse, and therefore, the types of controls the bill would have put on \nspending will not be enacted in the Senate.\n  Instead, I fear that with the end of session ``rush to get out of \ntown,'' Congress and the President are engaged in a spending spree the \nlikes of which we haven't seen since LBJ's Great Society. While I am \nconcerned that the President wants additional spending, I am \nparticularly alarmed at the fact that many of my colleagues are trying \ntheir hardest to outspend the President. Under this scenario, it's no \nwonder H.R. 5173 never had a chance.\n  Although we have not yet passed all of the fiscal year 2001 \nappropriations bills, the amount that spending has increased in the \nbills that have been passed is quite disturbing: particularly when \ncompared to the Consumer Price Index, which is 2.7 percent.\n  For instance, the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water appropriations \nbill that was just vetoed spends 12 percent more than its FY 2000 \ncounterpart; the FY 2001 Interior appropriations bill represents a 26 \npercent increase; and the FY 2001 Transportation appropriations bill \nthat we passed last Friday increased its discretionary spending by \nabout 25 percent. So far, Congressional spending in fiscal year 2001 is \non-track to make the 9.3 percent fiscal year 2000 non-defense \ndiscretionary spending increase look like ``chump change.''\n  I would like to say to the citizens of Ohio that there are many good \nthings in those bills that I would have liked to support, but spending \nincreases of this kind are just outrageous.\n  What we should have been doing with these appropriations bills is \nprioritizing our spending and living within the budget resolution that \nwe passed in the beginning of the year. Maybe I should ask my \ncolleagues, if we are not going to live within the parameters of the \nbudget resolution, then why did we spend to much time on it?\n  If, when I was Governor, I had ever gone to the Ohio legislature and \ntold them I wanted to increase the budget by 25 or 26 percent, they \nwould have impeached me. The editorial writers would have said I had \ngone crazy, especially when my mantra when I came into office was, \n``gone are the days when public officials are measured by how much they \nspend on a problem. The new realities dictate that public officials are \nnow judged on whether they can work harder and smarter and do more with \nless.''\n  And Mr. President I hate to think what the voters would have done to \nme.\n  Many of my colleagues do not seem to consider that each separate \nappropriations bill adds-up. There is no sense of concern that one \nparticular appropriations bill increases its spending from FY 2000 by \n20 percent, because it's only $2 billion to $3 billion more than last \nyear. Or, some may say we need to spend an extra billion dollars or so \non this or that program because we have a huge surplus and we can \nafford it.\n  In a $1.7 trillion overall budget, I can see how someone may got \ncaught up in that logic.\n  However, in the words of Everett Dirksen:\n\n       A billion here, and a billion there, and pretty soon you're \n     talking about real money.\n\n  It is all real money--real taxpayer's money. Congress and the \nPresident have got to admit that we cannot fund everything that we \nwant. We have got to make hard choices with respect to spending if we \nare ever going to bring our debt under control.\n  The American people know that the spending Congress is engaged in \nright now must be accounted for somewhere, because they know there is \nno such thing as a free lunch. They know that ultimately they are the \nones paying for what I like to refer to as a Congressional ``feeding \nfrenzy.''\n  They want us to make the hard decisions and most of all, they want us \nto pay down the national debt. When I go home to Ohio my constituents \nsay to me: Senator, we want you to pay down the national debt.\n  On one other last note, Mr. President--if you take the 9.3 percent \nincrease in non-defense discretionary spending from fiscal year 1999 to \nfiscal year 2000, and the rate of increase projected in the fiscal year \n2001 budget, we are blowing a big hole in the CBO 10 year projected \nbudget surplus.\n  The 10 year CBO budget surplus is predicated on a 2.7 percent \nincrease in Federal spending over 10 years.\n  We must remember that the on-budget surplus also includes the \nMedicare surplus, and if we are ever successful at passing Medicare \n``lock box'' legislation, those funds will be off the table for \nspending. Consider also the Medicare giveback which we must have to \nstabilize this country's healthcare system which will also take part of \nthe 10 year budget surplus; a prescription drug benefit that everyone \nagrees we must implement which will also take part of the 10 year \nbudget surplus; we must spend more money to stabilize and improve our \nnational defense which will also take part of the 10 year budget \nsurplus.\n  If you add up all of the numbers, including appropriations bills that \nhave passed and those that are anticipated to pass and include the \nprojected $200 billion worth of tax reductions for the next 10 years, \nas well as the additional interest costs generated by Congress' \nspending and reducing taxes, then Congress will have reduced the 10 \nyear projected budget surplus by some $750 billion. Let's not let that \nhappen.\n  If Congress intends to spend money on implementing programs, we need \nto tighten our belts on our current spending and not squander our on-\nbudget surplus on the kinds of wasteful spending included in the \nvarious fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills. We cannot forget that we \nare facing a Social Security and Medicare funding crisis in the near \nfuture, and if we can't prioritize our spending now, we will not be \nable to keep these programs solvent at their current level of benefits. \nThe young people here who are pages will have that burden right on \ntheir backs.\n  That's why I believe the best course of action we can take is to use \nwhatever on-budget surplus we achieve to pay down the national debt.\n  For three decades, we borrowed from our children, mortgaging their \nfuture for our present. And now, when times are good and we have the \nmost ideal situation to set things right, we cannot continue down the \nsame flawed path as before. Have we learned nothing?\n  Our current economic situation is our second chance to pay our \nchildren what we owe and ensure fiscal solvency for future generations. \nWe have an obligation to our children--indeed, a moral obligation--to \npay down the national debt and rein-in our spending in order to give \nthem back their competitive edge. If we do not act now, I fear we will \nnot get another chance to do the right thing.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 2000]\n\n                     Heedless of the Deficits Ahead\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       On the morning after last week's vice presidential debate, \n     Charles O. Jones, the University of Wisconsin political \n     scientist and scholar of the presidency, remarked that the \n     nation had witnessed ``a great civic event,'' a civil, \n     substantive discussion of serious policy matters between two \n     highly competent public officials, Joe Lieberman and Dick \n     Cheney.\n       In fact, Jones said, ``we are having a good election, \n     something you don't often get in good times.'' Contrast the \n     contest being waged by Al Gore and George W. Bush, he went \n     on, with the last race conducted in a healthy economy and at \n     a time when no incumbent president was on the ballot.\n       That would be 1988, when the father of the current \n     Republican nominee squared off, as vice president, against \n     Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. If the winning campaign \n     of 1988 is remembered at all, the enduring images are the \n     flag factories the elder George Bush visited in an implicit \n     challenge to Dukakis's patriotism and the Willie Horton ads \n     his supporters aired. And the hapless Democratic effort was \n     symbolized by\n\n[[Page S10266]]\n\n     Dukakis's tank ride and his lame, emotionless answer to \n     Bernard Shaw's question about how he would respond if someone \n     raped and murdered Kitty Dukakis.\n       We've come a long way from that, with the four nominees for \n     president and vice president arguing about such genuinely \n     important topics as defense, education, Social Security and \n     health care.\n       But before we get too giddy in celebrating our good \n     fortune, let it be noted that historians are almost certain \n     to remark on the purposeful myopia of the candidates in this \n     first election of the new millennium, their deliberate \n     refusal to acknowledge and discuss one of the biggest \n     realities of our national life: The glorious federal budget \n     surpluses they are happily parceling out for their favorite \n     programs and tax cuts are a short-term phenomenon, soon to be \n     followed by crippling deficits, unless we make some hard \n     choices in the next few years.\n       In this respect, the 2000 campaign is reminiscent of 1988--\n     but worse. In that year, Dukakis and the elder Bush avoided \n     discussing the savings and that year, Dukakis and the elder \n     Bush avoided discussing the savings and loan crisis both \n     of them knew was around the corner. The reason: There were \n     no easy answers, just bad news and an expensive bailout in \n     store.\n       What we now confront is much, much bigger than the savings \n     and loan bailout. Its dimensions were outlined last week in a \n     report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO)--a report that did not make the front page of any of \n     the papers I read and that was ignored by most of the TV news \n     shows.\n       Here's what it said: Assuming that the new president uses \n     the expected surplus in Social Security of $2.4 trillion over \n     the next 10 years to pay down the national debt, as Gore and \n     Bush say they will do, the government may be able to balance \n     its books until about 2020.\n       But then the retirement and health care costs of the huge \n     baby boom generation and the shrinkage in the number of \n     Americans working and paying taxes will once again create a \n     serious imbalance--and push us back into debt.\n       In the estimate of the CBO, ``If the nation's leaders do \n     not change current policies to eliminate that imbalance, \n     federal deficits are likely to reappear and eventually drive \n     federal debt to unsustainable levels.'' A chart accompanying \n     the report shows the public debt in 2040 rising to 60 percent \n     of the estimated size of that year's economy--creating a \n     burden on the next generation of Americans half again as \n     large as the accumulated debt of the past is on us.\n       As The Post's Glenn Kessler noted in his news story, ``The \n     report underscores how campaign rhetoric has become \n     increasingly separated from the budget reality that will face \n     the next president.'' While Bush pushes his trillion-dollar \n     tax cut and tries to keep up with Gore's promises of new \n     prescription drug benefits, 100,000 teachers and 50,000 cops, \n     neither one is preparing the public for the steps that are \n     needed to rein in runaway health care costs--the largest \n     single force driving us back into deficits.\n       By 2040, according to the best available data, the \n     percentage of Americans over 65 will rise from 13 percent to \n     almost 21 percent. The share of working-age Americans, \n     between 20 and 64, will decline by 3 points of slightly over \n     55 percent. The ratio of workers to retirees will drop from \n     almost 5 to 1 down to less than 3 to 1. Unless we begin now \n     to reorganize our dysfunctional health care system and take \n     steps to rationalize provisions for retirement income, the \n     demographic wave will sink us.\n       Someone has to force the candidates to confront that \n     reality.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this year the Joint \nCongressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies held an organizational \nmeeting to officially begin preparations for the next Presidential \nInauguration hosted by Congress to be held on Saturday, January 20, \n2001.\n  Next year marks more historic milestones as it will be the 200th \nanniversary of the first Presidential Inauguration in our Nation's \nCapital, the first Presidential Inauguration of the 21st Century, and, \nnot least of all, the first inauguration of the new millennium. 2001 \nalso marks the 100th birthday of the Joint Congressional Committee on \nInaugural Ceremonies, an entity which I am greatly honored to serve as \nChairman.\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\n  As we approach adjournment for this Congress, let us look forward \nwith great anticipation and excitement to our Nation's 54th \nPresidential Inauguration and celebrate this remarkable American \ntradition in which the peaceful transference of power takes place with \nall our citizens as witnesses.\n  In 1789, our Nation's Father and first President, George Washington, \nrecited the oath of office on the Balcony of Federal Hall in New York \nCity. By 1801, the seat of the U.S. Government had moved from New York \nCity, to Philadelphia, and finally to Washington, D.C.\n  On March 4, 1801, Thomas Jefferson became the first President to be \ninaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., in a room now \nknown as the ``Old Supreme Court Chamber.'' In 1829, Andrew Jackson \nbecame the first President to be inaugurated on the East Front of the \nCapitol, where the majority of swearing-in ceremonies continued to take \nplace until the late twentieth century. It was not until President \nRonald Reagan's inauguration on January 20, 1981, that the swearing-in \nceremony moved to the West Front of the Capitol where larger crowds \ncould be accommodated. Though below-freezing temperatures in 1985 \nforced the second Reagan inaugural ceremony inside to the Capitol \nRotunda, the West Front set the standard for the next three \nCongressionally hosted ceremonies. The 2001 Presidential inaugural \nceremonies will continue that tradition.\n  It is interesting to note that until 1901 the Presidential inaugural \nceremonies were planned and conducted solely by the Senate. A century \nlater, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies brings \ntogether the Senate and the House of Representatives in welcoming \nAmerica's President-elect to the Capitol for the public swearing-in \nceremony.\n  Upon undertaking this endeavor, it became apparent that steps needed \nto be taken to direct that the important historic materials generated \nby the JCCIC were preserved. For a committee reconstituted every four \nyears, these documents are critical tools for conducting this massive \nquadrennial event. To ensure these materials are preserved in an \nappropriate manner, I am introducing a resolution to establish the \nprocedures for archiving the records of the Joint Congressional \nCommittee on Inaugural Ceremonies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a press release which \ndocuments the May 24 organizational meeting of the Joint Congressional \nCommittee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the text of Senate Concurrent \nResolutions 89 and 90 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nU.S. Senator Mitch McConnell Named Chairman of the Joint Congressional \n                   Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies\n\n       Washington, DC.--U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), \n     Chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, \n     today was appointed Chairman of the Joint Congressional \n     Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.\n       Joining McConnell on the committee are Majority Leader \n     Trent Lott (R-MS), Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Speaker \n     of the House J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), House Majority Leader \n     Richard Armey (R-TX) and House Minority Leader Richard \n     Gephardt (D-MO).\n       The members met today and appointed McConnell as the \n     Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee, approved the \n     committee's budget and selected the West Front of the Capitol \n     for the location of the ceremony. McConnell is the third \n     Kentuckian to Chair the Congressional Committee since it was \n     formed in 1901.\n       ``I am truly honored to have been selected as Chairman of \n     this Congressional Inaugural Committee,'' said McConnell. ``I \n     look forward to the extraordinary privilege of planning the \n     first Presidential Inauguration of the 21st century.''\n       The JCCIC is charged with the planning and execution of the \n     Inaugural activities at the Capitol: the swearing-in ceremony \n     and the traditional luncheon which follows.\n       The Presidential Inauguration will be held Saturday, \n     January 20, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 131\n\n       Whereas, in July and August of 1980, Polish workers went on \n     strike to protest communist oppression and demand greater \n     political freedom;\n       Whereas, in the shipyards of Gdansk and Szczecin, workers' \n     committees coordinated these strikes and ensured that the \n     strikes were peaceful and orderly and did not promote acts of \n     violence;\n       Whereas workers' protests against the communist authorities \n     in Poland were supported by the Polish people and the \n     international community of democracies;\n       Whereas, on August 30 and 31 of 1980, the communist \n     government of the People's Republic of Poland yielded to the \n     21 demands of the striking workers, including the release of \n     all political prisoners, including Jacek Kuron and Adam \n     Michnik, the broadcasting\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\n     of religious services on television and radio, and the right \n     to establish independent trade unions;\n       Whereas from these agreements emerged Solidarnosc, the \n     first independent trade union in the communist bloc, led by \n     Lech Walesa, an electrician from Gdansk;\n       Whereas Solidarnosc and its 10,000,000 members became a \n     great social movement in Poland that was committed to \n     promoting fundamental human rights, democracy, and Polish \n     independence;\n       Whereas, during its first congress in 1981, Solidarnosc \n     issued a proclamation urging workers in Soviet-bloc countries \n     to resist their communist governments and to struggle for \n     freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas the communist government of Poland introduced \n     martial law in December 1981 in an attempt to block the \n     growing political and social influence of the Solidarnosc \n     movement;\n       Whereas Solidarnosc remained a powerful and political force \n     that resisted the efforts of Poland's communist government to \n     suppress the desire of the Polish people for freedom, \n     democracy, and independence from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in February [1999] 1989, the communist government \n     of Poland agreed to conduct roundtable talks with Solidarnosc \n     that led to elections to the National Assembly in June of \n     that year, in which nearly all open seats were won by \n     candidates supported by Solidarnosc;\n       Whereas, on August 19, [1999] 1989, Solidarity leader \n     Tadeusz Mazowiecki was asked to serve as Prime Minister of \n     Poland and on September 12, [1999] 1989, the Polish Sejm \n     voted to approve Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet, \n     Poland's first noncommunist government in 4 decades;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1990, Lech Walesa was elected \n     President of Poland;\n       Whereas the Solidarnosc movement, by its courage and \n     example, initiated political transformations in other \n     countries in Central and Eastern Europe and thereby initiated \n     the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1989; and\n       Whereas, since the time Poland freed itself from communist \n     domination, Polish-American relations have transformed from \n     partnership to alliance, a transition marked by Poland's \n     historic accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     in March 1999: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the workers' \n     strikes in Poland that [lead] led to the creation of the \n     independent trade union Solidarnosc; and\n       (2) honors the leaders of Poland who risked and lost their \n     lives in attempting to restore democracy in their country and \n     to return Poland to the democratic community of nations.\n       Amend the title to read as follows: ``Concurrent resolution \n     commemorating the 20th anniversary of the workers' strikes in \n     Poland that led to the creation of the independent trade \n     union Solidarnosc, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Santo Domingo Pueblo Claims \n     Settlement Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) For many years the Pueblo of Santo Domingo has been \n     asserting claims to lands within its aboriginal use area in \n     north central New Mexico. These claims have been the subject \n     of many lawsuits, and a number of these claims remain \n     unresolved.\n       (2) In December 1927, the Pueblo Lands Board, acting \n     pursuant to the Pueblo Lands Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 636) \n     confirmed a survey of the boundaries of the Pueblo of Santo \n     Domingo Grant. However, at the same time the Board purported \n     to extinguish Indian title to approximately 27,000 acres of \n     lands within those grant boundaries which lay within 3 other \n     overlapping Spanish land grants. The United States Court of \n     Appeals in United States v. Thompson (941 F.2d 1074 (10th \n     Cir. 1991), cert. denied 503 U.S. 984 (1992)), held that the \n     Board ``ignored an express congressional directive'' in \n     section 14 of the Pueblo Lands Act, which ``contemplated that \n     the Pueblo would retain title to and possession of all \n     overlap land''.\n       (3) The Pueblo of Santo Domingo has asserted a claim to \n     another 25,000 acres of land\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\n     based on the Pueblo's purchase in 1748 of the Diego Gallegos \n     Grant. The Pueblo possesses the original deed reflecting the \n     purchase under Spanish law but, after the United States \n     assumed sovereignty over New Mexico, no action was taken to \n     confirm the Pueblo's title to these lands. Later, many of \n     these lands were treated as public domain, and are held today \n     by Federal agencies, the State Land Commission, other Indian \n     tribes, and private parties. The Pueblo's lawsuit asserting \n     this claim, Pueblo of Santo Domingo v.

Mr. President, I understand that S. 3187 is at the desk, \nand I ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3187) to require the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to apply aggregate upper payment limits to \n     non-State publicly owned or operated facilities under the \n     medicaid program.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now ask for its second reading and \nobject to my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, over the past several months, the Finance \nCommittee has been focusing its oversight attention on an urgent \nproblem in the Medicaid program related to the use of upper payment \nlimits to exploit federal Medicaid spending. The Health Care Financing \nAdministration, HCFA, had assured me that it would solve the problem. \nIt has not.\n  Instead, last week HCFA released a notice of proposed rulemaking that \nsanctions the de facto abuse of this vitally important program--a \nprogram that provides health care coverage to 40 million low-income \npregnant women, children, individuals with disabilities, and senior \ncitizens. This Administration has failed to live up to its \nresponsibility to protect the financial integrity of the Medicaid \nprogram. Accordingly, I am introducing legislation today to do the \nright thing and stop the draining of potentially tens of billions of \ndollars from this program for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The problem confronting the program is a complicated one. Through the \ninappropriate use of aggregated upper payment limits, some states have \nbeen using the Medicaid program inappropriately, including for purposes \nsuch as filling in holes in state budgets. This has turned a program \nintended to provide health insurance coverage to vulnerable populations \ninto a bank account for state projects having nothing to do with health \ncare.\n  In fact, as I examine the current situation I am vividly reminded of \nthe Medicaid spending scandals we confronted 10 years ago when \ndisproportionate share hospital program dollars were used to build \nroads, bridges and highways. Let me be very clear--this cannot be \npermitted to continue without endangering the program.\n  The use of this complicated accounting mechanism may seem dry and \ntechnical--but let me assure you that the consequences are enormous. If \nunchecked, both the General Accounting Office and the Office of \nInspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services agree \nthat we face a situation that fundamentally undermines the fiscal \nintegrity of the Medicaid program and circumvents the traditional \npartnership of financial responsibility shared between the federal and \nstate governments.\n  I have been advised that what states are doing through upper payment \nlimits is technically not illegal. The states are taking advantage of a \nloophole in HCFA regulations. It is time to close that loophole fully.\n  We must act because nearly 40 million of the neediest Americans rely \non Medicaid for needed health care services. It is nothing short of a \nsafety net. The program must not be undermined and weakened by clever \nconsultants and state budgeters. What looks like loopholes to some are \nholes in Medicaid safety net for 40 million Americans.\n  Several months ago, I began working with the Administration to \nrespond to this scandal. We must stop it in its tracks--while of course \nat the same time working thoughtfully and carefully with those states \nthat have become dependent on the revenues generated through the use of \nupper payment limits to help them transition to\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\na more sustainable payment relationship between the state and federal \ngovernment.\n  Finally, last week, after repeated delays, this Administration \nreleased its notice of proposed rulemaking--in a form much weaker than \nit originally intended when I first started working with HCFA on this \nproblem last spring. The proposed regulation is inadequate. Instead of \nstopping a burgeoning Medicaid spending scandal, the proposed \nregulation looks the other way and tolerates the abuse of the program.\n  The proposed regulation permits facilities to be reimbursed for \nproviding services at a rate one and a half times that Medicare would \nhave paid for a given service. Then states are free to pocket the \ndifference between the payment level and the often much lower Medicaid \npayment rates through intergovernmental transfers. Not only does the \nregulation allow those who are exploiting the program to continue to do \nso, it also invites all others to come in and help themselves. The \nregulation permits the scam to continue while only modestly attempting \nto contain its magnitude.\n  Simply containing wasteful spending is not sufficient. The American \ntaxpayer who pays the bills should not stand for it, nor should the \nbeneficiaries who depend on the program. In fact, the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities, whose advocacy on social policy issues is well-\nknown, agrees that the scam must be shut down or the long-term health \nof the program will be jeopardized.\n  Not only does the proposed regulation fail to protect the financial \nintegrity of the Medicaid program, it also has a very low probability \nof ever being implemented. There is virtually no chance this \nAdministration will be able to finalize the proposed regulation before \nit leaves office in January. Until the regulation is finalized, nothing \nchanges. No abuser state has to modify its behavior one bit, and more \nand more states will be under pressure to take advantage of the \nwindfall their neighbor states are enjoying. If anything, the White \nHouse action may spur greater abuse in the Medicaid program.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that truly solving the \nproblem will save taxpayers $127 billion over the next decade. the \nstakes are high and we owe it to the 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries \nto protect the program so it remains strong and viable for the years to \ncome.\n  Accordingly, today I am introducing legislation that does what HCFA \nshould have done but failed to do. My bill does not sanction abuse--it \nstops it. It closes the loophole, and treats non-state governmental \nfacilities the same way state facilities are already treated. For those \nstates with upper payment limits approved by HCFA already in place, it \ngives them two years to fully transition into compliance with the law. \nBut no longer will schemes to exploit federal funding be tolerated. \nEven if HCFA is willing to look the other way, I am not. We must think \nabout the long-term interests of the program and act now to stop the \nabuse. We should save the safety net for those that depend on it and \nsave $127 billion over the next decade for he American taxpayer at the \nsame time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10271-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3244\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

McKinney Homeless \n     Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411).\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Before entering into an agreement under \n     section 3, the Administrator of General Services shall \n     transmit to the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on [Environment and Public Works] Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate a report on the proposed agreement.\n       (b) Contents.--A report transmitted under this section \n     shall include a summary of a cost-benefit analysis of the \n     proposed agreement and a description of the provisions of the \n     proposed agreement.\n       (c) Review by Congress.--A proposed agreement under section \n     3 may not become effective until the end of a 30-day period \n     of continuous session of Congress following the date of the \n     transmittal of a report on the agreement under this section. \n     For purposes of the preceding sentence, continuity of a \n     session of Congress is broken only by an adjournment sine \n     die, and there shall be excluded from the computation of such \n     30-day period any day during which either House of Congress \n     is not in session during an adjournment of more than 3 days \n     to a day certain.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 366) expressing the Sense of the \n     Senate on the certification of Mexico.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Res. 366\n\n       Whereas Mexico will inaugurate a new government on 1 \n     December 2000 that will be the first change of authority from \n     one party to another;\n       Whereas the 2nd July election of Vincente Fox Quesada of \n     the Alliance for Change marks an historic transition of power \n     in open and fair elections;\n       Whereas Mexico and the United States share a 2,000-mile \n     border, Mexico is the United States' second largest trading \n     partner, and the two countries share historic and cultural \n     ties;\n       Whereas drug production and trafficking are a threat to the \n     national interests and the well-being of the citizens of both \n     countries; and\n       Whereas United States-Mexican cooperation on drugs is a \n     cornerstone for policy for both countries in developing \n     effective programs to stop drug use, drug production, and \n     drug trafficking: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That (a) the Senate, on behalf of the people of \n     the United States--\n       (1) welcomes the constitutional transition of power in \n     Mexico;\n       (2) congratulates the people of Mexico and their elected \n     representatives for this historic change; and\n       (3) expresses its intent to continue to work cooperatively \n     with Mexican authorities to promote broad and effective \n     efforts for the health and welfare of United States and \n     Mexican citizens endangered by international drug \n     trafficking, use, and production.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the incoming new governments in both Mexico and the \n     United States must develop and implement a counterdrug \n     program that more effectively addresses the official \n     corruption, the increase in drug traffic, and the lawlessness \n     that has resulted from illegal drug trafficking, and that a \n     one-year waiver of the requirement that the President certify \n     Mexico is warranted to permit both new governments time to do \n     so.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before entering the closing statement, I \nyield to the distinguished Democratic assistant leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was off the floor. I appreciate very much \nthe patience of my friend, the Senator from Virginia. I know he wanted \nto vacate the premises more than an hour ago. I am confident early in \nthe morning we will be able to enter into an agreement relating to his \nbill.\n  Mr. WARNER. That would be the DOD conference on authorization.\n  Mr. REID. We are getting close to that. I apologize for not being \nable to do that tonight.\n  Mr. WARNER. No apology is needed. This bill has had a unique course \nthrough the Senate. I know of no one who has tried harder on a \nprocedural basis to see that this bill has forward momentum than our \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada. I hereby express my profound \nrespect and thanks to him.\n  Mr. REID. I already bragged earlier in the day about my colleague and \nSenator Levin, and I would like that spread across the Record again.\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain is on his way. We have a unanimous \nconsent agreement that he asked for earlier in the day. We are now able \nto clear it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, given that, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5164, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5164) to amend title 49, United States Code, \n     to require reports concerning defects in motor vehicles or \n     tires or other motor vehicle equipment in foreign countries, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That the Senate proceed to H.R. 5164.\n  Mr. REID. Is this the same request the Senator entered earlier today?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, as I said to my friend--and \nhe was so persuasive--I indicated that we have to be patient and I \nthought his patience would require more than an hour or so. But as a \nresult of our work on this side, we were able to get the agreement \ncleared, and we have no objection to this matter proceeding tonight, as \nindicated in the earlier consent agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  May I just say that one thing I have learned about my friend from \nNevada is that when he gives his word on an issue, he pursues that in a \nsincere and dedicated fashion. When he gives his word that he is going \nto oppose, as he has on several occasions, he is a formidable opponent. \nI thank the Senator from Nevada for working on this. He could have \neasily held this over until tomorrow and we could have gotten caught \nup, perhaps, in other issues. Instead, the Senator from Nevada said he \nwould be working on this issue. He did that, and we have it resolved. I \nexpress my deep and sincere thanks to him.\n  I look forward to next year when we again have our differences on the \nissue of college gambling being ventilated and work together on that \nissue as well.\n  Mr. REID. Also, we can work together to do more on boxing. If there \nwere ever a requirement that we have spread before us, it would be to \ndo something about the abysmal state of boxing in the world, which is \ncontrolled by the United States.\n  Also, the work the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nWisconsin have done on campaign finance reform--when the history books \nare written about what has happened in Government during the past \nhundred years, there is no question in my mind that one of the main \nchapters will be the work that has been done on campaign finance \nreform. It will happen, and it was instigated and initiated by the \nSenator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin. It is only a \nquestion of when; it will happen.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  I should not be speaking off the top of my head, but perhaps a \nhearing out in the city of Las Vegas, where really 90 percent of the \nmajor boxing is conducted in America, might be something he and I could \ndo together in the next couple of months to get the ball rolling. I \nthank my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last week I was blocked in my efforts to \ngain unanimous consent for the Senate to schedule a time for \nconsideration of S. 3059, the Motor Vehicle and Motor Vehicle Equipment \nDefect Notification Act. As you know, the Act is in response to the \nrecent Ford/Firestone recall of 6.5 million tires and the more than 100 \ndeaths associated with these tires.\n  Today, we are in the midst of what may likely be the last week of \nthis legislative session. The remaining days to enact legislation to \nremedy indisputable flaws in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act are \ndwindling to a precious few.\n  When we began this process more than six weeks ago, I made a \ncommitment to seek the enactment of legislation this year to remedy \nthis problem. I also stated that we would not make the perfect the \nenemy of the good. Last night, the House passed by voice vote H.R. \n5164, the Transportation Recall Enhancement Accountability and \nDocumentation (TREAD) Act. The legislation is similar to S. 3059 and \nhas the support of both Republicans and Democrats in the House.\n  While the House bill does not go as far as the Senate bill in some \nrespects, it will nevertheless advance the cause of safety. It will \nensure that the Department of Transportation will receive the \ninformation it needs to detect defects, including information about \nforeign recalls. It will increase penalties for manufacturers that fail \nto comply with the statute and its regulations. The maximum civil \npenalty under the current statute is $980,000. The House bill will \nincrease that amount to $15 million. It will also direct the Secretary \nto develop a program to conduct dynamic rollover tests of motor \nvehicles and make that information available to consumers. It will \ndirect NHTSA to upgrade the current tire standard for the first time in \n30 years. Finally, the House bill incorporates a measure sponsored by \nSenator Fitzgerald and recently reported by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, which will improve the design of child safety seats.\n  Many of the provisions in the House bill are an improvement upon \ncurrent law. The House bill is supported by the Secretary of \nTransportation. Nevertheless, let me be clear, I would prefer to have \nthe Senate complete action on the bill reported by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee with unanimous support. But holds and stalling tactics used \nby some members of this body will prevent us from even considering the \nSenate measure. The reality we face in the remaining days of Congress \nbecause of these tactics is that we pass the House bill or we pass \nnothing. Left with that decision, I would prefer we move forward with \nthe House bill.\n  Some people have raised concerns that the House bill would weaken \ncurrent law in several respects and it would be better to do nothing. \nSpecifically, concerns have been raised that the bill would inhibit the \nrelease of information collected by Department of Transportation to the \npublic, that manufacturers could destroy information to avoid the \nreporting requirements, and that the safe harbor provisions for the \nenhanced penalties could apply to existing penalties. I strongly \ndisagree with these assertions. More importantly, the supporters of the \nHouse bill both Democratic and Republicans disagree with those \nassertions as does the Department of Transportation which will be \ncharged with carrying out the provisions of the Act.\n\n  House supporters of the bill such as Congressmen Markey and Tauzin \naddressed some of these concerns in a colloquy upon final passage of \nthe House bill last night. I ask unanimous consent that the entire \ncolloquy from the House bill be included in the Record following my \nremarks. Two portions of the colloquy refute these assertions. First, \nMr. Markey asks if the ``special disclosure provision for new early \nstage information is not intended to protect from disclosure \n[information] that is currently disclosed under existing law such as \ninformation about actual defects or recalls?'' Congressman Tauzin \nresponds by saying, ``the gentleman is correct.'' Second, Congressman \nMarkey asks if it is in the ``Secretary's discretion to require a \nmanufacturer to maintain records that are in fact in the manufacturer's \npossession and that it would be a violation of such a requirement to \ndestroy such a record?'' Again, Congressman Tauzin responds ``the \ngentleman is correct.''\n  Congressman Tauzin wrote to me today to further clarify that this \nprovision would not enable manufacturers to destroy or conceal \ninformation.\n  In explaining the safe harbor provision under the enhanced penalty \nsection, the intent of the House sponsors is not necessary because it \nis clear on the face of the language that it would not apply to an \nunderlying violation of existing criminal law. The language of Section \n4(b)(2) clearly states that the safe harbor only applies to criminal \npenalties ``under this subsection.'' I am not a supporter of the safe \nharbor provisions under this bill. I believe that they create a \nloophole rendering the enhanced penalties meaningless, but it is clear \nthat they do not weaken existing law.\n  As I said earlier, NHTSA has linked more than 100 deaths to the \nfailure of Bridgestone/Firestone tires that are subject to the current \nrecall. Each day\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\nit becomes more apparent that these deaths may have been avoided had \nthe Department of Transportation possessed vital safety-related \ninformation that the law does not currently require manufacturers to \nreport.\n  The House bill falls short of the Senate bill, but it will improve \nthe Department of Transportation's ability to detect defects earlier. \nAs Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, I commit to revisiting \nthis issue next Congress and resolve the issues left in the House bill. \nBut it would be a serious mistake to prevent even this modest reform to \ngo forward. I ask my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 5164.\n  The bill (H.R. 5164) was passed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we went through a great deal of work in \norder to have the legislation passed concerning Bridgestone/Firestone. \nI thank the administration and Secretary Slater for all of his efforts.\n  I thank Senator Hollings, who had strongly held views on this issue \nand yet came together with me and others.\n  I thank the Consumers Union for what they did. They are an advocacy \ngroup that, again, didn't see a perfect piece of legislation but \nsupported this legislation. Mr. Kimmelman is a man of remarkable \ntalents. I thank him.\n  I also want to thank Congressman Upton and Congressman Tauzin, who \nwere able to get that legislation through the House of Representatives \nin this late period by a voice vote and thereby made it possible for \nthis legislation to be passed. They are both remarkable legislators. I \nappreciate very much all they did.\n  I say to my colleagues again that this issue isn't over. Tragically, \nI am in fear that there will be more deaths and injuries on America's \nhighways before we finally make it much safer for Americans to be on \nAmerica's highways. I think we have taken a major step forward, and one \nthat hopefully will save lives and prevent injuries. If that is the \ncase, as I think most experts view this legislation, then I think we \nwill have done something good today.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your patience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/11/senate-section/article/S10274-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
