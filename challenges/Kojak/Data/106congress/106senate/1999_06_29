Mr. President, I have sought this recognition to \ncompliment Rabbi Sherer, who has just delivered the Senate prayer.\n  We are recognizing the outstanding work of Rabbi Sherer's father, \nalso Rabbi Sherer, who died a little more than a year ago. Present \ntoday in the Senate gallery are some 200 representatives of a national \nconvocation to recognize the outstanding work of the departed Rabbi \nSherer.\n  I must say that Rabbi Sherer's comments this morning about freedom of \nreligion and the impact on everyone in America, but with special \nreference to Jewish Americans, is of great significance to me because \nboth of my parents came from foreign lands to the United States and \nwere pleased and honored to pledge their allegiance to the United \nStates of America.\n  My father left a shtetl, a small community, Batchkurina, in Ukraine, \nto come to the United States in 1911 at the age of 18, barely a ruble \nin his pocket, literally walked across Europe, took steerage in the \nbottom of a boat to come to America to seek his fortune, as did my \nmother who came with her parents when she was 5 years old in 1905 from \na small town on the Russian-Polish border. They settled in America. \nThey raised their family in America. My father fought in the American \nExpeditionary Force to help make the\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\nworld safe for democracy and, in his allegiance to his new-found \ncountry, rose to the rank of buck private. Next to his family, the \ngreatest honor he had was serving in the U.S. Army.\n  Freedom of religion is fundamental Americana, and the Rabbi's prayer \ntoday brings it home to us. And I wanted to express my own views of \nthanks for this country, what it has done for my parents and what it \nhas done for my brother, two sisters and me, and my sons and our \ngranddaughters.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank Senator Moynihan, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nNew York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Ashcroft would like to \nspeak at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for accommodating me \nfrom the time reserved for his control.\n  I am glad for the opportunity to stand in the Senate today to honor \nRabbi Morris Sherer, who passed away on May 17 last year. Today, I \nbelieve the very best way to pay tribute to Rabbi Sherer's memory is to \ncelebrate his inspiring accomplishments.\n  When Rabbi Sherer became the executive vice president of Agudath \nIsrael in America in 1941, the organization was but a small group with \nbut a few members. Rabbi Sherer transformed Agudath Israel from the \nsmall organization that it was in 1941 to a respected and influential \nforce in the culture and community we call America in both our \npolitical and religious life.\n  Rabbi Sherer's success came primarily from two strong leadership \ncharacteristics or character traits for which he was most respected. \nOne was that he was not one just to talk about something. He would do \nsomething. He was an activist. Second, he knew getting something done \nrequired more than just activism or motivation or inspiration. It \nrequired persistence. He could stay with a task until there was an \nachievement.\n  One often cited example of Rabbi Sherer's activism occurred almost \nimmediately after he became a part of the leadership of Agudath Israel. \nDuring Hitler's reign of terror, when all too many here and around the \nworld remained silent about the unspeakable atrocities committed \nagainst the Jews in Eastern Europe, Rabbi Sherer spoke and insisted \nthat action was necessary.\n  While Rabbi Sherer attempted to get others involved in his efforts, \nhe always understood that he must take the initiative and lead, and \nwhether others would be involved or not was not the criterion for his \nown involvement. He knew that real leadership required the ability and \nwillingness to stand alone. He knew he could not simply wait for \nsomeone else to do what he believed should be done.\n  With his still tiny organization, he sent shipments of food to Jews \nsuffering under the terrible injustices of Hitler's regime, and he \nhelped many to escape to gain refuge here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n  Not only was Rabbi Sherer a man of action, but he was a man of \npersistence. He followed through. When the war ended, he didn't forget \nabout the brothers and sisters who still remained in the ruins of \nEurope. Under his leadership, Agudath Israel shipped food and religious \narticles to Jews in displaced persons camps and he helped those who \nwanted to emigrate.\n  Rabbi Sherer's story, as we all know, continues in this same line and \nhis philosophy of activism and persistence guided Agudath Israel in \nAmerica for decades. He fought on behalf of Jews endangered behind the \nIron Curtain, those who were endangered in Syria, Iran, and anywhere in \nthe world where he saw that injustice was an imposition upon the \nliberties of individuals and discrimination that deprived individuals \nof their opportunity to reach the potential that God placed within.\n  He brought this attitude with him as he ascended to the presidency of \nAgudath Israel of America in 1963 and to the chairmanship of Agudath \nIsrael World Organization in 1980.\n  In all of these roles, Rabbi Sherer demonstrated the unique talent, \nunique character that provided him with the capacity to unite people \nfrom disparate backgrounds and interests. While this was partially a \nresult of his contagious warm personality and charisma, there was \nsomething deeper, too. People knew him as a man of integrity. This was \nrare ore, precious metal to be mined out of the character of this great \nleader. Though they might have disagreed adamantly with his views, they \nhad to respect the purity of his position, his sincerity and his \nhonesty.\n  This loyalty and integrity often placed him at odds with or at other \ntimes in alliances with unlikely groups. This, however, was Rabbi \nSherer's great charm. This is why he was so highly respected. He was \nloyal and passionate about ideas and truth, never letting political \nmaneuvering get in the way of his ultimate mission.\n  I am pleased to be on the Senate floor to honor Rabbi Sherer's \nmemory. He taught us that in the face of injustice we must act; in the \nface of failure, we must persist.\n  When the battle is over, he taught us there is still a war to fight: \nto continue to bind up those who had been injured, those who had been \nseparated, and those who had suffered.\n  Finally, he taught us that there is a way to achieve success and \nultimately respect. It is not by trying to appease all sides but by \nstanding firm in one's convictions and holding fast to one's beliefs.\n  That is the legacy of Rabbi Moshe Sherer. That is what he passed on \nto Agudath Israel and to all here today who respect his wondrous \naccomplishment and his faith.\n  I am delighted and personally privileged to have the opportunity from \nthis podium, in this body, to extend my condolences again to Rabbi \nSherer's wife, children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren, and to \nrecommend his stature, his principle, his integrity, his persistence, \nand his activism as models to all Americans.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for according me this time and this \nprivilege.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, we thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis moving, eloquent tribute.\n  I yield such time as he may require to my eminent friend, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend and colleague from New York. I thank \nSenator Lott for agreeing to set aside this time this morning to honor \nthe memory of Rabbi Moshe Sherer. I thank Senator Moynihan for \nproviding the dignity that is always his but the intimacy that reflects \nthe relationship he had with Rabbi Moshe Sherer. I thank my friend and \ncollege classmate from Missouri who just spoke so impressively about \nthis extraordinary man.\n  I am honored to have known Rabbi Moshe Sherer, a blessed memory. I \nmet him after I became a Senator and benefited, as anyone did, from the \nopportunity to be in his presence, from his wisdom, insights--insights \nnot just on matters of faith but on matters of the broader community.\n  This was a man of extraordinary personal dignity and discipline, of \nhard work and of very good humor. He was a pleasure to be with.\n  The life we celebrate today was a most extraordinary and \nconsequential life, based on values that go back thousands of years, \nmotivated by a single overriding towering motivation to honor God's \nname, to perform acts of Kiddish Hashem, the sanctification of God's \nname. That is to say, to do good works, to be true to the values that \nare set down in the Bible, in the Ten Commandments, in the broadly held \nethical system that we call the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n  Rabbi Moshe Sherer did that, magnificently rising to become, as we \nend this century, clearly one of the great leaders of the Orthodox \nJewish community in America in this century, one of the great leaders \nof any faith-based community in America during this century.\n  Those who have spoken before me have spoken of the extraordinary \nrecord of service and growth that Rabbi Sherer gave. I spoke to him \nseveral times about his involvement in 1943 when he was asked to take a \nposition at this organization, Agudath of Israel. He spoke to friends \nand they told him he would be foolish to even consider it. This was an \norganization that had little credibility, few members. In fact, it was \nat a time when even within the American Jewish community there were \npredictions that the\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nOrthodox community would not go with much vibrancy into the future. \nSomebody actually referred to the Orthodox community generally as a \n``sickly weed.'' The resilience and feistiness of this man and his \ncommitment to the values that were the foundation of his faith \npropelled him in the face of those pieces of wise counsel to go forward \nand prove them wrong. And did he ever do that, devoting the rest of his \nlife to this organization, particularly in the context of the end of \nthe Second World War, and the great suffering that occurred to so many \nsuffering Jews in Europe during the war--watching the growth of this \norganization as a reaction, a kind of affirmation of faith and life \nafter the temporary victories of death and antifaith, if I can put it \nthat way, and anti-God certainly during the Second World War.\n\n  This organization rose out of that experience, and enjoyed the \nextraordinary, unprecedented liberty that America provided to this \ncommunity, becoming the great, strong organization it is today. It is \nas Rabbi Sherer passed away with thousands of members in this country \nand all over the world in an extraordinary array of religious, social \nservice, and communal activities. It is a remarkable program of study.\n  I don't know if anyone else has spoken of what is called the ``daf \nyomi'' program, a page-a-day of Talmud study done under the auspices of \nAgudath Israel. It takes 7\\1/2\\ years to finish the Talmud--a \ncompilation of Jewish literature attempting to interpret the values and \nthe specifics of the Torah, the Bible. On the last completion of that \ncycle, which occurred in September of 1997, if I am correct, 70,000 \npeople gathered, filling Madison Square Garden in New York, Chaplain \nOgilvie. It reminds me in some sense of the Promise Keepers or groups \nof other faiths coming together to do some of the work you have done \nwith Reverend Graham, and others--70,000 people, first filling Madison \nSquare Garden, and then in the halls and chambers all over America and \nall over the world on one night to celebrate what is called the A \nSiyum, the completion of the 7\\1/2\\ year day-by-day trek through this \nexperience, a remarkable achievement, and a commitment to live by the \nvalues that were part of that organization and that experience.\n  Rabbi Sherer, it has probably been said here--and I will say it \nbriefly--not only built the inner strength of the American Orthodox \nJewish community through study, through social service, through \ncommunal strength, but was a remarkable ambassador to the broader \ncommunity of faith-based organizations working with people of other \nfaiths, and then reaching out into the community, and particularly the \npolitical community during his time in recent years. He opened an \noffice here in Washington, a kind of government relations office for \nthe good of Israel--working again with other groups to support across \nreligious lines commonly held principles, even when they were \ncontroversial.\n  On the day that Rabbi Sherer was buried and his funeral occurred, \nthere was a remarkable outpouring in New York to pay tribute to him. \nMore than 20,000 people stood outside the synagogue where the service \nwas held. They lined the streets to pay final honor to Rabbi Moshe \nSherer. It was heartfelt, it was emotional, and it was also an \nexpression of gratitude to all he had meant to the organization, to \nthem personally, to their children, to the institutions from which they \nhad benefited, and to their sense of freedom and confidence being \nreligious people in the America context. And now, as we are taught the \nway to continue to honor his memory is to live by the principles that \nguided his own life, we are taught that when a person dies and leaves \nthis Earth and their soul ascends to heaven that they are in that sense \nunable to do more to elevate themselves, that it is up to those of us \nwho survive them here on Earth to try to do deeds that are good in \ntheir name, if you will, to be of support and strength to them.\n  I think that is the work that has continued in the organization and \nin the lives of the individuals and all of us who were touched by Rabbi \nMoshe Sherer.\n  I join my colleagues to pay tribute to him, and to those who continue \nthe strong and important work for the good of Israel, and to offer \ncondolences to his wife, to his children, to his grandchildren, and to \nhis great grandchildren.\n  May God come forth and give them the strength--as I know He will--to \ncarry on the extraordinary good work that characterizes the life and \ntimes of a great Jewish American, Rabbi Moshe Sherer.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis beautiful words.\n  My dear friend and colleague, the Senator from New York, has asked to \nspeak, and I yield him 3 minutes, if we may, of the time that is \nbeginning to run out. Also, the distinguished majority leader has come \non the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Moynihan.\n  I, too, want to join my friends, Senator Moynihan, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Lott, Senator Ashcroft, and others in honoring the memory--the \nblessed memory--of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, who is truly one of the great \nheroes of the Jewish community and of all of America in the second half \nof the 20th century.\n  I am proud to have called him a friend as well as a mentor. He would \nguide me regularly on political and moral events. He is missed by \nmyself, and my wife and my family, as he is by millions of others.\n  Rabbi Sherer did so many good things. Senator Lieberman spoke about \nhow he gave great strength to the orthodox community which had been \nthrough one of the worst periods of history ever inflicted on any \npeople, and they came to America. What Rabbi Sherer did more than \nanything else was show them that they could live by Torah values, and \nthe values of teaching, as well as by American values--in fact, that \nthe two strengthened each other; that the values we have learned in the \nTorah, the Bible, and our teachings, the Talmud, which was mentioned by \nSenator Lieberman, would make people better Americans; and the values \nthat America allowed us to grow in, no matter who you were, or where \nyou came from, if you worked hard, you could achieve something for you \nand your family, were consonant with Torah values.\n  What Rabbi Sherer did through the guide of Israel, aside from the way \nhe touched all of our lives, is that he helped my State of New York and \nour great country grow, because today there are hundreds of thousands--\nmaybe millions--in America who follow Rabbi Sherer and who follow what \nhe taught. They are living the ways that have been lived by our \nancestors for thousands of years--the way of Torah, the way of \nlife. But at the same time, they are building this country by the \nAmerican values consonant with Torah values of hard work and \ndedication. And as they build and work hard to help themselves and \ntheir families, they help America grow; they start companies; they work \nin other companies; they teach.\n\n  So Rabbi Sherer's loss has been a loss for us who know him and knew \nhim and miss him. It has been a loss for the Jewish community in \nAmerica--one of our greatest leaders who taught us about education and \nwho taught us that living a life of Torah values and being proud \nAmericans is totally consistent. So it is also a great loss for America \nbecause America has always depended on and relished in the glory of \nlives such as that of Rabbi Moshe Sherer.\n  So I join with my colleagues, my friends in the gallery, in \nremembering him, remembering his life and his good deeds, and knowing \nthat, as a Jew and as a New Yorker and as an American, I am proud to \nstand before my colleagues and before all of our country and say words \nof praise in memory, in blessed memory, of Rabbi Moshe Sherer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I add I am proud of the warm and \ninsightful remarks of my junior colleague. I thank him.\n  I see the eminent majority leader is on the floor. Through his \ncourtesy, this\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\ntime has been made available. I wish him to take whatever time he \nrequires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New York. It is always a pleasure to \nwork with him. I thought it was appropriate we have this time this \nmorning to pay tribute to this great man.\n  Mr. President. today, along with other Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle, I note the first anniversary of the death of Rabbi Morris \nSherer, the long-time president of Agudath Israel of America.\n  This is a sad memorial, in that the nation has lost his ethical \nleadership and his commitment to justice and religious liberty. But \nthis should also be a celebratory observance, to honor the memory of a \nman who, while treasuring the past, always looked forward.\n  Rabbi Sherer was a living example of President Reagan's favorite \nsaying: there's no limit to what you can accomplish when you don't care \nwho gets the credit for it. But today, we rightly give him credit for a \nlifetime of good works on behalf of this people, his faith, and his \ncountry.\n  More than a half-century ago, in the worst of times for European \nJewry, he put Agudath Israel in the forefront of assisting the \npersecuted and saving the hunted. And with the defeat of Nazism, his \norganization pitched in to help refugees and immigrants.\n  Here at home, he took a small organization that seemed to be on the \nsidelines of American life and transformed it into an active, weighty, \ninfluential factor in the mainstream of national affairs.\n  He was not reluctant to apply the value of his faith of public \npolicy. Because religious education was at the very core of his \ncommunity's life, he fought for equitable treatment of students in \nfaith-based schools, whether Christian academies or Orthodox schools.\n  Because he understood that a culture without values is a culture \nwithout a future, he foutht against the moral decline that has brought \nso much suffering and sorrow to our country in recent decades.\n  His concern to preserve and strengthen the Jewish religious heritage \nin American did not prevent him from working with those outside his own \ncommunity who shared his principles. We need to have more of that in \nAmerica, not less.\n  In matters of public policy, it is easy to win applause, but it is \neven harder to win true respect.\n  Rabbi Sherer sidestepped the applause and earned the respect that \ntoday brings members of the Senate of the United States to pay tribute \nto his memory.\n  I know he would be especially pleased by this observance, not because \nwe are here praising him, but because his son, Rabbi Shimshon Sherer, \nis serving today as our guest Chaplain.\n  We thank him for that, as we thank the men and women of Agudath \nIsrael for their continuing commitment to defend their faith and \nadvance the humane vision of Rabbi Morris Sherer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our time has expired. Might I ask for 1 \nconcluding minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the majority leader for his fine, perceptive \nremarks and for making this occasion possible.\n  It is a little over a year since the passing of Rabbi Moshe Sherer, \none of American Jewry's most distinguished communal leaders. Rabbi \nSherer was the president of Agudath Israel of America for over 30 years \nand served as a reasoned, wise voice whose counsel was widely respected \nin the Yeshivot of his beloved Brooklyn and the halls of government in \nlower Manhattan, Albany, Jerusalem, and here in Washington.\n  I first met Rabbi Sherer in the early days of the Kennedy \nadministration when he came to Washington on behalf of Agudath Israel. \nI quickly learned to admire his sagacity and rely on his insightful \ncounsel and abiding integrity. For over 35 years he was a treasured \nmentor and a trusted friend.\n  Rabbi Sherer's earliest work on behalf of the Jewish community was \nthe grassroots, and largely illegal, organization and transport of food \nshipments to starving Jews in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe in 1941. His \nefforts also produced affidavits for European Jewish refugees that \nhelped them immigrate to the United States.\n  After the end of World War II, he and Agudath Israel continued to \nassist European Jews--survivors interned in displaced person camps--\nwith foodstuffs and religious items, and helped facilitate the \nimmigration and resettlement of Jewish refugees on these shores. In \nensuring decades, Rabbi Sherer spearheaded Agudath Israel's efforts on \nbehalf of endangered Jews behind the Iron Curtain and in places like \nSyria and Iran. In 1991, years of clandestine activity on behalf \nof Soviet Jews culminated in his establishment of an office in Moscow \nto coordinate Agudath Israel's activities in Russia. Under his \nleadership, Agudath Israel also played an important role in providing \nsocial welfare and educational assistance to Israel Jews, and in \nadvocating for Israel's security needs.\n\n  Ignoring the pessimistic predictions about Orthodox Jewry made by \nsociologists and demographic experts in the 40s and 50s, Rabbi Sherer \nwent on to help engineer a remarkable change in the scope, image and \ninfluence of the American Orthodox Jewish world. A staunch advocate of \nJewish religious education as a early as the 1960s, he helped establish \nthe principle in numerous federal laws--like the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965--and State laws that, to the full \nextent constitutionally permissible, children in non-public schools \nwere entitled to governmental benefits and services on an equitable \nbasis with the public school counterparts. In 1972, his efforts on \nbehalf of education led to his being named national chairman of a \nmulti-faith coalition of leaders representing the 5 million non-public \nschool children in the United States.\n  On the day of his funeral last year I took the Senate floor to \ndeclare that:\n\n       World Jewry has lost one of its wisest statesman. America \n     Orthodoxy has lost a primary architect of its remarkable \n     postwar resurgence. All New Yorkers have lost a man of rare \n     spiritual gifts and exceptional creative vision.\n\n  Rabbi Sherer passed away only hours before the President of the \nSenate, Vice President Al Gore, addressed Agudath Israel's 76th \nanniversary dinner in New York. He spoke for the Senate and for all \nAmericans when he eulogized the Rabbi as ``a remarkable force for the \nunderstanding and respect and growth of Orthodox Jewry over the past \nfifty years,'' whose ``contributions to spreading religious freedom and \nunderstanding have been truly indispensable in defending and expanding \nthose same rights for all Americans in all faiths.''\n  I know I speak for the entire Senate when I express my condolences to \nhis widow Deborah, his loving children Rachel Langer and Elky \nGoldschmidt, who join us today in the visitor's gallery, and his son \nRabbi Shimshon Sherer whose inspiring prayer opened this morning's \nSenate session.\n  ``There were giants in the Earth in those days,'' the book of Genesis \nteaches. Rabbi Noshe Sherer was a giant in our midst, whose counsel and \nwisdom will be missed by all of us who were privileged to enjoy his \nfriendship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon shall be under the control of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nGrams, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7760-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7760-S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we wanted to take a little time this \nmorning to again talk about what I consider the overtaxation of the \naverage working family in the United States. The tax burden is getting \nlarger and larger every day and every year. In fact, under this \nadministration it has grown by about 50 percent in just the last 6 \nyears. To sum up some of these things we do have a number of other \nspeakers who will come down this morning and join us and lay out some \nof the facts and figures on the current tax status in the United \nStates.\n  Next Sunday our Nation will celebrate the Fourth of July. Millions of \nAmericans and their families and\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\nfriends will gather to raise the national flag, parade in their \nhometown, grill in their backyard, or drive to the beach for a relaxing \nvacation.\n  The Fourth of July is always a truly great American holiday.\n  As we observe this special occasion, I rise to remind the American \npeople of why we celebrate the Fourth of July, Independence Day, and to \ncall upon Congress and the President to take immediate action to \nprovide meaningful tax relief for all overtaxed Americans.\n  This great Nation was born out of a tax revolt. The revolt was not \nbecause of Founding Fathers were selfish but because they did not want \nto be shackled under more government regulations, bureaucracy, taxing \npowers, and unjust legislation of their homeland.\n  They did not want to send their hard-earned money to the Parliament \nin England that furthered their own special interests in order to keep \nthemselves in power.\n  This tax revolt was about freedom and liberty, about a person being \nable to own himself, his labor, and the fruits of his labor. This is \nthe simple moral origin of our Nation.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood well that low taxes and freedom were \ndirectly related. They did their best to ensure that the American \npeople continued to enjoy their freedom.\n  Unfortunately, this freedom that our Founding Fathers treasured so \nmuch and that triggered our Nation's independence has been eroded.\n  Today, Americans are overtaxed. The tax burden on working Americans \nis more crushing than ever. In 1913, less than 1 percent of all \nAmericans paid income tax. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any income \ntax as late as 1939, before World War II.\n  Today, the Federal tax burden is at a historic high. Federal taxes \nconsume nearly 21 percent of national income. A typical American family \npays $9,450 in Federal income tax per year.\n  A median-income family can expect to pay nearly 40 percent of its \nincome in Federal, State, and local taxes--more than it spends on food, \nclothing, and housing combined.\n  But our Democratic colleagues and President Clinton do not believe \nthis rapidly growing tax burden is excessive and have preferred new \nspending to tax cuts.\n  One of the best indicators of how exhausting the tax burden has \nbecome is the annual arrival of Tax Freedom Day, the day on which \nAmericans stop working just to pay their State, Federal, and local \ntaxes and actually begin keeping their earnings for themselves.\n  This year, Americans had to wait until May 11 before they marked Tax \nFreedom Day. At 132 days into the year, it's the latest arrival of Tax \nFreedom Day ever.\n  As a sign of just how far and fast taxes have escalated, in 1950, \nAmericans marked Tax Freedom Day on April 3.\n  Cost of Government Day, a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, \ngoes further by including taxes, regulations, and total government \nspending. This year Cost of Government Day arrived on June 22.\n  The total cost of government in 1999 is estimated at $3.72 trillion, \nthat is up from $3.56 trillion in 1998.\n  This is a 4.5-percent increase overall, and that is almost double the \nrate of inflation. The cost of Government regulation alone will cost \ntaxpayers over $1.06 trillion in 1999. Again, our Democratic colleagues \nand President Clinton do not believe this rapidly growing tax burden is \nexcessive, and they have repeatedly denied tax cuts to Americans.\n  Let's take a look at another indicator. Over the course of President \nClinton's administration, Washington's income has grown faster than our \neconomy and has grown twice as fast than the income of the average \nAmerican. In fact, Federal taxes have grown by over 54 percent during \nthis administration. That is nearly $4,000 per year more per person. \nThe income tax rates also indicate Americans are overtaxed.\n  The average tax rate for the 437,036 individual returns filed for \n1916 was 2.75 percent. Again, the average tax rate for nearly the half \nmillion Americans who filed returns in 1916 was just 2.75 percent of \nincome. Under President Reagan, we had only two income tax rates: 15 \npercent and 28 percent. But today, there are now five tax rates, and \nAmericans can be taxed as high as 40 percent in Federal taxes.\n  In the past few years, over 20 million American workers earning \nbetween $30,000 to $50,000 have been pushed from the 15-percent income \ntax bracket to the 28-percent income tax bracket due to the unfair tax \nsystems we have. On top of that, they have to also pay a 15.3-percent \npayroll tax. Federal taxes alone account for the loss of 43 percent of \nthe income for those middle-income Americans who have worked hard just \nto try to get ahead.\n  The President and the Democrats always like to tell middle-income \nAmericans that, of course, they are only out there taxing the rich \nwhile they stick their hands deeper and deeper into the pockets of \naverage Americans. They use class warfare as a cover to tax all \nAmericans at a higher and higher rate.\n  The rapidly growing tax burdens hurt low-income and minimum wage \nworkers as well. They may not pay income tax, but they still have to \npay the payroll tax. As low-income and minimum wage workers work harder \nand earn more, their payroll tax increases, again taking a huge bite \ninto hard-earned dollars that are most needed to keep those families \nabove the poverty line. Once again, our Democratic colleagues and the \nPresident do not believe this rapidly growing tax burden is excessive \nand have repeatedly refused to support any tax cuts.\n  Let's ask the American people if they are overtaxed and want a tax \nrefund on their overpaid taxes. Let's ask a full-time mom and former \nschoolteacher, Susie Dutcher, about the overall tax burden. According \nto her:\n\n       Taxes are far and away the biggest portion of our family \n     budget.\n\n  Susie would love to put more dollars into their retirement account, \nwould love to buy more books for their three children, or put more \nmoney in their college fund or spend more money for other family \npriorities, but she cannot because much of the fruit of their labor is \nagain taken by the Government.\n  Ask John Batey of Tennessee about the death tax. John runs a 500-acre \nfamily farm that has been part of the Batey family for 192 years. John \nhas spent all of his life on his family farm and, like most other \nfarmers, he plans to be a good steward of the land, save and build his \nassets, and someday try to leave his farm to his children.\n  After the death of his father 5 years ago and the death of his mother \nlast June, John began to settle his parents' estate. As he was about to \ntake over the family farm, the IRS sent a death tax bill for a quarter \nof a million dollars. The land value of the farm increased \nsignificantly, but the death tax has never been indexed. John had no \nchoice but to sell some of his assets, dip into their lifelong savings, \nand even borrow some money to pay Uncle Sam.\n\n  The Federal death tax was originally levied to pay for the war in \n1916 to help fund the efforts of World War I, and estates under $9 \nmillion were not taxed at that time. But it later evolved into a \nmechanism, of course, with a redistribution of private income.\n  Just like the Batey family, millions of American farmers and small \nbusinessowners are faced with paying high taxes or, in fact, losing \ntheir farms and businesses to pay the death tax. Unfortunately, again, \nmy Democratic colleagues insist that a cut in the death tax is a tax \ncut for the rich, and they can hardly justify a costly tax cut that \nbenefits some of the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  Ask janitor Joe of Virginia about the capital gains tax. Over the \nlast 30 years, Joe saved every penny of his income he could possibly \nsave after paying Federal, State, and local taxes. He took the risk, \nand he invested his savings smartly in the market. He was excited as he \nwatched his savings grow into $1/2 million in assets. That excitement \nsoon turned into torment upon retirement when he began to withdraw the \nfunds. The Government took nearly one-third of those hard-earned \nsavings for capital gains taxes.\n  Or you could ask newly wedded Alicia Jones of my home State of \nMinnesota about the marriage penalty. Alicia and her husband graduated \nfrom college and had just begun working full time 2 years ago. In 1998, \nAlicia and her husband worked full time in professional careers. They \nhad no children and were renting an apartment and trying to save to buy \ntheir first house. They had to pay at least an additional $1,400 under \nthe marriage penalty tax in our Tax Code for simply being married.\n  As a result, on top of the over $10,000 they already had deducted \nfrom their\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\nchecks to pay Federal taxes, they had to take an additional $700 out of \ntheir limited savings account to pay for Federal taxes, taxes that they \nwould not have had to pay, by the way, if they had not been married.\n  She wrote and said:\n\n       I'm frustrated by this. I'm frustrated for the future. How \n     do we get ahead when each year we have to take money out of \n     our savings to pay more and more for our taxes? I hope that \n     you will remember my concern.\n\n  Alicia's story is not uncommon. There are 21 million American \nfamilies in this same situation. If these individual stories are not \nconvincing, let's take another look at the polls.\n  A recent Gallup-CNN-USA Today poll shows that over 65 percent of \nAmericans believe taxes are too high. Half of the American population \nthink the tax system itself is not fair. A Fox News poll indicates that \n65 percent of Americans believe that no more than 20 percent of their \nincome should go to Federal, State, and local taxes. As I said, about \nan average of 40 percent today is collected from Americans across the \ncountry.\n  An Associated Press poll also shows that the majority of Americans \nwant to use the non-Social Security surplus that we are hearing so much \nabout this week for tax relief, not for more pet spending programs by \nthis administration.\n\n  The list goes on. There are a lot of people around Congress, and \nespecially in the White House, who talk about tax relief, but I believe \nit is all show.\n  The message from the American people is loud and clear: We are \novertaxed, we want meaningful tax relief, and we want and need tax \nreform.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues and the President to ponder a very \nfundamental question about taxation over this holiday: Should our \nGovernment tax working Americans' income when they first earn it? \nShould the Government be able to tax it again when they save it, tax it \nagain when they spend it, tax it again when they invest it, and tax it \nyet again when they die?\n  They talk about redoing taxes for low income people because it takes \na larger portion of disposable income. I agree, but there is no excuse \nto tax others even more to support larger and larger spending plans.\n  To my fellow Americans, I invite you to think about our country's \norigin over this Independence Day holiday. Take a closer look at your \npayroll stubs to see how much in taxes is taken from your income, or \njust take a few moments to examine the hidden taxes on your holiday \nspending. You will be shocked to find out how much tax you are actually \npaying.\n  Let me give a few examples. If you drive the family car on vacation \non the holiday, remember that 45 percent of the cost of your car goes \nto taxes. Over half of what you pay for a gallon of gasoline ends up \ngoing for taxes. Thirty-six percent of the cost of the tires on your \ncar goes to taxes. And if you choose to fly, 40 percent of that cost \nalso will go to the Government.\n  Staying at a hotel is not cheap either, but did you know about 40 \npercent of your bill goes to the Government in the form of taxes?\n  If you decide to stay at home and have a simple barbecue to celebrate \nIndependence Day, the Government will stay there as an uninvited guest, \nand 43 percent of the cost of beer and 35 percent of the cost of soda \nwill go to taxes. The Government's slice of your pizza is about 38 \npercent, and taxes account for 72 percent if you want to have a drink. \nEven 31 percent of what you pay for a loaf of bread is taxed.\n  I think you get the idea of how much of the price of the average \nproducts you will buy over this holiday weekend is going to go to the \nGovernment in taxes.\n  So in closing, I am encouraged by President Clinton's announcement \nthat the budget surplus will grow by an estimated $1 trillion over the \nnext 15 years. This additional budget surplus, I believe, makes tax \nrelief even more necessary and even more feasible.\n  Even President Clinton is talking about new possible tax relief for \nthe American people this year. I welcome the opportunity to work with \nthe President to try to provide tax relief for all Americans--not to \ntalk about it, not to be all show, but to make sure that some tax \nreform is passed in tax relief.\n  Saving Social Security, reducing the national debt, cutting taxes are \nimperative for our economic security and our economic growth. Our \nstrong economy has offered us a historic opportunity to achieve this \nthree-pronged goal.\n  Republicans are committed to returning the non-Social Security \nsurplus to overtaxed Americans who are out there working hard and \ngenerating it in the first place. We have reserved nearly $800 billion \nof the non-Social Security money for tax relief in our budget, and we \nwill provide meaningful tax relief for all Americans this year.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I now yield the floor to my colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCoverdell, for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, first, I compliment the Senator from \nMinnesota for organizing and bringing this meeting together on the \nquestion of tax relief and for the powerful statement he just made in \nsupport of giving relief to American workers so they can keep more of \nwhat they earn in their checking accounts rather than sending it off to \nbureaucrats--locally, in the State, and federally.\n  In the last few days, President Clinton has joined in calling for a \nstrong lockbox to protect Social Security. I am pleased to see this. \nFor the last month, we have been fighting a filibuster from the other \nside of the aisle on this concept of setting a procedure in place that \nwould make sure Social Security receipts have a new protection device. \nHopefully, because the President has now said he supports it, the other \nside of the aisle will drop their filibuster and we can get on with our \nproposal to be more protective of Social Security receipts.\n  Second, the President has said he will now support tax relief. That \nis important. But tax relief can have a lot of definitions.\n  Our view of tax relief is that it should be across the board, that \neverybody should participate, and that the savings which families keep \nin their checking accounts be used for the decisions those families \nwant to make: Do they need more health insurance? Do they need to pay \nschool tuition? Do they have a leak in the roof? Do they need a new \ncar?\n  The President's definition of tax relief is that you get it if you do \nsomething he wants, for instances if you put a solar panel on your roof \nor if you buy an electric car, if you can find one. That is behavioral \nrelief. In other words, if you begin to live your life the way we in \nWashington think you should live it, you will get a break, but we are \nnot going to let you decide what you ought to do.\n  I would suggest that the tax relief proposal, which is growing in \nsize, ought to be looked at very seriously. I will come to that in just \na minute. But let's just talk for a second or two about why tax relief \nis so important to American families.\n  First, as was said by the Senator from Minnesota, they are paying the \nhighest taxes they have paid since World War II, which, given the \nextended periods of general peace, is unconscionable.\n  This year, American families will have a negative savings rate. That \nhas not happened since the Depression. If you read what several pundits \nin the country have written, they say it is because American families \nare greedy. Hogwash. What it is, the Government has been taking more \nand more of what they earn, and the disposable income, the income they \nhave left to use, is barely enough. In fact, in many cases it is not \nenough to manage their families so there is nothing left to save, and \nthey are not saving.\n  That means those families cannot face off an emergency. If somebody \nloses a job or there is some loss of income, the rent cannot get paid. \nIf there is an unexpected illness, an unexpected educational cost, an \nemergency, there are no savings in America to deal with that. So you \nput a whole arena of anxiety across the breadth of the land.\n  I am not going to overdetail this because of the time we have, but I, \nSenator Torricelli--it is bipartisan, bipartisan in the House, \nRepublican and Democrat with leadership--Senator Lott, Senator Gramm of \nTexas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, are all coauthors of a \nconcept that takes the first tax bracket, which is 15\n\n[[Page S7763]]\n\npercent, and increases dramatically the number of people who are in \nthat minimum tax bracket.\n\n  So everybody would share equally. But the effect is that about 7 \nmillion people would be pushed down into that lowest tax bracket. Then \nthe first $500 of interest that family earns from the savings account \nwould not be taxed. That means about $100 billion over the next 10 \nyears would be saved by those families, and 30 million of those \nfamilies would have no tax on their savings accounts.\n  So what we have is a plan that benefits 110 million taxpayers, 30 \nmillion of which would be saving tax free, 10 million of which would no \nlonger pay capital gains tax, and 7 million middle-income taxpayers \nwould be returned to the lowest tax bracket.\n  But we do not tell them what to do with their savings; they can \nfigure that out. It isn't designed to cause them to live in a loft or \nto use a solar panel or a windmill. It is designed to let them keep \nmore of their income so they can more effectively manage their families \nand their lives.\n  Incidentally, this is the only tax plan that has been endorsed by the \nNew York Stock Exchange. It is right on target, because pushing people \ninto the lowest tax bracket is helping them save, and it is simplifying \nthe Tax Code.\n  I hope that every succeeding year we can take another million-plus \ntaxpayers and push them down into this 15-percent tax bracket. One day \nwe might even get to the point that almost all Americans are there.\n  So this is a time for tax relief. Americans are paying the highest \ntaxes they have paid since World War II. They have no savings, and \ntherefore they do not run their families as effectively as they could. \nWe all know the results of that. So this is broad public policy that \nneeds the attention of the President and the Congress. It is the right \nthing to do, and this is the right time to do it.\n  I yield back to the floor manager.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his remarks this \nmorning. Also, I thank him for all his hard work during this and \nprevious Congresses to make sure that American families will be allowed \nto keep a little bit more of their hard-earned money, that less of it \nwill come to Washington, and that they will have a little bit more \ncontrol over how they spend it and what they spend it on. I appreciate \nit and thank him for all his efforts and work.\n  I also recognize this morning the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nAshcroft, who also has been a leader in the fight against higher taxes \nand is working very hard for tax relief.\n  I yield 7 minutes to Senator Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am delighted to commend the Senator from Georgia for his \noutstanding remarks. He is right about giving people a chance to spend \ntheir own money in the way they choose to spend it.\n  So much of our so-called tax relief from time to time is given in \nways that try to coach people that they should have it the way we want \nit done. Freedom is the ability to spend one's own resources the way \none particularly wants to spend them. So I am delighted with his \nremarks.\n  I rise today in support of Congress' plan to provide over $778 \nbillion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. The President has already \nannounced that the budget surplus will be larger than expected. This \nonbudget surplus is another name for a tax overpayment. Talk about a \nbudget surplus. It means we are collecting more than we need.\n\n  Having collected more than we need from the people who worked hard, \nthe least we could do would be to give it back to them. When you go \ninto a business and hand a $10 bill to the clerk for a $7 item, they \ndon't say: Well, we are going to increase your spending level. We are \ngoing to throw in four extra pairs of shoelaces and a can of polish, if \nyou are in a shoe store. They say: No, here is your change. This is \nyour money. You have overpaid.\n  That is where we are. In the days ahead, Congress will be deciding \nwhat to do. Are we going to try to find more ways to spend the money \nthe people have earned or are we going to say our faith is in families; \nwe are going to focus the resources of this country where we have our \nfaith, and that is in the private sector and in families? That is what \nhas made America great.\n  Or are we going to say our real faith is in bureaucracy; we are going \nto take more of this money and fund bureaucracy?\n  I think it is time for us to think about funding families, not \nfunding bureaucracies; funding Main Street, not funding Washington, DC. \nWhen we have challenges in this country, I think all of us know they \naren't going to be solved by government. As terrible as Littleton, CO, \nwas and is, the real challenge is a cultural challenge.\n  We need strong families with the right values. We don't need stronger \ngovernment bureaucracies. If bureaucracies could have solved the \nLittleton situation and many other challenges, we would have expected \nto have no challenges by now because we have great bureaucracies. We \nhave more bureaucracy in America than ever before, but we have greater \nproblems.\n  Instead of the high tax load that really almost forces the second \nparent to be in the workforce, maybe we ought to think about allowing \npeople to keep some of the money they earn so they don't have to have \nboth parents working and competing with the needs children have for the \nshaping, the nurturing, the developing, the teaching, and the parenting \nthat is so necessary.\n  This year, the average American will have to work 173 days just to \npay for government. This includes the burdens of Federal taxes, State \ntaxes, and local taxes. We pay more in taxes than at any other time in \nhistory.\n  Some people say: Well, there was a year or two in the Second World \nWar. I dispute that. I don't think they are counting local taxes as \nwell. Some people say: What does the Congress have to do with local \ntaxes? Very frankly, a good bit of the load of taxes at the State and \nlocal level is a result of Federal mandates, the Federal Government \nwanting to force things to be done by government and the bureaucracy, \nnot having the courage to charge for it but just saying to the States: \nYou must get this done.\n  It is sort of similar to going in to order something without paying \nfor it. We have done that at the Federal level. It is a shame, but it \nhas happened.\n  It is time for us to say that we need to allow some of the \nindividuals who have built this great Nation to enjoy the fruits of \ntheir own labors. When we have overcollected, we have taken more than \nwe need. We have a surplus. Let us give the folks the change back \ninstead of trying to force them to buy more bureaucracy, which they \ndidn't want, didn't order, and don't need. They do need the capacity in \nfamilies.\n\n  According to a Congressional Research Service study, the surplus \nmeans that the average household will be paying $5,000 more in taxes \nover the next 10 years than the government needs. Well, let's just let \nthe American people have some of that money back.\n  I want to go quickly to one of the most important things we can do to \ncorrect a serious error of our Tax Code. For a long time, Members of \nthis body have understood that our Tax Code penalizes people for being \nmarried. The way the Tax Code is administered, there is what is called \na marriage penalty for people who enter the durable, lasting \nrelationship of marriage, which is the place where children learn and \nwhere society and the social order, our culture, renews itself--in \ndurable, lasting, committed marriages. They get taxed more heavily, \nvery frequently, than if they were not married. That is called the \nmarriage penalty.\n  I may not be one for lots of little nuances in the Tax Code, but it \nis time for us to take this massive prejudice out of the Tax Code that \ncharges people elevated rates because they are doing the thing \ngovernment most needs. If government is to promote safety and the \nstability of the community so people can reach the potential that God \nhas placed within them--and that is what I think government is for--the \nfamily does that more effectively and in concert with government better \nthan anybody else. If anything, marriage ought to be the subject of a \nsubsidy, not the pernicious recipient of a penalty that punishes people \nfor being married.\n  I know Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Senator from Texas, has focused for\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\nyears on this idea. I have been one who has stood up to say that we \nought to focus on this idea. If we have an opportunity to let people \nkeep some of what they earn, let us stop punishing people for the \npersistent, durable commitment of dedicated marriage that is \nfundamental to the success of this society in the next century. That \nwould be a tremendous first step.\n  We all know that we are paying more in taxes than ever before. We \nhave watched, as the tax burden has gone up, families struggle to meet \ntheir responsibilities, moms and dads trying to juggle how they can \naccommodate their schedules and still raise a family. Finally, the \nsecond parent goes into the workforce to make ends meet because \ngovernment demands so substantially.\n  Let us give the American family the kind of tax relief that allows \nfamilies to make America great again and to make their own decisions. \nIt is with that in mind that I think one of the tremendous \nopportunities we have is the opportunity to abolish the marriage \npenalty in the tax law.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we consider our responsibilities, to relieve \nAmerican marriages of this pernicious penalty which punishes people for \ndoing that which we all need.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota and the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Missouri for those words and, \nagain, thank him for all his efforts on tax relief.\n  I now recognize the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, who also \nwanted to talk about it, for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I express my appreciation for the excellent remarks \ndelivered by the Senator from Missouri. He and the Senator from \nMinnesota have been champions of lowering the burden of government on \nAmerican people since they have been in this body. They are known for \nthat. They have given time and effort and passion to it. I really was \ninspired by the remarks of the Senator from Missouri. I appreciate them \nvery much.\n  We are in a time of surplus. We have time to make some decisions \nabout what we are going to do with that surplus. The President's own \nOffice of Management and Budget midyear review now indicates that we \nwill have, over 10 years, a $1 trillion surplus outside of Social \nSecurity available to us.\n  I suggest we have to consider allowing working Americans to keep more \nof what they earn. That is clearly a policy that will nurture freedom. \nThe more money we take from individuals, the more we take from \nfamilies, the more we shift it to a burdensome bureaucracy in \nWashington, the more we diminish their freedom, their power vis-a-vis \nthe government. The government is strengthened. The individual and \nfamily is weakened. It is just that simple. The power to tax is the \npower to destroy. A tax diminishes freedom. It penalizes certain \nbehavior, and it encourages other behavior.\n  I think we have to be honest with ourselves. This great economy has \ndone some wonderful things for America. We are also finding that people \nare moving up in the tax brackets, higher and higher tax brackets, \nmeaning they are paying a higher percentage of their income to the \ngovernment each year. And the sad fact is that the total percentage of \nthe gross domestic product; that is, of all goods and services produced \nin America, is increasing. According to the Federal Government's own \nstatistics, in 1992, when this administration took office, before the \nbig tax increase, we were sending 17.6 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct to the Government. It will reach 20.7 this year or next year--a \nsteady increase.\n  To say that tax decreases are going to destroy the Government and \nsomehow result in a massive reduction in funds to the Government is \nsilly. The year before last we rolled back one-third of the 1993 huge \ntax increase that the administration pushed for. We rolled that back \nand included within it a $500 per child tax credit. I know the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, the Presiding Officer, was a supporter of that, and the \nSenator from Minnesota, was a big supporter of that $500 per child tax \ncredit. I made it one of my highest priorities and worked extremely \nhard to see that that became a reality.\n  They say: Well, you can't afford a tax cut. If you have a tax cut, we \nwill increase our deficit. That has not happened. In fact, we are \ncontinuing to see surpluses accrue.\n  But what I want to ask the American people to do is think about this: \nA family with three children making $35,000 a year, or $45,000 a year, \nwill now receive a tax credit--not a tax deduction but a $500 reduction \nin the amount of money they have to pay in taxes to the Government for \neach of those children--$1,500. They will be getting those refunds this \nspring. Many have already received those refunds--$1,500 for a family. \nThat is $120 per month tax free for a family to use for things.\n  If there is somebody struggling today, as the Senator from Missouri \nnoted, it is working families. It is expensive. They will have $120 a \nmonth to buy shoes with, or maybe a new set of tires for the car, or \nmaybe money so the child can go on a school trip that they would like \nfor them to go on but are wondering how they are going to pay for it. \nThey will get it every month, because this Congress said, no, we are \nnot going to keep taking this money from the families; we are going to \nallow you to keep it and use it as you see fit.\n\n  Who cares more about children than a mother who cares about her \nchildren? Who can best decide what they need than the family?\n  It is a myth that if you do not vote for more and more and bigger \nprograms, you love your children less. That is an incorrect statement. \nIt really offends me, because what we are doing is taking that money \nfrom families who love their children and who know their children's \nnames. Nobody in Washington knows my children's names or the names of \nchildren in Alabama. They can't possibly utilize resources as \neffectively as the people who love them and who are raising them.\n  I really believe that was a nice step forward. But it was just one \nstep. I am proud that we accomplished that. It took some effort. It \nlooked as if it wasn't going to happen, until finally the American \npeople understood what was being talked about. They realized that it \nwas in fact possible to achieve it, and the people started speaking. \nThe Congress--some of those who objected--got the message, and the \nPresident got the message. He signed that bill. So we are looking at a \ncontinual possibility of a surplus in the future.\n  I am concerned that we are showing an unhealthy increase in the \namount taken by Government. I think it is time to send some of that \nback to our people. We can make reform of Social Security, we can \nsecure Medicare, and I am absolutely strongly committed to the Social \nSecurity lockbox--to setting aside our Social Security surplus so we \ndon't spend it, and making sure it is there to allow us to strengthen \nand improve Social Security.\n  That is the first step. If we spend the Social Security surplus by \nnew and bigger programs--there is always some new program that somebody \nhas--we are not going to have it to save Social Security.\n  Likewise, we have an opportunity with a non-Social Security surplus--\nthis $1 trillion, this $1,000 billion, that will be ours in the next \ndecade--to make a decision: Are we going to allow the Government to \ngrow and become more and more a dominating force in our lives, or are \nwe going to encourage families and freedom and prosperity?\n  Just for example, I support and am working very hard on a program I \ncall ``The Class Act.'' Most States--42 States now--have a plan called \na prepaid college tuition plan where you can buy into college tuition, \ninvest your money into it as your children grow, so much a month, how \nyou choose, and when your child gets to the age to go to college, it \ncan be paid for.\n  We found that the Federal Government taxes all the interest that \naccrues on that money. The Federal Government is taxing and penalizing \nfamilies who are doing the right thing by saving for their children's \ncollege education at the same time that we are providing tax breaks, \ninterest rate breaks, and interest deferred payments to people who \nborrow for college. As a result, we have found that borrowing in the \nlast decade has tripled--three times what it was in the previous \ndecade. And savings are down.\n\n  Good government policy calls on us and demands of us that we \nencourage\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\nthe highest and best qualities in people. Taxing and penalizing people \nwho save, and at the same time subsidizing people who borrow, which we \nneed to do--people need to be helped in borrowing to go to college; we \nare not eliminating any of those programs--is wrongheaded. It is not \nencouraging our highest and best instinct as a people.\n  We are different from the rest of the world. This was never a \ngovernment-dominated country. It has never been run by a king. It has \nnever been run by a totalitarian Communist dictator. It is made up of \nmillions of independent, free Americans who respect themselves and \ntheir communities and care about themselves and their communities.\n  We don't believe the Government ought to do everything for us. People \nare prepared in this country, as a part of our very character as a \npeople, to take care of themselves whenever they can. But if the \nGovernment continues to take more of their wealth and take more of the \nmoney they earn every month, making it more and more difficult for them \nto meet their responsibilities, then they tend to look to Government to \nfund them.\n  That is not a good trend for us. This is basic. This represents a \nbasic divide in this Senate and right down the hall in the Congress \nbetween people whose visions differ about the nature of our country.\n  I say let's celebrate our character of individualism, personal \nresponsibility, personal integrity, good financial management, and \nfrugality. Let's encourage savings and not tax people's money who save.\n  I think it is time for us as a nation to think about this. We dare \nnot get into a big spending program. We do not dare start taxing and \nspending again. We have an opportunity for a historic time for America. \nI am proud to join with the Senator from Minnesota in promoting it.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I appreciate \nthe words and all of the efforts of the Senator from Alabama. He is \ntalking about the President announcing that a tax cut is possible. He \nis agreeing with us that tax cuts are important.\n  I think we have to be very careful because I think it would be a bad \ndeal for the American people if we got a little bit of a tax cut but it \ncame at the cost of huge increases in spending. We don't want that type \nof a tradeoff. We want to make sure that tax relief means tax relief \nand not just some token tax relief while we increase spending over in \nthe other side.\n  I recognize for up to 5 minutes this morning the Senator from Kansas, \nMr. Brownback, and I also want to compliment him for all of his hard \nwork and efforts in the area of taxes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank our \ndistinguished colleague from Minnesota for all his work in this field.\n  As long as I have been in this body--I have not been in it that long; \nI am in my third year--I have known that Senator Grams has been really \nworking on the issue of tax cuts. He has pushed forward. He has prodded \npeople on it. He has done a beautiful job of getting us to the point of \npeople saying let's have a tax cut, a serious tax cut, not one where we \njust issue a bunch of press releases and the press releases cost more \nthan the tax cut but a real tax cut that stimulates the economy and \nhelps people.\n\n  I am delighted the President is now apparently willing to work with \nthe Congress in order to provide the American people with the tax cut \nthey need and deserve. Part of the reason the President is now willing \nto consider a tax cut is the strength of the American economy, which is \nprecisely one of the reasons we should consider a tax cut at this time. \nWe are at this point of a budget surplus because of some fiscal \ndiscipline in Washington but mostly because of the strength of our \neconomy. We need to keep that economy going and growing strong. That is \nthe key to having budget surpluses in the future--a strong economy. We \ncan help with tax cuts.\n  The bottom line, as has been mentioned before, is that growth works. \nWhen we have growth, we have more resources to pay down the debt, to do \nthe programs needed for the American public, and now to cut taxes.\n  If we are going to continue to experience a growing economy, we need \nto take steps to enhance and sustain our current record of economic \nexpansion in order to pave the way for the next century. We need \nanother ``American century.'' Providing the American people with broad-\nbased progrowth tax relief is one of the ways to help achieve it.\n  In America there is an emerging class of investors who are more aware \nof what tax policy means for individuals and for the ability of our \neconomy to perform. This class of investors is citizens who have been \nable to take part in the American dream through 401(k) programs and \nexpanded IRAs that have been offered as part of a retirement package or \nencouraged through our Tax Code. They are not wealthy--- not yet \nanyway--but they are increasingly concerned about our Tax Code and what \nit means to them.\n  We need to work with the family farmers, cab drivers, construction \nworkers, and small businessmen to allow them to participate in this \nfree market system and have it continue its expansion. They know the \nbest thing Congress can do in order to spur growth is to cut taxes.\n  There are a variety of options for cutting America's taxes. We can \nuse a budget surplus after accounting for Social Security. We need the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security, and we need to lock it \ndown, lock it out--create a lockbox for it.\n  With the budget surplus over and above Social Security, we could \nwiden the 15-percent tax bracket in order to help ``flatten\" the tax \nstructure and provide the American people with tax relief. An expansion \nof the 15-percent tax bracket has another desirous effect of \nalleviating the impact of the marriage penalty. Currently, nearly 21 \nmillion families are forced to carry an average of $1,400 more a year \nin taxes simply for being married. We must bring this institutionalized \ndiscrimination against the family to an end. Now is the time to do \nthat.\n  We could also take steps to encourage savings and investment by \ncutting the capital gains tax rate, which could stimulate the economy \nand give back further revenues to the Federal Government. Americans \nneed a higher rate of national savings to continue to grow into the \nnext century. Cutting capital gains tax rates will help. We can look at \nthe possibility of further reductions in the death tax area. I think we \nneed to do this, particularly for small businesses and family farmers \nwho frequently spend a lot of time reorganizing their business, \ncreating trusts and other corporations to get around paying death taxes \nthat would have the impact of killing their business, or of killing \ntheir farm, and not allowing them to pass it on to the next generation. \nWe need to do those things.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota for his work on this tax-\ncutting agenda and getting the President to agree that we can and \nshould do a tax cut. For the President to say he isn't opposed to a tax \ncut is a positive step. Now it is time for the President to deal with \nthe Congress in providing real tax relief to the American public. It \nstimulates the economy, it keeps us growing, and it supports the \nAmerican public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \nefforts in discussing the importance of continued work in reducing the \ntax burden for average Americans.\n  The bottom line is that we are overtaxed today. The average family \ntoday spends about 40 percent of everything they make on taxes. Compare \nthat to 1916 when the taxes began; it was less than a 3-percent tax \nburden on those paying taxes at that time, which was only about 5 \npercent of the American people. Today over 40 percent of a family's \nincome goes into taxes.\n  When we talk about tax relief, we are talking about giving back money \nthat has been overcharged--in other words, the excess money, the \nsurplus. We are not talking about cutting any Government spending. We \nare not talking about reducing even the size and scope of the \nGovernment under these plans. That we need to do. If we were going to \nactually cut taxes, we would be giving back the surplus and then \nlooking for ways to reduce the amount of money the Federal Government \nspends.\n  A couple of brief facts on the tax burden and how it has grown. Under \nthe Clinton administration, individual income tax relief for income tax \nreceipts\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\nhas far outstripped our economic output. The tax collections have more \nthan doubled this country's gross domestic product growth in the last 6 \nyears. It is almost double what personal income growth has been. In \nother words, Washington spending is growing twice as fast as the growth \nin the entire economy and twice as fast as a person's personal income. \nI think that is what we are talking about today.\n  We all need to pay taxes. We need to support Government. There are \nmany good things the Government does. We need to review the excessive \nspending and Washington's belief that it can do everything for \neverybody.\n  In a bipartisan effort and mood, I yield the reminder of my time to \nthe Senator from South Carolina to sneak in some remarks this morning.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. President, so the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has \ntime for the independent counsel, I ask unanimous consent to extend his \ntime from 12:05 to 12:35 so his half hour can be preserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank both of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n  I awoke with a shock when I saw we had $1 trillion more money to \nspend. I go right back to 1995, just 4 years ago, when I said I will \njump off the Capitol dome if this budget is balanced by the year 2002. \nI said to myself, it looks as if I am going to have to jump off the \ndome, because they found another $1 trillion. We just have surpluses \neverywhere.\n  I felt that way until I picked up the President's document--the \nbudget of the U.S. Government that they gave us today, hot off the \npress. Turn to page 42 and Members will see the actual deficit in 1998 \nat the end of September was $5,478.7 trillion.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, who is a certified public \naccountant, knows how to add and subtract. For the 5 years, on page 42, \nthe total gross Federal debt goes to $6,298 trillion. The Federal debt \nby the year 2002 that I was worried about has already increased some \n$400 billion. By the year 2004, it has increased from the 1999 deficit \n$551.1 billion.\n  The debt is going up half a trillion, and everybody is talking \nsurplus. That is totally dismaying to this particular Senator. It is a \nshabby game and a fraud that we play on the American public. The only \nentity to keep us honest is the free press. They join in the fraud. \nThey had a debate some years ago, between Mr. Walter Lippmann and John \nDewey. This is back before the war. Lippmann's contention was that the \nway to really build and strengthen a democracy is to get the best of \nminds in the various disciplines--whether it is in medicine or whether \nit is in law or whether it is in finance or whether it is foreign \npolicy--get the best of the best minds around a table, determine the \nneeds of the country, and give it to the Congressmen and Senators and \nlet them enact it into law.\n\n  John Dewey countered that. He said: No, the better way is to give the \nAmerican people the truth, and the American people, in a consummate \nway, through their Representatives in the Congress, the House and \nSenate, would reflect those truths, and we would have a strong \ndemocracy. That is the way since Jefferson's time, when he said:\n\n       [. . . as between] a government without newspapers, or \n     newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a \n     moment to prefer the latter.\n\n  That was because he was depending, over many years--now over the 200 \nyears we have had--on that media expounding and telling us the truth.\n  The truth is, there is nothing in the lockbox that everybody is \ntalking about. We have been spending it--$857 billion that we owe \nSocial Security this very minute. So there is nothing in the lockbox. \nYou can see from this document, when they say, pay down the public \ndebt, there is no such thing as paying down any kind of special debt. \nYou either have a debt that increases or a debt that decreases and \ncomes into balance. They play that shabby game called ``paying down.'' \nThe President even said, as quoted in the New York Times this morning, \nthat he was going to tear up the credit card.\n  What they do is transfer the debt from the general indebtedness of \nGovernment, namely for defense and spending and everything else, \nforeign policy and otherwise, and transfer it over to Social Security, \nover to the military retirees, civilian retirement, over to Medicare, \nbecause there is a surplus. So they transfer that debt into these trust \nfunds and say that is paying down the debt. It is like having a Visa \nand a MasterCard and you pay off your Visa card with the MasterCard. \nYou are still the Government. If you are still the individual, you have \nyour individual debt; if you are still the Government, you have the \nGovernment debt.\n  One more word and I will yield with gratitude to my distinguished \nfriend from Pennsylvania. Just turn to page 43, the next page. You can \nsee the 15-year; they have the debt held by the Government, accounts \nheld at the end of the period, which has to be added up with the debt \nheld by the public at the end of the period, and you will see the debt \ngoes up to $7.587 trillion. The debt goes up almost $2 trillion over \nthat 15 years.\n  Fortuitously, back 4 years ago I was saying that when President \nReagan came to town we had an annual budget deficit from year to year \nand President Reagan said: I am going to balance it the first year. \nThen he said: Whoops, this is worse than I ever thought; I'll do it in \n3 years. Then, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we did it in 5 years. I \nsaid, before long we are going up to 10 or 15 years. And sure enough, \nthis morning they have gone up with all kinds of estimates of revenues.\n  Really, the way to play, if you want to play this game, is let's have \na 25-year budget. We will have enough money for everything. Send the \nmoney to the U.N., double the amounts to the United Nations, double the \ntax cut. Let's double all these things, give it all to investment \naccounts, health care, whatever you want. Let's have a 25-year budget \nand really go to spending up here.\n  It is a wonderful charade. It is a lord-awful fraud. It is only up to \nthe media to cut out this nonsense about surplus when we are spending, \nthis year, $100 billion more than we are taking in. It shows from the \nPresident's own figures we will continue to spend more than we take in, \nincreasing the debt, which brings us to the $350 to $365 billion \ninterest costs on the national debt. Before long, I am going to put in \na tax allocated to really getting rid of that debt, whereby we will \ngive a $3.5-trillion tax cut, namely, get rid of that interest cost \nover the 10-year period. That is the kind of tax cut the Senator from \nSouth Carolina would like.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and agreement, the \ntime until the recess shall be under the control of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7766-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7766-S7790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INDEPENDENT COUNSEL REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to join my \ncolleagues Senators Levin, Lieberman, and Collins in introducing the \nIndependent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. Our bill would accomplish two \nimportant goals. First, it would reauthorize the institution of the \nindependent counsel for another 5 years. Second, our bill would make \nsignificant changes to the existing independent counsel statute to \ncorrect a number of problems which have become clear to all of us \nduring the course of the past few years.\n  Tomorrow, the independent counsel statute will sunset. The law is \ndying because there appears to be a consensus that it created more \nproblems than it solved. Many of us have forgotten the very serious \nproblems and conflicts that led us to pass the statute in the first \nplace. Any problems with the law can be fixed, and our bill addresses \nthe issues that have caused the most serious complaints. But it would \nbe a serious error to eliminate the institution of the independent \ncounsel.\n  Many years have passed since President Nixon's infamous Saturday \nNight Massacre. Yet it is important that we remember this episode \nbecause it is such a powerful reminder of why we\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\npassed the independent counsel statute and why the statute is still \nneeded today.\n  Before there was an independent counsel, the Attorney General \nappointed special prosecutors under his control to conduct \ninvestigations of Presidents and other high ranking officials. After \nthe Watergate break-in, Attorney General Elliot Richardson appointed \nArchibald Cox to serve as the Watergate Special Prosecutor. When \nPresident Nixon decided that Cox's investigation was getting too close \nto the truth, he sought to have Cox fired. The President was legally \nentitled to fire Cox, of course, since Cox was a Justice Department \nemployee like any other. When Attorney General Elliot Richardson \nrefused to fire Cox, Richardson was fired. When Deputy Attorney General \nWilliam Ruckelshaus refused to fire Cox, Ruckelshaus was also fired. \nFinally, Solicitor General Robert Bork agreed to fire Cox.\n  After Archibald Cox was fired, the White House announced that the \noffice of the Watergate special prosecutor was to be closed and the \nPresident's chief of staff sent the FBI to surround Cox's offices and \nseize the records he had compiled. Henry Ruth, an old friend of mine \nwho was working at the time as Archibald Cox's top deputy, described \nthe following scene in his testimony before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on March 3 of this year:\n\n       In anticipation of adverse action, we had secured copies of \n     key documents in secret locations around Washington, D.C. and \n     even removed some key items from the office that Saturday \n     night hidden in underwear and other unlikely locations. We \n     did not know whether the military would raid our homes \n     looking for documents. Unanimously, the staff of the \n     Watergate prosecutor's office just refused to leave or to \n     change anything we were doing unless someone physically \n     removed us. And if an unprecedented 450,000 telegrams of \n     spontaneous protest had not descended upon Washington, D.C. \n     in the few days after that Saturday night, no one really \n     knows if President Nixon would have succeeded in aborting the \n     investigation. In other words, we do not feel that the \n     Department of Justice was an adequate instrument for \n     investigating the President and other high officials of \n     government.\n\n  Eventually, as a result of these telegrams and enormous public \npressure, Leon Jaworski was appointed as a special prosecutor and the \nWatergate investigation was continued. But this positive outcome was \nfar from guaranteed. As Mr. Ruth reminded the committee, ``it is \nimpossible to describe how thin a thread existed at that time, and for \nthree weeks, for the continuation of what was going on.''\n  It was this dark episode, perhaps more than any other, which \nconvinced the nation that the individual investigating the President \nmust be truly independent of the President. This is a lesson we should \nhave to learn only once. While recent independent counsels have made \nsome mistakes, none of these mistakes are on the scale of a Saturday \nNight Massacre. With this history as our guide, let us move to fix the \nstatute, not eliminate it.\n  Senators Levin, Lieberman, Collins and I have all attended 5 very \ncomprehensive hearings before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee \nfrom February to April of this year. During these hearings, we heard \nfrom former independent counsels, former targets of independent \ncounsels, judges on the special division of the court which appoints \nindependent counsels, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and Attorney \nGeneral Reno. The four of us have also met repeatedly to discuss what \nis wrong with the current law and how to fix it. The bill we introduce \ntoday incorporates many of the suggestions made during these hearings \nand corrects provisions in the bill which lead to the most serious \ncomplaints.\n  First of all, we all agreed that too many independent counsels have \nbeen appointed for matters which simply do not warrant this high level \nof review. For example, I believe that Attorney General Reno made a \nmistake when she asked for appointment of an independent counsel to \ninvestigate Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman. In Secretary Herman's \ncase, there was really insufficient corroboration to justify the \nallegations made against her. To address this issue, we have raised the \nevidentiary standard which must be met before the Attorney General is \nrequired to appoint an independent counsel. The statute currently \nrequires that an independent counsel be appointed when there are \n``reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is \nwarranted.'' Our bill provides that an independent counsel must be \nappointed only when there are ``substantial grounds to believe that \nfurther investigation is warranted.'' This change will give an Attorney \nGeneral the discretion to decide that evidence she receives is not \nsufficiently strong to justify an independent counsel investigation.\n  As a further step to control the number of independent counsel \ninvestigations, our legislation limits the number of ``covered \npersons'' under the statute to the President, Vice President, members \nof the President's Cabinet, and the President's chief of staff. \nAccordingly, it would no longer be possible to appoint an independent \ncounsel to investigate lower officials and staff whom an Attorney \nGeneral could properly investigate on his or her own.\n  The four of us also agreed that it is a mistake to give an \nindependent counsel jurisdiction over more than one investigation. For \ninstance, Kenneth Starr started as the independent counsel for \nWhitewater. Attorney General Reno later expanded his jurisdiction to \ncover Travelgate, Filegate, the death of Vince Foster, and, or course, \nMonica Lewinsky. Unfortunately, the Attorney General's repeated \nexpansion of Mr. Starr's jurisdiction created the mistaken impression \nthat Mr. Starr was on a personal crusade against President Clinton, \nopening new lines of inquiry when prior ones failed to bear fruit. \nAfter Attorney General Reno expanded Mr. Starr's jurisdiction to \ninclude Monica Lewinsky, I publicly commented that this was a mistake, \nnot because Kenneth Starr was not competent to handle the \ninvestigation, but because I was afraid that the public would see this \nas yet further proof that Starr was on a vendetta. I'm afraid this is \nexactly what came to pass.\n\n  Our bill would eliminate this problem by deleting the provision which \nallows the Attorney General to expand the jurisdiction of an \nindependent counsel beyond his or her original mandate. Our bill \nfurther provides that the independent counsel can investigate only \ntopics in his original jurisdiction or those ``directly related'' \nthereto.\n  The four of us also agreed that some independent counsel \ninvestigations drag on too long. Lawrence Walsh's Iran/Contra \ninvestigation lasted 6 years. Kenneth Starr's investigation of \nPresident Clinton has been going on for almost 5 years. Investigations \nof this length are really an anomaly in our criminal justice system. \nFederal grand juries are empaneled for a period of 18 months. As \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia, I had a series of grand juries on \ncomplex topics such as municipal corruption, police corruption and \ndrugs all of which lasted 18 months. If you can't find certain facts in \n18 months, I think the odds are pretty good that you will never find \nthem.\n  Our bill sets a 2-year time limit for independent counsel \ninvestigations. Since there are some who would try to take advantage of \nthis time limit and ``run out the clock'' on an investigation, our bill \nalso empowers the special division of the court to extend this original \n2-year period for as long as necessary to make up for dilatory tactics. \nOur bill also provides that the special division can extend the \noriginal time period for good cause. Finally, the bill requires the \nFederal courts to conduct an expedited review of all matters relating \nto an investigation and a prosecution by an independent counsel.\n  Another complaint about the Starr investigation was that his report \nto Congress was a partisan document making an argument for impeachment \nrather than providing an impartial recitation of evidence. While I \nbelieve that Mr. Starr was merely doing his job when he submitted this \nreport, I do agree that requiring such a report inserts an independent \ncounsel into a process--impeachment--which should be left entirely to \nCongress. Accordingly, our bill deletes the requirement that the \nindependent counsel submit a report to Congress of any substantial and \ncredible information that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.\n  While Kenneth Starr was blamed for many things that were not his \nfault, I do believe he made a mistake when he decided to continue his \nprivate law practice while he was serving as an independent counsel. \nThe job of being an independent counsel is a privilege and an enormous \nresponsibility--it deserves someone's full time attention.\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\nAccordingly, our bill requires that an independent counsel serve on a \nfull-time basis for the duration of his or her investigation.\n  It appears that a majority of our colleagues believe that it is \nbetter to let independent counsel statute die and return to the old \ndays when special prosecutors appointed and controlled by the Attorney \nGeneral will investigate the President and his Cabinet. I am confident, \nhowever, that after the dust settles and tempers abate, our colleagues \nwill realize that the independent counsel statute provides a better way \nto handle investigations of the President and his cabinet than any of \nthe alternatives.\n  We must all remember that the independent counsel statute was passed \nto address a serious problem inherent in our system of government--the \npotential for abuse and conflicts of interest when the Attorney General \ninvestigates the President and other high-level executive branch \nofficials. After all, it is the President who appoints the Attorney \nGeneral and is the Attorney General's boss. Often the Attorney General \nand the President are close friends. Accordingly, there is an inherent \nconflict of interest in having the Attorney General control an \ninvestigation of the President or the President's closest associates. \nEven if an Attorney General were capable of conducting an impartial \ninvestigation, the appearance of a conflict of interest is serious \nenough to discredit the Attorney General's findings, especially a \nfinding of innocence.\n  The independent counsel statute is the only way to address this \ninherent conflict of interest. As memories of the Saturday Night \nMassacre have been supplanted by memories of Kenneth Starr, the \npendulum of public opinion has swung too far against the statute. I am \nconfident that as soon as the Attorney General begins to investigate \nhis or her colleagues in the White House, the pendulum will swing back \nin the opposite direction. When this occurs, I believe that our \ncolleagues will see that our approach is the best approach--to fix the \nproblems in the statute, not abandon it.\n  To reiterate, the existing independent counsel statute is set to \nexpire by sunset provisions tomorrow, June 30. There have been a series \nof five extensive hearings held in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nchaired by our distinguished colleague, Senator Thompson. During the \ncourse of those hearings, attended by all four of the cosponsors of \nthis legislation, we have heard extensive testimony. The four of us \nhave met on a number of occasions to craft the legislation which we are \nintroducing today.\n  Our fundamental conclusion is that the Attorney General, acting \nthrough the Department of Justice, has an irreconcilable conflict of \ninterest when it comes to investigating top officials of the \nadministration. This is a judgment which we come to from our various \npoints of view. My own perspective is molded significantly by my \nexperience as district attorney of Philadelphia, knowing in detail the \nwork of a prosecuting attorney, and the backdrop of the independent \ncounsel statute was the ``Saturday Night Massacre,'' where President \nNixon was under investigation and fired two Attorneys General until he \nfound one who would fire the special prosecutor, Archibald Cox.\n  What is not recollected, but was testified to at our hearings by \nHenry Ruth, later the special prosecutor succeeding Leon Jaworski, was \nthat at a critical moment, when President Nixon decided to eliminate \nthe special prosecutor, the President's Chief of Staff sent the FBI to \nsurround the office of the special prosecutor and to seize the special \nprosecutor's papers. As Henry Ruth outlined it, those in the office \ntook key documents hidden under their clothing, not knowing what would \nhappen next. It was only the public outrage, and some 450,000 telegrams \nwhich descended on Washington, which led President Nixon to change his \nposition.\n  But the importance of independence in the prosecutor's office cannot \nbe overly emphasized. We have seen experiences with independent \ncounsels, two to be specific, that by Judge Walsh, former Judge Walsh, \nwho investigated President Reagan's administration in Iran-contra, and \nJudge Starr, former Judge Starr, who investigated President Clinton, \nwhere those two investigations have drawn the wrath on both sides of \nthe political aisle. There does appear to be a consensus at the moment \nthat there ought not be a renewal of the independent counsel statute. I \npersonally believe, and Senators Lieberman, Levin, and Collins concur, \nthat this is a fundamental mistake. So we have worked from the mistakes \nof the past to craft a reform bill, and we have targeted the errors.\n  Sooner or later a crisis will arise in Washington. It happens all the \ntime. The crisis will be about the need to investigate the President or \nthe Vice President or some ranking official.\n  The question will present itself about the inherent conflict of \ninterest of the Attorney General, and this statute will be available to \ndeal with the problem.\n  We have dealt with the mistakes of Walsh-Starr investigations by \nlimiting the subjects. Only the President, Vice President, Attorney \nGeneral, and Cabinet members will be subject to investigation. There \nwill not be an expansion of jurisdiction unless directly related to the \ncentral charge, which would eliminate the Monica Lewinsky \ninvestigation.\n  The independent counsel would have to be full time. I know from my \ndays as district attorney it was impossible to do the job full time, \nbut that ought to be a minimal requirement. We have imposed a time \nlimit of some 2 years to be extended for cause, or to be extended \nautomatically for delaying tactics, or by priority given by appellate \ncourts on any legal issues raised. The independent counsel would have \nto submit an annual budget.\n  My colleagues are on the floor awaiting recognition. I inquire of the \nChair how much of the 30 minutes has elapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We reserve the remainder of the time, and in accordance \nwith our procedure of alternating between the parties, Senator Levin \nhas been on the floor but has found it necessary to absent himself for \na moment. I yield to Senator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining today with my friends \nand colleagues, Senators Specter, Levin, and Collins, in introducing \nthe Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. With this bill, we hope to \nconvince our colleagues, disillusioned perhaps by the conduct of \nparticular investigations, that the Independent Counsel statute serves \nan essential purpose, and has served us well over the past twenty \nyears. We want to convince our colleagues that our legislation will \npreserve the essential ideals that motivated the enactment of this \nstatute in the years after Watergate, that no person is above the law, \nand that our highest government officials must be subject to our laws \nin the same way as any other person. If they are guilty, they must be \nheld accountable. If they are not, they must be cleared. The American \npeople are more likely to trust the findings of an Independent \nCounsel's investigation and conclusions. Officials who are wrongly \naccused will receive vindication that is far more credible to the \npublic than when it comes from the Department of Justice. As a result, \nthe public's confidence in its government is enhanced by the \nIndependent Counsel statute.\n  We have drafted new provisions that will curb the excesses we have \nseen in a few recent investigations. These changes are substantial. The \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs held five hearings on the Independent \nCounsel statute. We heard from numerous witnesses who had served as \nIndependent Counsel, and as Attorney General, from former prosecutors \nand from defense attorneys. Many witnesses supported the statute, even \ndefense attorneys who had represented targets in Independent Counsel \ninvestigations. Both witnesses who opposed the statute outright, and \nthose who advocated keeping it in some form, suggested a number of \nimprovements to the statute. We carefully considered those \nrecommendations before we sat down to draft a bill that retains the \nessential features of the old law while reducing its scope, limiting \nthe powers of the Independent Counsel, and bringing greater \ntransparency into the process.\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n  As a result of our bill, there will be far fewer Independent Counsel \nappointed, they will be appointed only to investigate the highest \ngovernment officials, and their actions will be constrained by the same \nsorts of guidelines and practical restraints that govern regular \nfederal prosecutors.\n  For example, officials covered by the statute will be limited to the \nPresident, the Vice President, the President's Chief of Staff, and \nCabinet members. This is a major reduction in the number of officials \ncurrently covered by the Independent Counsel statute. We can trust the \nDepartment of Justice to investigate the mid-level officials listed in \nprevious versions of the statute. If any other investigation raises a \nconflict of interest, the Attorney General retains the authority to \nappoint her own Special Counsel. The purpose of our bill is to reserve \nthe extraordinary mechanism of a court-appointed Independent Counsel \nfor those rare cases involving allegations against our highest \nExecutive Branch officials.\n  In another change that will reduce the number of Independent Counsel \nappointed, the threshold for seeking the appointment of an Independent \nCounsel will be raised, so that a greater amount of evidence to back up \nthe allegation will be required. The Attorney General will also be \nentitled for the first time to issue subpoenas for evidence and convene \ngrand juries during the preliminary investigation, and would be given \nmore time to conduct the preliminary investigation. This change \nresponds to concerns that, in the past, the Attorney General's hands \nhave been tied during the preliminary investigation stage. With our \nbill, the Department of Justice will be able to conduct a more \nsubstantial preliminary investigation.\n  Each Independent Counsel will have to devote his full time to the \nposition for the duration of his tenure. This will prevent the \nappearance of conflicts that may arise when an Independent Counsel \ncontinues with his private legal practice, and it will expedite \ninvestigations as well. The Independent Counsel will also be expected \nto conform his conduct to the written guidelines and established \npolicies of the Department of Justice. The prior version of that \nrequirement contained a broad loophole, which has been eliminated.\n  There have been many complaints about runaway prosecutors, who \ncontinue their investigations longer than is necessary or appropriate. \nOur bill will impose a time limit of two years on investigations by \nIndependent Counsel. The Special Division of the Court of Appeals will \nbe able to grant extensions of time, however, for good cause and to \ncompensate for dilatory tactics by opposing counsel. Imposing a \nflexible time limit allows Independent Counsel the time they genuinely \nneed to complete their investigations, and deters adverse counsel from \nusing the time limit strategically to escape justice. But the time \nlimit will also encourage future Independent Counsel to bring their \ninvestigations to an expeditious conclusion, and not chase down every \nimaginable lead.\n  Our bill makes another important change that will prevent expansion \nof investigations into unrelated areas. Until now the statute has \nallowed the Attorney General to request an expansion of an Independent \nCounsel's prosecutorial jurisdiction into unrelated areas. This \nhappened several times with Judge Starr's investigation, and I believe \nthose expansions contributed to a perception that the prosecutor was \npursuing the man and not the crime. An Independent Counsel must not \nexist to pursue every possible lead against his target until he finds \nsome taint of criminality. His function, our bill makes clear, is to \ninvestigate that subject matter given him in his original grant of \nprosecutorial jurisdiction.\n  We also considered how we might impose greater budgetary restraints \non Independent Counsel. Some have spoken of the need for a strict \nbudget cap, but this idea strikes me as impractical, if not unworkable. \nIt's just impossible to know in advance what crimes a prosecutor will \nuncover, how far his investigation will have to go to get to the truth, \nhow expensive a trial and any appeals will be. Instead, we are bringing \ngreater budgetary transparency to the process by directing Independent \nCounsel to produce an estimated budget for each year, and by allowing \nthe General Accounting Office to comment on that budget. At the moment \nnot enough is known about how Independent Counsel spend their money, \nand this greater transparency will provide more incentive for Counsel \nto budget responsibly.\n  A final change that we all readily agreed to was to eliminate \nentirely the requirement that an Independent Counsel refer evidence of \nimpeachable offenses to the House of Representatives. The impeachment \npower is one of Congress's essential Constitutional functions, and no \npart of that role should be delegated by statute to a prosecutor.\n  This bill should be thought of as a work in progress. We hope to \ngather input from other Members and from outside experts, and to have \ncommittee hearings, and we intend to be flexible about incorporating \nsuggestions. Some of the provisions contained in the bill may raise \nconstitutional concerns, which need to be fully explored. For example, \ngiving the Special Division of the Court of Appeals new authority to \ndecide whether an Independent Counsel has violated Department of \nJustice guidelines may violate the doctrine of Separation of Powers. \nOther provisions expanding the Court's role may also have to be \nreformulated. I hope that all interested parties will be able to work \ntogether on amendments as harmoniously as the four of us did in \ndrafting the original legislation.\n  The occasion of our introducing this legislation is tomorrow's \nexpiration of the current Independent Counsel statute. Many have \ndismissed any efforts to revive the Independent Counsel as wrong and \nfutile. No doubt it will be an uphill struggle, and I do not expect \npeoples' minds to be changed overnight. But I do believe that over time \nseveral factors will work to change peoples' minds.\n  First, I feel confident that we can convince our colleagues that this \nlegislation is a better product than previous versions of the statute, \nand addresses the specific concerns raised by the law's opponents. \nThose who have predicted the death of the Independent Counsel statute \nhad not seen our legislation. I will work tirelessly, with the bill's \nother co-sponsors, to convince our colleagues to give this issue a \nfresh look.\n  Secondly, several controversial Independent Counsel investigations \nhave clearly soured some people on the law. This is understandable, but \nit is regrettable, as I do not believe these investigations revealed \nany flaws in the Independent Counsel statute that cannot be fixed. The \npassions raised by Judge Starr's investigation of the President, in \nparticular, must be allowed to subside, just as it took some time for \nthe passions inspired by the Iran-Contra investigation to subside \nbefore the Independent Counsel statute could be re-authorized in 1994.\n  Finally, as these passions subside I believe Members of Congress will \ngradually be reminded that the Independent Counsel statute embodies \ncertain principles fundamental to our democracy. The alternative to an \nIndependent Counsel statute is a system in which the Attorney General \nmust decide how to handle substantive allegations against colleagues in \nthe Cabinet, or against the President. Often the President and the \nAttorney General are long-time friends and political allies. The \nAttorney General will not be trusted by some to ensure that an unbiased \ninvestigation will be conducted. In other cases, many will question the \nthoroughness of an investigation directed from inside the Department. \nIn a time of great public cynicism about government, the Independent \nCounsel statute guarantees that even the President and his highest \nofficials will have to answer for their criminal malfeasance. In that \nsense, this statute upholds the rule of law and will help stem the \nrising tide of cynicism and distrust toward our government. The \nAmerican people support the Independent Counsel statute because it \nembodies the bedrock American principle that no person is above the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining today Senator Specter, \nSenator Levin and Senator Collins in introducing the Independent \nCounsel Reform Act of 1999. It has been a great pleasure working with \nthese three colleagues across party lines in what were, first, long \nhearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee on which we all serve, \nand then some very good\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\ncollegial discussions about how to preserve the principles involved in \nthe Independent Counsel Act while responding to what we have learned, \nparticularly in its recent existence and implementation. We have \nachieved a good balance.\n  The point to stress--and my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania \nhas just done it--is this is all about the rule of law which is at the \nheart of what the American experience is about, that no one is above \nthe law. There is no monarchy, there is no autocracy. Everyone is \nsupposed to be governed by the same law.\n  The question is, When the highest officials of our Government, the \nmost powerful people in this land are suspected of criminal wrongdoing, \nis it appropriate to have those suspicions investigated by the people \nwho are suspected themselves or by those whom they have appointed? Does \nthat guarantee a thorough and independent investigation, and does it \nguarantee or at least encourage the kinds of broad-based public \nacceptance of the credibility of that investigation that is critical to \nthe trust and respect that we hope the American people will have for \ntheir Government?\n  The four of us have answered that what is required is a counsel who \nis not just special, as others would provide, including the current \nAttorney General, but one that is genuinely independent, not appointed \nby the Attorney General, and not able to be fired, dismissed by the \nAttorney General.\n  My research has indicated that from the last century right through \nthe Nixon administration, from President Ulysses Grant to President \nRichard Nixon, there were actually six special counsel appointed to \ninvestigate possible criminal behavior by high officials of the \nGovernment, and three of those were dismissed by the administration \nthey served, presumably because they began to act in a way that \nunsettled that administration.\n  That is the principle of the rule of law, trust in Government, which \nwe tried to embody in this proposal with the changes that Senator \nSpecter has mentioned. We have added a presumption of a limited term, a \nhigher threshold for the appointment of an independent counsel, a \nsmaller number of people to be subject to this statute--the President, \nVice President, Attorney General, Members of the Cabinet and the Chief \nof Staff.\n  The prevailing consensus in this body and the other body is that we \nshould not renew this statute and it will, of course, expire tomorrow. \nMany have dismissed the efforts we are making now as either wrong or \nfutile. No doubt it will be an uphill struggle, but I am convinced it \nis the right struggle, and we can convince our colleagues of the \njustness of our cause.\n  I will say something else, Mr. President. There will be an \nindependent counsel statute in the future. We are either going to adopt \nit at a time when we are not in crisis, when somebody high up in our \nGovernment is suspected of criminal wrongdoing--and that is our hope, \nthat we do not adopt it in the spirit of crisis, or we will adopt it at \nthat time when someone is suspected of criminal wrongdoing and Members \nof this body and the other body will demand there not be a special \ncounsel appointed by the Attorney General but an independent counsel.\n  I plead with my colleagues, as the law is allowed to expire tomorrow \nand as, hopefully, we have a cooling off period, to take a look at our \nproposal, to try to separate ourselves from the controversies \nsurrounding Judge Starr's time as independent counsel and that of other \nrecent independent counsel, and focus on the principle of the rule of \nlaw, that nobody is above the law in America, and to come to agree with \nus that the best way to preserve those principles is by readopting an \nIndependent Counsel Act, one that is substantially reformed.\n\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I inquire how much time has elapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven and a half minutes has elapsed. Under \nthe previous order, the Senator has control of all time until 12:35 \np.m.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, Mr. Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania, \nand I commend him and Senators Collins and Lieberman for their effort \nin putting together a bill which we believe represents lessons learned \nbut also represents the feeling that we need to have an independent \ncounsel law, that sooner or later it will again appear that this \ncountry needs a way in which to independently investigate allegations \nof serious wrongdoing against high-level officials.\n  The independent counsel law expires tomorrow. It was enacted in 1978 \nto establish a nonpartisan process for investigating allegations of \ncriminal conduct by top executive branch officials. The key purpose of \nthe law is to retain public confidence in criminal investigations when \nthe Government investigates its highest officials. The goal is to treat \ntop Federal officials no better and equally important, no worse than a \nprivate citizen, and at the end of the investigation, when the judgment \nis rendered, be it a statement of guilt or innocence, to have the \npublic accept that judgment as a fair and impartial one.\n  Over the years, there have been many successful investigations by \nindependent counsels, most of which resulted in no indictments or \nprosecutions but resolved outstanding allegations without partisanship \nor favor. There have been 20 independent counsel investigations in 20 \nyears. Ten of those were closed without indictment; one was closed \nbecause of the death of the covered person. Excluding the top five most \nexpensive investigations, the average cost of an independent counsel \ninvestigation was under $1 million. And for all but a handful of the \ncases investigated by independent counsel, the results of the \ninvestigations have had the public's confidence.\n\n  While some say the lesson of Watergate was that the previous system \nworked, I would refer our colleagues to the testimony of Henry Ruth, \nwho was in charge of the Watergate special prosecution force during the \nSaturday Night Massacre. Referring to the possibility that the coverup \nby President Nixon could succeed, Mr. Ruth said, ``It is impossible to \ndescribe how thin a thread existed at that time.''\n  But the independent counsel law, while working most of the time, has \nalso been abused by a few overzealous prosecutors. These prosecutors \nhave made it apparent that before we reauthorize an independent counsel \nlaw, it would need to be dramatically revised to prevent a recurrence \nof the abuses that we have seen. The bill we are introducing today \nrepresents the lessons learned, while saving the essential elements of \nthe independent counsel law to preserve public confidence in the \nprosecution of our top Government officials.\n  Our bill would, among other things, change the law in the following \nways.\n  First, it would preclude an independent counsel from broadening an \ninvestigation to matters not within the original grant of jurisdiction.\n  Second, it would enforce the requirement that independent counsel \nfollow the established policies of the Department of Justice by giving \naffected persons the opportunity to challenge questionable independent \ncounsel actions not in line with those policies.\n  Third, it would eliminate the requirement for an independent counsel \nto submit an impeachment report to the House of Representatives.\n  Fourth, it would prohibit persons with an apparent or real conflict \nof interest from serving as independent counsel.\n  And, fifth, it would establish a presumptive 2-year term for an \nindependent counsel's investigation.\n  Those are just five of the many major changes that would be made in \nthe independent counsel law.\n  A handful of independent counsels have exceeded the intent of the \nindependent counsel law and have taken the law to places that U.S. \nAttorneys would not go when investigating private citizens.\n  Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz took 4 years and spent $20 million \ninvestigating allegations of graft in the Agriculture Department. Yet \nhis 2-month trial of former Secretary Mike Espy ended in an acquittal \non all 30 counts of corruption. Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Court \nthrew out Smaltz' conviction of Sun-Diamond Growers of California, \nconcluding that\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\nSmaltz and a Federal district court had stretched the law to punish \nbehavior that is not a crime.\n  The independent counsel for Samuel Pierce, Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development under President Reagan, was in existence for almost \n10 years, and that included almost 4 years after the independent \ncounsel publicly announced he had closed the case with respect to Mr. \nPierce.\n  Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr has singlehandedly done \nmore to undermine public confidence in the independent counsel law than \nanybody else. Well over half the American people think that Kenneth \nStarr is partisan and do not trust him to be fair. The editorials \nexpressing concern about Mr. Starr's investigation and judgment are \nvoluminous.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that six of those editorials \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, July 8, 1998]\n\n                         Whither Kenneth Starr?\n\n       Whitewater Independent Counselor Kenneth Starr continues to \n     disappoint his friends and delight his enemies in his long-\n     running investigation of President Clinton.\n       In a week in which Linda Tripp twice testified before one \n     of the three grand juries Starr convened during his four-\n     year, $40 million investigation, he was slapped down by a \n     federal judge who ruled that he exceeded his authority in \n     prosecuting former Associate Attorney General Webster \n     Hubbell.\n       In a stinging 35-page opinion, U.S. District Judge James \n     Robertson threw out the tax evasion indictment of Hubbell, \n     his wife, his accountant and his tax lawyer, declaring that \n     Starr had gone on ``the quintessential fishing expedition'' \n     in subpoenaing some 13,000 pages of records from Hubbell \n     after granting him immunity and then using them to build his \n     case against Hubbell.\n       Starr's behavior toward Hubbell and the late Vince Foster \n     was clearly indefensible. He showed a flagrant disregard for \n     the Constitution by trying to create an exception from the \n     lawyer-client privilege in the Foster case, but he went even \n     further by ignoring Hubbell's constitutional right against \n     self-incrimination when he improperly used information he got \n     from Hubbell under a grant of immunity.\n       The ruling was the latest in a series of legal and public \n     relations setbacks for Starr. Even as he defended himself \n     against charges by media watchdog Steven Brill that he \n     improperly leaked information about the Monica Lewinsky \n     investigation to reporters, Starr was rebuffed by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court, which rejected his claim that Vincent Foster's \n     right to the lawyer-client privilege ended with his death.\n       Starr also was put on the defensive by news reports that \n     Tripp asked Lewinsky leading questions about her relationship \n     with President Clinton as she was secretly tape recording the \n     former White House intern. Tripp denied the reports in her \n     grand jury testimony, according to her lawyer.\n       But Starr seems undeterred by his latest problems. He \n     immediately announced he will appeal the Hubbell decision, \n     even though it is almost certain to further delay the \n     conclusion of his investigation, even as some Republicans \n     hoped he would deliver an interim report to Congress before \n     they hit the campaign trail this fall. Starr's spokesman said \n     Sunday he won't submit an interim report, but will take as \n     long as he needs to determine if there is ``substantial and \n     credible information'' that crimes have been committed.\n       Meanwhile, Starr's investigation continues to expand--he \n     now employs approximately 60 people, including 28 attorneys, \n     not counting FBI agents working for him, and recently added \n     7,400 square feet of office space and opened a new office in \n     Alexandria, Va.\n       Starr's ultra-marathon probe still has a long way to go,be \n     he should keep in mind the original intent of the independent \n     counsel law, which was to assure a fair and impartial \n     investigation of high government officials. His recent \n     actions indicate that he's forgotten, or lost sight of, the \n     fundamental fact that our criminal justice systems works well \n     only when it ears the respect and confidence of the American \n     people.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1998]\n\n                        Ken Starr's Misjudgments\n\n       It has long been apparent that Ken Starr has a tin ear for \n     political appearances and public relations, but his decision \n     to subpoena a White House aide, Sidney Blumenthal, undermines \n     important legal and constitutional principles. On the \n     tactical level, this move by the Independent Counsel is bone \n     stupid. As a matter of principle, it is an attack on press \n     freedom and the unrestricted flow of information that is \n     unwarranted by the facts and beyond his mandate as a \n     prosecutor.\n       This latest blunder fits a pattern of chronic clumsiness \n     and periodic insensitivity to Mr. Starr's public \n     responsibilities. His attempt to slough off his public duty \n     and flee to Pepperdine University was dismaying. His \n     political ties and refusal to give up private legal clients \n     led us, in times past, to call for his removal. In four years \n     he has failed to develop sensitivity to his obligations as \n     custodian of an inquiry of national import. Apparently his \n     staff contains no one who can talk him out of bad ideas.\n       This time he has failed in his obligation to the law \n     itself. The effort to collect the name of every journalist \n     who talked with a White House communications specialist \n     amounts to a perverse use of the prosecutorial mandate to \n     learn what the Nixon White House attempted to determine \n     through wire-taps. Like any newspaper, we have an obvious \n     selfish interest in the confidentiality of the reporting \n     process. But you do not have to be a journalist to see that \n     Mr. Starr has committed an ignorant assault on one of the \n     most distinctive and essential elements of American \n     democracy.\n       Mr. Starr created this mess by following a bad example. Two \n     weeks ago the White House started its own demagogic search \n     for leaks in an effort to divert attention from the question \n     whether President Clinton and his associates had committed \n     perjury or suborned others to commit it. Mr. Starr may also \n     be miffed by reports that the White House has turned its \n     trademark tool of personal attack on his prosecutorial staff. \n     But he does not need to follow that pernicious example. He is \n     armed with something more honorable and powerful in the \n     mandate of the Attorney General and the majesty of the law.\n       But civic health demands that Mr. Starr get on with the \n     investigation he is authorized to conduct and bring it to a \n     speedy conclusion. The public interest does not lie in Mr. \n     Blumenthal's phone records. It lies in getting, as promptly \n     as possible, the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan, \n     Bruce Lindsey, Mr. Clinton and others whose testimony bears \n     directly on the issue of false swearing.\n       In a tightly reasoned article in the National Journal, \n     Stuart Taylor Jr. defended Mr. Starr's investigative \n     procedures, including calling Ms. Lewinsky's mother before \n     the grand jury, but called for him to resign in favor of \n     someone with less political baggage. We are not at that \n     point, because of the amount of time that would be lost. If \n     at all possible, the nation needs to have this business \n     driven to a conclusion without the delay that a switch in \n     leadership would entail. Every time Mr. Starr goes off on one \n     of these tangents or misreads the law he fritters away \n     support from those who believe in the importance of this \n     inquiry but bridle at his loco-weed judgments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 25, 1998]\n\n                   A Prosecutor Without Public Trust\n\n                          (By Albert R. Hunt)\n\n       When Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr continued to \n     represent tobacco companies and spoke to the law school run \n     by televangelist Pat Robertson--two of President Clinton's \n     arch enemies--his supporters insisted he wasn't a partisan. \n     He just lacked political judgment.\n       When he announced he was going to leave early and accept a \n     deanship at Pepperdine University, partially funded by right-\n     wing Clinton-hater Richard Mellon Scaife, the Starr chorus \n     claimed he wasn't insensitive. He lacked political judgment.\n       Or when he acknowledged in a lengthy, on-the-record \n     interview with publisher Steven Brill that his office, in \n     essence, had leaked to the press during the Clinton \n     investigation, again Mr. Starr's supporters insisted he \n     wasn't part of the right-wing conspiracy. Again, he just \n     lacked political judgment.\n       Let's accept the word of Mr. Starr's legal, political and \n     journalistic allies. He's not a right-wing partisan out to \n     destroy the president. He is an inexperienced prosecutor who \n     lacks political judgment. This is the man deciding whether to \n     bring a controversial case in a political setting against the \n     President of the United States.\n       No matter how this sordid episode unfolds in the ensuring \n     months. Mr. Starr already has failed miserably in the central \n     role of a special prosecutor; to engender public confidence \n     that he is fair, impartial and independent.\n       This week's Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that \n     Americans think that he is none of the above. People are sick \n     of his investigation, don't believe that what he is \n     investigating is serious enough to even consider impeachment \n     and hold Mr. Starr, far more than the president, responsible \n     for the four year, $40 million inquiry.\n       Most devastating for Mr. Starr is that nearly three-\n     quarters of the respondents have little confidence that the \n     report the independent counsel is expected to send to \n     Congress will be fair and impartial; even a majority of \n     Republicans feel that way.\n       Mr. Starr still holds some prosecutorial cards. Say he \n     makes a few headline indictments and assume his report to \n     Congress seems compelling. If this is so persuasive it turns \n     around one-third of the doubters--an ambitious achievement--\n     the country would still be split, making it difficult to \n     consider impeachment.\n       ``In every instance in which the public is asked to select \n     between Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr, the public \n     consistently lines up on the president's side,'' note Peter \n     Hart and Robert Teeter, who conducted the survey.\n       This is not a new problem for the independent counsel. But \n     just as he's rounding into what may be the final turn, his \n     public credibility is lower than ever. This reflects, a few \n     detached prosecutors suggest, his inexperience as a \n     prosecutor, a second rate staff\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\n     and an obsession to topple the president which causes him to \n     overreach.\n       Mr. Starr's supporters--many of whom are obsessively \n     hostile to the president--say a prosecutor can't be driven by \n     polls. A decision on whether to subpoena or indict someone \n     should be made on the legal merits and not on whether it will \n     curry favor with the public.\n       But if any prosecutor lacks public support, that fatally \n     undermines his or her task; in a democracy if people don't \n     believe justice is being served, the system, by definition, \n     isn't working.\n       In fact, prosecutors who go after crooked politicians, \n     mobsters or businessmen tend to be very popular with the \n     public. From Thomas Dewey to Rudy Guiliani, such prosecutions \n     have been promising stepping stones to higher office. \n     Occasionally a prosecutor over-reaches and stumbles; New \n     Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison in the Kennedy \n     assassination and more recently Los Angeles DA Ira Reiner \n     after a flawed prosecution of alleged child abuse. Such \n     blunders are rare.\n       The Starr camp replies that independent counsels have never \n     been so criticized by opponents and potential targets. That \n     will come as news to Iran-Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence \n     Walsh.\n       In 1992, Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole repeatedly charged that \n     Mr. Walsh was ``completely out of control,'' Earlier, Rep. \n     Henry Hyde complained the Walsh investigation was of \n     ``essentially minor violations.'' Terry Eastland, a former \n     top Justice Department official under Ronald Reagan, charged \n     that the Walsh inquiry had been a ``waste of money,'' having \n     spent more than $18.5 million of taxpayer funds. President \n     Bush complained it ``has been investigated over and over \n     again. . . . It's been going on for years.''\n       The notion that Mr. Starr has been a naive, defenseless \n     target was undercut by Mr. Brill's controversial article last \n     week, in which the independent counsel acknowledged that his \n     deputy, Jackie Bennett, spends more than a little time with \n     the press. That's not a surprise. One can disagree with some \n     of Mr. Brill's sweeping conclusions about the independent \n     counsel and the press and still have contempt for Mr. Starr's \n     pious hypocrisy for pretending earlier that he was above the \n     dirty business of leaking.\n       Ironically, what infuriates many conservatives is that Mr. \n     Clinton is getting away without paying any price. That's \n     simply not the case. Based on polls, and especially on \n     anecdotal evidence from outside the Beltway, many--probably \n     most--Americans think the president had a sexual relationship \n     with Monica Lewinsky and lied about it.\n       They don't want him tarred and feathered or thrown out of \n     office for these indiscretions--a typical response is that \n     most people lie about sex--but it's affected their view of \n     him. His high job approval ratings reflect the terrific \n     economy. Bill Clinton today is a much discredited president \n     with virtually no moral authority. The latest example is the \n     tobacco bill, where he was simply unable to rally public and \n     congressional support.\n       A few weeks ago a delightful retired couple in Carmel \n     Valley, Calif., Earl and Miriam Selby, talked about how for \n     the first time in 30 years of marriage they were arguing \n     about politics. Earl Selby, a former newspaperman and \n     magazine writer, who proudly notes he cast his first vote for \n     FDR's third term in 1940, is ``outraged at how Clinton has \n     lowered respect for the presidency.'' Miriam, a former \n     magazine writer, is equally ``outraged at Starr's tactics and \n     prosecutorial abuse.''\n       There is no need for an argument, Selbys. You both are \n     right.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 22, 1998]\n\n                        Politics by Other Means\n\n                           (By Anthony Lewis)\n\n       Kenneth Starr likes to say that he is going ``by the book'' \n     in his investigation of President Clinton and Monica \n     Lewinsky. The relevant book is the Justice Department's Rules \n     of Conduct, published in the Code of Federal Regulations.\n       Rule 77.5 says that a Government lawyer ``may not \n     communicate'' with a party ``who the attorney for the \n     government knows is represented by an attorney concerning the \n     subject matter of the representation without the consent of \n     the lawyer representing such a party.''\n       On Jan. 16 Mr. Starr's office arranged to have Linda Tripp \n     meet Monica Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon \n     City. Suddenly Mr. Starr's agents descended on Ms. Lewinsky. \n     They questioned her for many hours.\n       Ms. Lewinsky was represented by Francis D. Carter, who was \n     negotiating for her with Paula Jones' lawyers. Mr. Starr did \n     not ask Mr. Carter's consent to speak with his client, or \n     even inform him.\n       Violation of that rule was not a light matter. The \n     Independent Counsel Act requires such a counsel to follow \n     Justice Department regulations unless that would undermine \n     the purpose of the act--which respecting the right to a \n     lawyer plainly would not--and makes failure to obey the rules \n     ``good cause'' for the Attorney General to remove the \n     counsel.\n       Mr. Starr has also violated, wholesale, the rules against \n     prosecutors talking to the press about pending \n     investigations. If anyone doubted that, it has now been made \n     unanswerably clear by Steven Brill's meticulous marshaling of \n     the evidence in the first issue of Brill's Content.\n       In his angry reply to the article, Mr. Starr never denied \n     saying to Mr. Brill: ``I have talked with reporters on \n     background on some occasions, but Jackie [Bennett Jr., his \n     deputy] has been the primary person involved in that. He has \n     spent much of his time talking to individual reporters.''\n       Mr. Brill said that the Starr and Bennett talks with the \n     press violated Rule 6e of the Federal Rules of Criminal \n     Procedure, which forbid disclosure of grand-jury information. \n     Mr. Starr argued in reply that Rule 6e did not apply because \n     he and his staff disclosed not grand-jury testimony but \n     information obtained elsewhere and comments on it.\n       Whatever the merits of the legal argument about Rule 6e, \n     didn't the Starr leaks violate ethical rules and Justice \n     Department regulations? When Mr. Brill asked that question, \n     Mr. Starr replied that they would be violations except when \n     he was ``countering misinformation'' about his office. ``We \n     have a duty to promote confidence in the work of this \n     office.''\n       What a breathtaking assertion. It means that whenever \n     anyone disagrees with him, Mr. Starr has a right to break the \n     rules and become an unnamed source for some journalist ready \n     to convey his version of the story. In politics, that is \n     called spinning.\n       Mr. Starr's assertion that his leaks are only to counter \n     misinformation was also false. On the day the Lewinsky story \n     broke, Jan. 21, Mr. Starr told Mr. Brill, Jackie Bennett \n     spent ``much of the day briefing the press.'' That was before \n     there was any ``misinformation'' to answer.\n       Mr. Starr's veracity is in question on another matter. The \n     Brill article says Michael Isikoff of Newsweek told Mr. Brill \n     that Jackie Bennett asked him to hold up writing about Monica \n     Lewinsky in January because ``they were going to try to get \n     Lewinsky to wire herself and get [Vernon] Jordan and maybe \n     even the President on tape obstructing justice.''\n       Mr. Starr said his office had ``never asked Ms. Lewinsky to \n     agree to wire herself for a conversion with Mr. Jordan or the \n     President.'' But it was not only Mr. Isikoff who said that \n     happened. Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers said in February, in Time \n     magazine, that the prosecutors ``wanted her wired . . . to \n     record telephone calls with the President of the U.S., Vernon \n     Jordan and others''--and made her consent a condition of \n     being given immunity from prosecution.\n       We all know that prosecutors leak. But Kenneth Starr has \n     been so sanctimonious, so insistent that he never leaks.\n       Far from going ``by the book,'' he has in many ways abused \n     his extraordinary power. Most Americans perceive that. Others \n     are so critical of President Clinton that they overlook Mr. \n     Starr's abuses. They need reminding that however tempting the \n     target of a prosecutor, the end does not justify abusive \n     means.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 26, 1998]\n\n                       Starr Steps Out of Bounds\n\n       Special counsel Kenneth W. Starr plans today to bring a \n     White House advisor and his records before a grand jury to \n     try to find out what he said to reporters about the Monica \n     Lewinsky affair. The basis for this extraordinary assault on \n     privacy is Starr's suspicion that Clinton administration \n     aides have been spreading ``misinformation'' about personnel \n     in the special counsel's office. As Starr sees it, that could \n     represent an effort to ``intimidate prosecutors and \n     investigators, impede the work of the grand jury, or \n     otherwise obstruct justice.'' All of these are federal \n     crimes.\n       The subpoena that Starr has issued for White House aide \n     Sidney Blumenthal and his records appears to be allowable \n     under the special counsel's broad powers. At the same time \n     Starr is clearly treading on highly problematical ground with \n     his suggestion that any White House campaign to try to \n     discredit him or his investigators may represent an illegal \n     effort to influence or interfere with the work of prosecutors \n     or grand jurors.\n       Starr has spent a lot of time in Washington, enough to \n     grasp the difference between engaging in hardball politics \n     and committing a felony. And he has been a lawyer long enough \n     to understand that constitutionally protected comment about \n     the special counsel's office does not constitute a \n     conspiratorial attempt to subvert justice.\n       The truth is that in the Lewinsky investigation both the \n     independent counsel and the White House have been playing the \n     game of media manipulation to the hilt, using leaks, planted \n     stories, spin control and anything else--some of it pretty \n     nasty stuff indeed--to try to shape public opinion.\n       What set Starr off were stories about judicial criticism or \n     penalties levied against two of his prosecutors because of \n     their professional conduct years ago. What the two did is a \n     matter of public record. But Starr says many other \n     allegations about personnel involved in his investigation are \n     deliberate falsehoods, and so he has dubiously raised the \n     felonious specter of attempted intimidation.\n       But intimidation can cut two ways. Surely hauling a White \n     House political adviser and his log of press contacts before \n     a grand jury can be seen as a sly attempt to keep Clinton \n     loyalists from talking with the media, denying the public \n     information it has a right to hear and evaluate for itself. \n     That is not within Starr's mandate.\n       The special counsel was not hired to act as a censor. His \n     investigation has often been accused of ranging wide afield. \n     This time it has stumbled right off the map.\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n              [From the Detroit Free Press, Feb. 26, 1998]\n\n                              Starr's War\n\n       Whatever else Kenneth Starr may accomplish, he's becoming \n     the best brief for the abolition of the special prosecutor's \n     office that anybody could ever imagine. He is exercising \n     power without wisdom, power without restraint. His latest \n     wave of subpoenas is an attempt to use the grand jury process \n     to punish his critics, an outrageous misuse of prosecutorial \n     gunpowder.\n       What does Mr. Starr's current onslaught have to do with \n     Whitewater? What does it have to do even with Monica \n     Lewinsky? Mr. Starr is angry that someone at the White House \n     has dredged up old newspaper stories that suggest he's got a \n     couple of pit bulls on his staff, one of whom was once cited \n     for overzealousness in a previous job as a prosecutor. So \n     faxing old New York Daily News stories around, apparently, \n     has just become a federal crime\n       Mr. Starr is out to bring down the president, and he seems \n     not to care if he brings down the integrity of the justice \n     system with him. The president's defenders, meanwhile, are \n     whipping up the press to investigate the investigators, \n     blasting Mr. Starr for leaks from his own staff and in \n     general tipping over garbage cans in the hope that the \n     clangor will distract attention from the potential \n     obstruction of justice charge that hangs over the president.\n       This is unseemly behavior by both sides, but the root of it \n     is the unchecked power given to Mr. Starr, Virtually no one \n     has the ability to jerk his leash; the attorney general can \n     remove him only for flagrant violation of the law. He's the \n     only person or institution in the U.S. government that \n     operates without checks and balances.\n       Come 1999, when the statute is up for renewal, Republicans \n     who are hugely enjoying the spectacle of a Democratic \n     president at bay ought to recall how they felt about Lawrence \n     Walsh, and how they'll feel when some future prosecutor \n     recklessly targets another GOP occupant of the White House.\n       For now, for a moment, assume the worst is true about Bill \n     Clinton (although Mr. Starr has spend nearly 3 1/2 years and \n     $26 million and come up dry)--sexual indiscretion, something \n     funny about a failed land deal in Arkansas. Then ask who's \n     doing the worse damage to fairness, justice, the conduct of \n     government and the democratic process--the president or his \n     pursuer? We rest our case.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. A few of the headlines read: ``A Prosecutor Without Public \nTrust,'' ``Ken Starr's Misjudgments,'' and ``Starr Steps Out of \nBounds.'' Robert Morgenthau, in fact, the District Attorney for \nManhattan, and one of the most respected prosecutors in the country, is \nquoted as saying that Mr. Starr violated ``every rule in the book.''\n  Some argue that the statute should be scrapped. I cannot agree, \nprovided that we can prevent the abuses we have experienced in the \npast. We need a mechanism to address credible allegations of serious \ncriminal wrongdoing by top executive branch officials. We have made \nimprovements in the statute each of the three times it has been \nreauthorized over the past 20 years. We have required independent \ncounsel to comply with established Justice Department policies and \nprocedures; we have added standards of conduct for independent counsel; \nand we have added a whole new host of cost controls, including \nrequiring new independent counsel to comply with the expenditure \npolicies of the Justice Department with respect to salary levels, use \nof Government office space and travel.\n  But we obviously have failed to foreclose opportunities for major \nexcesses and clear abuses by independent counsel. Unless we can amend \nthe law sufficiently to stop the excesses and abuses in the future--and \nI think we can do that--then the law should lapse. We need a law but \nonly if the law ensures that individuals who conduct these \ninvestigations are highly qualified, nonpartisan attorneys with good \njudgment and common sense who are bound in by appropriate limits.\n  The list of lessons learned over the last few years is long. We have \ntried to incorporate them into the bill we are introducing today.\n  The first issues concern the appointment of the independent counsel. \nThere was a high degree of dissatisfaction and concern with the choice \nof Kenneth Starr as independent counsel in the Whitewater matter. The \ninvestigation was already well underway with Special Counsel Bob Fiske \nwho had been appointed by Attorney General Reno. Mr. Fiske was a well-\nrespected, veteran prosecutor who had also been a lifelong Republican. \nTo remove any doubt about whether he could be appointed under the \nreauthorized independent counsel law as well, Congress had specifically \nauthorized the special division of the court to reappoint him. But the \nthree judge special division took it upon itself to terminate Mr. Fiske \nand replace him with Mr. Starr. Many of us challenged the court's \ndecision at the time, arguing that Mr. Starr was a highly partisan \nperson who could not bring the necessary appearance of independence to \nthe job. At the time of his appointment he was linked to the Paula \nJones case, having argued publicly against the President's position on \nimmunity from civil suit. It turns out he had also conferred numerous \ntimes with attorneys for Paula Jones. He had served as the Finance Co-\nChairman of the Congressional campaign of a Republican in Alexandria, \nVirginia. At the time of Mr. Starr's appointment I wrote to the Special \nDivision and urged them to reconsider their decision. ``The issue with \nrespect to Mr. Starr,'' I said, ``. . . is that he lacks the necessary \nappearance of independence essential for public confidence in the \nprocess.'' Our concerns have proven to be true over time, to the point \nthat Mr. Starr is perceived by the public as a partisan prosecutor.\n  Our bill would make some very important changes in the current \nprocess in this regard. First, the special division of three judges who \nmake independent counsel appointments under current law are appointed \nby the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the court picks an \nindependent counsel from a list of candidates developed by the special \ndivision from various recommendations over time. Our bill would require \nthat the judges who serve on the special division court be picked by \nlottery from a pool of all of the federal appellate court judges. The \nSpecial Division would then be required to develop a list of qualified \ncandidates to serve as independent counsels from a list of five \ncandidates from each federal circuit selected by the chief judge of \neach circuit. Our bill would explicitly prohibit an independent counsel \ncandidate from having an actual or apparent conflict of interest, and \nit would encourage the appointment of an individual with prosecutorial \nexperience.\n  Mr. Starr was not a prosecutor. In making a number of critically \nimportant judgment calls, Mr. Starr demonstrated a lack of \nunderstanding of the discipline a prosecutor needs in order to exercise \nthe tremendous discretion and power of the office with fairness and \njustice. The bill would seek to remedy this by requiring the individual \nappointed as independent counsel to have prosecutorial experience ``to \nthe extent practicable.''\n  Many people expressed concern over the large and lucrative private \npractice Mr. Starr continued to have as independent counsel. We will \nnever know if the investigation into the President could have been \nconcluded much more expeditiously had Mr. Starr set aside his private \npractice from the inception of his appointment, but it's a reasonable \npossibility at least that it could have been. Independent counsel \nappointments are supposed to receive the highest priority and the \npublic benefits from a timely resolution of the allegations. Our bill \nwould require an independent counsel to devote full time to the \ninvestigation to bring it to a prompt conclusion, because we think \ndoing so has important benefits to the public interest.\n  Another area has to do with the scope of jurisdiction. This has been \nan area of great concern to some of us. That relates particularly to \nMr. Starr's investigation, because he was originally appointed to \ninvestigate the Madison Guarantee Savings and Loan matter as it \npossibly related to President Clinton. But he ended up prosecuting a \nmultitude of other matters. At one point his office even interviewed \nArkansas State troopers about President Clinton's relationship with a \nnumber of different women when he was Governor. Moreover, Mr. Starr had \nhis jurisdiction expanded to include Travelgate, Filegate, and the \nMonica Lewinsky matter. With each expansion, he looked more and more \nlike a prosecutor pursuing a person instead of a prosecutor pursuing a \ncrime.\n  In the end he became Javert to President Clinton's Jean Valjean. Our \nbill limits the scope of the original grant of jurisdiction to only \nthose matters that are ``directly'' related to an independent counsel's \noriginal jurisdiction, and eliminates the provision allowing an \nexpansion of jurisdiction. Such matters would be investigated by the \nDepartment of Justice or, if appropriate,\n\n[[Page S7774]]\n\na new independent counsel could be appointed. Only in this way can we \nprevent an independent counsel from becoming a permanent prosecutor of \nthe President or any other covered official.\n  Experience has also taught us that some of these independent counsel \ninvestigations develop huge staffs over time--far beyond those that \nwould be available in an ordinary investigation. At one point, it was \nalleged that the Starr investigation was one of the top three \ninvestigations in terms of numbers of FBI agents in the country--\nranking right up there with the Unibomber and the World Trade Center \nbombing. Our bill would limit the number of detailees from the FBI and \nthe Department of Justice to a number reasonably related to the number \nof staff the Justice Department or FBI normally assigns to a similar \ncase.\n  One of my greatest concerns in the past five years has been the \nfailure of Mr. Starr to comply with both the spirit and, I believe, the \nletter of the law with respect to the requirement that an independent \ncounsel follow established Department of Justice policies. I have made \nseveral floor statements identifying the particular instances in which \nI believe Mr. Starr has exceeded Justice Department policies, so I will \nnot elaborate here. The current law requires an independent counsel to \nfollow established Justice Department policies except to the extent to \ndo so would undermine the purposes of the independent counsel law. That \nexception, which was intended to be a very narrow exception, has been \nused by Mr. Starr to justify a laundry list of questionable actions. \nThe bill we are introducing today would eliminate that exception and \nprovide that the only policy an independent counsel would be allowed to \nignore would be that part of a policy or guideline that requires \napproval by a top Justice Department official. The bill provides that \neven in that situation, the independent counsel should consult with a \ntop Justice Department official; he or she just isn't required to get \nthat official's approval.\n\n  The bill also creates a remedy for the situation where a target or \nwitness in an independent counsel investigation believes the \nindependent counsel is not complying with established Justice \nDepartment procedures. Currently, Justice Department policies are not \nenforceable in court, and several individuals who attempted to enforce \ncompliance by Mr. Starr were turned away by the court. This bill would \ngive such an individual an explicit right to first obtain an opinion by \nthe Attorney General as to whether an independent counsel was complying \nwith a specific Department of Justice policy, and if the Attorney \nGeneral determines that the independent counsel is not, the bill allows \nthe person to seek enforcement from the special court.\n  Mr. Starr took the unusual step in his investigation to hire an \noutside ethics attorney. The bill requires an independent counsel to \nuse as his or her ethics adviser the person already housed in the \nDepartment of Justice who is familiar with the ethical rules and \nregulations of a Justice Department Attorney--the designated agency \nethics official or DAEO. This will help to keep the office of the \nindependent counsel in tune with the ethical requirements of other \ninvestigative offices, giving greater assurance that Justice Department \npolicies with respect to ethics issues will be followed.\n  Great concern has developed over the cost of these independent \ncounsel investigations. Mr. Smaltz spent some $20 million to have a 30 \ncount indictment rejected by a jury. Mr. Starr is likely to be the most \nexpensive independent counsel ever--topping $50 million when all is \nsaid and done. These figures are shocking. The bill would address this \nproblem by requiring an independent counsel to establish a budget with \nconsultation of the Attorney General and the General Accounting Office \nto review the budget and submit a written analysis to Congress. We have \ntried with every reauthorization of this statute to obtain cost \ncontrols over the operations of the independent counsels. We've made \nsome progress, but obviously more needs to be done. The bill also sets \na two year presumptive limit on the work of an independent counsel and \nrequires the independent counsel to affirmatively seek an extension for \none year from the special court. By requiring an independent counsel to \nestablish a budget and presumptively limiting the term of an \nindependent counsel to two years, I believe we will impose a useful and \nmeaningful cost control on these offices.\n  A final concern that many of us have had with the independent counsel \nlaw is the provision regarding the referral of information to the House \nof Representatives regarding possible impeachable offenses. Mr. Starr's \nreport to the House was not only shockingly and unnecessarily graphic, \nit was a brief for impeachment, far beyond the role envisioned by the \nindependent counsel law. Mr. Starr's report also violated the fairness \nexpected by the American people by presenting information on possible \nimpeachable offenses in a biased and prejudicial manner. Under the \nConstitution, the House has sole responsibility to decide whether or \nnot the President should be impeached. The independent counsel did not \nhave a statutory responsibility to argue for impeachment. His \nresponsibility was to forward ``information'' to the Congress that \n``may constitute grounds for an impeachment.'' Our bill would eliminate \nthe provision with respect to impeachment, removing any obligation on \nthe part of an independent counsel to take any initiative in this which \nis reserved exclusively to the House of Representatives by the \nConstitution.\n  Finally, it is clear, obviously, that the independent counsel law is \ngoing to expire tomorrow. We are going to have the cooling off period \nthat former Senator Howard Baker prescribed during our Governmental \nAffairs Committee hearings. I hope that after a reasonable cooling off \nperiod we will turn our attention to reestablishing a reasonable and \nfair procedure for the investigation of criminal allegations of our top \nofficials and that the legislation we consider at that time contain the \nnecessary protections against abuses of power. The bill we are \nintroducing today is our best effort at drafting such legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 7 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is about a quarter of the time.\n  I yield to my distinguish colleague from Maine, Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a coauthor of the \nIndependent Counsel Reform Act of 1999. At the outset, let me express \nmy deep appreciation to Senators Specter, Lieberman, and Levin for the \nbipartisan spirit in which they approached the task of drafting this \nimportant legislation. Legislation of this complexity, which must \nbalance innumerable competing but important interests, is never easy to \nachieve. This is particularly true when the legislation--as is the case \nin this bill--touches on political nerves that are still raw and fresh.\n  We have worked very hard to achieve legislation that I believe truly \nserves the public interest while correcting the significant flaws in \nthe current law.\n  Supporting the reauthorization of the Independent Counsel Act is not \nlikely to win this bipartisan group much applause from the Clinton \nadministration or congressional partisans on either side of the aisle. \nMany of our colleagues say let it die. However, I caution my colleagues \nagainst short memories. We should not forget what prompted passage of \nthis legislation more than two decades ago and its reauthorization \nthree times since then.\n  The Congress that passed the independent counsel law after Watergate \nwanted to assure the public that there were institutional guarantees \nthat would never again allow the political leadership of the Justice \nDepartment to obstruct a criminal investigation of the President and \nthe highest Government officials in the land. Their concern was not \nabstract or based on conjecture. The Justice Department, indeed, the \nAttorney General himself was implicated in the coverup of criminal acts \nby the incumbent administration.\n  Do we think it couldn't happen again? Clearly, unfortunately, it \ncould.\n  The fact is, there will always be cases in which the Attorney General \nhas an\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\nactual or an apparent conflict of interest. The Attorney General simply \ncannot credibly conduct an extensive investigation and make \nprosecutorial decisions involving his or her boss, the President, the \nVice President, or colleagues in the Cabinet. We must have an \ninstitutional mechanism that assures the public that allegations of \nserious criminal conduct by high level officials will be thoroughly \ninvestigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.\n  Only by resorting to a prosecutor beyond the actual and perceived \ncontrol of the administration can the public be assured that impartial \njustice extends to the most influential and powerful leaders of our \nland. Moreover, the independent counsel law fosters public confidence \nin the decision not to prosecute high level Government officials. A \nGovernment official who has been investigated but cleared by an \nindependent counsel can justifiably and with credibility reclaim his or \nher public reputation. Political opponents cannot reasonably claim that \nthe official escapes scrutiny and punishment by pulling political \nstrings at the Justice Department.\n  We should keep in mind that the majority of the independent counsel \nover the past two decades have conducted prompt and cost-effective \ninvestigations that resulted in decisions not to prosecute or indict \nthe official accused of the criminal wrongdoing. Can there be any doubt \nthat the political credibility of these decisions was enhanced \nsignificantly because the prosecutor had no political or financial \nconnections to the target or other members of the administration? If we \nreturn these important decisions to the Justice Department, I fear we \nwill encourage public skepticism of decisions not to prosecute. There \nwill always be a cloud of suspicion tainting the decision.\n  The need for the independent counsel mechanism is as evident today as \nit was back in 1978, when the law was first enacted. We have learned \nmuch from our experience with the law. It is flawed. It needs \nsignificant reform. That is just what the legislation we are \nintroducing today would do.\n  Though I strongly believe we should reauthorize the Independent \nCounsel Act, I am mindful of its many shortcomings. I participated in \nan excellent series of hearings chaired by my colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Thompson, and virtually every witness agreed that the law must \nbe changed.\n  The legislation we are introducing today takes significant steps to \nrein in the length and the cost of independent counsel investigations. \nIt limits all independent counsel investigations to a maximum of 2 \nyears and only allows the investigation to proceed for additional 1-\nyear periods upon a special showing to the court. It requires \nindependent counsel to serve full time and to submit annual budgets to \nthe General Accounting Office.\n  We substantially limit the number of covered officials under the act, \nlimiting coverage to only the President, the Vice President, the \nCabinet, and the President's chief of staff. By limiting the coverage \nof the law, we have reserved the extraordinary remedy of an independent \ncounsel for those high-level officials who will always, by virtue of \ntheir position, pose a conflict of interest to the Justice Department.\n  We make many other changes. We heighten the threshold for the \nappointment of an independent counsel, and we make clear that an \nindependent counsel must follow the prosecutorial guidelines of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  We also abolish the requirement for independent counsel to report \nimpeachable conduct to the House of Representatives. We have come up \nwith a bill that would preserve this important mechanism while \ncorrecting the serious flaws in the current act.\n  Let me conclude by again recognizing the efforts of my distinguished \ncolleagues and applaud them for their leadership on this important \nissue. My hope is that the rest of our colleagues will take advantage \nof this opportunity to remedy the weaknesses in the independent counsel \nlaw before the next unfortunate and inevitable crisis occurs and the \npublic is left doubting whether it can have confidence that the laws of \nthis country will be enforced impartially, without regard to rank or \nprivilege.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Limits applicability of the statute to the President, \n     Vice President, members of the Cabinet, and the President's \n     Chief of Staff.\n       2. Eliminates the provision which allowed the AG to begin a \n     preliminary investigation and appoint an IC with regard to \n     any individual when she believed that investigating this \n     person may result in a personal, financial or political \n     conflict of interest.\n       3. Eliminates the provision which allowed the AG to begin a \n     preliminary investigation and appoint an IC to investigate a \n     Member of Congress.\n       4. Grants the AG the power to convene a grand jury and \n     issue subpoenas during the preliminary investigation.\n       5. Increases the length of the preliminary investigation \n     from 90 to 120 days and increases the length of the extension \n     from 60 to 90 days (to allow more time given the AG's new \n     powers and the higher standard for appointing an IC).\n       6. Lowers the standard for not appointing an IC due to the \n     suspect's lack of mens rea from ``clear and convincing \n     evidence'' that he/she lacked the requisite state of mind to \n     a ``preponderance of evidence'' that he/she lacked the \n     requisite state of mind.\n       7. Changes the standard necessary for appointing an IC from \n     ``reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is \n     warranted'' to ``substantial grounds to believe that further \n     investigation is warranted.''\n       8. Requires that the IC be selected from a list of \n     candidates comprised of 5 individuals recommended by the \n     chief judge of each Federal circuit.\n       9. Provides that an IC shall have ``appropriate experience \n     including, to the extent practicable, prosecutorial \n     experience.''\n       10. Provides that an IC shall have ``no actual or apparent \n     personal, financial or political conflict of interest.''\n       11. Requires that the IC conduct the investigation on a \n     full-time basis.\n       12. Eliminates the provision which allows the AG to expand \n     the jurisdiction of an independent counsel beyond his/her \n     original mandate (such as the additions of Filegate, \n     Travelgate, etc. to Starr's original Whitewater mandate).\n       13. Provides that the IC can investigate only topics in his \n     original jurisdiction or those ``directly related'' thereto.\n       14. Provides that DOJ employees can be detailed to the IC \n     in a number which is ``reasonably related to the number of \n     staff ordinarily assigned by the Department to conduct an \n     investigation of similar size and complexity.''\n       15. Eliminates the provision which provided that the IC \n     need not comply with written or established DOJ policies ``to \n     the extent doing so would be inconsistent with the purposes'' \n     of the statute.\n       16. Provides a mechanism for aggrieved parties to appeal \n     directly to the AG when they believe that the IC has failed \n     to observe written DOJ policies or guidelines. If the AG \n     determined that the IC has in fact violated the guidelines in \n     a manner that has caused a cognizable harm to the complaining \n     party, the AG may file a motion with the Division of the \n     Court seeking appropriate injunctive or declaratory relief.\n       17. Limits the IC's final report to one which sets forth \n     only a list of indictments brought by the IC, the outcomes of \n     each indictment, and a summary of expenses.\n       18. Provides that the IC shall submit an annual budget to \n     the AG and the GAO. The GAO shall review the budget and \n     submit a written appraisal of the budget to the IC and the \n     House and Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and \n     Appropriations Committee.\n       19. Provides for expedited review of all matters relating \n     to an investigation and a prosecution by an IC.\n       20. Deletes the requirement of a report to Congress of any \n     substantial and credible information that may constitute \n     grounds for an impeachment.\n       21. Defines the ``good cause'' for which an AG can remove \n     an IC as a physical or mental disability, a knowing, willful \n     and material failure to comply with relevant, written \n     Department of Justice guidelines, and a personal, financial \n     or political conflict of interest.\n       22. Provides a 2 year time limit for IC investigation. \n     Empowers the Special Division of the Court to extend this \n     period for additional one year periods for good cause, and to \n     extend this period to make up for dilatory tactics.\n       23. Provides that the judges of the Special Division of the \n     Court shall be chosen through a lottery of circuit judges \n     (instead of the current system where the Chief Justice \n     chooses them). Extends period of service on the Special \n     Division from 2 to 3 years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Independent Counsel Reform Act of 1999--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     SEC. 1: SHORT TITLE: ``INDEPENDENT COUNSEL REFORM ACT OF \n                   1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2: INDEPENDENT COUNSEL STATUTE\n\n       United States Code Chapter 40, title 28 is replaced by this \n     Act.\n\n     Sec. 591.

Notification shall consist of a summary of the \n     information received and the results of the preliminary \n     investigation.\n       The Attorney General shall apply to the special court for \n     the appointment of an independent counsel if the Attorney \n     General determines there are substantial grounds to believe \n     that further investigation is warranted or the 120 day period \n     granted for preliminary investigation has elapsed without \n     proper notification to the special court.\n       In making this determination, the Attorney General shall \n     comply with the written and established policies of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       If the Attorney General receives additional information \n     after notifying the special court of a decision not to seek \n     an independent counsel, the Attorney General shall conduct an \n     additional preliminary investigation for a period of no more \n     than 120 days.\n       The Attorney General's determination on the appointment of \n     an independent counsel shall not be reviewable by any court.\n       Congress may request in writing that the Attorney General \n     apply for the appointment of an independent counsel.

The Attorney General \n     shall respond in writing within 30 days.

The 6-\n     month period report shall include explanations of expenses, \n     and estimates of future expenses. The termination report \n     shall include summaries of expenses and disposition of legal \n     actions taken.\n       The special court may release appropriate sections of the \n     reports if it is appropriate to protect the rights of any \n     individual named in the report. At the request of an \n     independent counsel, past reports may be printed and made \n     available to the public.\n       The independent counsel may have no other paid employment \n     and any person with an associated firm may not represent \n     anyone under investigation by the independent counsel. \n     Appointees may not represent anyone under investigation. The \n     independent counsel and appointees may not represent a \n     subject of the investigation for three years. Those parties \n     and an associated law firm are banned for one year from \n     representing any person in any matter involving this chapter.\n       The independent counsel shall conduct all activities with \n     due regard for expenses and authorize only reasonable and \n     lawful expenditures. An appointee making an invalid \n     certification will be held liable. An independent counsel \n     shall comply with the established expenditure policies of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       The independent counsel shall within 90 days of appointment \n     submit a budget for the first year, and thereafter on an \n     annual basis. This budget shall be submitted to the Attorney \n     General and the General Accounting Office (``GAO''). The GAO \n     shall review the annual budget and submit a written appraisal \n     to Congress.\n       It shall be the duty of the courts of the United States to \n     expedite matters relating to an investigation and prosecution \n     by an independent counsel.\n\n     Sec. 595. Congressional oversight\n\n       The appropriate committees of Congress shall have oversight \n     jurisdiction. The independent counsel shall submit annually a \n     report on the activities of the independent counsel omitting \n     confidential matters, but sufficient to justify the \n     expenditures.\n       Within 15 days of a request from an appropriate \n     congressional committee, the Attorney General shall provide \n     the following: when the information regarding the case was \n     received, the starting date of the preliminary investigation, \n     and whether an application for an independent counsel or \n     notification of no further investigation has been filed.\n\n[[Page S7782]]\n\n     Sec. 596. Removal of an independent counsel; termination of \n       office\n\n       An independent counsel may only be removed from office by \n     the Attorney General for ``good cause,'' physical or mental \n     disability, or any other condition that impairs the \n     performance of the independent counsel's duties. Good cause \n     include a knowing and material failure to comply with the \n     written policies of the Department of Justice, or an actual \n     conflict of interest\n       Upon removal of an independent counsel, the Attorney \n     General shall submit a report to the special court and the \n     appropriate congressional committees specifying the facts \n     found and the ultimate grounds for the removal. This report \n     shall be made public with necessary protections for the \n     rights of any named individual.\n       The independent counsel may request judicial review of his \n     or her removal. Remedies may include reinstatement or other \n     appropriate relief.\n       The independent counsel shall notify the Attorney General \n     when the matters within the prosecutorial jurisdiction have \n     been completed, or completed to the point that it would be \n     appropriate for the Department of Justice to complete those \n     investigations. The independent counsel shall file the final \n     report. The special court may terminate an office of the \n     independent counsel on the same grounds within two years of \n     appointment and thereafter on an annual basis.\n       The term of an independent counsel shall terminate after \n     two years except for good cause or dilatory tactics. The \n     special court shall review all requests for extensions and \n     may grant an extension for additional one year periods.\n       By June 30th and December 31st of each year, the \n     independent counsel shall prepare a statement of expenditures \n     covering the previous 6 months. The Comptroller General shall \n     conduct a financial review of the statements and submit the \n     results to the appropriate congressional committees.\n\n     Sec. 597. Relationship with the Department of Justice\n\n       Whenever a matter is within the prosecutorial jurisdiction \n     of the independent counsel, the Department of Justice shall \n     suspend all investigation, except if the independent counsel \n     agrees in writing that the matter may be continued by the \n     Department of Justice.\n       Nothing in this chapter shall prevent either the Attorney \n     General or the Solicitor General from presenting an amicus \n     curiae brief on matters involving the jurisdiction of the \n     independent counsel.\n\n     Sec. 598. Severability\n\n       If any provision of this chapter is held invalid, the \n     remainder of this chapter not similarly situated shall not be \n     affected by that invalidation.\n\n     Sec. 599. Termination of effect of chapter\n\n       This chapter shall sunset five years after the date of \n     enactment.\n\n     SEC. 3: ASSIGNMENT OF JUDGES TO DIVISION TO APPOINT \n                   INDEPENDENT COUNSELS\n\n       Section 49 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     Sec. 49. Assignment of judges to division to appoint \n       independent counsel\n\n       Three judges shall be assigned for a period of three years \n     to a division of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia to be the special court for the purpose \n     of appointing independent counsels. This shall not be a bar \n     to other judicial assignments. Assignment shall be by \n     lottery. Vacancies shall be filled by lottery only for the \n     remainder of the assignment. These judges shall not be \n     eligible to participate in any judicial proceeding concerning \n     a matter that involves the independent counsel while the \n     independent counsel is in office, or a matter involving the \n     exercise of the independent counsel's official duties.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for 2 \nadditional minutes to comment about an amendment which I will seek to \nadd when this statute is considered. It is one where I am proceeding by \nmyself. That is a provision to have a mandamus action to compel the \nAttorney General to appoint an independent counsel where there is an \nabuse of discretion. It is my view that independent counsel should have \nbeen appointed on campaign finance reform, as recommended by FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh and special counsel Charles LaBella.\n  I will ask consent that at the conclusion of the remarks which I am \nnow making, there be included a draft complaint which I had prepared to \ncompel the appointment of independent counsel.\n  This draft complaint was never filed because at each stage where it \nappeared warranted to pursue mandamus, the Attorney General would take \nsome action on extension of investigation, and then it became \ninterwoven with the impeachment proceedings so the time was never quite \nright. There was a complex issue on standing, although at one time we \nalmost had an agreement by the chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to have \ntheir sponsorship, perhaps if not all of the Republicans in each \ncommittee, a majority of the Republicans, which would have provided \nstanding for a report and, by analogy, perhaps, standing for such a \nlawsuit.\n  I do believe that when independent counsel is again considered and \nthis statute sponsored by the four of us will be ready, willing, and \nable to proceed, the issue of a mandamus action ought to be considered.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this draft complaint be \nprinted in the Record to preserve the factual allegations for later \nreference on the general principle of the need for a mandamus \nprovision.\n  There being no objection, the complaint was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civil \n                             Action No.   ]\n\n Plaintiffs vs. The Honorable Janet Reno, Attorney General, Department \n                         of Justice, Defendant.\n\n\n                               COMPLAINT\n\n       Plaintiffs, by counsel, complain as follows:\n       COME NOW Plaintiffs, and for cause of action against \n     Defendant, allege as follows:\n\n                              JURISDICTION\n\n       1. This court has jurisdiction by reason of (1) 28 U.S.C. \n     section 1361, which confers jurisdiction over any action in \n     the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of \n     the United States, or any agency thereof, to perform a duty \n     owed to the plaintiff; (2) 5 U.S.C. section 702, which \n     confers jurisdiction over any action to compel an agency of \n     the United States to perform a duty which has been \n     unreasonably withheld; and (3) by reason of its general \n     Federal Question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. section 1331.\n\n                  The Parties and Statutory Background\n\n       2. This is an action to compel the Attorney General of the \n     United States of America to comply with statutory provisions \n     set forth in the Independent Counsel Statute, 28 U.S.C. \n     sections 591-599 (hereinafter ``The Act'').\n       3. [Plaintiffs comprise a majority of the Republican \n     members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.] \n     Section 592(g) of the Act provides that a majority of the \n     majority party members of the House or Senate Judiciary \n     Committee shall have the authority to request that the \n     Attorney General apply for appointment of an independent \n     counsel.\n       4. Defendant is the Attorney General of the United States \n     and is charged with the duty of carrying out the provisions \n     of the Act by reason of the requirements set forth in 28 \n     U.S.C. sections 591-595.\n       5. Section 591 of the Act provides that the Attorney \n     General ``shall'' conduct a preliminary investigation \n     whenever the Attorney General receives specific and credible \n     information which is ``sufficient to constitute grounds to \n     investigate'' whether a covered person under the Act ``may \n     have violated'' any Federal criminal law. Such covered \n     persons include the President and the Vice President.\n       6. Section 592(c) of the Act provides that the Attorney \n     General ``shall'' apply to the special division of the \n     circuit court for appointment of an independent counsel if \n     the Attorney General determines, after reviewing specific and \n     credible evidence, that there are ``reasonable grounds to \n     believe that further investigation is warranted.''\n\n                           Factual Background\n\n       7. The following factual background sets forth specific and \n     credible information sufficient to require the Attorney \n     General to apply for appointment of an independent counsel \n     under the provisions of the Act cited above. This information \n     has been organized as follows:\n       I. National Security Information Withheld from the \n     President. The Attorney General found that there was \n     sufficient evidence of illegal activity by the President to \n     justify withholding certain national security information \n     from him. Since the evidence was sufficiently compelling to \n     justify such an extreme denial of presidential prerogative, \n     the same evidence is sufficiently specific and credible so as \n     to warrant appointment of independent counsel.\n       II. Criminal Violations. The Attorney General has ignored \n     specific and credible evidence of at least two violations \n     that warrant appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate the President and/or the Vice President:\n       A. Coordination between the President and the DNC. There is \n     specific and credible evidence that President Clinton engaged \n     in illegal coordination of expenditures by the DNC on its \n     television advertising campaign.\n       B. Conspiracy to Violate and Evade the Campaign Finance \n     Laws. There is specific and credible evidence that the \n     President, Vice President, and other high-ranking officials \n     acted in concert to violate the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act.\n       III. The Failure of the Department of Justice's \n     Investigation and Estoppel of the Attorney General.\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\n       A. Failure of the Department of Justice's Campaign Finance \n     Investigation. After over one year of investigation, the \n     Justice Department's campaign finance task force has suffered \n     a series of embarrassments and can point to little visible \n     achievement. If a credible investigation is to take place, it \n     must be done by an independent counsel.\n       B. Estoppel of the Attorney General. Attorney General Reno \n     has stated before Congress that there is an inherent conflict \n     whenever senior Executive Branch officials are to be \n     investigated by the Justice Department and its appointed \n     head, the Attorney General. Furthermore, Attorney General \n     Reno has, until the present, complied with the view she \n     expressed before Congress by appointing independent counsels \n     to investigate Executive Branch officials on four separate \n     occasions. Given the Attorney General's statements and \n     pattern of behavior, and Congress' detrimental reliance \n     thereon, Attorney General Reno is estopped from refusing to \n     appoint an independent counsel in the instant case.\n\n\n   I. National Security Information Withheld from the President and \n                           Secretary of State\n\n       8. The Federal Election Campaign Act provides that ``it \n     shall be unlawful for a foreign national directly or through \n     any other person to make any contribution of money or other \n     thing of value . . . in connection with an election to any \n     political office. . . .'' 2 U.S.C. 441e(a). A ``foreign \n     national'' is defined as someone who is not a citizen of the \n     United States and who is not lawfully admitted for permanent \n     residence in the United States. 2 U.S.C. 441e(b).\n       9. National Security Information Withheld from the \n     President. On June 3, 1996, the F.B.I. briefed two members of \n     the White House National Security Council (the ``N.S.C.'') on \n     intelligence of Chinese Government efforts to buy influence \n     in the United States government through political \n     contributions. Also in June, the F.B.I. provided individual, \n     classified briefings to 6 members of Congress, warning them \n     that they may have been targeted by the Chinese Government to \n     be the recipients of illegal campaign contributions.\n       10. President Clinton was not informed of the F.B.I. \n     briefing to the N.S.C. and became aware of it only after \n     reading a February, 1997 report in the Washington Post. After \n     learning about the June briefing, President Clinton explained \n     on March 10, 1997, that the two N.S.C. officials had not \n     reported the F.B.I. briefing to their superiors because the \n     F.B.I. agents involved, ``asked that they [the N.S.C. \n     officials] not share the briefing, and they honored the \n     request.'' Also on March 10, White House Press Secretary \n     Michael McCurry stated that the two N.S.C. officials who \n     received the briefing were ``adamant in recalling \n     specifically that they were urged by [by the FBI] not to \n     disseminate the information outside the briefing room.''\n       11. President Clinton further stated on March 10 that such \n     national security information should not have been withheld \n     from him. The President stated, ``I should have known. No, I \n     did not know. If I had known, I would have asked the N.S.C. \n     and the chief of staff to look at the evidence and make \n     whatever recommendations were appropriate.''\n       12. National Security Information Withheld from the \n     Secretary of State. On February 18, 1997 White House Counsel \n     Charles Ruff wrote to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick \n     asking for information about the possible involvement of \n     Chinese officials and citizens in a purported plan to make \n     illegal contributions to American political campaigns. He \n     sought this information in order to brief Secretary of State \n     Madeline Albright, who was preparing to make an official \n     visit to China in late February. Mr. Ruff's letter stressed \n     that he did not want information that might interfere with \n     ``any criminal investigation.''\n       13. The New York Times reported (March 25, 1997) that \n     F.B.I. and Justice Department officials prepared a thorough \n     response to Mr. Ruff's letter but, at the request of F.B.I. \n     Director Freeh, this response was never sent. As a result, \n     Secretary of State Albright was denied critical information \n     at a time when she was embarking upon a diplomatic mission to \n     Beijing.\n       14. In response to this decision to withhold this \n     information from the Secretary of State, President Clinton \n     stated on March 26, 1997 that, ``I think everyone understands \n     that there are significant national security issues at stake \n     here and that the White House, the National Security Council, \n     and the Secretary of State, as well as the President, need to \n     know when the national security issues are brought into \n     play.''\n       15. On April 30, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee for an oversight \n     hearing. At this hearing, Senator Arlen Specter questioned \n     the Attorney General about these reports that the FBI and the \n     Justice Department had withheld national security information \n     from President Clinton and the Secretary of State because the \n     President is a subject in a criminal investigation. In \n     response, Attorney General Reno acknowledged that Director \n     Freeh had told National Security Advisor Sandy Berger that \n     ``he [Freeh] would not go into certain matters because of the \n     ongoing criminal investigation.''\n       16. In an op-ed piece published in the Washington Post on \n     May 22, 1997, Senator Arlen Specter noted the inconsistency \n     in Attorney General Reno's position: ``Since the facts of the \n     underlying investigation are sufficiently serious in the \n     judgement of the Attorney General to deny the president \n     `significant national security' data, how can they possibly \n     be insufficiently `credible' and `specific' to justify not \n     appointing independent counsel?''\n\n\n                        II. Criminal Violations\n\n       17. There is specific and credible evidence that the \n     President and Vice President have committed criminal \n     violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA''). \n     The Attorney General has therefore violated the letter and \n     the spirit of the Independent Counsel Statute by failing to \n     appoint an independent counsel to investigate these \n     allegations.\n\n   A. Illegal Coordination of Expenditures of DNC Money by President \n                                Clinton\n\n       18. There is specific and credible evidence that President \n     Clinton committed a criminal violation of FECA by personally \n     drafting, editing, and planning a series of television \n     advertisements paid for by Democratic National Committee soft \n     money.\n       19. ``Hard money'' is money which is raised pursuant to the \n     caps, restrictions, and reporting requirements of FECA. Hard \n     money can be spent in connection with a specific campaign for \n     Federal office. ``Soft money'' is money that is not governed \n     by the restriction of FECA and can therefore be raised in \n     unlimited amounts. Soft money cannot be spent in connection \n     with specific campaigns for Federal office and must be used \n     for general party building activities.\n       20. As one of the conditions for receiving $61.8 million in \n     Federal funding for their 1996 general election campaign, \n     President Clinton and Vice President Gore signed a letter to \n     the Federal Election Commission in which they pledged that in \n     exchange for the Federal funding they would not spend any \n     additional money on their campaign.\n       21. After signing the pledge, President Clinton actively \n     participated in raising funds for the DNC beyond these \n     limits. According to Federal Election Commission records, the \n     President helped raise $27 million in hard and soft money for \n     the DNC through the White House coffees, and an additional $6 \n     million in hard and soft money for the DNC from overnight \n     guests in the Lincoln Bedroom.\n       22. President Clinton also actively participated in \n     spending DNC money through close coordination with the DNC of \n     the expenditures made on a major television advertising \n     campaign.\n       23. Former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, \n     appearing on the March 9, 1997 edition of NBC's ``Meet the \n     Press,'' acknowledged that President Clinton helped direct \n     the expenditure of approximately $35 million in DNC soft \n     money on television campaign commercials.\n       24. Former Presidential advisor Richard Morris, in his book \n     Behind the Oval Office (p. 144), describes his first-hand \n     knowledge of the coordination which took place between \n     President Clinton and the DNC: ``[T]he President became the \n     day-to-day operational director of our TV-ad campaign. He \n     worked over every script, watched each ad, ordered changes in \n     every visual presentation, and decided which ads would run \n     when and where. He was as involved as any of his media \n     consultants were. The ads became not the slick creations of \n     admen but the work of the president himself. . . . Every line \n     of every ad came under his informed, critical, and often \n     meddlesome gaze. Every ad was his ad.''\n       25. Section 441a(a)(7)(B)(I) of FECA states that: \n     ``Expenditures made by any person in cooperation, \n     consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or \n     suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political \n     committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a \n     contribution to such candidate.'' By this standard, all of \n     the money spent by the Democratic National Committee \n     (``DNC'') on express advocacy commercials, as defined under \n     FECA, that were designed, edited and/or purchased in \n     consultation and co-ordination with the Clinton campaign and \n     the President personally were contributions to the Clinton \n     campaign under FECA. The President knowingly violated FECA by \n     (1) coordinating the contributions by the DNC and (2) \n     accepting and expending contributions in violation of his \n     commitment to limit expenditures to the public financing.\n       26. Violations of FECA are criminal violations when they \n     are done ``knowingly and willfully'' and involve \n     contributions or expenditures aggregating $2,000 or more. 2 \n     U.S.C. 437g(d)(1)(A).\n       27. The Federal Election Commission has defined express \n     advocacy ads as: ``Communications using phrases such as `vote \n     for President,' `reelect your Congressman,' `Smith for \n     Congress,' or language which, when taken as a whole and with \n     limited reference to external events, can have no other \n     reasonable meaning that to urge the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified federal candidate.'' 11 CFR 100.22.\n       28. On April 30, 1997, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee for an oversight \n     hearing. At this hearing, Senators Arlen Specter and Fred \n     Thompson questioned the Attorney General about the \n     coordination between the DNC and the President. The Attorney \n     General acknowledged that coordination between President \n     Clinton and the DNC ``was presumed at the time by the FEC.'' \n     The Attorney General further stated that ``it would be the \n     content'' which controlled whether or not the law was \n     violated, thereby acknowledging that such coordination would \n     be illegal if the advertisements so produced were advocacy \n     ads.\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\n       29. Senator Specter then asked Attorney General Reno the \n     following question:\n       Attorney General Reno . . . I ask you if this advertisement \n     . . . can be anything other than express advocacy. . . . It \n     reads as follows:\n       `Head Start, student loans, toxic cleanup, extra police, \n     anti-drug programs--Dole-Gingrich wanted them cut. Now, \n     they're safe, protected in the 1996 budget because the \n     president stood firm. Dole-Gingrich--deadlock, gridlock, \n     shutdowns. The president's plan--finish the job, balance \n     the budget, reform welfare, cut taxes, protect Medicare. \n     President Clinton gets it done. Meet our challenge, \n     protect our values.'\n       Can that possibly be language taken as a whole which does \n     anything other than urge the election expressly of President \n     Clinton?\n       30. In response to this question, the following exchange \n     took place between Attorney General Reno and Senator Specter:\n       RENO: Based on the processes that have been established by \n     the Department of Justice, the MOU with the elections \n     commission, this is a situation in which we would not find \n     specific and credible evidence that a crime had been \n     committed that would justify triggering the statute.\n       SPECTER: Well, Attorney General Reno, that is conclusory. A \n     critical step along the way is your legal judgment as to \n     whether that is express advocacy.\n       RENO: At this point, the career lawyers who have worked on \n     this issue, who are familiar with the election law, I have \n     met with them. We have discussed it, and they do not believe \n     that it could support a prosecution.\n       SPECTER: Are you familiar with these ads, Attorney General \n     Reno?\n       RENO: I have not seen the ads. I have read what could be \n     called the transcripts of the ads.\n       SPECTER: Well, can you say--listen, I don't have to make a \n     point that you're the attorney general. You have career \n     lawyers. Have you gone over these ads with them specifically \n     to ask them?\n       RENO: I have specifically gone over the ads. I have read \n     the ads and have discussed the ads and discussed what is \n     involved.\n       SPECTER: And have your career lawyers told you that the ad \n     I just read to you is not express advocacy?\n       RENO: What they have told me is that based on their \n     understanding of the law, their structure of the election \n     law, that we could not sustain a prosecution.\n       SPECTER: Well, I understand your conclusion. But my \n     question to you is a lot more specific than that: Have you \n     gone over that ad with your career prosecutors, and they told \n     you that was issue advocacy . . .\n       RENO: No, I have not.\n       SPECTER: Well, Attorney General Reno, I would like to \n     submit these to you, and I would like you to give us your \n     judgment as to whether they are express advocacy or not--your \n     judgment on them. . . . And this is not a judgment for the \n     Federal Election Commission alone. This is jurisdiction for \n     the attorney general of the Department of Justice, because \n     the Federal Election Commission statute has criminal \n     penalties.\n       31. Senator Arlen Specter wrote to Attorney General Reno on \n     May 1, 1997 requesting a legal judgment as to whether the ads \n     in question constitute express advocacy. A true and correct \n     copy of the May 1, 1997 letter is attached as Exhibit   . All \n     of the contents of the attached letter are hereby \n     incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint. \n     Senator Specter included in his letter the following texts of \n     the DNC advertisements:\n       `American values. Do our duty to our parents. President \n     Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to \n     cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President \n     Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole/\n     Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of \n     them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposed tax breaks for \n     tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college \n     scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our \n     challenges, protects our values.\n       `60,000 felons and fugitives tried to buy handguns--but \n     couldn't--because President Clinton passed the Brady Bill--\n     five-day waits, background checks. But Dole and Gingrich \n     voted no. One hundred thousand new police--because President \n     Clinton delivered. Dole and Gingrich? Vote no, want to repeal \n     'em. Strengthen school anti-drug programs. President Clinton \n     did it. Dole and Gingrich? No again. Their old ways don't \n     work. President Clinton's plan. The new way. meeting our \n     challenges, protecting our values.\n       `America's values. Head Start. Student loans. Toxic \n     cleanup. Extra police. Protected the budget agreement; the \n     president stood firm. Dole, Gingrich's latest plan includes \n     tax hikes on working families. Up to 18 million children face \n     health care cuts. Medicare slashed $167 billion. Then Dole \n     resigns, leaving behind gridlock he and Gingrich created. The \n     president's plan: Politics must wait. Balance the budget, \n     reform welfare, protect our values.\n       `Head Start. Student Loans. Toxic Cleanup. Extra police. \n     Anti-drug programs. Dole, Gingrich wanted them cut. Now \n     they're safe. Protected in the '96 budget--because the \n     president stood firm. Dole, Gingrich? Deadlock. Gridlock. \n     Shutdowns. The president's plan? Finish the job, balance the \n     budget. Reform welfare. Cut taxes. Protect Medicare. \n     President Clinton says get it done. Meet our challenges. \n     Protect our values.\n       `The President says give every kid a chance for college \n     with a tax cut that gives $1,500 a year for two years, making \n     most community colleges free, all colleges more affordable . \n     . . And for adults, a chance to learn, find a better job. The \n     president's tuition tax cut plan.\n       `Protecting families. For million of working families, \n     President Clinton cut taxes. The Dole-Gingrich budget tried \n     to raise taxes on eight million. The Dole-Gingrich budget \n     would have slashed Medicare $270 billion. Cut college \n     scholarships. The president defended our values. Protect \n     Medicare. And now, a tax cut of $1,500 a year for the first \n     two years of college. Most community colleges free. Help \n     adults go back to school. The president's plan protects our \n     values.'\n       32. By letter dated June 19, 1997, Attorney General Reno \n     refused to respond to Senator Specter's request and instead \n     referred the request to the Federal Election Commission \n     (``FEC''). A true and correct copy of the June 19, 1997 \n     letter is attached as Exhibit  . All of the contents of the \n     attached letter are hereby incorporated by reference as part \n     of the factual and evidentiary basis for the relief sought in \n     this complaint. By letter dated June 26, 1997, the FEC \n     responded that it would not respond to Senator Specter's \n     inquiry because the letter was not in the form of a formal \n     complaint to the Commission. A true and correct copy of the \n     June 26, 1997 letter is attached as Exhibit  . All of the \n     contents of the attached letter are hereby incorporated by \n     reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint.\n       33. The President conceded that these DNC ads were advocacy \n     advertisements intended to further his candidacy in remarks \n     he made at a December 7, 1995 DNC luncheon at the Hay Adams \n     Hotel in Washington. The President said the following in \n     remarks which were captured on videotape: ``Now we have come \n     way back. . . . But one of the reasons has been . . . we have \n     been running these ads, about a million dollars a week. . . . \n     So I cannot overstate to you the impact that these paid ads \n     have had in the areas where they've run. Now we're doing \n     better in the whole country. . . . [I]n areas where we've \n     shown these ads we are basically doing ten to fifteen points \n     better than in areas where we are not showing them. . . . And \n     then we realized that we could run these ads through the \n     Democratic Party which meant that we could raise money in \n     twenty and fifty and hundred thousand dollar lots, and we \n     didn't have to do it all in thousand dollars and run down--\n     you know--what I can spend which is limited by law.\n       34. The facts outlined above constitute sufficient specific \n     and credible evidence to make a prima facie case that the \n     President committed criminal violations of FECA through the \n     knowing and wilful coordination of the expenditure of DNC \n     soft money. The Attorney General has therefore violated the \n     letter and the spirit of the Indpendent Counsel statute by \n     failing to appoint an independent counsel to investigate \n     these allegations.\n\n     B. Conspiracy to Violate and Evade the Campaign Finance Laws.\n\n       35. 18 U.S.C. 371 provides that a conspiracy to commit an \n     offense against the United States is a criminal offense \n     punishable by up to 5 years in prison. Participation in a \n     conspiracy to violate the Federal campaign finance laws is \n     therefore a criminal violation.\n       36. After the Democrats lost control of both houses of \n     Congress in the 1994 elections, President Clinton and his \n     associates realized that in order to win reelection in 1996, \n     the Clinton campaign would need to raise large sums of money. \n     President Clinton's former senior advisor, George \n     Stephanopoulos, wrote in Newsweek (March 10, 1997) that \n     President Clinton's reelection would ``take cash, tons of it, \n     and everybody from the President on down knew it. So money \n     became a near obsession at the highest levels. We pulled out \n     all the stops: overnights at the White House, coffees, \n     intimate dinners at Washington hotels, you name it.''\n       37. As the events detailed below reveal, ``pulling out all \n     of the stops'' included ignoring the Federal election law. \n     Accordingly, the White House plan to aggressively pursue \n     campaign contributions was, in practice, a conspiracy to \n     evade and violate the Federal election laws.\n       38. The acts detailed below were all acts in furtherance of \n     this conspiracy. There is specific and credible evidence that \n     President and Vice President participated in this conspiracy \n     by trading access to the President, Vice President and other \n     Executive Branch officials for political contributions, \n     trading access to the White House for political \n     contributions, engaging in fundraising activities from \n     Federal property, granting public office for political \n     contributions, and soliciting campaign contributions from \n     illegal sources.\n\n        Use of the White House for Fundraising--The May 1 Coffee\n\n       39. President Clinton personally engaged in fundraising \n     activities from the executive offices of the White House. On \n     April 29, 1997, the Democratic National Committee (``DNC'') \n     sent a memorandum to President Clinton which identified five \n     individuals invited to attend a May 1 coffee at the White \n     House. The following personal note is typed at the top of the \n     memo, ``Mr. President. . . the five attendees of this coffee \n     are $100,000 contributors to the DNC.'' In addition, there is \n     a notation on the first page of the memo which reads, \n     ``President has seen, 5/1/96.'' A true and correct copy of \n     the April\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\n     29, 1997 memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit  . All \n     of the contents of the attached memorandum are hereby \n     incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n        40. On May 1, 1996, President Clinton held a coffee in the \n     Oval Office which was attended by the five individuals listed \n     in the DNC memo. Federal Election Commission (``FEC'') \n     filings show that within one week of the coffee, four of the \n     five attendees (Peter Mathias, Samuel Rothberg, Barrie \n     Wigmore, and Robert Menschel) had contributed $100,000 each \n     to the DNC. A true and correct copy of a printout from the \n     FEC database of contributors is attached hereto as Exhibit  . \n     All of the contents of the attached printout are hereby \n     incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n\n   Use of the White House for Fundraising--Overnights in the Lincoln \n                                Bedroom\n\n       41. President Clinton used the opportunity to spend the \n     night at the White House as a tool to raise funds from large \n     contributors. The overnights in question were arranged by the \n     Democratic National Committee, not the President, and thus do \n     not fall into the category of the President using his \n     residence to entertain friends.\n       42. White House records indicate that between 1993 and \n     1996, 178 individuals who were not personal friends of the \n     President or First Family spent the night at the White House. \n     These 178 individuals contributed a total of over $5 million \n     to the DNC during the '96 election cycle. A true and correct \n     copy of the list of 178 overnight guests provided by the \n     White House to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is \n     attached hereto as Exhibit  . All of the contents of the \n     attached list are hereby incorporated by reference as part of \n     the factual and evidentiary basis for the relief sought in \n     this complaint\n       43. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee obtained a \n     list of the dates on which 51 of these 178 individuals spent \n     the night in the White House. Of these 51 individuals, 49 \n     contributed a total of over $4 million to the DNC during the \n     1996 election cycle. Furthermore, of these 38 families \n     represented by these 51 individuals, 37 families, or 98%, \n     contributed to the DNC during the 1996 election cycle. 21 of \n     the 38 families, or over 50% percent, contributed a total of \n     $900,000 to the DNC within one month of their stay at the \n     White House. A true and correct copy of this list of 51 \n     overnight guests is attached hereto as Exhibit  . All of the \n     contents of the attached list are hereby incorporated by \n     reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint.\n\n                 The Solicitation of R. Warren Meddoff\n\n       44. Appearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on September 19, 1997, Mr. Warren Meddoff testified \n     to the facts set forth in paragraphs 35, 36 and 37 below.\n       45. At a fund-raising dinner on October 22, 1996 at the \n     Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Florida, Mr. Meddoff handed \n     one of his business cards to President Clinton with the \n     following message written on the back of the card, ``I have \n     an associate that it interested in donating $5 million to \n     your campaign.''\n       46. After reading this message, the President stopped to \n     speak with Mr. Meddoff and stated that someone from his staff \n     would contact him. Two days later, on October 24, the \n     President's Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Harold Ickes, called \n     Mr. Meddoff and left a message on his answering machine. On \n     October 26, Mr. Ickes called Mr. Meddoff again, this time \n     from Air Force One, and discussed the possibility that an \n     associate of Mr. Meddoff would contribute as much as $55 \n     million to the DNC over the course of the year.\n       47. On October 29 or 30, Mr. Ickes called Mr. Meddoff again \n     and asked for an immediate contribution of $1.5 million \n     within 24 hours. On the next morning, Mr. Ickes sent Mr. \n     Meddoff a fax with detailed instructions on where to send the \n     money. Mr. Ickes later called Mr. Meddoff and requested that \n     he shred the fax.\n\n                    Mr. Roger Tamraz's Contributions\n\n       48. Appearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on September 18, 1997, Mr. Roger Tamraz testified \n     that he gave a total of $300,000 in contributions to the DNC \n     and state Democratic parties during the 1996 campaign. On \n     March 28, 1996, at Mr. Tamraz's request, the DNC's Richard \n     Sullivan drafted a memorandum to Mr. Tamraz listing the \n     Democratic entities to which Mr. Tamraz had contributed and \n     the amounts he had contributed to each entity as of that \n     date. A true and correct copy of the March 28, 1996 \n     memorandum is attached hereto as Exhibit  . All of the \n     contents of the attached memorandum are hereby incorporated \n     by reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint\n        49. In his September 18 testimony, Mr. Tamraz stated that \n     ``the only reason'' he contributed this money was to gain \n     access to the President and senior government officials. Mr. \n     Tamraz was promoting a plan to build an oil pipeline from the \n     Caspian Sea region of Central Asia to the Mediterranean and \n     was hoping to receive assistance from the Federal government.\n        50. Mr. Tamraz further testified that, following this \n     donation, Mr. Tamraz was invited to six social functions at \n     the White House. At one of these events, he spoke to \n     President Clinton briefly about the proposed pipeline. Asked \n     whether or not he got his ``money's worth'' for the $300,000 \n     he gave, Mr. Tamraz replied, ``I think next time I'll give \n     $600,000.''\n        51. Appearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on September 17, 1997, Ms. Sheila Heslin, a former \n     official with President Clinton's National Security Council, \n     testified that she was concerned about Mr. Tamraz's ``shady \n     reputation'' and advised the White House not to agree to any \n     formal policy meetings with him.\n        52. Ms. Heslin further testified that she received calls \n     to pressure her to drop her opposition to Roger Tamraz from \n     Don Fowler of the Democratic National Committee, Jack Carter \n     of the Department of Energy, and a CIA officer referred to \n     publicly as ``Bob of the CIA.'' Ms. Heslin testified, for \n     example, that Jack Carter told her that ``he [Mr. Tamraz] \n     has already given $200,000, and if he got a meeting with \n     the President, he would give the DNC another $400,000.'' \n     When Ms. Heslin persisted in her opposition, Mr. Carter \n     told her not to be ``such a Girl Scout.''\n\n         Mr. John Huang in the Commerce Department and the DNC\n\n       53. On July 18, 1994, John Huang began to serve as the \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Trade and \n     Economic Policy at the U.S. Department of Commerce. Huang's \n     supervisor at the Commerce Department, Commerce \n     Undersecretary Jeffrey Garten, found Huang ``totally \n     unqualified'' for his position and limited his activities to \n     administrative duties.\n       54. Prior to working at the Commerce Department, John Huang \n     had been the chief U.S. representative of the Lippo Group. \n     The Lippo Group is a multi-billion dollar firm based in \n     Indonesia with large investments in the Far East and China. \n     The Lippo Group is controlled by Mochtar and James T. Riady, \n     longtime friends and financial backers of President Clinton \n     dating back to his days as governor of Arkansas.\n       55. The Lippo Group has extensive investments and contacts \n     throughout China and is currently involved in dozens of \n     large-scale joint ventures in China, including construction \n     and development of apartment complexes, office buildings, \n     highways, ports, and other infrastructure. Appearing before \n     the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on July 15, 1997, \n     Mr. Thomas Hampsen, president of a business research and \n     investigation firm, testified that ``the record is very clear \n     that the Lippo Group has shifted its strategic center from \n     Indonesia to the People's Republic of China.'' Mr. Hampsen \n     noted that Lippo's principal partner in China is ``China \n     Resources,'' a company wholly owned by the Chinese \n     Government. Mr. Hampsen further testified that ``the People's \n     Republic of China uses China Resources as an agent of \n     espionage, economic, military, and political.''\n       56. Documents from the Lippo Group and its subsidiaries \n     show that, upon leaving the Lippo Group for a much lower \n     paying job at the Commerce Department, Huang received a bonus \n     of over $700,000. A true and correct copy of the Lippo Group \n     documents detailing John Huang's bonus are attached hereto as \n     Exhibit   . All of the contents of the attached documents are \n     hereby incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n       57. Records from the U.S. Secret Service show that during \n     his tenure at the Commerce Department, and despite the fact \n     that he was a relatively low level functionary there, Huang \n     made 67 visits to the White House. A true and correct copy of \n     a list of the dates on which the visits took place and, where \n     available, the visitee is attached hereto as Exhibit   . All \n     of the contents of the attached list are hereby incorporated \n     by reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint.\n       58. While he was at the Commerce Department, Huang was \n     given top secret security clearance. Appearing before the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on July 16, 1997, Mr. \n     John H. Dickerson, a CIA agent who handled issues relating to \n     the Commerce Department, testified that he gave John Huang 37 \n     confidential intelligence briefings in which he showed Huang \n     hundreds of confidential documents. Mr. Dickerson further \n     testified that he gave Mr. Huang 12 finished intelligence \n     reports--10 classified ``secret'' and 2 classified \n     ``confidential''--which Mr. Huang kept in his possession \n     until the end of his tenure at the Commerce Department. Mr. \n     Dickerson further stated that Huang had a particular interest \n     in China and Taiwan.\n       59. Appearing before the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on July 17, 1997, Mr. John H. Cobb, an attorney \n     with the staff of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \n     testified that Mr. Huang had over 300 contacts (phone \n     conversations, faxes and meetings) with the Lippo Group and \n     Lippo-related individuals during his tenure at the Commerce \n     Department. Many of these calls were made from his Commerce \n     Department office. In addition, other calls were made from \n     the offices of Stephen's, Inc., a Little Rock-based \n     investment bank with an office across the street from the \n     Commerce Department, where Huang regularly went to send and \n     receive faxes and make phone calls.\n       60. Shortly after he left the Commerce Department in \n     December, 1995, John Huang was appointed Finance Vice-\n     Chairman of the DNC. During his 9 months at the DNC, he \n     raised $3.4 million, nearly half of which was returned as \n     illegal, inappropriate or suspect.\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\nJohn Huang's Solicitation of Funds in the Presence of the President in \n                            the White House\n\n       61. In his appearance before the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee on September 16, 1997, Mr. Karl Jackson, a \n     former Assistant to the Vice President for National Security \n     Affairs from 1991 to 1993, testified that Mr. John Huang \n     solicited money in front of and within hearing distance of \n     the President in the White House. Mr. Jackson was present at \n     a coffee held in the Map Room of the White House on June 18, \n     1996 at which the President, John Huang, and eleven others \n     were present. Mr. Jackson testified that after everyone had \n     taken their seats and were listening to opening comments, Mr. \n     Huang stood up and said, ``Elections cost money, lots and \n     lots of money, and I am sure that every person in this room \n     will want to support the re-election of President Clinton.''\n       62. A photograph taken of all of the attendees of the June \n     18 coffee at their seats demonstrates that Mr. Jackson, who \n     heard Mr. Huang clearly, sat four seats away from Mr. Huang. \n     The President was seated next to Mr. Jackson and only three \n     seats away from Mr. Huang. The President did not object to \n     Mr. Huang's comments or disassociate himself from them. A \n     true and correct copy of the photograph and a legend are \n     attached hereto as Exhibit   . All of the contents of the \n     attached photograph and legend are hereby incorporated by \n     reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint.\n\n   Mr. Wang Jun and the Possible Laundering of Foreign Contributions\n\n       63. Mr. Wang Jun is the chairman of the state-owned China \n     International Trade and Investment Corp. (``CITIC''), a $21 \n     billion conglomerate. One of CITIC's subsidiaries, Poly \n     Technologies, is one of Beijing's leading weapons companies \n     and has been tied to an attempt to smuggle $4 million worth \n     of AK-47s into the United States. Wang Jun is the son of Wang \n     Zing, who was the Vice President of China.\n       64. In a deposition taken by the Senate Governmental \n     Affairs Committee on June 18, 1997, Ernest Green, a managing \n     director of the Washington office of Lehman Brothers \n     investment bank, stated that he had written a letter to Wang \n     Jun inviting him to the United States. At the time, Lehman \n     Brothers was competing for underwriting business in the \n     vastly expanding Chinese market.\n       65. On February 5, 1996, a copy of Wang Jun's bio was faxed \n     to the DNC from Lehman Brothers' offices. A true and correct \n     copy of the fax of Wang Jun's bio received by the DNC is \n     attached hereto as Exhibit   . All of the contents of the \n     attached fax are hereby incorporated by reference as part of \n     the factual and evidentiary basis for the relief sought in \n     this complaint.\n       66. On February 6, 1996, Wang Jun attended a coffee with \n     President Clinton at the White House. On the morning of this \n     coffee, Mr. Green contributed $50,000 to the DNC. A true and \n     correct copy of the check signed by Mr. Green's wife, Phyllis \n     Clause-Green, is attached hereto as Exhibit   . All of the \n     contents of the attached check are hereby incorporated by \n     reference as part of the factual and evidentiary basis for \n     the relief sought in this complaint.\n       67. In his June 18, 1996 deposition, Mr. Green testified \n     that towards the end of February, he received a bonus of \n     approximately $50,000 from Lehman Brothers. Mr. Green had \n     already received a bonus of $114,961 on February 1, 1996. The \n     grant of a $50,000 bonus so quickly following Mr. Green's \n     $50,000 donation to the D.N.C. gives rise to the inference \n     that Lehman Brothers, not Mr. Green, was the true source of \n     the contribution to the DNC. Making contributions ``in the \n     name of another person'' is prohibited by FECA. 2 U.S.C. \n     441f.\n\n     Vice President Gore and the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple Fundraiser\n\n       68. Vice President Gore appeared at a fundraiser in the Hsi \n     Lai Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles on April 29, 1996. The \n     fundraiser at the Temple was illegal since the Temple is a \n     tax-exempt institution which cannot engage in political \n     activity. The Vice President has maintained that he did not \n     know that the event at the Temple was a fundraiser.\n       69. There is evidence that Vice President Gore did know \n     ahead of time that the Hsi Lai Temple event was a fundraiser. \n     In a deposition taken by the Senate Governmental Affairs \n     Committee on August 6, 1997, the Venerable Man-Ho, an \n     administrative assistant at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple, \n     stated that on March 15, 1996, there was a meeting at the \n     White House between Vice President Gore, Hsi Lai Temple \n     Venerable Master Hsing Yun, John Huang, and Maria Hsia. The \n     Los Angeles Times (9/5/97) has reported that Gore was invited \n     to visit the Temple during this meeting. The involvement at \n     the meeting of Huang (a DNC fundraiser) and Hsia (a long-time \n     Gore fundraiser) should have suggested to Gore that the \n     Temple event was planned as a fundraiser from the beginning. \n     The presence of Huang and Hsia at the Temple when Gore \n     arrived should have further suggested to Vice President Gore \n     that this event was a fundraiser.\n       70. Following the March 15 meeting, Vice President Gore \n     responded via e-mail to an aide (Kimberly H. Tilley) who \n     inquired about whether the Vice President could attend a New \n     York event the night before the April 29 Los Angeles trip. In \n     his e-mail, Vice President Gore stated ``If we have already \n     booked the fundraisers, then we have to decline.'' This \n     demonstrates that the Vice President knew that the Temple \n     event was a fundraiser, since he used the plural term \n     ``fundraisers'' and the only acknowledged fundraiser he \n     attended on April 29 was a dinner at a home near San Jose. A \n     true and correct copy of a print-out of the Vice President's \n     e-mail message to Kimberly Tilley is attached hereto as \n     Exhibit   . All of the contents of the attached print-out are \n     hereby incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n       71. The facts outlined above constitute sufficient specific \n     and credible evidence to make a prima facie case that the \n     President, Vice President, and other high-ranking executive \n     branch officials conspired to violate the Federal campaign \n     finance laws in order to raise large sums of money to spend \n     on the 1996 presidential campaign. The Attorney General has \n     therefore violated the letter and the spirit of the \n     Independent Counsel Statute by failing to appoint an \n     independent counsel to investigate these allegations.\n\n Johnny Chung, Loral, Inc. and the Launching of American Satellites by \n                                 China\n\n       72. On March 14, 1996, the White House announced that \n     President Clinton had decided to transfer control over export \n     licensing for communications satellites from the State \n     Department to the Commerce Department. This decision makes it \n     much easier for American companies to get permission to \n     export their satellites to be launched by Chinese rockets. \n     (The New York Times, 5/17/98). In February, 1998, the White \n     House gave permission to Loral Space and Communications Ltd. \n     to launch one of its satellites on a Chinese rocket. (The \n     Washington Post, 5/17/98)\n       73. One of the parties that benefitted from the waivers and \n     eased export restrictions is China Aerospace Corporation, a \n     state-owned company with interests in satellite technology, \n     missile sales and rocket launches. Contracts to launch \n     American satellites are crucial to the financial viability of \n     these ventures. (The New York Times, 5/15/98)\n       74. Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung has told Department \n     of Justice investigators that an executive from China \n     Aerospace named Liu Chao-Ying gave him $300,000 to donate to \n     the Democrats' 1996 campaign. According to Mr. Chung, Ms. Liu \n     told him that the money originated with Chinese military \n     intelligence. Mr. Chung has stated that he funneled $100,000 \n     of this money into Democratic party coffers. (The New York \n     Times, 5/16/98)\n       75. Liu Chao-Ying is a lieutenant colonel in China's \n     People's Liberation Army and vice-president of China \n     Aerospace International Holdings, Ltd., the Hong Kong arm of \n     China Aerospace Corporation. Ms. Liu's father, General Liu, \n     was China's top military officer and a member of the \n     Politburo of China's Communist party. (The New York Times, 5/\n     15/98)\n       76. Johnny Chung brought Ms. Liu to two fundraisers \n     attended by the President on July 22, 1996. The first \n     fundraiser was a $1,000 a plate affair at the Beverly Hilton. \n     The second fundraiser was a $25,000 per couple dinner at the \n     home of a private donor. At the dinner, Ms. Liu had her \n     picture taken with President Clinton. (The New York Times, \n     5/15/98)\n       77. Two American companies, Loral Space and Communications \n     Ltd. and Hughes Electronic Corp., also benefited from the \n     waivers and eased export restrictions on commercial \n     satellites. These companies wanted permission to launch their \n     satellites on Chinese rockets to cut costs and shorten the \n     waiting period prior to launch. These companies repeatedly \n     lobbied the White House to allow them to launch their \n     satellites on Chinese rockets. (The New York Times, 5/17/98)\n       78. In 1996, a rocket carrying a $200 million Loral \n     satellite crashed upon launch from China. Following this \n     crash, scientists from Loral and Hughes allegedly advised the \n     Chinese on how to improve their guidance systems by sharing \n     technology that had not been cleared for export. (The \n     Washington Post, 5/17/98) A classified Pentagon report \n     concluded that the technology transferred to the Chinese by \n     these companies can be used to significantly improve the \n     accuracy of China's long-range missiles aimed at the United \n     States. (The Chicago Tribune, 4/13/98)\n       79. The Justice Department started a criminal investigation \n     to determine if Loral and Hughes had illegally transferred \n     technology to the Chinese. That investigation was still \n     underway in February, 1998, when Hughes and Loral petitioned \n     the White House for another waiver to launch a satellite from \n     China. The Justice Department objected to this waiver, \n     arguing that its ability to pursue its investigation would be \n     severely hindered if the government allowed Loral and Hughes \n     to return to China under the same arrangement they had \n     allegedly abused two years earlier. The White House granted \n     the waiver. (The Washington Post, 5/17/98)\n       80. According to an official familiar with this \n     investigation, the White House decision, ``just about killed \n     a major investigation involving a very sensitive national \n     security issue. On the one hand you have investigators and \n     prosecutors needing to be taken seriously so they can gather \n     information, and then on the other hand the White House is \n     saying that suspicions . . . are not serious enough to keep \n     these companies from going back and doing it all over \n     again.'' (The Washington Post, 5/17/98)\n       81. Loral's Chief Executive Officer, Bernard L. Schwartz, \n     was the single largest donor to the Democratic party in 1996. \n     According to\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n     the Center for Responsive Politics, Mr. Schwartz gave \n     $632,000 in ``soft money'' donations to the DNC in advance of \n     the 1996 elections. (The Washington Post, 5/17/98). According \n     to the Center for Responsive Politics, Mr. Schwartz has given \n     an additional $421,000 to Democrats in the current election \n     cycle. (The Washington Post, 5/6/98)\n\n\n  III. Behavior of the Attorney General and the Department of Justice\n\n A. Failure of the Justice Department's Campaign Finance Investigation\n\n       82. Attorney General Reno has repeatedly insisted that \n     there is no need to appoint an independent counsel to \n     investigate the campaign finance activity during the 1996 \n     presidential election because the Department of Justice's own \n     Campaign Finance Task Force was conducting a professional and \n     effective investigation. Yet in the two years it has been \n     conducting its investigation, the Task Force has proved \n     unable to handle this matter.\n       83. In March, 1996, it was revealed that Vice President \n     Gore had solicited campaign contributions from his White \n     House office.\n       84. For more than five months following Vice President \n     Gore's public defense of his phone calls, Justice Department \n     investigators did not review Vice President Gore's assertion \n     that he acted legally in seeking these contributions from his \n     White House office in 1995-96 and solicited only soft money.\n       85. On September 3, the Washington Post reported that more \n     than $120,000 raised by Vice President Gore through these \n     phone calls had actually been deposited into legally \n     restricted ``hard money'' accounts maintained by the DNC. \n     This report was based on White House and DNC records that had \n     been available to the public. Only after reading the report, \n     Attorney General Reno ordered a 30-day review of the Vice \n     President's phone calls, the first step in the legal \n     procedure leading to appointment of an independent counsel.\n       86. On September 5, the Attorney General acknowledged that \n     she learned of the deposits to hard money accounts from the \n     press: ``The first I heard of it was when I saw the article \n     in the Washington Post . . . . It is my understanding that \n     this is the first time the public integrity section learned \n     of it, as well.''\n       87. On September 20, the Justice Department announced that \n     Attorney General Reno had decided to open a review of \n     President Clinton's fund raising calls from the Oval Office. \n     On September 22, the Washington Post reported that the \n     records that convinced Attorney General Reno to open this \n     review had been turned over to the Justice Department task \n     force several months prior to the decision to open the \n     review, but the Task Force had not examined the documents \n     until that week. The delay in examination was attributed to \n     confused document-handling procedures within the campaign \n     finance task force.\n       88. On September 11, 1997, Attorney General Reno, FBI \n     Director Freeh and CIA Director Tenet briefed the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee on some matters relating to \n     the campaign finance investigation. At this briefing it was \n     revealed that the Department of Justice had critical \n     information in its files for two years relating to possible \n     illegal contributions without advising the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee without knowing it had the information in \n     the first place.\n       89. Specifically, CIA Director Tenet advised the Committee \n     that a particular individual (whose identity is confidential) \n     who had been identified in many news accounts as a major \n     foreign contributor to political campaigns and campaign \n     committees, made these contributions as part of a plan of the \n     government of China to buy influence in the United States \n     government through political contributions. According to \n     Senator Arlen Specter, FBI Director Freeh further advised the \n     Committee that one of the reports upon which the briefing was \n     based had been in the FBI's files for over two years, since \n     September/October 1995, and a second report had been on \n     file since January, 1997.\n       90. On September 16, 1997, Senator Arlen Specter made the \n     following comments about the September 11 briefing from the \n     floor of the Senate: ``In those briefings, Senators learned \n     that the Department of Justice had critical information in \n     its files for a long time on the issue of possible illegal \n     foreign contributions without advising the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee and, apparently, without knowing it had the \n     information or acting on it. That again shows the necessity \n     for Independent Counsel to be appointed to investigate the \n     1996 Federal campaign illegalities and irregularities.''\n       91. These failures of the Justice Department Campaign \n     Finance Task Force have been attributed in part to a policy, \n     pattern and practice which prevented the task force from \n     investigating the President, Vice President and other high \n     level officials covered by the Independent Counsel Statute \n     (``covered persons.'')\n       92. On October 3, 1997, the Washington Post reported that \n     Justice Department prosecutors determined that the law \n     prohibited them from looking at the activities of ``covered \n     persons'' unless presented with ``specific'' and ``credible'' \n     allegations that such covered persons had committed a crime. \n     This approach prevented the Justice Department prosecutors \n     from focusing on or even interviewing senior administration \n     officials, thus insuring that covered persons would be among \n     the last implicated in any possible misdeeds. According to \n     one Justice Department lawyer involved in the investigation, \n     ``You can't ask someone whether a covered person committed a \n     crime.'' That approach and mindset demonstrated the DoJ Task \n     Force could not and did not handle this matter thus calling \n     for Independent Counsel.\n       93. The Act does not mandate such a passive investigatory \n     approach. The Act requires ``specific and credible'' evidence \n     of wrongdoing by covered persons before the Attorney General \n     is required to appoint an independent counsel. Nowhere does \n     the Act require ``specific and credible evidence'' of \n     wrongdoing before the Department of Justice can investigate a \n     covered person on its own.\n       94. This policy demonstrates that the Justice Department \n     has simply ignored evidence of violations by covered persons \n     and, contrary to its public pronouncements, has failed to \n     conduct a competent investigation of the evidence that has \n     been presented to it.\n\n                  B. Estoppel of the Attorney General\n\n       95. In her May 14, 1993 opening statement before the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs on the reauthorization of \n     the Independent Counsel Statute, Attorney General Reno \n     stated: ``The reason that I support the concept of an \n     independent counsel with statutory independence is that there \n     is an inherent conflict whenever senior Executive Branch \n     officials are to be investigated by the Department and its \n     appointed head, the Attorney General. The Attorney General \n     serves at the pleasure of the President . . . . It is \n     absolutely essential for the public to have confidence in the \n     system and you cannot do that when there is conflict or an \n     appearance of conflict in the person who is, in effect, the \n     chief prosecutor. There is an inherent conflict here, and I \n     think that is why this Act is so important.''\n       96. Commenting on the Independent Counsel Statute, Attorney \n     General Reno, at the same May 14, 1993 reauthorization \n     hearing, stated: ``The Independent Counsel Act was designed \n     to avoid even the appearance of impropriety in the \n     consideration of allegations of misconduct by high-level \n     Executive Branch officials and to prevent, as I have said, \n     the actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Act thus \n     served as a vehicle to further the public's perception of \n     fairness and thoroughness in such matters, and to avert even \n     the most subtle influences that may appear in an \n     investigation of highly-placed Executive officials.''\n       97. During most of her tenure in office, Attorney General \n     Reno has interpreted the Act in a manner consistent with \n     these statements. On seven previous occasions she sought \n     appointment of independent counsels when presented with \n     evidence of possible violations by covered officials:\n       A. On May 11, 1998, Attorney General Reno requested the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that Labor Secretary Alexis Herman accepted \n     payments in return for directing clients towards a consulting \n     firm operated by her friend and a colleague.\n       B. On February 11, 1998, Attorney General Reno requested \n     the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt allowed \n     contributions to the Democratic party to influence his policy \n     decisions.\n       C. In November of 1996, Attorney General Reno requested the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that Eli Segal, head of the AmeriCorps program, \n     raised illegal campaign contributions.\n       D. In July of 1995, Attorney General Reno requested the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that former Commerce Secretary Ron Brown \n     improperly accepted a $50,000 payment from a former business \n     partner and then filed inaccurate financial disclosure \n     statements.\n       E. In March of 1995, Attorney General Reno requested the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that former Housing and Urban Development \n     Secretary Henry Cisneros misled the FBI about payments he \n     made to his former mistress.\n       F. In September of 1994, Attorney General Reno requested \n     the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     allegations that former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy \n     violated the law by accepting gifts from companies regulated \n     by his Department.\n       G. In January of 1994, Attorney General Reno requested the \n     appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \n     President Clinton's Whitewater real estate venture.\n       98. Congress relied upon the Attorney General's statements \n     and record when amending and then reauthorizing the \n     Independent Counsel Statute subsequent to the hearing. \n     Accordingly, no Senator saw a need to amend the statute to \n     clarify or emphasize the requirement that independent counsel \n     be appointed in circumstances such as those reflected in the \n     facts recited above.\n       99. Given the Attorney General's statements and pattern of \n     behavior, and Congress' detrimental reliance thereon, \n     Attorney General Reno is estopped from refusing to appoint an \n     independent counsel in the instant case.\n\n                        C. Conflict of Interest\n\n       100. Section 591(c) of the Act provides that the Attorney \n     General ``may'' conduct a preliminary investigation of any \n     person whenever the Attorney General (1) receives specific \n     and credible information which is ``sufficient to constitute \n     grounds to investigate'' whether such person ``may have \n     violated'' any Federal criminal law, and (2) determines that \n     an investigation or prosecution of such\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\n     person by the Department of Justice ``may result in a \n     personal, financial, or political conflict of interest.''\n       101. The independent Counsel statute presumes that it would \n     present a conflict of interest for the Attorney General to \n     investigate the President or Vice President.\n       102. The Department of Justice campaign finance task force \n     has indicted five individuals with close ties to the \n     President and/or Vice President (as detailed below). \n     Accordingly, the investigation of the five individual \n     currently under indictment will inevitably involve the \n     Justice Department in investigating the President and Vice \n     President. In order to avoid the conflict of interest \n     presented by such an investigation, the Attorney General \n     should exercise her discretion under the Act and appoint an \n     independent counsel.\n     Howard Glicken\n       Finance Vice Chairman of the DNC during the 1996 campaign.\n       Raised over $2 million for the Democratic party during the \n     1996 campaign.\n       Made over 70 visits to the Clinton White House.\n       Served as Vice President Gore's Florida Finance Chairman \n     during his 1988 Presidential bid.\n     Maria Hsia\n       Accompanied Vice President Gore on a trip to Taiwan paid \n     for by a Buddhist organization in 1989.\n       Organized a $250-a-plate Beverly Hills fund-raiser for \n     Gore's 1990 Senate re-election campaign.\n       Helped organize April 29, 1996 fund-raising lunch at the \n     Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple attended by Vice President Gore which \n     raised $140,000 for the DNC.\n     Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie\n       Owned a Chinese Restaurant in Little Rock, Arkansas, \n     frequented by President Clinton during his tenure as Governor \n     of Arkansas.\n       Raised $640,000 for President Clinton's legal defense fund \n     in 1995-96.\n       Raised $645,000 for the Democratic party in 1995-96.\n       Made at least 23 visits to the Clinton White House.\n     Johnny Chung\n       Contributed $366,000 to the DNC between August 1994 and \n     August 1996.\n       Contributed $50,000 to the DNC on March 9, 1995. Handed \n     check to Hillary Clinton's Chief of Staff, Maggie Williams, \n     at the White House.\n       Two days later, Mr. Chung and a delegation of six Chinese \n     officials were admitted to watch President Clinton tape his \n     weekly radio address.\n       Made at least 49 visits to the Clinton White House.\n      Pauline Kanchanalak\n       Raised $679,000 for the Democratic Party and candidates.\n       Visited the Clinton White House 26 times.\n       Appointed Managing Trustee of the DNC.\n       Recommended by the White House for a position on an \n     executive trade policy committee.\n\n   D. Additional Facts relating to the Attorney General's Refusal to \n                      Appoint Independent Counsel\n\n Letters to Attorney General Reno from the Senate and House Judiciary \n                         Committees and Others\n\n       103. On March 13, 1997, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Hatch and all Republican members of the Committee sent a \n     letter to Attorney General Reno setting forth, in great \n     detail, evidence of involvement by individuals and \n     associations, including foreign interests, that point to \n     potential involvement by senior Executive Branch officials. \n     The letter also notes the ``inherent conflict of interest'' \n     in the Attorney General investigating the Executive Branch, \n     and calls on the Attorney General to commence a preliminary \n     investigation. A true and correct copy of the March 13, 1997 \n     letter is attached as Exhibit ----. All of the contents of \n     the attached letter are hereby incorporated by reference as \n     part of the factual and evidentiary basis for the relief \n     sought in this complaint.\n       104. On April 14, 1997, the Attorney General responded by \n     letter to Chairman Hatch that she would not initiate a \n     preliminary investigation under the Act. A true and correct \n     copy of the April 14, 1997 letter is attached hereto as \n     Exhibit ----. All of the contents of the attached letter are \n     hereby incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n       105. On October 11, 1996 Senator John McCain wrote to the \n     Attorney General requesting that she appoint an independent \n     counsel. Senator McCain wrote to the Attorney General again \n     on October 29, 1996 in a joint House-Senate letter. True and \n     correct copies of the October 11, 1996 and October 29, 1996 \n     letters are attached hereto as Exhibit ---- and ----, \n     respectively.

On September 3, 1997, House Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Hyde and all of the Republican members of the \n     Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Reno setting \n     forth, in great detail, the alleged wrongdoings of the \n     Clinton Administration in the 1996 campaign. The letter \n     requests that the Attorney General apply for the appointment \n     of an independent counsel to investigate these matters. A \n     true and correct copy of the September 3, 1997 letter is \n     attached as Exhibit   . All of the contents of the attached \n     letter are hereby incorporated by reference as part of the \n     factual and evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this \n     complaint.\n       107. On November 13, 1997, House Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Hyde and a majority of the Republican members of the \n     Committee sent a letter to Attorney General Reno setting \n     forth, in great detail, the allegation that the U.s. \n     Department of the Interior made policy changes in exchange \n     for campaign contributions. The letter calls on Attorney \n     General Reno to immediately request appointment of an \n     independent counsel to investigate these allegations. A true \n     and correct copy of the November 13, 1997 letter is attached \n     as Exhibit   . All of the contents of the attached letter are \n     hereby incorporated by reference as part of the factual and \n     evidentiary basis for the relief sought in this complaint.\n\n The Preliminary Investigations and Failure to Appoint an Independent \n                                Counsel\n\n       108. On September 3, 1997, Attorney General Reno launched a \n     preliminary investigation under The Act into allegations that \n     Vice President Gore may have violated Federal law by making \n     fund-raising telephone calls from his office in the White \n     House.\n       109. On October 14, 1997, Attorney General Reno launched a \n     preliminary investigation under The Act into allegations that \n     President Clinton may have violated Federal law by making \n     fund-raising telephone calls from the Oval Office.\n       110. On November 25, 1997, Senator Arlen Specter wrote to \n     Attorney General Reno setting forth in great detail the \n     reasons why her focus on the issue of fund-raising telephone \n     calls in both preliminary investigations was too limited. \n     Senator Specter noted that there is ``substantial evidence of \n     wrongdoing which meets the specific and credible threshold in \n     the Independent Counsel Statute'' and cited five specific \n     examples of issues other than the telephone calls which \n     require appointment of independent counsel. A true and \n     correct copy of the November 25, 1997 letter is attached \n     as Exhibit  . All of the contents of the attached letter \n     are hereby incorporated by reference as part of the \n     factual and evidentiary basis for the relief sought in \n     this complaint.\n       111. On December 2, 1997, Attorney General Reno announced \n     that she decided not to seek an independent counsel to \n     investigate these allegations against the President and Vice \n     President. On the same day, she formally advised the special \n     panel of three judges who oversee the appointment of \n     independent counsel that ``there are no reasonable grounds'' \n     for further investigation.\n       112. On August 26, 1998, Attorney General Reno launched a \n     preliminary investigation under The Act into allegations that \n     Vice President Gore lied when he told investigators that he \n     did not know that a percentage of the money he raised from \n     the White House went into hard money accounts. The \n     investigation was initiated after the Department of Justice \n     received evidence that the Vice President had attended a \n     meeting in which the division of such funds into both hard \n     and soft money was discussed.\n       113. On November 24, 1998, Attorney General Reno announced \n     that she decided not to seek an independent counsel to \n     investigate the allegations that Vice President Gore lied to \n     the campaign finance investigators. On the same day, she \n     formally advised the special panel of three judges who \n     oversee the appointment of independent counsels that ``there \n     are no reasonable grounds'' for further investigation of the \n     allegations against the Vice President.\n       114. On September 1, 1998, Attorney General Reno launched a \n     preliminary investigation under The Act into allegations that \n     former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes lied to \n     the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee about whether he \n     made efforts to aid the Teamsters Union in exchange for \n     campaign contributions.\n       115. On November 30, 1998, at the end of the 90-day \n     preliminary investigation, Attorney General Reno decided to \n     delay her decision whether to appoint an independent counsel \n     to investigate Harold Ickes. On that date, Attorney General \n     Reno requested and received from the special three judge \n     panel a 60-day extension of the preliminary investigation \n     into Ickes.\n\n Rejection of Advice from Top Investigators to Appoint an Independent \n                                Counsel\n\n       116. In deciding not to appoint an independent counsel, \n     Attorney General Reno rejected the advice that had been given \n     to her by two individuals she had placed at the top of the \n     Justice Department's campaign finance investigation: Louis \n     Freeh and Charles LaBella.\n       117. On October 15, 1997, Attorney General Reno testified \n     before the House Judiciary Committee that she had given FBI \n     Director Louis Freeh a leading role in the Justice \n     Department's campaign finance inquiry and that no avenues of \n     investigation would be closed without Freeh's approval.\n       118. On December 9, 1997, Director Freeh testified before \n     the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight that \n     he had recommended to Attorney General Reno that she appoint \n     an independent counsel with respect to the campaign finance \n     investigation. It was later disclosed that in a 22-\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n     page memorandum to the Attorney General explaining his \n     conclusions, Director Freeh concluded that, ``It is difficult \n     to imagine a more compelling situation for appointing an \n     independent counsel.''\n       119. In September, 1997, Attorney General Reno appointed \n     Charles G. LaBella to direct the Justice Department's \n     campaign finance investigation task force.\n       120. On May 3, 1998, Mr. LaBella issued a statement \n     confirming that he had recommended to Attorney General Reno \n     that she appoint an independent counsel to investigate \n     whether President Clinton and Vice President Gore violated \n     the law by making telephone solicitations from their offices.\n       121. On July 16 or 17, 1998, Mr. LaBella delivered a \n     detailed report to Attorney General Reno arguing that she had \n     no alternative but to seek an independent prosecutor to \n     investigate political fund-raising abuses in President \n     Clinton's reelection campaign. In particular, Mr. LaBella \n     concluded that there is enough specific and credible evidence \n     of wrongdoing by high-ranking officials to trigger the \n     mandatory provisions of the Independent Counsel statute. The \n     report was based on all of the evidence gathered by the \n     Department's task force including confidential evidence and \n     grand jury testimony not available to the public.\n       122. September, 1997, Attorney General Reno appointed James \n     V. DeSarno Jr. to serve as special F.B.I. agent in charge of \n     the campaign finance investigation task force.\n       123. On August 4, 1998, Mr. DeSarno testified before the \n     House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight that he \n     agreed with the conclusion in Mr. LaBella's memo that \n     Attorney General Reno has no alternative but to seek an \n     independent counsel to investigate campaign finance \n     violations.\n\n              Reliance upon Advice from Secondary Advisors\n\n       124. In deciding not to appoint independent counsel, \n     Attorney General Reno relied primarily upon the advice of two \n     individuals further removed from the investigation than \n     Freeh, LaBella and DeSarno: Lee Radek and Robert Litt.\n       125. Robert. S. Litt has plated an active role in the \n     meetings in which Attorney General Reno has concluded not to \n     appoint Independent Counsel. Mr. Litt was nominated to be \n     chief of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice \n     in 1995, but was never confirmed for this position. He \n     currently serves as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \n     General and is the de facto head of the criminal division.\n       126. Prior to moving to the Department of Justice, Mr. Litt \n     was the law partner of David Kendall, the President's private \n     attorney.\n       127. Lee Radek is a career bureaucrat who currently serves \n     as chief of the Criminal Division's public integrity section. \n     Mr. Radek and the lawyers working under him have been among \n     the strongest advocates for keeping the inquiry inside the \n     Department of Justice. (New York Times, 12/11/97).\n       128. Mr. Radek has been openly critical of the independent \n     counsel statute and has rejected the fundamental premise of \n     the law--that the Department of Justice should not be in \n     charge of investigating certain high officials in the \n     executive branch. According to Mr. Radek, ``The independent \n     counsel statute is an insult. It's a clear enunciation by the \n     legislative branch that we cannot be trusted on certain \n     species of cases.'' (New York Times, 7/6/97) Radek also \n     complained that the Independent Counsel statute places his \n     prosecutors in a no-win situation, ``If we do very well in \n     our investigation, we have to turn the case over to an \n     independent counsel. If we don't find anything, then we're \n     criticized for not making the case.'' (New York Times, 7/6/\n     97)\n\n Special Standing of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees to Sue \n           for Enforcement of the Independent Counsel Statute\n\n       129. The Act provides that: ``The Committee on the \n     Judiciary of either House of the Congress, or a majority of \n     majority party members or a majority of all nonmajority party \n     members of either such committee may request in writing that \n     the Attorney General apply for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel.'' 28 U.S.C. 592(g)(1).\n       130. The Attorney General must respond in writing to such \n     request and report to the Committees whether she has begun or \n     will begin a preliminary investigation of the matters with \n     respect to which the request was made, and the reasons for \n     her decision. 28 U.S.C. 592(g)(2).\n       131. This specific inclusion of the Judiciary Committees \n     within the framework of the Act and the role granted these \n     Committees thereunder is evidence that Congress intended to \n     create procedural rights--including the right to sue for \n     enforcement--in members of the Judiciary Committees.\n       132. Both the D.C. Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have made \n     specific reference to the fact that members of the Judiciary \n     Committees have been given a special oversight role within \n     the scheme of the Act and each court has stated that this \n     role is evidence that Congress intended to create broad \n     procedural rights in the members of these Committees. See \n     Banzhaf v. Smith, 737 F.2d. 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1984) and Dellums \n     v. Smith, 797 F.2d 817 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n\n                  FIRST COUNT (For a Writ of Mandamus)\n\n       133. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all of the foregoing \n     allegations in the Complaint as if set forth at length \n     herein.\n       134. Defendant, Attorney General Reno, has been presented \n     with specific and credible evidence pertaining to possible \n     violations of criminal law by covered persons which is \n     sufficient to create reasonable grounds to believe that \n     further investigation is warranted.\n       135. Given this evidence, Attorney General Reno is required \n     under the Act to make an application to the special division \n     of the circuit court for appointment of an independent \n     counsel.\n       136. Notwithstanding the duties imposed on her under the \n     Act and repeated requests by Plaintiffs, the Attorney General \n     has refused to apply to the special division of the circuit \n     court for appointment of an independent counsel.\n       137. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel despite the evidence \n     that has been presented to her is a violation of her \n     mandatory duty to do so under the Act or, in the alternative, \n     is a gross abuse of her discretion to do so under the Act.\n       138. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel injures the plaintiffs, \n     who have requested that she do so in accordance with their \n     special authority under the Act and who have supplied her \n     with information sufficient to trigger such an appointment \n     under the Administrative Procedures Act.\n       WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court \n     require the Defendant, the Attorney General of the United \n     States Janet Reno, to apply to the special division of the \n     circuit court for the appointment of an independent counsel \n     to investigate evidence that criminal violations may have \n     occurred in the 1996 presidential campaign involving covered \n     persons, including possibly the President and/or the Vice \n     President.\n\n\n  SECOND COUNT (For a Court Order under the Administrative Procedures \n                                  Act)\n\n       139. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all of the foregoing \n     allegations in the Complaint as if set forth at length \n     herein.\n       140. Despite the specific and credible evidence that has \n     been presented to her, the Attorney General has unlawfully \n     withheld and unreasonably delayed applying for the \n     appointment of an independent counsel.\n       141. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel injures the plaintiffs, \n     who have requested that she do so in accordance with their \n     special authority under the Act and who have supplied her \n     with information sufficient to trigger such an appointment \n     under the Act.\n       WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court \n     require the Defendant, the Attorney General of the United \n     States Janet Reno, to apply to the special division of the \n     circuit court for the appointment of an independent counsel \n     to investigate evidence that criminal violations may have \n     occurred in the 1996 presidential campaign involving covered \n     persons, including possibly the President and/or the Vice \n     President.\n\n\n                    THIRD COUNT (For a Court Order)\n\n       142. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all of the foregoing \n     allegations in the Compliant as if set forth at length \n     herein.\n       143. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for the \n     appointment of an independent counsel despite the specific \n     and credible evidence that has been presented to her is a \n     gross abuse of any discretion she may have to do so under the \n     Act.\n       144. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel effectively blocks the \n     proper and orderly administration of justice in the instant \n     case.\n       145. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel injures the plaintiffs, \n     who have requested that she do so in accordance with their \n     special authority under the Act and who have supplied her \n     with information sufficient to trigger such an appointment \n     under the Act.\n       WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court \n     exercise its inherent power under common law to issue an \n     order appointing an independent counsel to investigate \n     evidence that criminal violations may have occurred in the \n     1996 presidential campaign involving covered persons, \n     including possibly the President and/or the Vice President.\n\n\n   FOURTH COUNT (For Specific Performance under Promissory Estoppel)\n\n       146. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all of the foregoing \n     allegations in the Complaint as if set forth at length \n     herein.\n       147. In her May 14, 1993 statement before the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs on the reauthorization of \n     the Independent Counsel Statute (quoted above), Attorney \n     General Reno made statements which assured the Committee and \n     the Senate that she shared their interpretation of the \n     Independent Counsel Statute and that she understood her \n     obligation to appoint an independent counsel in circumstances \n     such as those reflected in the facts recited above.\n       148. On four prior occasions during her tenure in office, \n     Attornet General Reno has applied for appointment of an \n     independent counsel. This pattern of conduct further assured \n     the Committee and the Senate that she understood her \n     obligation to appoint an independent counsel in circumstances \n     such as those recited in the facts above.\n       149. The member of the U.S. Senate relied upon Attorney \n     General's statements and record when amending and then \n     reauthorizing the Independent Counsel Statute subsequent to \n     the hearing. Accordingly, no Senator saw a need to amend the \n     statute to clarify or emphasize the requirement that \n     independent counsel be appointed in circumstances such as \n     those reflected in the facts recited above.\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\n       150. The failure of the Attorney General to apply for \n     appointment of an independent counsel injures the plaintiffs, \n     who have requested that she do so in accordance with their \n     special authority under the Act and who have supplied her \n     with information sufficient to trigger such an appointment \n     under the Act.\n       WHEREFORE, the Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court \n     exercise its power under the common law doctrine of \n     promissory estoppel to issue an order appointing an \n     independent counsel to investigate evidence that criminal \n     violations may have occurred in the 1996 presidential \n     campaign involving covered persons, including possibly the \n     President and/or the Vice President.\n       Dated: December   , 1998.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                    ------ ------,\n                                          Attorney for Plaintiffs.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, it is interesting when you think of the \ndebate we are in. Here we are as Americans in the richest and most \npowerful country the world has ever known. There is really no \ncomparison to it. We have the most highly trained and capable health \nprofessionals of any nation. Our technology leads the way on the \nfrontiers of medical science. People come from all over the world to \ntrain and to be educated in medical science. But at that same time, \nmillions of American families in our Nation with its first-class \nmedical expertise are subject to second-class treatment because of the \npolicies and practices of our health insurance system.\n  I have to ask, is it really beyond the ability of this great Nation \nto ensure access and accountability to help these families? Of course \nit is not. Is this an important enough problem that solving it should \nbe a high priority for this body, the Senate? Of course it is.\n  Although the President and many of the Senators have done their \nutmost for years to encourage the Congress to act, I am afraid that the \nRepublican leadership long ago decided that protection for those \nAmericans insured through private managed care plans was just not a \npriority for us--this despite the fact that we have had calls from \nnonpartisan groups from every corner of the Nation. The Republican \nleadership has refused to schedule a full and reasonable debate to \nconsider the vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Certainly from my experience in the Senate it is clear that the only \nstep left is, of course, to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights directly \nto the floor. I believe we should keep it there until the Republicans, \nwho are in the majority, agree that it merits the priority \nconsideration that we--and I believe most of the American people, \nRepublican and Democrat--strongly believe it does.\n  I applaud Senator Kennedy, Senator Durbin, and many others for \nleading this vigilance to save the Patients' Bill of Rights. I commend \nthe distinguished Senate Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, for continuing \nto insist on a reasonable time agreement as he attempts to negotiate \nwith our friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  I urge our friends in the Republican Party to make the Patients' Bill \nof Rights a high priority. Let's get on with the debate, vote it up or \nvote it down, and then go on to the other matters, things such as the \nagriculture appropriations bill and other business before us.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that we Democrats have presented \nreflects a fundamental expectation that Americans have about their \nhealth care. That expectation is that doctors--not insurance \ncompanies--should practice medicine.\n  To really sum up our Patients' Bill of Rights, we are saying that \ndoctors--not insurance companies--should be the first decisionmakers in \nyour health care. The rights that we believe Americans should have in \ndealing with health insurers are not vague theories; they are \npractical, sensible safeguards. You can hear it if you talk to anybody \nwho has sought health care. You can hear it if you talk to anybody who \nprovides health care. I hear it from my wife, who is a registered \nnurse. I hear it from her experiences on the medical-surgical floors in \nthe hospitals she has worked in. If you want to see how some of them \nwould work in practice, come with me to Vermont. My state has already \nimplemented a number of these protections for the Vermonters who are \ninsured by managed care plans. I am proud Vermont has been recognized \nnationally for its innovation and achievements in protecting patients' \nrights.\n\n  I consistently hear from Vermonters who are thankful for the actions \nthat the Vermont legislature has taken to ensure patients are \nprotected. But I also hear from those who do not yet fall under these \nprotections.\n  This Congress should waste not more time and instead make a \ncommitment to the American people that we will fully debate the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We must protect those Vermonters who are not \ncovered under current state law. And we must act now to cover every \nother American who expects fair treatment from their managed care plan.\n  I am one of many in this body who firmly believe in the importance of \nthis bill. I hope the leadership is listening and I hope they hear what \nwe are saying. It is what Americans are saying.\n  As I stated at the beginning of this message, millions of American \nfamilies in this Nation of first-class medical expertise are subject to \nsecond-class treatment because of the policies and practices of our \nhealth insurance system.\n  We have heard a lot of ``our bill has this,'' and ``their bill \ndoesn't have that.'' Here are some of the facts. Our Patients' Bill of \nRights will protect every patient covered by private managed care \nplans. And it offers protections that make sense, such as ensuring a \npatient has access to emergency room services in any situation that a \n``prudent layperson'' would regard as an emergency, guaranteeing access \nto specialists for patients with special conditions, and making sure \nthat children's special needs are met, including access to pediatric \nspecialists when they need it.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights provides strong protections for women. \nIt will provide women with direct access to their ob/gyn for preventive \ncare. Through successful research, we have learned that regular \nscreening can prevent breast cancer and cervical cancer in women of all \nages.\n  We stress the importance of regular visits to ob/gyns to the women in \nour lives: our mothers, our wives, our daughters, and our sisters. But \nwe make it difficult for these women to receive care by requiring \nreferrals and putting other obstacles in the way of their care. Let us \nmake sure women have the direct access they need and deserve.\n  Our bill also will give women time to recover when they have \nundergone surgery. We should let doctors and patients determine if a \nlengthier hospital stay is necessary, and our bill would let them \ndecide.\n  Health plans must be held accountable for their actions, just as \ndoctors and hospitals are today. Out Patients Bill of Rights provides a \nvariety of ways to achieve this goal.\n  First, patients must be able to appeal decisions made by their health \nplans. In our bill, any decision to deny, delay or otherwise overrule \ndoctor-prescribed treatments could be appealed. And our bill says these \nappeals must be addressed in a timely manner, especially when the life \nof a patient is threatened. Patients must have the opportunity to \nquestion managed care decisions and insurance companies must be held \naccountable, especially when they decide to overrule the decisions of a \ntrained health care providers.\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\n  Our bill would require an external appeals process through an \nindependent body with the ability and the authority to resolve disputes \nin a variety of instances. We know this is often a successful way of \nmediating labor disputes. Why can't it work for our patients, too?\n  Finally, the Patients' Bill of Rights would allow patients to hold \nhealth plans liable for their decisions. This is essential. How can we \njustify holding our physicians responsible for decisions that they are \nnot really making? Doctors must account for the decisions they make. \nWhy shouldn't health insurers be responsible for theirs?\n  Differences between patients and their managed care plans can readily \nbe resolved without going to court. But that will not and should not \nalways be the case.

WHITE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the question of \nnominations. We are approaching another Senate recess. We ought to act \non judicial nominations, the longstanding vacancies in the Federal \ncourts around this country. This is the fourth extended Senate recess \nthis year. So far this year, the Senate has confirmed only two judicial \nnominees for the longstanding vacancies that plague the Federal courts. \nThat is one judge per calendar quarter; it is one half a judge per \nSenate vacation. We should do better.\n  Let me focus on one: Justice Ronnie White. This past weekend marked \nthe 2-year anniversary of the nomination of this outstanding jurist to \nwhat is now a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court in \nthe Eastern District of Missouri. He is currently a member of the \nMissouri Supreme Court.\n  He was nominated by President Clinton in June of 1997, 2 years ago. \nIt took 11 months before the Senate would even allow him to have a \nconfirmation hearing. His nomination was then reported favorably on a \n13-3 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 21, 1998. Senators \nHatch, Thurmond, Grassley, Specter, Kyl and DeWine were the Republican \nmembers of the committee who voted for him along with the Democratic \nmembers. Senators Ashcroft, Abraham, and Sessions voted against him.\n  Even though he had been voted out overwhelmingly, he sat on the \ncalendar, and the nomination was returned to the President after 16 \nmonths with no action.\n  The President has again renominated him. I call again upon the Senate \nJudiciary Committee to act on this qualified nomination. Justice White \ndeserves better than benign neglect. The people in Missouri deserve a \nfully qualified and fully staffed Federal bench.\n  Justice White has one of the finest records--and the experience and \nstanding--of any lawyer that has come before the Judiciary Committee. \nHe has served in the Missouri legislature, the office of the city \ncounselor for the City of St. Louis, and he was a judge in the Missouri \nCourt of Appeals for the Eastern District of Missouri before his \ncurrent service as the first African American ever to serve on the \nMissouri Supreme Court.\n  Having been voted out of Committee by a 4-1 margin, having waited for \n2 years, this distinguished African American at least deserves the \nrespect of this Senate, and he should be allowed a vote, up or down. \nSenators can stand up and say they will vote for or against him, but \nlet this man have his vote.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in his \nYear-End Report in 1997: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a \nconsiderable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final \nfloor vote. The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, \nwell under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: \n``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular \nnominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up \nor vote him down.''\n  For the last several years I have been urging the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate to proceed to consider and confirm judicial nominees \nmore promptly and without the years of delay that now accompany so many \nnominations. I hope the committee will not delay any longer in \nreporting the nomination of Justice Ronnie L. White to the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and that the \nSenate will finally act on the nomination of this fine African-American \njurist.\n  I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women \nand minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to \nthe Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on \nOctober 8 last year. Over the last couple of years the Senate has \nfailed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the \nfirst African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to \nthe Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the \nNorthern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court \nin Puerto Rico; and many others. In explaining why he chose to withdraw \nfrom consideration after waiting 15 months for Senate consideration, \nJorge Rangel wrote to the President and explained:\n\n       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will \n     who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service \n     asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service \n     are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by \n     interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, \n     but it also has its limits.\n\n  Last year, Senator Kennedy observed that women nominated to federal \njudgeships ``are being subjected to greater delays by Senate \nRepublicans than men. So far in this Republican Congress, women \nnominated to our federal courts are four times--four times--more likely \nthan men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more than a year.''\n  Justice White remains one of the 10 longest-pending judicial \nnominations before the Senate, along with Judge Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon.\n  I have noted that Justice White's nomination has already been pending \nfor over two years. By contrast, I note that in the entire four years \nof the Bush Administration, when there was a Democratic majority in the \nSenate, only three nominations took as long as nine months from initial \nnomination to confirmation--that is three nominations taking as long as \n270 days in four years.\n  Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days \nand 11 nominees confirmed last year alone took longer than nine months: \nJudge William Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-\npending judicial nomination in the history of the United States; Judge \nHilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's \nconfirmation took 30 months, Judge Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 \nmonths, Judge Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Judge \nMargaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's \nconfirmation took 15 months, Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation \ntook 14 months, Judge Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and \nJudge Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. Of these 11, eight \nare women or minority nominees. Another was Professor Fletcher, held \nup, in large measure because of opposition to his mother, Judge Betty \nFletcher.\n  In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 10 took more \nthan 9 months before a final favorably Senate vote and 9 of those 10 \nextended over a year to a year and one-half. Indeed, in the four years \nthat the Republican majority has controlled the Senate, the nominees \nthat are taking more than 9 months has grown almost tenfold from 3 \nnominations to almost 30 over the last four years.\n  In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the record for the average \nnumber of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial \nconfirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the \naverage number of days from nomination to confirmation rose \ndramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a \npresidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average \ntime it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke \nthe 200-day barrier\n\n[[Page S7792]]\n\nfor the first time in our history. It was 212 days.\n  Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still \nrising to the detriment of the administration of justice. Last year the \nSenate broke its dismal record. The average time from nomination to \nconfirmation for the 65 judges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since the 104th \nCongress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and should \nend.\n  As the Senate recesses for the Independence Day holiday, I hope \nSenators will reflect on this record and the need to maintain the \nindependence of the judiciary by acting more promptly on the \nnominations of the many fine men and women pending before us. We have \n45 nominations still pending, the Senate having only acted on only two \nall year. The courts are faced with 72 vacancies, many of extensive \nduration. The Senate recesses with a sorry record of inaction on \njudicial nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7792-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7792-S7794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand yesterday there was a press \nconference on the Capitol lawn. They brought in some big, shiny farm \ntractors and a group of folks held a press conference, with the \ntractors as a background, wheezing and moaning about the agriculture \nappropriations bill, saying somehow that bill is getting held up and it \nwill hurt family farmers.\n  I advise my colleagues, if we had invoked cloture as the majority \nleader and others wanted with respect to that bill, we would have been \nprevented the opportunity to offer an amendment on the floor dealing \nwith the farm crisis, an amendment that provides some basic income \nsupport to family farmers during this urgent farm crisis. We would not \nhave been able to do that.\n  Voting yes on cloture, on a bill that the majority leader pulled off \nthe floor and then brought back on a cloture motion, would mean there \nis no opportunity to vote for some kind of income support package for \nfamily farms while there are collapsed prices. We have tried to get \nthat before this Congress.\n  I sat downstairs at midnight in the emergency conference on \nappropriations between the House and the Senate. Senator Harkin and I \noffered an amendment that would have provided about $5.5 billion in \nemergency help for family farmers during this collapse of farm prices. \nWe lost on a 14-14 tie vote. Then we tried in the appropriations \nsubcommittee and lost there on a partisan vote.\n  We intend to offer the amendment on behalf of family farmers on the \nfloor, saying when prices collapse, if this country cares about family \nfarmers, if this Senate is indeed profamily and cares about family \nfarmers and wants to have some family farmers in its future, then it \nwill pass an emergency package to respond to family farmers' needs \nduring this price collapse. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we \nvoted to invoke cloture. We would not have been able to offer the \namendment. Now we have people saying somehow those who voted against \ncloture have disserved the interests of farmers.\n  The agricultural appropriations bill that came to the floor is a \npiece of legislation that funds USDA; it funds the research programs \nand the other programs at USDA. It takes effect October 1. It does not \ntake effect for months.\n  The delay of the bill is not going to injure, in any way, family \nfarmers. The bill will get passed on time. It will be sent to the \nPresident and be signed. Contrary to those standing in front of a \ntractor yesterday, wheezing and blowing about farm issues--some of whom \nI bet wouldn't know a bale of hay from a bale of twine--I guarantee \nbefore that bill leaves the Senate, we intend to offer an emergency \npackage to say to family farmers: You matter; we are going to help you; \nwhen prices collapse, we will help you over the price ``valley.''\n  What happens to a company on Wall Street, Long-Term Capital \nManagement, that threatens to lose billions of dollars? What happens is \nthey get bailed out by the Federal Reserve Board.\n  What would happen if we were talking about big corporations? They \nwould get bailed out, but they are family farmers.\n  Somehow in the minds of some, it does not matter what happens to \nfamily farmers. It matters to me. It does to many of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  I know why they held the press conference with tractors. It is \nbecause they are upset that folks on this side of the aisle offered a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The reason the Patients' Bill of Rights was \noffered in the Senate on agriculture, and it would not have mattered on \nwhich bill it was offered, is we said it was going to be offered to the \nfirst bill that came up if we were not given the opportunity to have a \nPatients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the Senate.\n  It was offered because we have pushed and pushed and pushed and we \nhave been denied the opportunity to debate and offer amendments on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That is not the way the Senate is supposed to \nwork. You are supposed to be able to offer legislation, offer \namendments, have debates, and then have a vote. But some do not want \nthe Senate to operate that way. They want to shut the place down, close \nthe blinds, pull the windows shut, and then say: This is our agenda. \nHere is all we are going to allow you to do. You can offer these three \namendments. They have to be worded this way. If we don't agree with \nthem, we will not give you the privilege of speaking on the floor. That \nis not the way the Senate is supposed to operate and we will not let it \noperate that way. We have rights.\n  The American people have rights. In my judgment, patients in this \ncountry have the right to know all of their medical options for their \ntreatment, not just the cheapest. Patients have the right to get \nemergency room treatment when they have an emergency. Patients have a \nright to keep their own doctors during cancer treatment even if their \nemployers change HMOs. All of those issues are issues we intend to \nfight for on behalf of patients in this country. But we are denied that \nright by a majority who says you can only talk about the things we want \nto talk about.\n  Then when the agriculture appropriations bill or any other bill comes \nto the floor and we offer the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are told by \nthe same folks who say they care about farmers that we have delayed the \nagriculture appropriations bill. This bill will not take effect until \nOctober 1 and is to fund the U.S. Department of Agriculture and had we \nvoted for cloture, it would have prevented Senator Harkin and myself \nfrom offering the specific amendment to deal with income support for \nfamily farmers during this farm crisis.\n  I just have to say it takes some imagination to hold a conference and \nsuggest we are the problem.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true the course of the debate we have literally \ntaken is to debate measures such as the Y2K liability bill with dozens \nof amendments, and there was not a complaint made that we were slowing \ndown the process on appropriations?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly the case. It is the case that we are in \nthe circumstance which now exists because there are some here in the \nSenate who simply do not want to have to vote on the issues we are \ntalking about with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights. They want \nto have a slogan so they can vote for something titled the Patients' \nBill of Rights but one that will not have any strength; one that will \nreally not have any provisions to provide people with the basic rights \nthey ought to be provided with respect to this health care issue.\n  We have talked at great length about the too many instances in this \ncountry where health care decisions are not made by a doctor in a \npatient's room in the hospital or by a doctor in a doctor's office at a \nclinic, but where the answer to what kind of patient care will be \nallowed is to often, in too many circumstances, made by an accountant \nmaking medical judgments somewhere in an insurance company office 1,000 \nmiles away. That is what is wrong with the system.\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is my understanding correct that some 200 groups that \nrepresent consumers and doctors and hospitals and business and labor \nhave endorsed the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights and, to my \nknowledge, the only group endorsing the Republican approach to this is \nthe insurance industry?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator describes it exactly. It is the difference \nbetween one approach that is toothless and an approach that has some \nteeth to it that says we are going to make this work; we are going to \noffer some basic protections to patients.\n  I have a poster I was going to show today. I will show it later in \nthe day. It is a poster of a young boy in a wheelchair named Ethan who \nwas denied treatment by the HMO. He was born with very difficult \nproblems that impaired the use of his limbs. He was denied treatment \nbecause a doctor who had never seen this young patient decided that the \npatient had a 50-percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, and a \n50-percent chance of being able to walk if he gets the appropriate \ntherapy is ``not significant.'' This is from a doctor who did not see \nthe patient. It is not significant that this person might have a 50-\npercent chance of being able to walk, therefore we deny coverage.\n  That is the kind of thing that is happening time and time again. I \nsay to the Senator from Illinois, I have talked about this woman who \nfalls off a cliff, drops 40 feet, fractures her bones in three places, \nis knocked unconscious, taken by medevac helicopter out to a hospital, \nis brought into the emergency room unconscious, survives, and later is \ntold: We will not pay the emergency room bill because you didn't have \nprior approval for emergency room treatment. This is a woman \nunconscious, brought into the emergency room for help. That is the kind \nof thing that ought to stop. Does she have a right through her health \ncare coverage to emergency room treatment when she is knocked \nunconscious from a fall in the mountains? The answer is yes, of course. \nWe demand that right be given that patient in this Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one other question, it is \nmy understanding the Republican bill, supported by the insurance \nindustry, provides no protection to 115 million Americans who have no \nhealth insurance, whereas the Democratic bill provides protection to \nall of those in this country who have health insurance. That is a \npretty dramatic difference; is it not?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is absolutely correct. Again, it is the \ndifference between an approach that is toothless and an approach that \nhas teeth; one that works, makes a difference, one that matters.\n  So we have a couple of bills ricocheting around here for which the \nother side has adopted the same title--which is a nice thing to do, I \nguess: The Patients' Bill of Rights. The question is scope. How many \nAmericans will it cover and what kind of coverage will it offer? Will \nit, in fact, help people like that young boy who was told a 50-percent \nchance to be able to walk by age 5 really doesn't cut it with us; we \nwill not provide the therapy you need? Or will it, in fact, provide \nassurance to someone who is knocked unconscious in an accident, that if \nhe or she goes into an emergency room unconscious nobody is going to \nsay later: You should have gotten prior approval from the emergency \nroom?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I will ask this in the form of a question. Not only are we \nconcerned now about the terrible care that is being given or not given \nto patients, but would the Senator care to comment on what we are \nseeing as a result of how doctors are being treated? Could you have \nimagined 5 or 10 years ago that the doctors would join together to form \nunions to protect their interests, as they are doing now?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator, I was as surprised as anyone to \nread the news these days about doctors wanting to join a union. But the \nreason is pretty obvious. They are tired of not being able to practice \nhealth care on their own. They are tired of someone making decisions \nabout their patients who they have seen. They are the ones who have \nbeen in the examining rooms. They are the ones who have visited the \nhospital beds. Yet an accountant 500 miles away or 1,000 miles away in \nsome insurance office, is telling them how to practice medicine. They \nare flat sick of it.\n  Mr. REID. So I say to my friend, it is not only the patients who are \nrising up, but now we have the doctors rising up because of this \nmanaged care program. I think that is the reason the American people \nhave latched onto this issue and are saying please, Washington, do \nsomething. Does the Senator think that is a fair statement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think that is exactly the case, the reason over 200 \nmedical, consumer, and labor groups support this legislation. I have a \npicture loaned to me by Dr. Ganske, who is a Member of Congress from \nthe House, a Republican, a very thoughtful Congressman. He is a doctor \nwho does reconstructive surgery. He held up the picture of this young \nboy. Let me hold up that picture, if I might, just so everyone \nunderstands what we are talking about. This is a terrible deformity. \nDr. Ganske held this picture up to use it as an illustration.\n  Obviously, you look at this young boy and you say what an awful \ndeformity to have to live with. But there are ways, of course, to \ncorrect this. A young boy doesn't have to live with that deformity. Dr. \nGanske pointed out he did a survey of his fellow doctors and discovered \nthat half of his fellow doctors had experienced the circumstance of \nhaving an HMO say: No, this is not medically necessary. You don't need \nto correct this. It is not medically necessary.\n  Can this young person live with this? Yes, I suppose so. Would any \nprudent American say it is medically necessary to help fix this \nproblem, to give this young child the opportunity to get reconstructive \nsurgery? The answer is clearly yes. That is what is at the root of this \nissue.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Dr. Ganske, who is a conservative Republican from the State \nof Iowa, voted on this issue and joined the Democrats' Patients' Bill \nof Rights because of this and other instances. Here is a man who also \nbrought in a picture later showing what could happen to a child who has \nsurgery that has been perfected over the decades. This is a child who \nhas a cleft palate; is that not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask one further question to the Senator.\n  Isn't it true there are over 200 organizations that support our \nPatients' Bill of Rights and that the only organization that opposes \nour Patients' Bill of Rights is the insurance industry basically?\n  Mr. DORGAN. As I understand it, the Senator describes the case \nexactly. Virtually every organization in health care supports what we \nare trying to do. The doctors in this country, the patients all support \nwhat we are trying to do because they know we are trying to solve \nproblems.\n  Let me go back to this notion there are two different approaches. The \napproach they offer is toothless. It has a title and does not mean \nanything very much. The approach we offer has teeth, is real, and makes \na difference in people's lives.\n  I want to make one additional point and then conclude because I know \nthere are others who wish to speak. I came to the floor today because \nthe majority leader and others held a press conference yesterday with \ntractors as a backdrop saying what we have been doing here is \nshortchanging American farmers. Nothing is further from the truth. \nAmerican farmers are going to be well served by a Senate that does not \npush this agriculture appropriations bill through without emergency \nhelp which farmers desperately need. That is exactly what would have \nhappened if we had voted for cloture as the majority leader was \ninsisting.\n  Had we voted for cloture on the agriculture appropriations bill, the \namendment that Senator Harkin and I were going to offer for $6 billion \nto $7 billion in emergency help for farmers would have been ruled \nnongermane. It would have been over. We cannot pass an agriculture \nappropriations bill in the Senate without addressing this farm crisis, \nand those who stood in front of\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\ntractors and talked about farmers know that. They know better than \nthat. We cannot pass an agriculture appropriations bill and say we have \ndone our job if we ignore the crisis which now exists and if we do not \npass some basic income support package.\n  Senator Harkin, Senator Durbin, and I tried in the midnight hours of \nthe emergency appropriations bill. We lost on a 14-14 tie vote. We \ntried to get it in this year's appropriations bill but lost on a \npartisan vote. We must try again on the floor of the Senate, and we \nwill in the coming weeks.\n  We had a farmer and author testify before the Democratic Policy \nCommittee named Wendell Berry. He has written a book called ``Another \nTurn of the Crank.'' I was thinking about that today because \nyesterday's show in front of these polished tractors was just another \nturn of the crank.\n  As I said, some of these folks would not know a bale of hay from a \nbale of twine and they are telling us about the long-term interests of \nfarmers. Many of us who fight for farmers every day in every way are \ninsistent that before this Senate moves any appropriations bill dealing \nwith agriculture out of this Senate, it does not just deal with the \nprograms and research over in USDA, that it deals with the income needs \nof family farmers. That is what has been at stake in the last couple of \ndays.\n  Frankly, I am not a happy person to see the criticism that has been \nleveled by those who do not know anything about family farmers and \nthose actions which will undercut our attempt to help family farmers.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I wonder if the Senator has the same perception I do, \nbeing from the State of North Carolina. The Senator and I both know \nthat agriculture and our family farmers are in desperate crisis, and \nthey need help in the worst kind of way. He and I are committed to help \nthem. I know that. I have heard him talk about that subject in this \nChamber. I feel very strongly about that.\n  My question is about this Patients' Bill of Rights issue. It seems to \nme what we have--there has been a lot of discussion about the \nDemocratic version and the Republican version--is an insurance company \nbill, on the one hand, and a patients' and doctors' bill on the other \nhand. Will the Senator agree with that?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think that is correct.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Also, we have such extraordinary medical technology in \nthis country. We have the most advanced medical treatment available in \nthe world today. Can the Senator explain to us how that treatment and \nthe fact we are the most advanced medical country in the world today \ndoes anybody any good if folks cannot get access to it? Does the \nSenator have any explanation for that?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator asks a question that relates to the key \ncomponents of our piece of legislation. I again refer to this picture \nused by Dr. Ganske, a Congressman in the House of Representatives, a \nRepublican who supports our basic legislation.\n  Does current medical technology and all the advances in \nreconstructive surgery do this young child any good, if the child does \nnot have access to it, if the child's parents belong to an HMO that \nsays, no, it is not medically necessary we correct that deformity, it \nis not medically necessary at all? Does that kind of medicine help this \nchild? The answer is no. What helps this child is a determination by \nthis Senate that health care plans ought to judge on a uniform basis \nthat this type of deformity is medically necessary and this child would \nget reconstructive treatment to solve that problem.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. We discussed it briefly a moment ago, and that is the \nfact that doctors are finding it necessary to unionize or to make an \neffort to unionize because they are no longer able to prescribe the \ntreatments and tests for their patients they know their patients need, \nin fact because they are not able to make determinations about what is \nmedically necessary, whether a child--if the Senator would hold this \nphotograph up one more time--whether such a child medically needs the \nsurgical procedure the Senator talked about in the last few minutes, \nthe fact that doctors find it necessary to unionize in order to do what \nthey have spent their entire lives being trained to do, which is to \nprovide the best possible medical care to their patients. Can the \nSenator imagine a more powerful indication and symptom of the medical \ncrisis confronting this country today?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I cannot. The Senator makes a point with his question. \nThis is real trouble for a lot of patients, and what we are trying to \ndo and say is health care is changing and patients ought to have \nrights. That is what our Patients' Bill of Rights does. It empowers \npatients and allows them to believe that if they are covered with \nhealth care through their HMO, there will be some basic guarantees that \njust, prudent people expect would be there anyway but which we have now \nseen in recent years by some HMOs have systematically been denied \npatients.\n  Let me make one final point. Not always, but too often health care \ntreatment has become a function of profit and loss for some \ncorporations. Look at their executives. Find how much money they are \nmaking in this industry. Then they say: But we can't afford to provide \nemergency room care for someone who is unconscious and presents himself \non a gurney to emergency room workers, or we can't help this young \nchild with a facial deformity which clearly needs attention. We can't \nhelp a child in a wheelchair who has a 50-percent chance of walking and \ntold you don't get the therapy because a 50-percent chance of walking \nby age 5 is insignificant.\n  We are saying those are not medical judgments made by a doctor. Those \nare insurance judgments made by HMO accountants 1,000 miles away, and \nthey undercut the very premise of this health care system in which we \nought to expect prudent treatment that a doctor believes is necessary \nfor a patient.

Mr. President, I rise today to note with sadness the \ndeath this morning of the Chancellor of the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, Michael Hooker.\n  Chancellor Hooker was a friend and someone whom I have known for a \nnumber of years. He was a man of vision, enthusiasm, energy, \nbrilliance, and he had an extraordinary love for the State of North \nCarolina.\n  His passing is not only a loss for those of us in the University of \nNorth Carolina family, but for all North Carolinians. By making a great \nuniversity better, Michael Hooker made a lasting contribution to our \nentire State.\n  The truth is that his death was both a shock and a blow. Just \nyesterday he was at work in Chapel Hill.\n  He was diagnosed this year with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and had been \nundergoing treatments at the National Cancer Institute in Maryland and \nalso at the UNC Hospitals.\n  While he was up here, I had the pleasure of seeing him a few times. \nNot too long ago, I ran into him and his wonderful wife Carmen, who is \nan extraordinary woman, right outside the Senate Chamber. He looked \nwell and was feeling optimistic at that time about his health. He did \ntake a brief leave from his job for treatment of the disease, but for \nmost of the year, he was hard at work.\n  I cannot say how sad I felt to learn this morning the news that his \ncancer had grown worse and that it took him at an early age--at the age \nof 53. My thoughts and prayers go out to Carmen, his wonderful wife, \nand to their children.\n\n[[Page S7795]]\n\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, just a little more about Chancellor \nHooker and what he has done for my State of North Carolina.\n  He was the first person in his family to get a college degree--a \nphilosophy degree from Chapel Hill in 1969. His father was a coal \nminer. He always credited his parents' belief in hard work and good \neducation for his own success.\n  After graduation, he left North Carolina to get a graduate degree and \nto enter the world of academics. He taught philosophy at Harvard. He \nwas president of Bennington College and also president of the \nUniversity of Massachusetts system. He was president of the University \nof Maryland at Baltimore County.\n  He returned to North Carolina in July of 1995 to become UNC's eighth \nchancellor. And he really attacked the job. One year he visited every \nsingle county in North Carolina--and we have 100 counties in North \nCarolina--to make sure that every person in the State knew they were \nconnected with their university. Then he made sure that the faculty and \nadministration at UNC were connected to the State. He once took the new \nfaculty and administrators from other States on a week-long bus tour of \nNorth Carolina.\n  The truth of the matter is that men like Michael Hooker have long \nlists of accomplishments. They serve on many blue ribbon panels; they \nget lots of honorary degrees; they write great scholarly pieces; they \nare placed on many ``best of'' lists. I could go through a great deal \nof these with respect to Chancellor Hooker, because he accomplished all \nof those things.\n  But in the end, I think Michael Hooker himself valued people most. I \nbelieve he would like to be remembered for all of the things he did to \nmake people's lives better. He understood the need for education, not \nonly because it expands men's and women's minds but because it makes \nour society better, stronger, more prosperous, and more equitable. He \nwas an extraordinary and wonderful man.\n  He said it best himself, if I could just quote him:\n\n       There is only one reason to have a public university, and \n     that is to serve the people of the state. That should be the \n     touchstone of everything we do: whether it's in the interest \n     of North Carolina and our citizens. Our litmus test is the \n     question: Is what we do in Chapel Hill helping the factory \n     worker in Kannapolis?\n\n  The best tribute we can give him is all the good works performed in \nthe future by those who were touched by him and his life. Chancellor \nHooker was an extraordinary man. He will be missed by me, he will be \nmissed by every single citizen in North Carolina, and he will be missed \nby all those who knew him.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just thank the Senator from North Carolina. \nHaving been an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina, \nhaving done my doctorate work there, having had two children born in \nChapel Hill, and having known Chancellor Hooker, I am also very sorry \nto hear of his death--a very young man. It is really a loss for North \nCarolina and the country. I appreciate the Senator's eloquence.\n  There are other Senators on the floor, so I am going to try to be \nbrief and take only an hour or so--less than that, much less than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7795-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7795-S7796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, coming from an \nagricultural State, I just want to, as I think Richard Nixon would say, \nmake one thing ``perfectly clear'' about agriculture.\n  Senator Dorgan is right on the mark when he makes the point. It is \nsort of an inside thing, but it is very important to the outsiders, \nespecially to farmers, and not just to farmers but to those of us who \ncome from farm States. If yesterday the majority leader had been \nsuccessful on the cloture vote, we would not have been able to bring \nthis amendment to the floor on this ag bill that calls for an \nadditional $6.5 billion of assistance.\n  Let me just say that this ag appropriations bill that just funds \nexisting USDA programs will not do the job. Let me also say, in my \nState of Minnesota, and I will not talk about a lot of statistics that \nI could talk about farm income having dropped 40 percent over the last \nseveral years. I could talk about this last decade where farmers have \nbeen wondering why they see a 35-percent drop in price, and yet the \nconsumer price goes up while the farm-retail spread grows wider and \nwider between what farmers make and consumers pay. We want to know what \nis going on. Let me just tell you, in my State there are a lot of \nbroken lives and a lot of broken dreams and a lot of broken families.\n  Let me also just simply say that time is not neutral; time moves on. \nWe are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. If we do not get this \nadditional assistance to farmers, much of it directly related to income \nloss because of record low prices, then a lot of farmers are not going \nto be able to live to farm another day.\n  We have to get this assistance to farmers. It has to be in this ag \nappropriations bill. I will tell you something. I do not even like \ncoming out here and fighting for additional bailout for farmers or \nadditional credit assistance, because most of the farmers in North \nCarolina and Minnesota, and around the country, are not interested in \nbailout money. They are interested in being able to get a decent price. \nThat's what they are interested in.\n  Let me go on. Let me say, again, this appropriations bill will be an \nappropriations bill that will really help. This amendment calls for \nthis additional $6.5 billion in assistance.\n  Second point: I do not know what the press conference was about here \nin Washington. I was back home with a lot of farmers. There were a lot \nof people from all around the State who came together for a gathering \nat the capital. But I will tell you this. I hope that some of the folks \nwho held the press conference also talked about how we can make sure \nthat family farms have a future several years from now. I think we have \nto speak the truth. And the truth of the matter is, this Freedom to \nFarm bill of 1996 is a freedom to fail bill.\n  The fundamental crisis is a crisis of price. Right now our corn \ngrowers get $1.75 at the local elevator; our wheat growers get $3.13 \nfor wheat. This is nowhere near the cost of production. They cannot \ncash flow. They cannot make a living. Unless we fix this freedom to \nfail bill and we go back to some sort of leverage for farmers in the \nmarketplace, some kind of safety net which will give them a decent \nincome, some sort of price stability, our family farmers do not have \nany future. That is what this is all about.\n\n  I am not interested in semantics. If people want to say, I am still \nfor the Freedom to Farm bill, I don't care. But I will say this. The \nflexibility in that legislation to farm a whole lot of different crops \ndoes not do any good if there are record low prices for all of them. So \nlet's get the assistance to people so they can survive.\n  But let's get beyond the short run, and let's be honest with one \nanother. Let's fix that Freedom to Farm, or freedom to fail, bill, and \nlet's make sure there is some price stability and there is some farm \nincome out there; otherwise, our family farmers have no future.\n  Finally, if there was a press conference yesterday, I sure as heck \nhope there was some focus on the distortions in the market. I would \nlike to join all my Republican colleagues in calling for putting free \nenterprise back into the food industry. I would like to join with all \nof my Republican colleagues in being a true Adam Smith apostle and \ncalling for a market economy. I would like to join with all my \nRepublican colleagues, in other words, in calling for some antitrust \naction.\n  How in the world can our family farmers make it when you have four \nlarge firms, the packers dominating the livestock farmers, the grain \ncompanies dominating the grain farmers? There has to be some fair \ncompetition. Everywhere our family farmers turn, whether it is from \nwhom they buy or to whom they sell, we do not have the competition.\n  Let's really be on the side of these family farmers and insist on \nsome competition. Let's have the courage to take on some of these \nconglomerates that have muscled their way to the dinner table \nexercising their raw political power over our producers and over\n\n[[Page S7796]]\n\nour consumers, and, I say to the Chair, who is my friend, I think over \nthe taxpayers as well.\n  So I am all for a focus on family farmers. This is a crisis all in \ncapital letters. I hope we will have some action. But I want to make it \ncrystal clear, I think these are the issues that are at stake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7796-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7796-S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also want to make it crystal clear \nthat I have been proud to join with my Democratic colleagues out here \non the floor; and the sooner we have Republican colleagues joining us, \nthe better. We have been focusing on the importance of patient \nprotection legislation. Protection of medical records privacy is very \nimportant to the American people. I hope we will have an opportunity to \ndebate the Patients' Bill of Rights because I want to offer an \namendment for segregation of records. The right to privacy is deeply \nrooted in American culture. American citizens expect that we will \ncontinue that tradition.\n  This amendment allows a person to segregate any type or amount of \nprotected health information, and limit the use or disclosure of the \nsegregated health information to those people specifically designated \nby the person. I want to just give one more example and, in this small \nexample, tell a larger story.\n  It would allow a person, any of us, to take some of the particular \nprivate health information, and make sure it is not a part of a total \nrecord by segmenting it off and preserving privacy. We are getting more \nand more worried about genetic testing. For example, if you are talking \nabout a woman who has genetic testing for breast cancer, she may fear \nthe results if she thinks the life insurance companies are going to get \nahold of this information or employers are going to get ahold of this \ninformation. She might not want to even be a part of this testing.\n  We want to protect the privacy rights of people. The same thing could \nbe said for people who are talking to their doctor about mental health \nproblems or substance abuse problems. The same can be said on a whole \nrange of other issues.\n  There is the whole question of making sure ordinary citizens have \nsome privacy rights, some protection in terms of who gets to see their \nmedical records and who doesn't, making sure it is not abused. I will \ngive a perfect example. I have never said this on the floor, but I will \nto make a larger point, I had two parents with Parkinson's disease. \nResearch is now showing there is probably some genetic predisposition. \nAs we move forward with this research, I may want to be a part of \nwhatever kind of test or pilot project is put together by doctors. But \nmaybe I wouldn't, if I thought there would be no way that, whatever \ntheir research suggested, that I wouldn't have some right to ensure I \nhad some protection.\n  The right to privacy is relevant for the potential for genetic map \nresearch, for testing, and, for that matter, treatment, for maybe even \nfinding cures for diseases. There are a lot of people who are not going \nto want to be a part of it, and there are a lot of people who are going \nto worry about that information if we don't have the privacy rights.\n  Conclusion: The pendulum has swung too far. I think we should be \ntalking about universal health care coverage as well, and we will. At \nthe moment, here is what we are faced with.\n  In the last several years, since we were stalemated on every kind of \nmajor national health insurance legislation or universal health care \ncoverage bill, major changes have taken place in health care, not here \nin Washington but in the country. They have been revolutionary in their \nimpact on people. The pendulum has swung too far. We have now moved \ntoward an increasingly bureaucratized, corporatized, impersonal \nmedicine where the bottom line has become the only line, where you have \na few large insurance companies that own and dominate the majority of \nthe managed care plans to the point where consumers, ordinary people, \nthe people we represent want to know where they fit in. Right now they \ndon't believe they fit in at all.\n  So without going into all the specifics, because we have been talking \nabout this for a week, what people in the country have been saying is, \nif you want to do a good job of representing us, please make sure we \nhave some protection for ourselves and our children to make sure we \nwill be able to get the care we need and deserve. That is what we hear \nfrom the patients. That is what we hear from the consumers.\n  What we hear from the providers, the care givers, is, Senators, we \nare no longer able to practice the kind of medical care we thought we \nwould be able to practice when we went to medical school or nursing \nschool. We have become demoralized. Demoralized care givers are not \ngood care givers. So we have a lot of work to do to make sure we have \nfamilies in our States getting the health care they deserve. That is \nwhat this debate is all about.\n  We have been trying for a week to get some commitment from the \nmajority party that we would have a substantive debate. That is the \nSenate. I hope that we will have an agreement. I hope we can come back \nto this. I hope we will have an agreement, and then I hope we can have \nthe substantive debate and Senators can bring amendments to the floor.\n\n  There are several amendments I am very interested in, and probably a \nnumber of other Senators have amendments they are interested in. We \nwill vote them up or down. We will all be accountable. We will all do \nwhat we think is right for the people in our States.\n  The point is, we are not going to accept not being able to come to \nthe floor and fight for people we represent on such an important \nquestion. That is what last week was about. That is what the beginning \nof this week is about.\n  I hope there will soon be an agreement. I hope there will soon be a \ndebate. My hope is that before it is all over, we can pass a good piece \nof legislation that will not be an insurance company protection act but \nwill be a consumer or patient protection act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. Before \nhe leaves the floor, I say to my friend that he pointed out we have \nbeen talking about this for a week solid. I came down to the floor \ntoday to talk about how we have been fighting this for over 2 years. We \nhave increased and we have escalated the debate in the last week, but I \nasked my staff to go through my earliest talks on this subject.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tiffany \nStedman, who is an intern, and Carol Rest-Mincberg, who is a fellow, be \ngranted the privilege of the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know we are running short of time so I will be glad to \nyield to my colleagues for questions.\n  On January 28, 1998, I came to the floor and talked about the case in \nmy State of a gentleman named Harry Christie who had a very poignant \nstory to tell me about his daughter who, when she was 9 years old, was \ndiagnosed with a very malignant and dangerous tumor in her kidney. It \nwas explained to Mr. Christie that there were only a couple of surgeons \nwho knew how to operate on this kind of a tumor, and it would cost \n$50,000 for the operation.\n  He went to his HMO. He said to them: Look, this is my flesh and \nblood, my daughter. She means everything to me. I am assuming the HMO \nwill allow me to go out of the plan, get the specialist, and then the \nHMO will pay the specialist.\n  They said: No, we have good oncologists on our staff. We have good \nphysicians, and they will handle it.\n  He said to them: Did they ever do this kind of pediatric surgery?\n  No, they had never done it in their lives.\n  And Mr. Christie said: This is an impossible situation, and I won't \naccept this.\n  They said: Then too bad. You will have to pay for it yourself.\n  Well, that is exactly what he did. It was not easy.\n  What about parents who can't do that? What happens to their child?\n  This is just one story. I told it January 28, 1998. By the way, the \nend of the\n\n[[Page S7797]]\n\nstory is that Carley is now 15 years old and her cancer is gone. She is \na fantastic young woman.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would like to ask the Senator a question because I \nhave heard of so many similar instances. A young woman, a nurse on Long \nIsland, needed an orthopedic oncologist to remove a tumor from her leg. \nNo, she can't have it. She couldn't afford it. So she went to a regular \northopedist, not the oncological orthopedist, who took out the tumor. \nIt grew back. She can hardly walk. Then she had to go to an oncological \northopedist and pay the $40,000 herself because there was no other \nchoice.\n  So the Senator is right. She has fought for this for so long.\n  I just heard--parenthetically, it is sort of related, because one of \nthe things that inspired some of us to join in this fight was what \nhappened on guns--for instance, that the majority leader in the House \nhas said they would not appoint conferees at least until after July 4, \nwhich I consider truly outrageous. I will talk more about that later \nwhen we get time. I think it is so wrong to not allow the will of the \npeople to happen. We are doing the same thing on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We just want to debate and let people vote on what is \nimportant.\n  I ask the Senator, is this the only case she has heard of in this \nsituation, or do you hear, when you go around your State, as I go \naround mine, hundreds of cases where people are denied treatment that \nthe doctors feel they need? They sit there in anguish.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. They almost go into complete debt to get the operation \nor get an inferior product.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. My friend is exactly right.\n  First of all, I think his point about the House putting off any \naction on the juvenile justice bill that deals with making sure we keep \nguns out of the hands of children and criminals is an outrage. When \nthey tried to put this bill forward, we pointed out it was really a \nsham. Now we have the same thing in the Senate.\n  I think the Senator from North Carolina was speaking before and we \nwere talking. He points out that it is not a question anymore of the \nRepublican bill or the Democratic bill. He said that we ought to just \nsay it is about a bill that is supported by patients and doctors versus \na bill that is supported by insurance companies. We understand on this \nside of the aisle that it is supported by patients and doctors.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask a question \nof her. I think it is important to remind those who are following this \ndebate why we are here. We are here trying to bring this issue to the \nfloor of the Senate. We want there to be a debate between Democrats and \nRepublicans on giving patients and families across America some rights \nwhen it comes to dealing with these insurance companies. The Republican \nleadership does not want this debate. We think the American people do. \nWe think that is why we were elected--because families across America \nknow there is real concern when you take your child to the hospital.\n  I literally ran into a doctor from Highland Park, IL, Sunday night \nwho told me a terrible situation that just happened to him a week \nbefore. He is a cardiologist. A woman came in to see him in his office \non a Thursday complaining of chest pains. He was worried and said: I \nwant to get you into the hospital tomorrow morning for catheterization. \nIt is a diagnostic process to find out what was wrong with her heart. \nShe said: Fine. He said: We will do it tomorrow morning.\n\n  He called her insurance company. The insurance company said: No, we \ndon't approve of the hospital where you want to send her. Let us call \nour hospital under her insurance policy, and we will see when we can \nget her scheduled.\n  They told that to the doctor on Friday. They never had a chance to \nschedule it. She passed away on Sunday. That was a decision made by the \ninsurance company not to let this woman go to a hospital on a Friday \nmorning to get the catheterization. They did not understand her \nproblem.\n  Is this not what this debate is all about?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is exactly what this debate is all about.\n  I want to talk about another case that I brought up about a year or \ntwo ago, also a doctor with a similar story in Texas. He came to \ntestify before the Democratic Policy Committee. This was in Texas. This \ndoctor was assigned to work in the emergency room. A gentleman comes in \nwith terribly high blood pressure. They checked him into a room, and \nthey monitored his blood pressure. It could not be controlled by \nmedication. They were giving him a lot of medicine that didn't work. \nThe doctor called the HMO and said: We need to keep this patient \novernight. I am very fearful he will have a stroke.\n  Bottom line: The HMO says: You control it by drugs. He says: I can't.\n  He has to now tell the patient that the HMO won't cover this, and he \nsays to his patient: Pay for that out of your own pocket; I will fight \nfor your right to be reimbursed.\n  The patient said: How much will it be? Five thousand dollars. I can't \ndo it, says the man, I am sure the HMO wouldn't hurt me.\n  P.S.--you know the story. The gentleman had a stroke, and he is \ntotally paralyzed on one side.\n  The irony of all ironies about this is that under current law the \ndoctor can be sued but not the HMO that actually made the decision.\n  Isn't there any wonder that doctors are joining with patients? You \nspend your life trying to save others' lives, and now you can't do it--\na doctor in Highland Park, and a doctor in Texas. It goes on.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. With respect to the instance described by our \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Illinois, where obviously a \ncatheterization would have saved this patient's life, will the Senator \nfrom California explain to the American public and to our colleagues, \nNo. 1, when they decided initially, no, we are not going to pay for the \ncare, and, therefore, they could not get the test done, and a lot of \nlife-saving tests that needed to be done, what avenue or recourse does \nthat patient have? Is there anything they can do under the \ncircumstances under existing law if we don't pass a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We have to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, because, \nunless you are so wealthy that you can pick up the tab and the cost for \nthese very expensive procedures, you are just plain out of luck. We \nhave said this a number of times to our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle. We have good health insurance as Members of the Senate. We \nreally do. We are fortunate. We have the clout. We have good health \ninsurance. We are trying to bring everybody up to our standards.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask the Senator, isn't it true that, as Senator \nEdwards of North Carolina just said, the example I gave where the lady \ndidn't get the catheterization and passed away--if her family hears of \nthis and they are upset and want to go to court and believe there has \nbeen medical malpractice and negligence--the only exposure and the only \nthing they can sue the insurance company for is the cost of the \ncatheterization, or for the procedure? That is it under the law. And \nthat our bill says health insurance companies, as every other company \nin America, will be held accountable for their actions. If they are \nguilty of negligence, they can be held accountable. But under current \nlaw, a law being protected by the Republican bill, the patients will \nnot have that right of recovery.\n  Is that not the fact?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is the most incredible thing about this. As I said, \nin many of these cases, the doctor can be sued if he is working and he \nis contracting with the plan and not an employee. The doctor can be \nsued--a doctor who is trying to fight for the patient--but not the HMO.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If the Senator will yield for one other question, with \nrespect to what my distinguished colleague from Illinois just pointed \nout, it is my understanding that under existing law we have this very \nprivileged group of insurance companies--very wealthy insurance \ncompanies--that are singled out in American life as not being held \naccountable for what they do. You and I can be held accountable.\n\n[[Page S7798]]\n\n Everybody in our State of North Carolina, and Illinois, New York, and \nCalifornia, can be held accountable. Every other business, small and \nlarge, can be held accountable. But the health insurance industry is \nspecial. It is different. It is better than the rest of us. It can't be \nheld responsible.\n  I want to know how the Senator from California would respond to a \nfamily, or to our children who we are trying on a daily basis to teach \nabout personal responsibility, personal accountability, something that \nall of us believe in deeply, how do we explain that we have singled out \nthis very well-to-do industry for privileged treatment, and, in fact, \nunlike our children, unlike our families, we are not going to hold them \nresponsible or accountable?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator has made a very good point. If we \nbelieve that each of us should be responsible for our actions and our \ndeeds, the current law certainly undermines that. It is unfathomable to \nme. As the Senator from Illinois has pointed out in another debate, the \nonly people in our country today who are truly exempted from any kind \nof accountability--you can't go after them--is a foreign diplomat and \nan HMO. Something is wrong with that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I was going to ask the Senator another question related \nto one of the other problems we face; that is, even before they get the \nright to sue, there is an appeal.\n  Let us say, as in the case that the Senator from Illinois brought up \nand the unfortunate death that occurred, the doctor said that she \nneeded catheterization, and it is denied by the insurance company. The \nonly type of appeal that is required by law is an internal review. I \nwant to know if that is required--that the only appeal that would be \nrequired would be an internal review.\n  I ask the Senator a question, and that is this: Wouldn't it be much \nfairer if it at least were mandated that there be some external, \nimpartial review so that in instances over and over again where \ninadequate health care maybe would be provided before the stroke \noccurs--as in the case related by the Senator from California, and the \nunfortunate death that occurred--some outside, independent reviewer \ngets to say, hey, that actuary didn't quite make the correct medical \ndecision; I agree with the doctor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right on point. It is another aspect of our \nPatients' Bill of Rights where you have a truly independent outside \nreview so the people who are looking at the actions of the HMO are not \npart of the initial decision. On the other side of the aisle, they have \nan appeals process where essentially the HMO says who the outside \nreviewers are. That is not really an outside review.\n  I want to say to all of my friends who have been so good on this \nissue I had such a transforming event 2 years ago at a hearing the \nDemocratic Policy Group had. A woman from an HMO spoke. By the way, she \nwas afraid to show her face. She was on a satellite television hookup \nwith her face covered and her voice was disguised because she was a \nwhistleblower.\n\n  In the course of her testimony, she said something that made my skin \ncrawl. I wonder if my friends feel the same. We kept asking questions \nabout patients. We said: What happened when a patient came in and had \nheart symptoms? How was it handled? Who made the decision?\n  In the course of describing the patient, she said: This unit was a \ncase we felt we had to look at.\n  I said: What did you say?\n  She said: This unit.\n  I said: What do you mean, this ``unit\"?\n  That is how we refer to clients.\n  I said: You mean patients?\n  She said: Yes, we refer to patients or clients as units.\n  I had this sense there was no humanity left. It is all about \n``units.'' It is all about dollars. It is all about the bottom line. It \nis all about profit. It is not about serving. That is why doctors are \nsaying this is against their Hippocratic oath: Do no harm, help people.\n  Now they are doing harm. They are in situations where they have \npredicted patients could die if they didn't get the treatment, and the \nHMO didn't give the treatment.\n  I want to hear from my friends as we go back and forth on this \nquestion.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I was thinking about the comments from the Senator from \nIllinois, the comments from the Senator from New York, and the comments \nmade about the health insurance executive accounting, talking about \nhuman beings as ``units.''\n  I did understand the Senator correctly?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Units, U-N-I-T-S.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Units. Not human beings but units.\n  Under existing law, health insurance companies have proven time and \ntime again they are motivated by one thing, and that one thing is the \ndollar bill. Profit is the bottom line.\n  We have talked about doing two things in a patients' bill--not in an \ninsurance industry bill. Since money seems to be what motivates these \nfolks, we will do two things.\n  No. 1, as the distinguished Senator from New York mentioned, we will \ncreate an independent body that can oversee the insurance industry, the \nHMO. When they make arbitrary decisions, when they decide even though \nit is clear a patient or child desperately needs a treatment or a test \nand that was an arbitrary decision, they can get a quick reversal from \nthat truly independent board. That is one thing.\n  In addition to that, we also say health insurance companies and HMOs, \nas every other segment of American society, will be treated the same. \nThey can be held accountable. They can be held responsible. They can be \nheld responsible in a court of law.\n  Those two things together--a truly independent review, done swiftly \nso reversals can occur, combined and working in concert with arbitrary, \nmoney-driven decisions where if some child is severely injured as a \nresult, they can be held accountable.\n  I wonder if the distinguished Senator would comment on whether she \nbelieves those two things, working together, create a tremendous \nincentive that does not presently exist for HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies to do the right thing to start with, so we never get to an \nindependent review board, we never get to a court of law; instead, \ninsurance companies and HMOs are doing the right thing, not making \narbitrary decisions, doing what the treating doctors are advising needs \nto be done in the very first instance when it is most important and \ncould do the most good.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend from North Carolina for articulating \ntwo areas of our Patients' Bill of Rights which are so important: The \nright to independent review if a patient feels the HMO made a mistake, \nand the ability to hold HMOs accountable if they do the wrong thing.\n  By the way, the opposition from the other side is misleading because \nall we do is say if States choose to hold HMOs accountable, they can. \nWe don't dictate the law on the right to sue. It is up to the States. \nHowever, we lift the impediment to holding them responsible.\n  I think it is important to note that we in America have the safest \nproducts in the world, even though every once in a while there is a \nhorrible example of something monetarily wrong. The reason is, we hold \ncompanies accountable if they make an unsafe product that could explode \nand harm a child. Most of the time we don't have any problem because we \nhave a very clear precedent in law that says if you don't take into \naccount what your product can do to a human being, and they get hurt, \nyou will pay a price. For HMOs, we don't do that. The irony is that \nthey are dealing with life and death decisions every day and they are \nmaking wrong decisions.\n  My friend is right on those two aspects of our Patients' Bill of \nRights, working together.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I follow up on what the Senator from North Carolina \nsaid.\n  Five years ago I introduced a bill on patient protection. This matter \nhas been going on for a while. There is an issue that defines ``medical \nnecessity,'' another issue the Senator from North Carolina raised about \nan external independent appeals process, another issue on ``point-of-\nservice'' option--making sure the families have a choice, and they \ndon't now have when the employer shifts from one insurer to another.\n  There are two bills on the floor. People in the country have become \nmore\n\n[[Page S7799]]\n\nand more disillusioned with the politics that they think is dominated \nby money and special interests.\n  Does the Senator from California agree people want to see a piece of \nlegislation passed that has some teeth in it, that will make a \ndifference and provide some protection?\n  My question is, Do the Senators think this patient protection \nlegislation, what we are trying to do, is a test case as to whether or \nnot the Senate belongs to the insurance companies, or whether or not \nthe Senate belongs to the people in this country?\n  Is that too stark a contrast, or does it ultimately boil down to that \ncore question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think the Senator has put his finger on it exactly \nright.\n  Who is supporting our Patients' Bill of Rights? It is every patient \nadvocacy group, every provider who has an organization, including the \nnurses and the doctors. And who is on the other side? The insurance \ncompanies.\n  What do we have? Two bills. The bill on our side is supported by \nthese advocacy groups and doctors; the other is supported by the \ninsurance companies.\n  My friend is right. People are getting so upset that this place seems \ndominated by the special interests.\n  I yield the remaining time to my friend from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Let me follow up and perhaps engage in a brief dialog. I think the \nSenator from Minnesota made a good point about the heart of the \nRepublican legislation. The most telling point, in my view, is the \ncoverage. It simply covers one-third of the eligible private-insured \nindividuals throughout the country.\n  As I understand the legislation, it is aimed at those self-insurers. \nThese are businesses that contract with HMOs simply to manage the \nhealth care of their employees, so the only people who will directly be \nimpacted by their legislation are those individuals who are essentially \ninsured by their employers directly through self-insurance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REED. In a sense, the only protections in the Republican bill are \nprotections for the insurance industry. They are completely without \nrisk. All of their patients, all of the people they directly insure, \nwhere they directly assume the risk, are exempt from coverage by this \nlegislation.\n  The Democratic bill covers all of those who are private-insured HMOs \nthroughout the United States. If the logic is these protections are \ngood enough and necessary enough for those in employer-sponsored self-\ninsured plans, why aren't they good enough, important enough, necessary \nenough, for those who are direct insurers of HMOs?\n  The answer, frankly, is that the legislation has been designed to \nprotect the insurance companies from any additional risk. It is fine if \nwe put it on employers; it is fine if they have to pay extra or if they \nhave to do these things.\n  However, the only consistent pattern if you look at the coverage, \nthis is not a patients' protection bill; this is an insurance industry \nprotection bill.\n  I yield to the Senator for her comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It perplexes me that my friends on the other side have a \nbill that doesn't cover everyone.\n  It perplexes me it is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. As my \nfriend points out, if you look at the differences, whether it is the \nappeals process--and my friend last week came to the floor and pointed \nout that under the Republican proposal it doesn't look as if there is \nan outside entity looking over the HMO decision but, rather, someone \nessentially selected by the HMO itself.\n  I thank my friend for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7799-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent the \nSenate now proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 148, \nS. Res. 98.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 98) designating the week beginning \n     October 17, 1999, and the week beginning October 15, 2000, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the resolution I have just alluded to is \na bipartisan resolution. A number of years ago we started this approach \nto character education called Character Counts. Senator Nunn was the \ncosponsor of a resolution that passed the Senate on innumerable \noccasions, perhaps as many as five times. It declares for all of \nAmerica that one week during the year will be known as called Character \nCounts Week.\n  Frankly, from this Senator's standpoint, we hear so much about what \nwe ought to do and what we can do to help our young people as they grow \nup in this very difficult society and often very difficult time. We all \nunderstand that there are many people who have primary responsibility \nfor our children. We are not in any way talking about negating that \nprimary responsibility, that of relatives and grandparents and mothers \nand fathers and brothers and sisters to help raise a child with good \nvalues. But we have found, starting about 6 years ago, that the \nteachers in our public schools have been yearning for something they \nwould like to teach our children that for some reason had been \neliminated from both the public and private school agenda. It is \nsometimes referred to as character education.\n  I chose to call it ``Character Counts'' and I chose to speak about a \nspecific program that is being used in many public schools in our \ncountry, and certainly in my State of New Mexico, whereby the teachers \ntake six pillars of character and they embrace those within the \nclassroom--on a day-by-day basis, not as a special class. But let me \njust mention a few of the Character Counts traits that are part of this \nprogram and used in many schools.\n  Let's start with the first one. It is trustworthiness. In some public \nschools and private schools, especially in the grade schools, for one \nentire month, the school would promote the idea of trustworthiness by \nstudents and teachers, who have lesson plans and programs that \narticulate what trustworthiness is. They use this with the students, \nand they from time to time engage in discussions, engage in activities \naround the school that epitomize trustworthiness. I think we all \nunderstand trustworthiness is one of those characteristics and \nqualities of character that says you should not lie. It says if you \nagree with somebody to do something, you should live up to your \nagreement. Trustworthiness has a quality of loyalty to it.\n  Then maybe the next month, one of the other six pillars would be \ndiscussed and woven into the curriculum. The next month, it may very \nwell be ``respect.'' The same kind of thing might happen during that \nmonth in some grade school in New Mexico or Idaho or the State of \nTennessee or the State of Connecticut, where an awful lot of activity \nin Character Counts education is taking place.\n  Maybe the next month it might be the third trait, which is \n``responsibility,'' and then maybe the next would be ``fairness,'' and \n``caring,'' and ``citizenship.''\n  I have been part of this now for a number of years. It is a joy to \nvisit public schools, parochial schools, and other kinds of schools, \nand visit a class and just talk to the young people about the word of \nthe month; to see the teachers, how excited they are that for that \nmonth the children have been talking about responsibility; they have \nbeen talking about that in terms of their classmates, their teacher, \ntheir responsibilities at home.\n  Then if you are lucky, you might choose to visit a school at the time \nonce a month when they are having an assembly. During Character Counts \nassemblies, schools bring all the students together, and they present \nawards to the students that month who were most responsible. One way of \nreinforcing the importance of good character is to reward those who did \nmore\n\n[[Page S7800]]\n\nthings than anyone else that month to demonstrate ``trustworthiness,'' \nor ``responsibility,'' or ``caring,'' or ``respect,'' or \n``citizenship.''\n  Actually, Character Counts and its Six Pillars are not the only \ncharacter education idea and program taking place in our country. But \nit is one of the best. The resolution we have just adopted resolves and \nproclaims the week beginning October 17 of this year, and the week \nbeginning October 15 in the year 2000, to be National Character Counts \nWeek. We request that the President issue a proclamation calling upon \npeople and interested groups to embrace the six core elements of \ncharacter identified by the Aspen Declaration, which are \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship. That week the people in the country observe as National \nCharacter Counts Week, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  There are many Senators who have already joined in this effort from \nboth sides of the aisle. Some are very active in their home States, and \nsome are not. But I can say to any Senator who would be interested, \nthere is a format which is very simple and at the same time very \neffective and profound, where a Senator or any elected official can get \ntogether with the superintendent of schools and others and talk about \njoint sponsorship of Character Counts in that particular public school. \nIf the board of that school condones it and says it is a good idea, \nthen it is all a question of leadership and who wants to pursue it and \npush Character Counts. So when graduation at a Character Counts school \noccurs, you can attend and you can see what the 9 months of character \neducation have done. At schools where arithmetic was taught, grammar \nwas taught, reading was taught, all of a sudden the young kids also \nknow something about these six pillars of character.\n  Frankly, people ask what has gone wrong with our country and what \nshould we do about it.\n  I am no prophet, and I am not one who thinks he knows all the \nanswers, but I say what is missing in the United States more now than \n20 or 30 years ago is character. The old Greek philosophers talked \nabout character. I think it was Plato who said a country without \ncharacter is a country that cannot exist for long, and that for a \ncountry to have character, the people in the country must have \ncharacter.\n  What we are speaking of is our little mission and our part in trying \nto change the quality of lives of young people by letting them know \nthat some things are better than other things, there are some things \nthat are right and some things that are wrong.\n  Nobody seems to object across this land to these six pillars, these \nsix words. It used to be whenever one talked about behavior and said \nvalues, people would wonder, whose values?\n  In our America, under our Constitution, we surely cannot decide which \nreligions values are to be taught in the schools, for as soon as we do \nthat, we have to ask which ones are being left out. And as soon as we \ndo that, we begin to break down the wall of separation between church \nand State, which is such a formidable part of America as it started \nunder our forefathers and continues today.\n  It is interesting. I have asked in many assemblies of adults whether \nthere was any objection in the community--be it the community of \nGallup, NM, or Clovis, NM, or Las Cruces, NM, or Albuquerque, my home \ncity--to these six pillars. If one thinks them through, they are so \nfundamental and desperately needed that hardly anyone can object to \nthem.\n  I wish the Governors of our country--and I am going to ask them, \nalong with my good friend and chief cosponsor, Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut--might adopt this in their States. I want to work with the \nGovernors to move together with the public institutions of education \nand the private institutions of education to begin a broader-based \npromotion of Character Counts in more States.\n  Frankly, a number of our Senators have been involved in the past. \nSenator Dodd has brought this idea to his State, and Senator Lieberman \nworks with him. Senator Frist of Tennessee has had great success in \ngetting it started, and now it is multiplying in his State. I have had \na rather phenomenal success in New Mexico. In my small State, over \n200,000 young people, one way or another in classrooms across our \nState, are learning and living these six words, these six pillars of \ncharacter, as part of their 9 months of education. It is having a \nprofound effect.\n  On the other hand, there are cynics. They ask: How do you know? Are \nyou sure?\n  We do not know for sure, although we are beginning to get some \nobjective analysis that seems to indicate that some of the things going \nwrong in the schools before are not going wrong when the six pillars of \ncharacter are utilized, are popular and preeminent and where the \nchildren are participating in building their character around them.\n  I believe we are better off trying character education than not. If I \nhad to guess what might change things, I would say if the young people \nin our country can build individually and collectively into their daily \nlives the six pillars of character celebrated in this resolution, so \nthey feel part and parcel and immersed in the ideas of respect, \ntrustworthiness, caring, and the other three pillars I have mentioned \nheretofore, we have a better chance of effecting some change for the \npositive than almost anything else we can do.\n  I am going to do my share to keep this going in my State. I am also \ngoing to join Senator Dodd in meeting at the next opportunity with the \nGovernors in a bipartisan way to see if they will engage us in a \ndiscourse and dialog about character education and, in particular, how \nCharacter Counts works in the places it is being tried.\n  There is not an organization that dictates Character Counts for the \nNation, nor does it promote it nationwide. This is an activity left up \nto localities. The only thing is, it is coordinated in our country by \nan entity which came up with these six pillars, the Josephson Institute \nof Ethics. That institute helps provide materials and the know-how for \nlocalities, schools, Boy Scouts, athletic clubs and others to promote \nthese six pillars. But, it is up to the locality to do something about \nit.\n\n  But today, we are going to adopt this resolution celebrating \nCharacter Counts in the hope of raising awareness and encouraging \nstates and localities to consider using this approach in their \ncommunities.\n  I note the presence on the floor of my cosponsor who has done a \nwonderful job in his State, and also speaks about Character Counts and \nthe six pillars in various places in this country. He has had a \nsignificant degree of success. The way it is run in his State is \ndifferent than our State, but, nonetheless, the six pillars are \nbecoming prominent.\n  These six pillars are becoming prominent in the education of young \npeople. We might never have thought we could include them, but in the \nbacks of our minds we always thought they must be used.\n  How can we raise children without responsibility, without caring and \nrespect being meaningful to them?\n  I am very pleased to be part of this again this year. Like I said, I \nam going to try to be a little more effective in expanding Character \nCounts to a few more places with the help of my colleague, Senator \nDodd. As I said in Senator Dodd's absence, we are going to ask \nGovernors to take the lead. We will join them and get the Josephson \nInstitute and any others that are involved in character education and \nmove it ahead so that many States will be like Senator Dodd's and mine \nwhere it will be flourishing among young kids.\n  Mr. President, I say again, today, for the sixth consecutive year, we \nwill adopt a resolution designating the third week of October as \nNational Character Counts Week. Once again, this resolution has \nreceived overwhelming bipartisan support with 57 cosponsors. Through \nthis measure, this body--the United States Senate--pledges its support \nand encouragement of character education and training by setting aside \none week for a celebration. Yes, National Character Counts Week, \nOctober 17-23, 1999 and October 15-21, 2000 will be an opportunity for \nschools, communities, and youth organizations all over America to \ncelebrate the ideals of good character and honor those who have worked \nso hard throughout the year to promote values such as trustworthiness, \ncaring, fairness, respect, responsibility, and citizenship.\n\n[[Page S7801]]\n\n  I believe it is time to reclaim the importance of these values in our \ndaily lives. Many Americans, I regret, have become too cynical about \nthe role of character in modern society. For too long, we have declined \nto discuss fundamental moral principles in our schools for fear of \noffending someone or imposing our beliefs. However, we nearly forgot \nthat this nation was founded upon basic values. These values have bound \nour citizens together and sustained them through wars, depressions and \nother adversities. Indeed, it is our belief in these core values that \ncontinues to make the United States a beacon of hope and opportunity to \npeople around the globe.\n  The ``Six Pillars of Character'' concept reflects these core values. \nThey are the building blocks to helping our children recognize the \ndifference between right and wrong, and they deserve a place in our \nschools alongside lessons in math and reading. Although parents do bear \nultimate responsibility for teaching children the value of human \ndignity and character, we, as a community, have a duty to support these \nmessages outside the home. To that end, Senator Dodd and I are \nexploring ways to expand the role of character education in schools and \nafter-school programs, and we urge our colleagues to join us. I can \nassure the Senate, character education programs have been phenomenally \nwell received in school systems throughout the country.\n  In my own State of New Mexico, teachers have told me they finally \nfeel empowered to discuss what it means to be a good citizen and a good \nperson with their students, and they love it. Schools across the state \nhave walls covered with posters on what ``responsibility'' means, and \nstudents who demonstrate outstanding acts of caring, for example, are \ncelebrated at pep rallies. These simple lessons are taking root among \nour children, and they must be encouraged.\n  I am not suggesting that character education is the magic elixir that \nwill prevent tragedies like the Columbine High School shooting from \nhappening, but it's a start. We, as a society, need to tell our \nchildren that lying is not acceptable, under any circumstance. Stealing \ncannot be allowed. Breaking the law will not be tolerated. We also need \nto reinforce positive values, and programs like Character Counts do \njust that. I applaud the Senate for passing this resolution designating \na National Character Counts Week for this year and next, and I \nencourage my fellow Senators to continue to work with me to ensure that \nour children receive strong and consistent messages on the essential \nvalues our society must embrace in order to succeed.\n  This is Republican time, but I am going to yield on Republican time \nto my colleague, Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico for \nyielding to me. Far more important, I thank him for his leadership on \nthis issue. We have worked on this issue together, along with several \nof our colleagues for the last 5 or 6 years.\n  It all began because the Senator from New Mexico discovered this \nprogram and brought it to the attention of the Senate and asked a group \nof his colleagues if we wanted to get involved in this idea of \nCharacter Counts.\n  I will not go through the long history of it, but one can imagine how \nprovocative a meeting it was in Aspen, CO, when educators, child \npsychologists, and Lord knows who else, gathered together--quite a \ngroup of people--to try to come to some conclusion about six pillars of \ncharacter. Apparently the debate went on for some time on which pillars \nthey could agree on. They finally settled on respect, responsibility, \ntrustworthiness, caring, loyalty, honesty, and fairness.\n  This is not an all-inclusive list. There may be other ideas. There \nmay be synonyms for each of these words that others find more \nacceptable to their particular community.\n  The point is not to be rigid about the words or rigid about how to \nbest promote these values among our young people. What is important is \nthat there be community efforts, efforts at the neighborhood level to \npromote the idea of strong values in our young people, not only young \npeople but young adults and adults as well.\n  One of the beauties of this program is it does not focus just on the \nchildren in the schoolroom. But when the issue of trustworthiness is \nraised as an issue that the school is going to focus on for a \nparticular period of time--a day, a week, a month--everybody in the \nschool is involved with the issue of trustworthiness. The \nadministrators, the teachers, the coaches, the faculty advisers, as \nwell as the students, share in coming to a better understanding of how \nthat particular value can be enhanced and understood and promulgated \nwithin the community.\n  This has been a tremendously successful program. In my State of \nConnecticut, there are now some 10,000 young people who have gone \nthrough a Character Counts Program. I do not know the exact numbers in \nmy colleague's State of New Mexico, but it is easily that or more. We \nare small States. We are not large States. But it is a good indication \nof how successful this program has been. It has expanded primarily as a \nresult of word of mouth, good reputation, one teacher telling another \nteacher in another community how it works, one principal telling \nanother principal how well it works. That is why it has expanded as \nmuch as it has in my State of Connecticut.\n  Education, as we all know, is a central activity in any child's life. \nWe teach them to walk, to talk, to read, and to write. But one of the \nmost important things that a child can learn is how to get along with \nothers and to be a part of the larger community, to be a responsible, \ncaring, loyal, honest, fair, respectful citizen. You can add other \nwords, as I said.\n\n  Regrettably, today, for a lot of reasons which we do not need to go \ninto this afternoon, young people are entering a school system not \nhaving learned these basic values. It has nothing to do with economics. \nIt has nothing to do with race or religion.\n  I can show you communities in my State that are some of the most \naffluent in the country where children are entering a school system \nwithout these values. I can also take you to some of the poorest \nneighborhoods in my State and show you where children are entering \nschool with these values. I could also show you children out of those \ncommunities who do not have those values.\n  So it was decided a number of years ago we ought to try to weave into \nthe educational process the teaching of these values, and to do so in a \nway that would not confront, if you will, the agenda that a teacher, a \nschool system, has on a daily basis, but to weave it into the seamless \ngarment of a student's daily life.\n  So instead of having, say, 15 minutes at the outset of the school day \nin which the principal comes on the loudspeaker and says: We are now \ngoing to talk about trustworthiness for 15 minutes--and if any of us \nhere recall those kinds of discussions growing up as children, we all \nknow what happened: We yawned; we fell asleep; no one paid much \nattention; we hardly remember what the principal had to say--what \nCharacter Counts says is, we are not going to do it that way; we are \ngoing to take the word ``trustworthiness,'' or ``loyalty,'' or \n``respect,'' or ``citizenship,'' and we are going to ask you to weave \nit into the daily life of a student--not for a day or a week, but for a \nmonth.\n  That is what we have done in Connecticut--a month. So from the \nbeginning of the day, whether it is math class or science class or \nwhether the student is going to band or working on the school \nnewspaper, or showing up on the athletic field--whatever the activity \nis--that school tries to take one of those pillars and make it a part \nof that teaching experience, for the full program, in a sense, to weave \nit into it so that everybody in school, for that period of time--in our \ncase, a month--works on that word--``respect,'' ``trustworthiness.'' \nWhat does it mean? What is the absence of it? How do you become more \nrespectful, more trustworthy? What are examples when it does not \nhappen? It becomes, as I said, part of the seamless garment of that \neducational experience.\n  I have to tell you, you may say: Well, this sounds wonderful, \nSenator. It is a nice idea. I wonder how it is working.\n  It is working remarkably well. I can tell you, on the basis of \ncountless conversations I have had with people all across my State, \nthey point to this particular effort as having had success in changing \nthe culture of a school. I\n\n[[Page S7802]]\n\nam telling you it has had a profound effect not just on the students I \nmentioned earlier but on the teachers, administrators, faculty, student \nadvisers. They have all benefited as a result of weaving these \nCharacter Counts programs into their school life.\n  We spent a lot of time over the last couple months after the tragedy \nof Littleton, CO, talking about what we might do to solve the problem. \nWithout belaboring the point, we sort of resort to our old bromides. We \nhave one group of us here that will convince you it is gun control that \nis the answer to the problem, and if we could just deal with gun \ncontrol, we could solve the problem. I happen to believe that is part \nof the answer. We have others who say: Look, if we can clean up \nHollywood, the videos games, that is the answer to the problem. I would \nnot argue, there is certainly an element that contributes to what \nhappened.\n  But frankly, what happened at Littleton, CO, did not happen all at \nonce. The event did. But I suggest to you that what happened in \nLittleton, CO, what happened in Arkansas, and Kentucky and Oregon, and \nother places, in my own State, isolated cases of violence began a long \ntime before the events. There was a breakdown at home. There was a \nbreakdown that occurred weeks, months, years before, that culminated in \nthe tragic events of those days that we all remember with such painful \nclarity.\n\n  What Character Counts does here is, it tries to get at the source of \nthe problem early to try to see if we can begin to change the \ndirection, to offer a foundation in basic values to students so that \nyou might change a young person's ideas on how they relate to each \nother--understanding differences, respecting differences, not having to \nfeel alienated because you are different, not making someone feel \nisolated and alone because maybe they are not a good athlete or a great \nstudent--maybe their clothes are not the ones you would wear or I would \nwear; they may listen to music that you and I would not particularly \nfind appealing--but to understand that each person is God's creation \nand that if we can inculcate them with a basic sense of decency, of \nunderstanding that they are part of a larger community, as I said at \nthe outset, learning to respect each other, to trust each other, to be \nhonest with each other, then we can begin to change the kind of \nculture, in my view, that contributes to this growing sense of violence \nwe too often see among our young people.\n  I again thank my colleague from New Mexico. He is the leader on this \nissue. I am his blocking guard here. I get involved whenever he asks me \nto, because I am so committed to it and so believe in what he is trying \nto do.\n  I think the idea of getting our Governors involved is a tremendous \nidea. We hope that every Governor in the country, if they are not \nalready involved in this, will be willing to join with us and in some \npublic relations efforts, if you will, to raise the level of awareness.\n  We do not have a fixed idea in mind. My colleague mentioned Mr. \nJosephson and his program. It is a fine program. There are others who \nhave a different point of view on how best to make this work. We have \nlearned to respect what works in, say, a Native American community in \nthe Southwest or a highly ethnic community in my State of Connecticut \nwhere you may have differences on how you approach these particular \nvalues. We let local communities and school districts and others try to \nsort out what size fits them best and how to make it work.\n  That is what we want to support, we want to recognize, we want to \nbring attention to. We want to promote and expand this. Again, we do \nnot have any simple answers here for how you stop some of the problems \nwe are seeing that are becoming too frequent in our society.\n  But I stand here today and tell you that if more communities would \nadopt a Character Counts program, if they would at least try this--just \ntry it; and we can get you the information; we can put you in touch \nwith people who can help you work through how to start it and get it \ngoing so you do not have to make it up on your own--then I promise you, \nif you try this, if you really give it a chance, you can make a \ndifference not only in your school's life but the individual lives of \nthe people who enter those institutions.\n  It need not be just elementary schools or middle schools. We have not \ntried it extensively, but I know of one in my State at the high school \nlevel where Character Counts has worked, where the principal said: \nWe're going to try it. And it made a difference at that senior high \nschool.\n  So many say: Kids are too old then. They are not too old. They are \nlooking for some direction, some ideas they can hold on to and grasp as \nroadmaps on how to proceed with their lives.\n  I think the 2 weeks we have designated--October 17 of this year and \nOctober 15 of the year 2000--as National Character Counts Week bring us \none major step forward, bringing some needed recognition to this very \nworthwhile program that has made such a difference already in the lives \nof thousands of people all across our country.\n  Again, I commend my good friend and colleague from New Mexico for his \ndistinguished leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have been a Senator for a long time. I have \nparticipated in a number of events that made me feel very good about my \nwork and about my community and the citizens of my State. But I do not \nbelieve there has been anything as satisfying as to work with the \ncommunities in New Mexico and school boards and superintendents and \nteachers on the six pillars of character in Character Counts. It has \nbeen absolutely something that I just will never forget.\n  I am quite confident that while it is not the only answer, the \nelixir, to all of our problems, it is certainly a very positive thing \ngoing on in the lives of our young people. We ought to be proud of \nthese efforts and certainly encourage Character Counts, where we can.\n  I would say to the Senate, if any of you get involved in Character \nCounts, it is very difficult for the schools to have success at the \nhigh school level, but a lot of work is being done there. It is among \nthe grade school children where this program starts. As they move \nthrough those years, when they have been exposed to character education \nfor 4 or 5 years, there is a real difference in how they perceive their \nrelationship to their teachers, to their parents, and to their \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I understand that I have a number of minutes remaining \nunder my control on the Republican side of this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the remaining 15 minutes \nbetween now and 4:15.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there are any Republican Senators who would like to \nspeak, they may certainly come and do that now. I will yield the floor \nto them.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on May 6, 1999, I was pleased to join my \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, (Mr. Domenici), in \nintroducing a Senate Resolution designating the third week in October, \n1999 and 2000 as Character Counts Week. I am delighted today that we \nare approving this legislation, just as we have approved similar \nlegislation in the Senate every year since 1994.\n  In 1993, the Josephson Institute of Ethics convened a conference of \nethicists, educators and other leaders to examine the issue of \ncharacter development. The result of that conference, held in Aspen \nColorado, was the Aspen Declaration on Character Education.\n  The elements of character described in the Aspen Declaration were: \ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and \ncitizenship. They are often referred to now as the Six Pillars of \nCharacter.\n  Today, more than 300 member organizations, including community \ngroups, schools and businesses are part of a nationwide Character \nCounts Coalition. These organizations sponsor programs that emphasize \nthe importance of good character traits in our society. American \nsociety is dependent on the strength of the character of her citizens.\n  Never have we seen a time in the life of our society that good \ncharacter has been more important. Solid lessons in character must be \ntaught by parents and families, schools, and religious groups.\n  A 1996 National School Boards Association report on Character \nEducation\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nin our schools showed a significant trend toward adopting character \neducation programs in schools.\n  Character Counts! suggests three steps to teach young people for \nmaking the decision to do the right thing:\n\n       1. Think about the welfare of all people likely to be \n     affected by your actions and make choices that avoid harm to \n     and promote the well-being of others.\n       2. Demonstrate character by living up to all ethical \n     principles of the Six Pillars of Character even when you must \n     give up other things you want.\n       3. If you cannot live up to one ethical principle without \n     giving up another, do the thing that you sincerely believe \n     will promote a better society and should be done by all.\n\n  The National School Boards Association report found that schools with \ncharacter education programs reported improvement in student \nleadership, discipline, violence, vandalism, academic performance, \nattendance and drug and alcohol incidents. It also stated, \n``Ultimately, . . . character education may be a long-term investment \nas improvement and contribution levels often increase over time.''\n  As we work to train our children well, we must keep in mind that we \nare building the foundation for new generations. The examples we set \nabout how we treat others, and what we accept in social behavior will \ninfluence not only our children, but all children.\n  In Mississippi, the Noxubee County Competitive Community Program, the \nOcean Springs Chamber of Commerce, Kids With Character, and the Junior \nAuxiliary of Clinton are organizations who have joined the Character \nCounts! Coalition. They make specific commitments including:\n\n       To integrate character education into new and existing \n     programs and to encourage young people and their parents to \n     adopt and model the Six Pillars. And, to participate in \n     CHARACTER COUNTS! Week.\n\n  I congratulate them on their important efforts and hope that this \nyear more groups and communities will become involved in similar \nprograms.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to this resolution \nappear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 98) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 98\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, the United States, and the world in critical \n     times, and the present and future well-being of our society \n     requires an involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of people of the United States;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play a very important role in supporting \n     family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of the United States \n     and to recognize that character is an important part of that \n     future;\n       Whereas in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``Effective character \n     education is based on core ethical values which form the \n     foundation of democratic society.'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``The character and \n     conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week beginning October 17, 1999, and the \n     week beginning October 15, 2000, as ``National Character \n     Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to--\n       (A) embrace the 6 core elements of character identified by \n     the Aspen Declaration, which are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7803-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7803-S7804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE ECONOMIC AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to speak a little about the \nPresident of the United States, his staff and his renewed focus on the \ndomestic and economic issues of this country.\n  Across the land, it has been heralded that the President is once \nagain coming back to address economic issues and wants to become a part \nof the economic agenda. He wants to be involved with what we are doing \nhere in Congress in our work on approving money for programs, talking \nabout Medicare, Social Security, and other things. I will say at the \noutset that it wasn't too many months ago that the President of the \nUnited States was promoting a plan that was considerably different from \nwhat he is espousing today. It wasn't long ago that you felt satisfied \nwith saving only a portion of the Social Security surplus and using the \nrest for your spending initiatives. Yet, as of today, the President's \nplan has come the Republican way. We both say now that we should save \n100 percent of the money that belongs to the Social Security recipients \nof our country and we should not let it be squandered on anything else.\n\n  This means that we are going to save the $1.8 trillion dollar Social \nSecurity surplus over the next decade. In the Congressional plan, the \nonly way that we can touch these funds is if they are needed to \nundertake substantive reforms of Social Security to ensure that the \nprogram works well for seniors. Nothing else.\n  In order to guarantee such restraint, we have developed a lockbox \nproposal--I came up with the basic idea and Senator Abraham has taken a \nlead in promoting it. While the President's lockbox is different from \nours, at least we are speaking the same language--even the President is \nsaying that we must make sure not to spend any of the Social Security \nsurplus. That puts us on the same path. He is following us. We thank \nhim for that and are pleased to have him on board.\n  However, now is the chance for him to show his commitment to this \nprinciple. Up until now, we have faced opposition on our lockbox bill, \nboth in our budget resolution and on the Senate floor. I would remind \nyou that we have not been able to vote on this proposal here yet \nbecause the Democratic minority doesn't want to let us vote on our \nlockbox. We are going to ask them another time, very soon, to give us \nan opportunity to vote on it. This lockbox has the name, Abraham-\nDomenici. It is a real lockbox.\n  We are also joined by the distinguished junior Senator from Missouri \nas our third cosponsor, Mr. Ashcroft. We wish others would join. We \nwish Senators from the other side would join. Let us make sure that \nwhen we say to the seniors that we are putting their Social Security \nfunds in a lockbox, that it is real and is the most real one we can do. \nAs a matter of fact,\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nour bill is so tough that the administration has opposed it on the \nbasis that it might put our Government in a straitjacket. They fear \nthat it might cause some harm to our Government and to our country \nbecause we tied the knot on our lockbox so tightly.\n  We do not agree. We think we need a tough lockbox to guarantee \nsafety. However, the Administration should take comfort in the fact \nthat the Office of Management and Budget--the President's experts on \nbudgetary matters--has just revised up their surplus projections over \nthe next decade in light of recent economic strength. As our economy \ngrows and new jobs are added, people pay more in taxes. This means that \nonce again, there is more revenue expected in the year 2000 than we \ncontemplated 3 months ago. This means that we will now have an on-\nbudget surplus in fiscal year 2000 above and beyond the Social Security \nsurplus--both the President's budget shop and the Congressional Budget \nOffice expect forecast this. This is true, even accounting for the $7 \nbillion we spent recently in FY2000 on Kosovo. This money came out of \non-budget funds--we have not touched the funds that are accumulated by \nSocial Security.\n  The President believes that we have a $5 billion on-budget surplus \nremaining next year. I can't tell you what the Congressional Budget \nOffice is going to say with certainty, but I can tell you it is more \nthan that. I can tell you it is between $10 and $15 billion. That means \nwe can lock up Social Security's money in the Trust Fund and still have \na $10 or $15 billion buffer to absorb any unanticipated expenses. This \nshould allay the Administration's concerns about our lockbox.\n  Having said that, let me talk for a moment about a profound change \nwhich has occurred in our country in recent years. Something very \ndynamic is happening to the US economy. Some say we're having a new \nindustrial revolution of sorts in the high tech arena that is \nfundamentally changing the way we do business. It has fueled tremendous \ngrowth in all sectors. Now, no one knows for certain why this recovery \nis so long-lived. However, even though I am usually pretty cautious as \nbudget chairman of the Senate, it does appear that this growth will \npropel us toward higher and higher surpluses going forward. It is \nrealistic to assume that American taxpayers will be paying far more in \ntaxes than we need to run the Government for many years to come.\n\n  That means, year over year, your Government spends less than it takes \nin. It is great to run persistent surpluses. However, we will surely \nlose the faith of the American people if we end up spending those \nsurpluses. We must save Social Security's money now and in the future. \nHowever, we should think carefully about what we do with the extra \nsurplus--the surplus above Social Security's funds. The President is \nthinking about this and has formulated 15 year budget plans. I should \nsay as an aside, we will not use 15 year budget numbers--we will not go \nbeyond ten years, regardless of what the President does. Ten-year \nestimates are long enough--we will have almost a trillion-dollar \nsurplus beyond Social Security during the coming decade.\n  Now, I have not seen the entire new plan of the President, but I can \ntell you that is has some odd features. In the first five years, no one \nin America will get any tax relief. The Government of America will \nretain control of all the enormous projected surpluses. Tax relief is \nrelegated to the second five years in the President's plan.\n  That is not fair to the American working man or woman. Now certainly, \nwe will need to retain some of the projected surpluses to put toward \nMedicare reform. The President envisions one type of reform where he \nspends $51 billion of surplus dollars on a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. We don't know if that is right or not. But we can sit at the \ntable and fix Medicare given our wonderful fiscal situation. But let's \nnot kid ourselves. We don't need a trillion dollars. We should be \ngiving some of this money back to the American people--they are the \nones who generated all these extra tax payments, they ought to get some \nof them back.\n  In that regard, it appears we are on a collision course with the \nPresident. We will let the American people be the judge of who is \ncorrect. I don't think that these hardworking men and women will stand \nby as their taxes climb higher and higher--I think they will support \nour call for tax relief.\n  It is unfair to assume that the Government, having collected more \nthan we need, ought to start saying: Well, let's find out how we can \nspend all of it in Government. How does that make sense? Should we wait \nfor Washington to figure out which new program it needs? Should we do \nwhat the President is doing? He wants to put $340 billion of IOUs into \nthe Medicare trust fund, and then say, in 30 years when the IOUs come \ndue, we will just raise income taxes to pay for it. Putting that money \ninto the trust fund for Medicare does not enhance one payment, does not \nincrease its solvency for one week. And here we sit failing to say \nexactly what it is. The President's proposal will lead to income tax \nincreases down the road to cover these IOUs.\n  I should say a number of Democrats and almost every Republican have \nbeen critical of this presidential proposal. It is similar to writing a \npostdated check. Guess who is signing the check? The American people, \nbecause they back up the U.S. Government who signed that check. It is \npostdated 30 years. When it comes due, there isn't any money to pay it. \nSo then you go out and tax the American people to pay it. But, in the \nmeantime, you can for some reason run around and say there is a lot of \nmoney in the trust fund, ignoring the long-run consequences of this \nplan. Frankly, I don't believe this is the right way to do things.\n  I look forward to a good, healthy debate. Normally, I would wonder \nwhether the President is going to once again politicize the issue of \nMedicare so much so that it will turn out that we will not do anything, \nand we will all be frightened to death. But I actually believe that the \nPresident and Congress can work together. However, we do not endorse \nthe President's reliance on trust fund accounting. Instead of forcing \nall the surpluses into some trust fund or another, why don't we give \nthem back to the people who paid us? Maybe they could set up their own \ntrust funds. Maybe they could start their own savings plan. Maybe they \ncould put a little more into the kind of things they think they need \nfor their families.\n  In a sense, I don't know about the rest of the Senators on both sides \nof the aisle, but I look forward to these issues we are going to \ndiscuss between Members of the Congress and the President. On some of \nthem, I look for us to walk right down this aisle in bipartisan fashion \nand get some things done. However, we will not walk into an end \nagreement where no relief is given to American taxpayers. We will not \nbe able to agree with the President of the United States if he is \nleading all the Democrats--which I somehow doubt--saying, no matter how \nbig the surplus is, let's just wait around and see if Government \ndoesn't need it. I submit that, if you do that, Government will need \nit. Government will use it. And the taxpayers who collectively paid \nmore into Government than we need will see bigger Government, more \nmoney spent and less money in their own pockets, which is where more of \nit ought to be.\n  I think my time has expired.

Mr. President, 2 months ago, right after the tragedy of \nColumbine High School, I warned that whenever a tragedy occurs in our \nschools, if we don't act quickly and resolutely, the tragedy would \nrecede in memory and we would fail to pass laws necessary to make our \nschools safe, thereby creating new ways for future tragedies to occur.\n  To the relief of the entire Nation, the Senate passed the juvenile \njustice bill that, thankfully, although belatedly, closed the gun show \nloophole.\n  The House, however, failed in its duty to the American people. The \nHouse was unable to shake loose from the NRA. They were unable to pass \na juvenile justice bill with any gun control legislation and unable to \neven close the gun show loophole.\n  I rise today to remind the Senate of the urgency that led us to act \nfirmly and resolutely after Columbine, and to use the various \nparliamentary procedures that allow Members to bring the juvenile \njustice bill and the gun show loophole bill to conference where we can \ndo what is right.\n  I spent part of this weekend, Sunday and Monday, in New York's \ncapital region, talking with constituents from Albany and the \nsurrounding towns. Some of the areas were fairly rural. Without \nprompting, people walked up to me and said: Senator, what the heck are \nthey doing in Washington? How come you can't even close something as \nsimple as the gun show loophole?\n  They were incredulous. These people aren't passionate advocates of \ngun controls. They were outraged. They could not believe that a \nlobbying group, even such a powerful lobbying group as the NRA, could \nstop the Congress from passing a basic gun show measure.\n  I am proud of what the Senate accomplished last month. We debated \njuvenile justice for over a week. Passions frequently ran high. We cast \nfive separate votes on various proposals purporting to close the gun \nshow loophole. In the end, we approved the real thing. The juvenile \njustice bill itself passed by a margin of 73-25, with majorities of \nboth parties voting in favor.\n  Is it a perfect bill? No. Is it a good bill that will make a real \ndifference? Absolutely.\n  Now the question is whether we are going to throw up our hands and \nsay the House couldn't stand up to the gun lobby, so let's give up.\n  We are in a strange lull, a lull in which newspaper stories inform \nus, and I quote the Washington Times of June 23:\n\n       Some [GOP leaders] said even a Senate-House conference to \n     iron out differences with Democrats over gun-control \n     provisions in a juvenile justice bill is now in doubt.\n\n  I am told today that Mr. Armey said at the very earliest, conferees \nwould not be appointed until after the July 4 recess.\n  First and foremost, conferees ought to be appointed. We should not \nsimply stop the process because some people, certainly a minority of \nthe Members of Congress, and certainly a minority in terms of the views \nof the American people, do not want it to happen. The Senate debated \nthe issue. We should have the ability to go to conference. I call on \nthe House leadership to appoint conferees quickly and with alacrity so \nwe might debate the provisions here, not only the gun show loophole but \nmany of the provisions that people on both sides of the aisle support \nthat would make it easier to punish violent juveniles as adults and \nthat would provide some of the prevention services that young people \nneed. Because juvenile justice and closing the gun show loophole is a \npriority to many Americans; to a large majority of Americans, in my \nopinion.\n  Two weeks ago, for instance, a month after we passed the juvenile \njustice bill, we passed the Y2K liability bill. Lo and behold, Senate \nconferees were immediately appointed, and I understand we are now close \nto an agreement. In fact, I believe an agreement is due this afternoon. \nI think that is great. But Y2K is a far more complicated bill than \njuvenile justice. It is treading on fresh new ground.\n  The millennium, by definition, occurs every thousand years but we \nfinished this one right up. The juvenile justice bill, however, is in \nstasis. There are things that can be done to get it moving. The most \nobvious is for the House leadership once again to appoint conferees so \nwe can debate the gun show loophole. The real problem I fear is that \nthose in the Republican House leadership do not want to continue to \ndebate this issue. They know their allies in the NRA and the American \npeople, including most gun owners, are divided because most Americans, \nincluding most gun owners, sincerely believe providing a background \ncheck at a gun show does not infringe their rights just as we now \nprovide that a background check must be done when you buy a gun at a \ngun shop. But they do not want to do that.\n  So there are other things we should consider to get things moving. \nPerhaps we can add these provisions to a bill that has to be \nconferenced. Perhaps we can add this to other types of proposals which \nthe other body sees a need to have go forward. But I am issuing this \nchallenge, particularly to the House leadership but to all of my \ncolleagues: We should pledge to send a juvenile justice bill, one way \nor another, to the President's desk, a bill which includes the Senate \ngun show provision, by the first day of school, the Tuesday after Labor \nDay. That is 2 months to pass a bill that we already passed. If we do \nnot, and there is, God forbid, another school shooting, we will sorely \nregret our inaction.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7805-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7805-S7809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I will speak for a few moments about a topic \nthat has consumed many of us for many days this week and preceding \nweeks, and that is the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  A particular concern to me has been the status of children in the \nvarious versions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I argue very \nstrenuously and very emphatically that the Democratic proposal \nrecognizes the key differences between children and adults when it \ncomes to health care, and there is a significant difference. For a few \nmoments, I will try to sketch out some of these differences.\n  First of all, if one looks at the adult population in terms of types \nof illnesses, they are characterized as chronic diseases with \nrelatively simple symptoms, simple manifestations with known \nconsequences. They are quantifiable over a short period of time. \nProstate cancer, breast cancer, heart attack are familiar diseases to \nall of us.\n  The other aspect of adults is that there is a large volume of adults \nwho have these types of diseases. As a result, there is more than a \nsufficient supply not only of physicians but of specialists, those who \nare particularly skilled and particularly knowledgeable about the most \nefficacious treatments one can use for these types of conditions.\n  In contrast, children present another type of population to the \nhealth professionals. The good news is that most children are healthy. \nBut if a child is sick, that child usually does not have one of these \nchronic diseases that is well-researched and well-treated and staffed \nby numerous specialists, but something more complicated. In fact, as \nthe professionals say, these diseases are usually complex and with \nmultiple co-morbidities. For the layperson, that means different \nproblems interrelated causing a much more complicated case for the \nphysician.\n  There is another aspect of this dichotomy between adult health and \nchildren's health. There are so many\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\nhealthy children --the good news. The bad news is in terms of managing \nthis population, there is a very small volume of very sick children. \nThis makes it very difficult for physicians to maintain their clinical \ncompetency, particularly for general practitioners. They will see many \nadults who have similar symptoms and they know very well how to treat \nthem. By contrast, they very rarely see chronically ill children, so \ntreating them effectively becomes especially difficult for a general \npractitioner.\n  Another difficulty is the sense these general practitioners or even \nadult specialists can treat this population of patients. There is a \nfurther complicating factor, that is, to manage cases you need volume, \nyou need data, you need to understand what the best treatments are, and \nyou can only do that in a rational way by studying lots and lots of \ncases and, frankly, because of the nature of children's health, they do \nnot have the same type of volume in children's diseases as they do in \nadult illnesses.\n  One other complicating factor is that many times children's true \nhealth conditions manifest themselves long after they have actually \ncontracted the condition. It is not the short duration, it is not the \nheart attack that one can rush the person into the emergency room, do \nthe surgery, apply the drugs, and get that adult on the road to \nrecovery. It is much different when it comes to a child.\n  Managed care organizations and the way they deliver care can compound \nthese inherent differences between the adult population and the \nchildren's population.\n  First, let me give credit where credit is due. When a managed care \nplan does it right, they do preventive care very well. They can \nanticipate, through the management of the child's case, immunizations \nand well-baby visits, et cetera. But there are certain inherent \ncharacteristics of the managed care system of health care delivery that \nmakes it--appropriate for adults but less appropriate for children. \nThat is why we have to focus a part of our efforts on making sure that \nchildren are truly recognized in the legislation we are discussing.\n\n  First of all, because there are a relatively small number of very \nsick children, there is not the adequate number of patients for the HMO \nto maintain a number of pediatric specialists in their provider \nnetwork. The other fact is that HMOs tend to fragment the market. They \ngo after parts of the market and leave other parts out, but they do not \ntend to accumulate large groups of children so that a pediatric \nspecialist in a particular area can be fully employed.\n  Another aspect of the managed care delivery system is that they \ntypically look for an affiliation with what they call centers of \nexcellence, hospitals that are well-known for their practice in a \ncertain field of medicine. In most cases, what they consider to be the \ncenter of excellence is a center that provides the best adult medicine \nbecause after all, they are marketing their products to adults, not to \nchildren. They are marketing their products to human resource managers \nwho have to buy for a company, or they are marketing directly to people \nwho make decisions about health care who are by definition adults. When \nthey are out looking for centers of excellence, they are looking for \nthose hospitals that have the best urology departments, have the best \nrecords with prostate cancer and breast cancer and heart attack. That \nis another built-in aspect of the HMO dilemma which complicates the \ncare to children.\n  There is something else. There is an economic incentive for these \nHMOs to refer children to adult specialists and not to pediatric \nspecialists. There is a great difference between a cardiologist and a \npediatric cardiologist because of the differences in caring for a child \nversus caring for an adult. The incentives are sometimes very \ncompelling.\n  For example, if you have a staff model HMO--that is where the doctor \nactually works for the HMO--you have a cardiologist simply because that \nis expected, and if you look at the numbers, you are likely to have a \nlot of adult cardiology patients and very few children. To add a \npediatric cardiologist increases the fixed costs. Why do that when you \ncan simply make a referral to the adult cardiologist that is already in \nthe plan's network?\n  When you look at the nonstaff model, one where they will contract \nwith individual physicians, typically what they will do is look at \nvolume discounts. A physician will say: Sure, I will sign up for so \nmuch per visit, but you have to assure me that I will get a lot of \nvisits. That is another incentive to drive children not to pediatric \nspecialists but to adult specialists.\n  As a result, these incentives tend to diminish the quality of health \ncare that HMOs give to children, particularly very sick children. It is \nnot because they have some type of grudge against kids. It is simply, \nif you look at the market dynamics, if you look at the volume they are \ntrying to manage, it all argues against the type of care that sick \nchildren must be assured. In other words, there is a failure in the \nmarket to recognize the needs of children.\n  That is why we have to step in. That is why we have to require HMOs \nto make sure that there is access to pediatric specialists, to make \nsure HMOs are tracking the health progress of children, to make sure \nthey are measuring their outcomes in terms of children and not just \nadults. If we do not, the system will always be driven to the needs of \nthe adults who managed care plans are trying to recruit as patients. \nAnother way to say this very simply is that HMOs operate on economies \nof scale. That is how they make the money. And children with \nparticularly complicated pediatric health care cases do not conform to \nthose types of economies of scale.\n  I mentioned before there are other particular issues about the health \nstatus of children that make them distinct from adults, and one of them \nis the fact that children are still developing. They are constantly \nchanging their functional levels --mobility, toddlers start walking, \nand then they start running, speech, puberty--all issues which are \nseldom associated with adult health.\n  As a result, unless you consider development as a first order of \npriority, you are going to overlook a lot of the emphasis that should \nbe placed on children's health care. I suggest that most HMOs do not \nfactor in the sensitivities to development that are so necessary.\n  Also, when you get into a situation like this, when the development \nof a child is at stake, the challenge is early intervention. It is not \nsimply catching the disease someplace along its course and providing \nsome type of treatment. It is early intervention.\n\n  There are numerous examples. One that I recently read about is a \ncondition in infants called strabismus, which is muscle weakness of the \neye. If it is not corrected soon after birth when the neurological \nconnections between the eye and the cortex of the brain are being \nformed--again, this is not a situation that an adult would ever \nencounter--if you do not catch it early, you are going to have \nsignificant and irreversible loss of sight.\n  That is a special concern for kids, a very serious developmental \nconcern for children diagnosed with the disease. That is why we need to \nmake sure that development is built into HMOs consideration of the type \nof treatment and services they provide children. The economics of HMOs \nmeans they will not do it themselves. Therefore, we must make it our \njob. I think that is what is part and parcel of a good part of the \nDemocratic initiative.\n  Let me suggest something else on the issue of development. My \ncolleague from California, Senator Feinstein, and so many others, have \ntalked about medical necessity. This whole definition of medical \nnecessity tends really to prejudice kids from getting a fair shake in \nHMOs, for many reasons.\n  First of all, most medical necessity determinations are documented by \ndata. How efficacious is the treatment? How often do we use it? And it \ngoes right back to one of the inherent issues: The very lack of the \nvolume of seriously ill children to generate the kind of data, \ntreatments and outcomes.\n  There is nothing in the law that I can see today at the Federal level \nthat even requires HMOs to start thinking about outcomes, to start \nthinking about effectiveness in terms of kids.\n  The other thing that we should be concerned about is that a lot of \nmedical necessity is cost based--using the cheapest option. Once again, \nwhen you have a very small volume of very sick\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\nkids, the appropriate form of treatment may be extremely costly.\n  Another factor concerning medical necessity is that usually it is \ntied to the notion that a health plan will not pay for innovative \ntreatment. It will not pay for experimental treatment.\n  Once again, many of the treatment modalities used for children, \nsimply because they are not routine, can be called innovative or \nexperimental. That is another example of how children are prejudiced by \nthe system. It is something that we have to correct.\n  Finally, very seldom will you find in the definition of medical \nnecessity this concept of developmental impacts, beyond simply \nreturning to normal function. As a result, it is easy for HMOs to say a \ntreatment or procedure is not medically necessary when children present \nthemselves or their parents present them for care. It is not \nthreatening their lives today, or even their ability to function today. \nHowever, they probably know that months from now, a year from now, 2 \nyears from now, their development will be severely impaired. But that \nis not part of medical necessity. So that is another example of why we \nhave to step up to the plate, particularly when it comes to children.\n  We have learned so much about the development of young children, \nparticularly from ages 0 to 3, including the way the brain develops.\n  Once again, this is an issue that has very little correlation with \nadult experience. Children are developing.\n  Just a few examples.\n  At the Baylor College of Medicine there was a survey of abused and \nneglected children. They focused on 20 children who they described, in \ntechnical jargon, as living in ``globally understimulating \nenvironments.'' In other words, these children were rarely touched; \nthey had no real opportunity to play; they had no opportunity to \nexplore and experiment. They found that the brains of these young \nchildren were 20 to 30 percent smaller than those of children who had \nthe opportunity to be stimulated. Indeed, literally parts of their \nbrains had wasted away. Again, this is an issue that would never \nconfront a practitioner looking at an adult.\n\n  Another example relating to development is in the area of childhood \ntrauma. We have been able to show, through scientific examination, that \nchildren who have witnessed violence have physically continued to \nregister that violence, they remain in a high-alert state, and this \nleads to emotional, behavioral and learning problems.\n  Again, these are conditions that you would never find in an adult, \nwith some exceptions of course. But they are part and parcel of the \ndevelopmental process of children. If we do not understand that, we do \nnot recognize it. If we do not provide particular protections for \nchildren, it will not be done by the HMOs. It costs too much. They do \nnot have the data. It is just something that they do not think about a \nlot.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon is here. Let me make one other point, \nif I could.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I just want to, at a convenient time, ask my good friend \nfrom Rhode Island to yield for a question or two because I think the \nSenator has made an excellent presentation on the need to advocate for \nkids. All the latest research with respect to these children is really \ndropped-dead material. Unless you get there early, as the Senator from \nRhode Island is suggesting, you end up, with a lot of these poor kids, \nplaying catchup ball for the next 10 years.\n  So when it is convenient, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island in a few questions about some of the other \nareas where he has contributed on this bill that, frankly, I think \nought to help bring the parties together and help us fashion a \nbipartisan proposal.\n  I just want the Senator from Rhode Island to know how much I \nappreciate him standing up for those kids who do not have political \naction committees and do not have clout and cannot speak for \nthemselves. At an opportune time in the Senator's address, I would like \nto be able to ask the Senator to yield just to address a few other \nquestions about some of the areas on which he has focused.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  I want to make one final point about children, and then I would very \nmuch like to yield to the Senator. And I compliment him, too, on his \nefforts because we are working together on many of these issues, \nincluding children's health.\n  One final point: Children's health is, I would argue, more dependent \non environmental conditions than adults. Of course, there are certain \nsituations in the workplace where adults are exposed to chemicals, and \nwe try to deal with that in terms of regulations and standards. \nHowever, it is also important to recognize that children are \nparticularly prone to environmental and sociological conditions.\n  For instance, lead poisoning--it is an epidemic in so many cities. In \nmy city of Providence it is an epidemic. But it is not just Rhode \nIsland, it is across the country.\n  For too long, we used lead paint in houses, and now we do not have \nenough HUD money to clean up homes that have lead-based paints. That is \nwhy so many children have lead paint poisoning.\n  We have to recognize, for kids, is they these are important health \nproblems. We have to be developing mechanisms so managed care \norganizations recognize these issues as health problems and that the \nGovernment recognizes them as health problems, and that they work \ntogether with linkages.\n  My final point is, unless we pass the kind of language that we have \nin the Democratic alternative, we are not going to give the special \nneeds of children the attention it needs and deserves. When we start \ncollecting the data, when we start having the HMOs publish what they do \nfor kids--what is their success rate with kids? How many kids with \ncomplicated conditions do they have enrolled in their program? When we \nstart doing that, they are going to have an incentive to start talking \nto the schools and the local authorities about their patients because \nnow they have a real visible, accountable incentive to do it.\n  Just one final point: Again, Bruce Clarke, Gen. Bruce Clarke, one of \nthe great combat leaders of World War II, said--and I remember this \nfrom my days at West Point--``A unit does well what its commander \nchecks. If the commander doesn't check, you are not going to find that \nunit paying attention.''\n  We have not been checking on kids in HMOs in this country. I do not \nthink they are doing particularly well as a result. When we start \nchecking on kids specifically, as the Democratic alternative does, then \nwe will start doing much better, I think we will start doing well.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for yielding. He has made an \nexcellent presentation with respect to the need for strong advocates \nfor these kids.\n  I will turn briefly to another area where the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has, in my view, done yeoman work, and an area, frankly, that I \nthink has sort of gotten lost a little bit in this discussion. That is \nthe proposal the Senator from Rhode Island has made with respect to \nhaving ombudsmen or advocates for consumers around the country. It \nought to be one of the areas that both political parties could \ngravitate to, because I believe that what the Senator from Rhode Island \nhas done--of course, we have gotten great input from Families USA and \nRon Pollack and some of the folks who have done so much for consumers \nover the years--is essentially talk about a true revolution in the area \nof consumer protection.\n  What happened--I have seen this so often since my days as director of \nthe Gray Panthers; I was head of the Gray Panthers at home for about 7 \nyears before I was elected to the House--what we saw was that the \nconsumer would have a problem and, without any advocates or the ability \nto get it handled early on, a problem that started off relatively \nmodest and minor would just fester and get worse and eventually blossom \ninto a huge controversy which ended up in litigation.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island knows, one of the most \ncontroversial aspects of this whole debate about managed care is \nlitigation. It seems to me that if the Senate were to adopt the \nproposal of the Senator from Rhode Island or some version of it, this \nwould shift the focus of consumer protection away from litigation,\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\naway from problems after they have unnecessarily developed into \nsomething serious. Instead, we would resolve a lot of the problems \nearly on and we wouldn't need this focus on litigation.\n  Certainly, we ought to have legal remedies for the really outrageous \nexamples of consumer rip-offs and the like. But I think what the \nSenator from Rhode Island has done, and it is such a valuable service \nin this debate and a real revolution in consumer protection, is said: \nLet's get at it early on when the consumer and the families can find \nsomewhere to turn. We will prevent problems then. It can be done \nrelatively inexpensively.\n  I would like the Senator from Rhode Island to elaborate a little bit \non this and make sure that over the next few minutes the Senator from \nRhode Island can lay out his proposal, on which I am honored to join \nwith him. I think this has the potential of, frankly, being one of the \nareas where the parties, once they focus on it, can say: This is good \npublic policy that will reduce the need for litigation and, as Ron \nPollack and Families USA have said so eloquently, help a lot of \nconsumers when they need it most. Perhaps the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island could take us through it.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his very kind words. \nLet me also thank him for his help and support in working so closely \nwith me and Families USA and others to ensure that this proposal will \nwork for all consumers and for the insurance industry as well.\n  Part of our attempt is to find answers before, as the Senator from \nOregon has said, they wind up in court. My experience--I think your \nexperience, too--is that people want their health care to be addressed. \nThey don't want a lawsuit. They want to get their children cared for. \nThey want their own health care. This is not an attempt to figure out \nsome way to get involved in a messy multiyear litigation process. Yet \nif there are no mechanisms, such as an ombudsman and an internal/\nexternal review process, if we don't have these mechanisms, that is \nwhere we inevitably will find ourselves.\n  Let me quickly accept the Senator's invitation to lay out some of the \ndetails.\n  First, it would be a State-based program, not a national program in \nthe sense of some collective wisdom here in Washington, but each State \ncould design their own ombudsman program. We would provide financial \nsupport. There would be some general guidelines for the states to \nfollow. Basically, this ombudsman operation or consumer assistance \noperation would inform people about their plan options that are \navailable and to answer other questions about a person's health plan.\n\n  Frankly, one of the great dilemmas most of our constituents have is, \nthey don't know whom to ask about health plans, what health plans are \navailable. This would be a source, a clearinghouse, if you will, for \nthat type of information.\n  Then the ombudsman or the consumer assistance center would operate a \n1-800 telephone hotline to respond to consumer questions and requests \nfor information--again, such a necessary ingredient, for several \nreasons: First, the general befuddlement one experiences when you try \nto read a health plan contract. Two, I sense there is deep skepticism \nabout the kind of response you expect to receive from your own \ninsurance company about your rights and your benefits, if you get a \nresponse at all. Too many times I have heard constituents say they have \njust found themselves entangled in a voice mail hell, if you will. As \nyou push one number and find one recording, you push another number and \nfind another recording. The ombudsman program with the 1-800 number \nwould serve as a place where you could get information and get it \nquickly.\n  Then this objective ombudsman, or woman, as the case may be, would \nprovide assistance to people who think they have a grievance. They \nwould have an opportunity for a patient to go in and say: My plan said \nI could not have this procedure for my child. My doctor says my child \nneeds it. Can you help me? Frankly, not only will the ombudsman help \nthe individual consumer, but they will look at the plan, and they will \nconclude that under the terms and conditions of the contract, that is \nor is not covered.\n  It won't be the insurance company protecting their own interest, it \nwill be an objective agency that will be able to step in and advocate \nfor consumer rights when they need to vindicate their rights and \nexplain to them the limitations of the policy, when that is the case.\n  That is the general outline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the distinguished Senator yielding. I have \nfelt that he has really gone to great lengths to try to ensure that \nthis could be supported by every Member of the Senate.\n  Frankly, I feel about his proposal much like I do about the gag \nclause discussion. I think he and I have talked about this. I am \nprobably a lot of things, but one of the last things I guess I would \nqualify as is an HMO basher. We have a lot of good managed care in my \npart of the United States. My hometown of Portland has the highest \nconcentration of folks in HMOs in the United States. About 60 percent \nof the older people are part of a managed care program.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Smith, and I have worked \ntogether on a lot of these issues. Frankly, one of our big concerns is, \nwe do offer a lot of good managed care. We end up getting the short end \nof the stick in terms of reimbursement. I think what the Senator is \ntalking about with an ombudsman, much like gag clauses where people, of \ncourse, ought to be entitled to all of the information about their \noptions, the ombudsman concept is much the same kind of approach to \ngood government.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has written this now so as to ensure it \ncannot result in litigation, that this specifically is designed to help \nconsumers at the front end and bars litigation. I don't think the \nmajority of the Senate is aware of that. The Senator from Rhode Island \nhas indicated to this Senator and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nwho has been very interested in this issue over the years, who has done \ngood work, that he wants to make sure we don't duplicate existing \nservices.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming my time, it is quite specific in the \nlegislation. Again, the Senator is one of the contributors to this \nlegislation, along with Senator Wellstone, and I thank him.\n  The ombudsman, or the consumer assistance center, could not \nparticipate in litigation. Their scope of participation is informal and \ncould include contacting the insurance company, explaining rights, \nadvocating for the patient as an ombudsman, not as a lawyer, not as a \nlitigator.\n  Let me add one other point and then, again, yield to my colleague \nfrom Oregon. Interestingly enough, again I think he has identified an \nissue that we all can rally around. One of the great talents the \nSenator from Oregon brings to the Senate is an ability to be a bridge \nin so many different ways, i.e., the Education Flexibility Act--to find \na mechanism that we all can agree upon.\n  This is another one of these areas. Interestingly enough, a few weeks \nago we passed with little controversy and with much enthusiasm the \ndefense authorization bill that included an authorization for an \nombudsman program to address the problems and complaints associated \nwith military HMOs--the TRACER system--looking at the same problem that \nall of the Senator's constituents from Oregon face, and all of my \nconstituents face, but in the context of military families and \ncomplaints, and legitimate complaints of military families. They cannot \nget the care they need. They cannot get the answers. They get the \nrunaround. They do not get the support.\n  In response to that, this body voted enthusiastically to authorize an \nombudsman for the TRACER system. Frankly, both the Senator from Oregon \nand I are saying if it works well, or we think it is going to work well \nfor our military families who are enrolled in an HMO that has a great \ndeal of responsibility for them, why not give it a chance in the \ncontext of the private insurance HMO industry in the United States?\n  I think that underscores what the Senator from Oregon has said. This \nis not controversial. This is helpful. This\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\nis practical. This is not about litigation, it is about making sure \nthat people get answers, that people get results, and that people get \nthe care. That is what I think we are all here to do.\n  Again, I will yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the chance to continue this for a moment \nbecause the Senator from Rhode Island is essentially being logical. \nHeaven forbid that actually takes over some of the debate we have. \nThere is nothing partisan about making sure that consumers have all the \nfacts about their health care. That is the effort with respect to \nbarring gag clauses. And there is nothing partisan about this ombudsman \napproach.\n  I am very hopeful, frankly, that as the Senate learns more about this \nkind of concept pioneered by the Senator from Rhode Island, Families \nUSA, and others, that we will see some of the good health care plans in \nthis country saying we are going to support this because it makes sense \nto solve problems early on.\n  Frankly, if we can win support for the Reed proposal early on--I am \nhonored to join in on it--I think this will go a long way to eventually \nresolving the controversy about litigation because I think we will see \ngood advocacy programs early on, and we can confine then the need for \nlitigation to really only the outrageous, outlandish cases where I \nthink every Member of the Senate would say, goodness, this is an area \nwhere you really ought to have a legal remedy. But we would have skewed \nthe whole system toward prevention and early intervention, or answering \nthe questions that the Senator from Rhode Island has properly \nidentified.\n  I will tell you that in my hometown, where we do have a lot of good \nmanaged care, folks want to see this kind of proposal. They want to see \nwhat is laid out in the legislation that our colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle are offering, and they want to see us reach a bipartisan \nagreement.\n  The Presiding Officer of the Senate and I have had the most \ncompetitive elections in the history of the West. We have teamed up \ntogether on a whole host of issues in the Senate.\n  It would seem to me that around the ombudsman program and around \nbarring gag clauses, this is another area where essentially partisan \npolitics ought to stop outside the Chamber. We ought to work together \nto enact a good ombudsman program to say that this is the best anecdote \nto frivolous litigation, frankly, that we could possibly find.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, with whom I have enjoyed \nworking for well over a decade on senior and consumer issues, and for \nthe chance to work with him on it.\n  Perhaps by way of wrapping up my question to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, could he fill us in on progress with other colleagues? I know \nthat Senator Collins has been very interested in this issue. She has \ndone good work in her home State of Maine. Perhaps the Senator from \nRhode Island could just wrap up by telling us where his proposal \nstands. I want to assure him and Senator Kennedy, who has been leading \nthis fight--and I am anxious to work with him. In fact, when I first \ncame to the Senate, just a few weeks after arriving I had a chance to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts on the effort to \nbar gag clauses. I only wish we had gotten that in place back then \nseveral years ago. It is long overdue that we get that protection for \nconsumers as well as the Reed proposal.\n  Perhaps the Senator from Rhode Island could tell us where the \nombudsman proposal stands at this time.\n  Mr. REED. Very quickly, we have been working, as the Senator knows, \nclosely on the Reed-Wyden-Wellstone proposal, which was formally \nintroduced as separate legislation. It is incorporated in the Democrat \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I know Senator Collins of Maine is very \ninterested in this issue. I think she is also convinced that this is \nimportant and significant.\n  Let me also say that the Senator from Oregon made reference to his \nexperience as a senior advocate. There are, in fact, senior ombudsman \nprograms throughout the United States which we support with the Older \nAmericans Act. These programs have been very effective and are doing \nprecisely what we want to do in the context of managed care.\n  Again, we just adopted an ombudsman program for military personnel in \nthe TRICARE system. It was noncontroversial. In fact, we have a great \ndeal of expectation and hope that this will be helpful to our military \nfamilies. We are working together across the aisle. I hope that we can \nalso incorporate this provision in whatever Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation that emerges. It is not designed to be a tool of \nlitigation; it is designed to be a tool of conciliation.\n  On those grounds, I am optimistic and hopeful.\n  But, once again, let me finally conclude by thanking the Senator from \nOregon not only for our colloquy this afternoon but also for his \nsupport, not only on this issue but so many others.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I will be very brief as well.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, particularly \nwith Families USA, is on to something that really constitutes a \nrevolution in consumer protection. What we have seen on one issue after \nanother--just a few minutes ago the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, and Senator Dodd of Connecticut, and I were able to get an \nagreement on the Y2K issue with respect to trying to hold down \nfrivolous lawsuits surrounding Y2K. What the Senator from Rhode Island \nand Families USA have been able to do is essentially say in the health \ncare system: We are going to do everything we possibly can to limit \nfrivolous lawsuits; we are going to help people when they need it most, \nwhen the problem first develops.\n  I want to assure the Senator from Rhode Island and the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts that I am anxious to work with them on this \nproposal, because I think this is one of the areas where the parties \nought to be able to come together. It may sound quaint, but the \nombudsman notion is simply good government. It is preventive kind of \nmedicine.\n  I thank the Senator for the chance to work with him on it. I will not \nask him to yield further. But I am very hopeful that in the days ahead \nboth political parties can see the merit in this idea and have it \nincluded.\n  Mr. REED. Before yielding the floor, let me just say that I, along \nwith my colleague from Oregon, must recognize Families USA and Ron \nPollack for the inspiration and thoughtful analysis that helped propel \nthis proposal. It is a good one.\n  Frankly, we could do very well in this Senate this year if we could \nprotect children through better managed care legislation and give all \nof our citizens a real voice in our health care decisions through an \nombudsman program. This will be a very satisfactory and very successful \nendeavor for all of us in the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for morning business was concluded at \n5 p.m.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7809-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7809-S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to comment on the President's \nproposal relating to Medicare, and specifically relevant to the drug \nbenefit which has been put forward by the President today and by his \nstaff.\n  I think the American people have to look at this in the context of \nthe history of this administration's efforts in the area of health \ncare. We know that when this administration came into office, Mrs. \nClinton was assigned the task of developing a health care proposal. She \ncame up with what has become known as ``Hillary Care,'' which was \nessentially a nationalization of the health care system. It was \nintricate bureaucracy that basically was so interwoven and so complex \nthat it was totally impossible to recognize.\n  It needs to be noted in evaluating the drug component on this recent \nproposal on Medicare, the proposal of the\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nClinton administration on general health care issues as it came forward \nunder Mrs. Clinton's plan, known as ``Hillary Care,'' was a dramatic \ninvasion of the health care delivery system in this country by the \nFederal Government. It was essentially a nationalization of the system \nwith huge complexities and huge intricacies. That was followed by a \nnumber of other initiatives which were lesser but equally aggressive in \ntheir attempts to move to the Federal level control over functions of \nhealth care in this country.\n  Then on the issue of Medicare, a commission was set up. The \ncommission was to be balanced. In fact, the President had a large \nnumber of appointments to it, and the Senate and House had a large \nnumber of appointments to it. It was chaired by a Democratic Member of \nthe Senate, Senator Breaux.\n  That commission was to resolve this matter. It was to come forward \nwith a proposal to address the long-term solvency of Medicare and, \nwithin that, the drug benefit for senior citizens. The commission did \ngreat work, yeoman's work. They came up with a proposal. More than a \nmajority, a significant majority, of the commission supported the \nproposal which had in it a drug component, and the President walked \naway from the proposal, even though the proposal had been supported by \na majority of the commission which he was instrumental in setting up \nand to which he appointed the chairman, who was Senator Breaux from \nthis body.\n  The question of his most recent proposal on Medicare, I believe, has \nto be looked at in that context, and therefore it becomes a question of \nwhether or not the proposal put forward by the President, most recently \ntoday, is a serious proposal or is it a political proposal. If it is a \nserious proposal, why is it not in step with the Breaux commission, and \nif it is a political proposal, what is its purpose?\n  Let's look at it quickly. Nobody has had a great deal of time to \nanalyze it, but if you look at it quickly, it appears to be a proposal \nthat is turning on its head the basic purposes of a drug benefit.\n  The Breaux commission suggested that the purpose of a drug benefit \nshould be to make sure the beneficiary, the person paying the drug \ncosts, was not wiped out by the cost of the drugs. That is a reasonable \nposition. Essentially, the Breaux commission concluded that we should \nhave some way of saying to a senior citizen who ends up with a huge \namount of drug costs that if you are hit with a catastrophic drug cost, \nthere is going to be some protection for you and some coverage for you.\n  This proposal from the President does the opposite. Instead of \ncovering a catastrophic drug event where a senior citizen has to buy a \nlot of drugs to maintain their health over a period of a year and, \nthus, runs up huge bills which basically deplete their assets, this \nproposal has first-dollar coverage. The first-dollar coverage stops \nwhen it gets to $2,000, I believe, of drug expenditures, which means \nthat if a senior citizen has a large number of drug expenditures, \nessentially the senior citizen is still going to be wiped out by those \ncosts.\n  It makes much more sense to approach it the way the Breaux commission \napproaches it and the way most people have looked at the issue, which \nis, you say to a senior citizen or anyone else: Listen, you have to be \nresponsible for the cost up to a certain level, and when you get to \nthat level which would threaten your economic solvency, at that point \nthe Federal Government will come in and assist you in paying the drug \ncosts, which would be catastrophic coverage and makes much more sense \nthan the proposal which has first-dollar coverage, if you are putting \nforward a plan which has as its purpose the actual correction of the \npresent problems occurring in the health care community relative to \ndrug costs.\n\n  The proposal the President puts forward makes no sense substantively \non the issue of paying for drug costs, because it does not benefit \nanybody if they have a catastrophic amount of drug costs. It may make \nsense, however, politically because it says to a senior citizen, we are \ngoing to cover you for first-dollar coverage of your drug costs, which \nmeans you can say to all seniors, you no longer have a drug cost for up \nto $2,000, which means a lot of seniors will be covered, but of course \nthose seniors who are most at risk, who have lots of drug expenditures, \nwho exceed $2,000 in drug expenditures, are thrown out like the baby \nwith the bathwater, but at least politically you pick up the vast \nmajority of seniors who have lower drug costs.\n  One has to look at that benefit and say that is a more politically \ndriven benefit structure than a benefit structure directed at the \nproblem, which is the huge amount of drug costs on senior citizens and \nthe fact it can wipe out their assets.\n  One has to look at another issue, which is, we all know a drug \nbenefit is very expensive for the Federal Government, and therefore for \nthe taxpayers, and when we are talking about taxpayers, we are talking \nabout younger taxpayers who are paying to support the senior citizens.\n  We have a transfer of income from younger working Americans into \nsenior citizens' accounts, and one would expect, therefore, in looking \nat that, we would be saying: Seniors who are doing well--and a large \nnumber of seniors in our society are, fortunately, because we have been \nable to create an atmosphere where many seniors have a fair amount of \nincome, and, as a matter of fact, as a matter disposable income, people \nover age 65 have more disposable income than in their working years \nwhen they were in their twenties and thirties. For the most part, you \ncould say those people are doing really well.\n  For example, say, Bill Gates' parents, who probably have a fair \namount of stock in Microsoft, may be retired. I do not know if his \nparents are retired or not. I am using that as an example. Someone who \nis extremely wealthy who is retired, one would not expect their drug \nbenefits to suddenly be subsidized by somebody who is working in a \nrestaurant, a gas station, or on a computer assembly line in Nashua, \nNH.\n  Yet what the President has put forward is a plan that does just that. \nHe put forward a plan where working Americans, Americans who are just \ntrying to make ends meet, where both parents are having to work in \norder to take care of household expenditures, who are under tremendous \nfinancial pressure, are going to have to subsidize the drug benefit of \nall senior citizens, no matter what their income level.\n  A high-income senior citizen, somebody who happens to be a member of \na famous family that has made millions of dollars, or somebody who is \nnot even a member of a famous family but happens to have a tremendous \namount of wealth--Charlton Heston, for example, I suspect he has been \nsuccessful--that person's drug benefit under Medicare will suddenly \nbecome a subsidized event paid for by a working American.\n\n  Does that make sense? No; that is upside down. Obviously, if you are \ngoing to have a drug benefit for senior citizens, it should really \napply to those seniors who need the benefit and who cannot afford it. \nThat happened to be the proposal that came out of the Breaux \ncommission. They suggested people up to 135 percent, I believe, of \npoverty be allowed to get the drug benefit and have it subsidized and \npeople over 135 percent would not have that event occur. Therefore, \npeople with higher incomes would not end up being subsidized by working \nAmericans who maybe cannot afford to subsidize the drug benefit of \nsenior citizens because they have to take care of their own household \nexpenditures.\n  Yet this proposal from the administration has not taken the tack of \nthe Breaux commission which says: Let's take care of those seniors who \nneed the assistance, but let the seniors who can afford to pay for \ntheir own drugs pay for them. They turned it upside down: Let's take \ncare of all seniors at the expense of working Americans, maybe even \nAmericans who have trouble making ends meet.\n  That leads one to the question: Why are they doing this? Is this the \nsubstantively right thing to do? Is it the politically correct thing to \ndo? Yes, it is, because we all know when it comes to senior citizen \naccounts, there is tremendous reticence within the senior citizen \nactivist community in this country to have any sort of means testing, \nwhich is what this amounts to, or affluence testing, which is where it \nwould lead to. Yet they allow Americans to subsidize extremely wealthy\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nAmericans, not only for the drug benefit as proposed by the President \nbut, unfortunately, as the President did in part B premiums, they are \nwilling to allow that truly inappropriate action to occur for the \npolitical benefit of it. Once again, what we are seeing is a political \ninitiative.\n  Then if you look at the proposal in its outline form, you can see it \nis going to create an intricate, complex, bureaucratic structure to \ndetermine what benefit is covered and is available to be picked up by \nthe Federal Government under the drug benefit cost. There is going to \nhave to be some sort of extremely complex structure. They turned it \nover to HCFA, which is an agency that has the capacity to develop a \ncomplex structure, but there will need to be some sort of national \nstructure set up in order to account for what is and is not covered \nunder the system the President has set up in his proposal.\n  One gets the feeling we are looking again at the use of the Federal \nbureaucracy as the agency to manage the day-to-day activities of health \ncare. We know from experience that does not work too well.\n  This proposal the President has put forward is, on its face, upside \ndown on core basic issues of better health care, whether it happens to \nbe the premium, whether it happens to be the means testing, or whether \nit happens to be the bureaucracy.\n  I think the thing that I find most dangerous about this proposal, and \nthe thing I am most concerned about, is the effect on lifestyle of \nAmerican seniors because it puts us on an extraordinarily slippery \nslope, in its present structure, which will most likely lead to a \ndiminution of the effort of the American entrepreneurial culture to \nproduce better drugs for seniors.\n  A great number of American citizens today benefit dramatically from \nthe fact that we have the most vibrant, innovative drug research and \ndevelopment industry in the world. We have an industry which is second \nto none in producing products that make people's lives better.\n  But it is an extremely expensive undertaking. It takes 12 years and \nhundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to the market. The only \nway that these entrepreneurs can undertake that initiative is if they \nare able to go out in the marketplace and get the capital necessary to \ntake that type of risk to produce those drugs.\n  When you start having the Federal bureaucracy manage who can and who \ncannot buy a drug and what drug has to be bought and what drug cannot \nbe bought, as will inevitably be, I suspect, the outcome of this \ninitiative, as it moves into its second- and third-generation event--\nand was the intention, by the way, of the Hillary health care plan, so \nwe know that we can suspect that is in the back of somebody's mind \naround here--then your ultimate outcome will be to have a chilling \neffect, a dramatic dampening effect on the innovative minds of America, \non the scientists of America who are producing the new drugs which make \npeople's lives better because those scientists and those innovators are \nnot going to be able to get funds through the capital markets to \nunderwrite their undertakings.\n  Why? Because if you are a capital investor, as Mr. Greenspan has so \noften told us, the capital markets are the most efficient markets in \nthe world. Money flows for capital where it gets the return that makes \nthe most sense for those dollars. People are not going to invest in \ndrug research and development if they are not going to get adequate \nreturn. They are not going to get adequate return on it if you have a \nFederal bureaucracy taking over the control of the pricing mechanisms \nor the appropriate drugs to be purchased--both of which are potential \noutcomes of any plan put forward by this administration because that, \nas we have already seen, is a goal that is in the back of the mind of \nthis administration. So although it is not a stated risk, it is, in my \nopinion, a clear undercurrent of risk as we step into this area of drug \nbenefit for senior citizens.\n  The ultimate conclusion of this, of course, is that I think the \nPresident's proposal is political, not substantive. If the President \nwanted to substantively pursue a drug proposal, a drug benefit for \nsenior citizens that would work, that had been well vetted and well \nthought out intelligently, he would have adopted the proposal of his \nown commission, the Breaux Commission. That was rejected in order to \ntake the path of the political initiative. I think we should be very \nsuspicious before we step on to that path as a Congress.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7811-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7811-S7813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say first Senator Daschle and I have \nlabored long and hard to come to an agreement on a unanimous-consent \nprocedure to deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights issue, \nappropriations bills, and nominations, and it still takes an awful lot \nof good faith. We have to work together. We have to have some trust. We \nhave to give the benefit of the doubt to the leaders. Also, in the \nSenate we have to be prepared to deal with action. We are trying to \nfind a way to deal fairly with the appropriations bills and with the \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader or his designee, \nintroduce the underlying health care bill and it be placed on the \ncalendar by 12 noon on Thursday, July 8, and the bill become the \npending business at 1 p.m. on Monday, July 12, 1999, with a vote \noccurring on final passage at the close of business on Thursday, July \n15, and the bill be subject to the following agreement:\n  That the bill be limited to 3 hours of debate, to be equally divided \nin the usual form, that all amendments in order to the bill be relevant \nto the subject of amendment Nos. 702, 703, the introduced bill or \nhealth care tax cuts, and all first degree amendments be offered in an \nalternating fashion with Senator Daschle to offer the initial first \ndegree amendment and all first- and second-degree amendments be limited \nto 100 minutes each, to be equally divided in the usual form. I further \nask consent that second-degree amendments be limited to one second-\ndegree amendment per side, per party, with no motions to commit or \nrecommit in order, or any other act with regard to the amendments in \norder, and that just prior to third reading of the bill, it be in order \nfor the majority leader, or his designee to offer a final amendment, \nwith no second-degree amendments in order.\n  I further ask consent that following passage of the bill, should the \nbill, upon passage, contain any revenue blue slip matter, the bill \nremain at the desk and that when the Senate receives the house \ncompanion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the Senate bill \nthat was passed be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill as amended be \npassed, the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference \nwith the House, all without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to announce at this time that the minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, and I have discussed several times how we would \nproceed with this matter once we have had this period of time for \ndebate and votes on and in relation to the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Senator Daschle has given me his assurance that although this \nagreement will not prohibit Members from offering this issue or an \namendment related to this issue again in the session, he does not \nexpect a need to offer this issue again, presuming the normal \nlegislative process is followed.\n  In other words, if we should complete an action and it goes to \nconference, if it languishes there or does not come back, this \narrangement would not prohibit some amendment from being offered at \nsome subsequent point.\n  I can fairly say that the minority leader is willing to say this \nissue will have had due consideration after these 4 days of debate, and \nat the conclusion of this week we would not feel the need to readdress \nit.\n  Finally, I announce to the Senate, following this agreement, the two \nleaders have jointly agreed to pass three to five of the remaining \nappropriations bills available prior to the Fourth of July recess. This \nwill take a good bit of cooperation, too.\n  The top priority of the appropriations bills are likely in the \nfollowing\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\norder: foreign operations, D.C., Treasury-Postal Service, and the \npending agriculture appropriations bill. We will work to see what the \nprospects are and time to be consumed for Transportation, State-\nJustice-Commerce, or Interior.\n  I have already discussed this matter twice this afternoon with the \nchairman of the committee. I believe he is working with Senator Byrd to \ntry to identify the bills we could most likely move in this remaining \ntime, and how that can be done--time agreements, if necessary--but we \nwill have to work together. I believe we can move at least three, and \nhopefully four, of these bills.\n  In light of this agreement, I now ask consent that the pending two \namendments to the agricultural appropriations bill be withdrawn.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \ncertainly won't, I want to reserve my comments on the overall agreement \nuntil after the majority leader has completed his unanimous consent \nrequest, which has one more piece.\n  Let me say in regard to the comments made by the majority leader \nabout our assurances, as he has indicated, that we would not pursue \nthis matter further this year. He used the right phrase--``if the \nnormal legislative process'' is followed.\n  Obviously, we expect the normal legislative process to be one which \nwill allow a good debate on an array of amendments, first and second-\ndegrees with limits on time, and that we will have completed an \nadequate number of those amendments.\n  This issue, of course, is the Patients' Bill of Rights. The agreement \ndoesn't preclude debate and amendments on other health-related matters \nunrelated to the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I am confident that if we have a good debate and if we have an \nopportunity to consider these amendments, there will be no need to \npursue this matter further this year. The Senate will have spoken.\n  I indicated privately in my conversation with Senator Lott that this \ncertainly is my expectation, and we will decide at the end of that week \nhow well we did. My expectation is the normal legislative process will \nbe followed.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to \nobject, do I understand from the leaders we would have the normal kind \nof days that we have traditionally had in terms of the workings of the \nSenate? If the majority leader could give some indication of that.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my intent to move forward in the normal fashion that \nwe deal with these legislative days. Of course, we always take into \nconsideration conflicts that one party or the other may have. There \nwill be no intent to have short days. We intend to have long days so we \ncan have adequate discussion.\n  Let me express my appreciation to Senator Nickles for the amount of \ntime and effort he has put into all of this. He is very knowledgeable \non the substance of the Patients' Bill of Rights issue.\n  There are many Senators on both sides of the aisle who prefer to do \nthis another way. It has taken restraint on both sides. I know Senator \nNickles still has concerns about it, but he has been willing to work \nwith us to come up with an agreement to move forward. I know that \napplies to Senator Kennedy also.\n  I also have to thank Senator Cochran and Senator Kohl, managers of \nthis agriculture appropriations bill, around whose neck this issue has \nbeen attached for the last week. They have been very patient and \nunderstanding.\n  I hope tomorrow we will be prepared to move forward aggressively on a \nnumber of these appropriations bills--the three I mentioned at the top \nor agriculture or one of the others.\n  I will be talking to the ranking member and Senator Daschle about the \nappropriations we can move forward with first.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. Reserving the right to object, I do not intend to object, \nbut I want to echo a comment of the Democratic leader. That presumption \nis that this flexible process will allow a sufficient number of \namendments to come to the floor, that it will not be a process where \none or two amendments are brought up and then through a series of \nextended second-degree amendments delayed?\n  Mr. LOTT. The agreement wouldn't allow for that.\n  Mr. REED. We are really talking about a procedure where we could \nfully ventilate all the issues--and there are numerous issues that are \ninherent in this bill. I hope that is the spirit and the actuality of \nthe agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think there will be full opportunity to talk about the \nsubstance of the issue and the bills pending, and amendments would be \noffered. I think after 2 or 3 days on this issue, most of the issues \nthat need to be debated--or all of the issues--will have been \naddressed.\n  Senator Daschle and I will have talked back and forth about that. I \nthink once we have some critical debate and some critical amendments, \nthe Members will think they have had the opportunity to be heard and \nwill have made their points.\n  So I think there is going to be plenty of time here. It doesn't \nspecify amendments. It doesn't specify a maximum or a minimum. There \nare some time limitations, which is the orderly way to do business \naround here, but there is not going to be any effort to have two or \nthree amendments and then forestall everything else. You could not do \nit under this arrangement.\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, let me clarify something \nwith the majority leader. The majority leader made a request, or we \ndiscussed one on Thursday evening, I think, at 6:30. The major \ndifference between this request and the one on Thursday is, No. 1, the \nlimit on debate on the bill is limited to 3 hours and there was not a \ntime limit?\n  Mr. LOTT. There was not a time limit on the earlier bill in the \ngeneral debate in the earlier unanimous consent. There is 3 hours in \nthis unanimous consent. Instead of the 2 hours on the first- and \nsecond-degree amendments, 2 hours each, there is 100 minutes on each \none of them.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that. For further clarification, I \nunderstand why the minority leader asked for that, but I will state--I \nstated it on the floor--it was never anyone's intention on this side, \nto my knowledge, to filibuster the bill. I do think 3 hours is a very \nlimited time. I do think it is possible, though, you can discuss the \nbill during amendment time, so I am not going to object.\n  Then the other major change was a reduction from 120 minutes to 100 \nminutes. That, of course, is to facilitate a greater number of \namendments and that is understandable as well. So I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Nickles again for his cooperation. I do \nthink as we go forward it is very likely some of these amendments will \nnot take the full time. I assume some of them may even be agreed to by \nboth sides. I also think it is possible we might be going along with \npretty hot debate and Senators may want a little extra time. Usually, \nwe try to accommodate each other, if there really is a need for it, on \nboth sides of the aisle. I am not advocating it now. I think we could \nnitpick it to death, but I think we have come about as close as we \npossibly can.\n  I do have two other announcements I would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the majority leader's \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. LOTT. As we have discussed, it is my intention to work to clear \nthe Executive Calendar. We now have a number of nominations on the \ncalendar, including a long list of military nominations and the nominee \nto be Secretary of Treasury. We may even have other nominees coming on \nthe calendar. I understand the Finance Committee reported three more \nnominations today, including the Under Secretary of Treasury. We have \nsome judicial nominations. We will begin the process tomorrow of \nhotlining those nominations. We will be moving them along as\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nwe go forward on this process of getting appropriations done.\n  Again, our purpose is to work together and do the people's business \nin the next 2\\1/2\\ days, and that will include clearing nominations. \nSome of them, of course, may hit a snag for one reason or another, but \nwe will certainly work on that.\n  The other thing is we have talked on both sides of the aisle about \nhow someday we needed to go back and correct a situation that developed \na few years ago with regard to rule XVI so that we can preserve the \nintegrity of the appropriations and the authorization process. Senator \nDaschle and I have talked about this. We want to reach a point where he \nand I together--not when one side or the other seizes the opportunity, \nbut at the earliest opportunity, he and I will stand together to \ncorrect what I think was a mistake. And it originated on our side of \nthe aisle. I acknowledge that. I was part of the problem. But I think \nfor the future sanctity of the appropriations process and to make the \nauthorization committees really work as they should, we should have \nthat point of order reinstated. Senator Daschle has indicated he would \nwork with me on that. I would like it to be totally a bipartisan \neffort. I know our ranking member and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee would like to do that, too. So I thank him for \nhis cooperation on this unanimous consent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to publicly commend the majority \nleader for the effort he has made over the last several days to find a \nway to resolve this impasse. I believe this is a win-win. I think only \nthrough his persistence and willingness to consider a lot of different \noptions were we able to reach this point. I am grateful to him and \nhave, once again, enjoyed the opportunity to resolve what has been a \nvery significant procedural difficulty for us all.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for the outstanding job he has done providing us real \nleadership on this issue, as he does on so many issues relating to \nhealth and education.\n  I also thank the assistant Republican leader as well.\n  I believe this is a good agreement any way one looks at it. It \nprovides us with the opportunity to have a good debate. It provides us \nwith the opportunity to have a series of amendments. It certainly \nprovides us with the focus that we have been looking for with regard to \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. This is a very good agreement, agreed to, \nI think, with the direct involvement of a lot of people. So we are \ngrateful.\n  The majority leader mentioned a couple of other matters, one having \nto do with his desire to work full days. He has assured me we will work \n9- to 12-hour days that week we come back because he recognizes the \nimportance of giving this issue a full opportunity for debate. I \nappreciate his commitment in that regard.\n  I also share his concern about how we might make the appropriations \nprocess work better. Democrats were opposed, of course, to the \noverruling of the Chair at the time it occurred. To take it back would \nbe consistent with the position we took when the vote was taken a few \nyears back. So I do intend to work with him to find a way to resolve \nthis matter. That also, of course, is assuming we will have \nopportunities--I know we have talked about this--opportunities to have \ngood debates with amendments on authorization bills. This will only \nwork if we have the regular order on authorization bills. We certainly \nhave to be sure that we have an opportunity on those occasions when \nauthorization bills are presented to have a good debate with amendments \nas we have had now on a couple of bills this year.\n  Again, I think this is a good agreement. I appreciate the cooperation \nof everybody but in particular the leadership of the majority leader \nand Senator Kennedy and others on our side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending the two leaders for \npropounding this unanimous consent request. These past days have been \nhard fought in establishing a procedure which would be fair and permit \nthe opportunity for the Senate to debate fully some of the important \nmeasures I think are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think \nthe leaders have outlined a process and the Senate has been willing to \naccept that procedure. Both leaders do deserve credit.\n  I want to underscore what both leaders have said; that is, we are \ngoing into this whole process on the basis of good faith. I join with \nthe Senator from South Dakota in feeling we can do the business of the \nSenate on this issue in that time. But it is also preserved, if for \nsome reason there is not the kind of constructive and positive attitude \nwe have heard this evening, that there is going to be the denial of \nthat opportunity, that rights will be reserved for Members to raise \nthese issues at another time. I am hopeful we can follow what has been \noutlined here and in good faith have a full and fair debate on these \nissues.\n  The real fireworks are going to be after the Fourth of July this \nyear. I look forward to engaging in this debate.\n  I again thank my leader and the majority leader for moving this whole \nextremely important piece of legislation to the point where it will be \ncenter stage in the Senate. I thank the leader for his efforts.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make one further \nannouncement. I have been communicating, as I said, with the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee. In the wrapup, we will announce that \nin the morning we will go to one of the appropriations bills, perhaps \nD.C. or foreign ops. We will need to confer with a lot of different \npeople. But when we get the time agreement, we will go to one of those.\n  In view of the work that has gone on, I will announce at this time \nthere will be no further rollcall votes tonight, but Members should \nexpect votes to occur in the morning and throughout the day.\n  Mr. President, one final announcement: We are going to pursue the \npossibility of laying down one of the appropriations bills tonight so \nwe would have it pending. I want Members to be aware of that, but there \nstill would not be any more recorded votes.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the introduction of S. 1301 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7813-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7813-S7815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there has been a breakthrough which \nobservers in the galleries and others watching might not be aware of; \nthat is, after 2 weeks of effort on the floor, we now have an \nunderstanding that after the Fourth of July recess when we return, we \nare going to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  That is the bill that talks about reforming health insurance in \nAmerica so that families have a better chance of getting quality health \ncare so that when you visit a doctor, and the doctor makes a medical \ndecision for you or someone you love, it will be less likely that some \nbureaucrat and insurance company will overrule the doctor.\n  We want to make certain, as well, that if you have a picnic in the \nbackyard on the Fourth of July, and your little boy climbs up the apple \ntree and falls out and breaks his arm, you can take him to the closest \nemergency room without fumbling through your papers to figure out which \nhospital is under your health insurance plan. That is just basic common \nsense.\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n  We want to make sure that if a doctor decides that a specialist is \nneeded for your problem that the health insurance company just can't \noverrule them; that you go ahead and get that specialist and get the \nbest care that doctor recommends.\n  If a woman would like to keep an OB/GYN as her primary care \nphysician, we don't let the insurance company come in and second-guess \nher on those sorts of things.\n  Fundamentally, this bill will also argue that health insurance \ncompanies, just like every other company in America, should be held \nresponsible for their decisions.\n  Each of us is responsible for our decisions in life. If you proceed \nto drink too much and drive and something terrible happens, you could \nbe held accountable in court.\n  The same thing is true for businesses that make bad decisions or good \ndecisions. They can be held accountable in court.\n  There are only two groups that are above the law: Foreign diplomats \nwho can't be brought into court in America, and health insurance \ncompanies--companies that make decisions every day that are literally \nlife and death decisions.\n  We believe with the Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of \nRights that these health insurance companies should entertain the \npossibility that if they make the wrong decision they will be held \naccountable.\n  I told this story on the floor before. I think it is one that \nillustrates exactly what is happening.\n  Sunday night, I was back in my home State of Illinois and met a \ncardiologist from Highland Park, IL, who a week before had a woman come \ninto his office complaining of chest pains. This was on a Thursday. He \nsaid: I want you in the hospital tomorrow morning, Friday morning, for \na catheterization to determine what problem you might have.\n  She checked with her health insurance company, and they said, no, she \ncannot go in for that catheterization because that isn't an approved \nhospital. We have to find a hospital that is approved under your health \ninsurance plan. We will check over the weekend and call you back.\n  There was no need to call back. She passed away on Sunday over that \nweekend. And the doctor said to me: What am I supposed to tell that \nfamily? This woman came to me for the best advice. I had an appointment \nmade in a hurry for what I considered to be a serious situation, and it \nwas overruled by an insurance company clerk.\n\n  That sort of thing happens too often. We believe in the Patients' \nBill of Rights to be offered on the Democratic side, and that the \npatients and families across America deserve better treatment.\n  The bottom line, of course, is that you are never more vulnerable in \nyour life than when you are sick and go to a doctor, or someone you \ndearly love is sick and you bring them to a doctor. You really want the \nbest care, and you don't want a decision made on the bottom line of a \nprofit statement of an insurance company to guide decisions. You want \nthe decisions made by the professionals involved.\n  We spent the last 2 weeks kind of twisted in knots not moving forward \nvery quickly on a lot of other matters because we couldn't agree \nbetween the Republican side and the Democratic side on how we might \napproach this issue. There has been a breakthrough today. I am happy \nthat it has happened. Now we have an agreement that the week following \nthe Fourth of July recess, we will come back and devote the entire week \nto this debate.\n  I think of all the things that we have talked about in the 106th \nCongress--and some of them are very important--there is hardly an issue \nmore important than the peace of mind which American families want when \nit comes to medical care. They want to have affordable, accessible \nhealth insurance. They want to be able to speak to a doctor in terms \nwhere they are confident that the real focus of the attention is on the \nhealth of the member of the family and not the health of the profit and \nloss statement of the insurance company. That, unfortunately, has \nbecome the case.\n  It wasn't that many years ago in Washington that we had this big \ndebate. President Clinton brought in health care reform. I am sure you \nremember it. It was a hotly debated issue. The insurance companies \nopposed it. There were a lot of efforts to derail it. And they were \nsuccessful. That health insurance-health care reform was swept aside.\n  But most Americans would believe that we did something because of all \nthe changes that took place within the last few years. There are more \nand more Americans under so-called managed care plans and fewer and \nfewer Americans with health insurance. Fewer employers are offering it. \nPeople in rural areas whom I represent in Illinois are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to even find, let alone afford, health \ninsurance.\n  All of these things have been happening over the last several years \nin a swirl of activities.\n  They tell me that last night Jay Leno, on his television show, talked \nabout the fact that Stephen King, after this unfortunate accident and \nthe experience he had in the hospital, was going to write his next \nhorror novel about managed care insurance companies. I hope that is not \nthe case. But it might be. It drew a rise from the audience, as I am \nsure it would almost everywhere.\n  You may remember the movie, ``As Good as it Gets,'' with Helen Hunt \nand Jack Nicholson. I enjoyed it a lot. At one point in the movie--she \nwas raising an asthmatic son--she expressed her frustration in very \ndramatic words about dealing with health insurance companies. And in \nthe movie theater in which I was sitting in Springfield, IL, people \nstarted applauding. That doesn't happen much.\n  But that kind of spontaneous reaction tells you that the people of \nthis country have been waiting for Congress to catch up with the needs \nof American families.\n  I think we can do it. I think this debate this week that we have set \naside, if it doesn't get bogged down in a lot of parliamentary \nhassles--and I don't think it will--could result in an honest debate \nwhere the Republican Party puts forward its best proposal for health \ninsurance reform, and the Democrats do the same, and we vote on it.\n  When it is all said and done, perhaps we will then have a bill that \nreally sets us on a track to help families across America get a break \nwhen they deal with these health insurance companies.\n  Last Saturday I met with a group of farmers in downstate Illinois. I \nheard an interesting story from one farmer about the problems his wife \nfaced because of her medical condition. These farmers in many ways are \nthe most vulnerable of all. They don't have the benefit of group health \ninsurance, in most instances, nor can they bargain with insurance \ncompanies. They find themselves, many times, facing outrageous premiums \nand arbitrary decisions by the insurance companies.\n  This farmer had driven about 100 miles to the meeting because he \nwanted to tell his story about what he and his wife had been through \nwith the health insurance companies. These stories, repeated over and \nover and over again, suggest to me that it is our responsibility to \ndeal with this.\n  I hope when this Congress comes to an end, at least this year we can \npoint back to the fact that we were sensitive to the issues that \nAmerica cared about. There was a time, for example, on the Senate floor \nwhen there was a serious question as to whether we would do anything--\nanything--about the horrible shooting that occurred at Columbine High \nSchool in Littleton, CO. Fortunately, a debate was scheduled on the \nfloor. After a week of debate, we passed a gun control bill--a modest \nbill, I might say, but one that was designed to keep guns out of the \nhands of kids and criminals.\n  We sent it to the House of Representatives. Sadly, the National Rifle \nAssociation, the gun lobby, used the 2 weeks before it came up for a \nvote to lobby away, and they were very effective. They watered down the \nbill until it was a joke. The bill ultimately was even defeated in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I haven't given up on that issue, because I think most people across \nthe country--gun owners and not--believe we can do things to keep guns \nout of the hands of people who shouldn't use them for a variety of \nreasons. The bill we passed was a very modest bill,\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\nwhich said, for example, that those who purchased guns at gun shows \nwould be subject to a background check. I don't think that is an \noutrageous idea.\n  We passed the Brady law. We said, if you want to buy a gun, we want \nto know if you have a history of committing a crime, a violent crime, \nbecause if you do, we are not going to sell you a gun; or if you have a \nhistory of violent illness, mental illness, we won't sell you a gun. \nThat has worked. It has kept guns out of the hands of hundreds of \nthousands of people. At least it slowed them down, at a minimum, but \nmaybe it stopped them from owning a gun.\n  It turns out that a substantial portion of firearms are sold outside \nthe law. They are sold at gun shows. We have them all over Illinois, \nall over the United States. People who own guns and collect them get \ntogether and sell them to one another, no questions asked. Because no \nquestions are asked, it has become a supply operation for a lot of \ncriminal elements.\n  In Illinois, the State police found that 25 percent of the guns used \nin crime came out of those gun shows. One of the things we put into law \nin the Senate was that there would be a background check, similar to \nthe Brady law, to find out if a person purchasing at a gun show had, in \nfact, a criminal background or a history of mental illness.\n  The National Rifle Association doesn't like that. When they got the \nbill over in the House, they said, you can't take more than 24 hours to \ndo the check. The gun shows occur on weekends, of course, and the \nwheels that are spinning forward to check the backgrounds of people may \nnot be as available on weekends. As a consequence, they watered down \nthe bill until it was meaningless.\n\n  A second provision we put into law--Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin \nwas the author--suggested we not sell guns in America unless they had a \ntrigger lock, a child safety device. Thirteen kids every day in America \nare killed by guns. Some are gangbangers who shoot away in Washington, \nDC, in Chicago, IL. Others, though, are kids who go out and get a gun \noff a shelf from their father's closet, start to play with it, \ndischarge it, and shoot themselves, a brother, sister, or playmate. \nThirteen kids a day die that way.\n  We want to lessen the likelihood of those tragic accidents. Trigger \nlocks, safety devices on guns, do that. That was in our bill. That was \nsent to the House. That was rejected.\n  The final point is one that Senator Dianne Feinstein of California \nproposed, a proposal that tries to close a loophole in the law. When we \npassed gun control a few years ago, we said, we are going to prohibit \nthe manufacture of these high-capacity ammunition clips, clips that can \nliterally hold up to 240 bullets. Unfortunately, we left a loophole and \ndidn't stop the importation of these clips from overseas. So we stopped \nthe domestic manufacturing, and they started flooding in from overseas.\n  Frankly, it raises a serious question: Who needs a gun with a 240-\nbullet high-capacity ammunition clip? If you need an AK-47 and 240 \nbullets to shoot a deer, you ought to stick to fishing.\n  Unfortunately, they are coming into this country for no purpose other \nthan to be used for criminal purposes.\n  Senator Feinstein was successful. She passed that amendment in the \nSenate. We sent it to the House. It got nowhere.\n  Those are the kinds of things we did to try to deal with some of the \nproblems we have identified. Having done those things, and having seen \nthe National Rifle Association do its work in the House, we have a lot \nmore work to be done.\n  I hope when the debate is concluded at the end of this 106th \nCongress, we can point with pride to having succeeded in passing import \nelements in law that improve the quality of life in America, that \nreduce the likelihood of violence in schools, that reduce the \nlikelihood of guns getting in the hands of criminals, that increase the \nopportunities for families across America to have good health insurance \nand be able to trust their doctor's decisions, and several other things \nthat I think are very important as part of the agenda.\n  One of them has to deal with increasing the minimum wage of $5.15 an \nhour. Imagine, if you will, trying to raise a family or even take care \nof yourself for $5.15 an hour. It has been years since we have \nincreased it. It is time we bring that up to a wage that more \naccurately reflects the cost of living in America. I hope before we \nleave this year we can address that.\n  We cannot leave, as well, without addressing the future of Medicare. \nThis has been a banner week for Medicare with the President's \nannouncement that we now have a reestimate of the budget. We believe if \nthe economy continues to grow, as we believe it will, we are going to \nhave an additional surplus. With that surplus we can do some \nextraordinary things.\n  I first came to Congress 17 years ago. When I came, we were facing \nall sorts of red ink and all sorts of deficits. We have been through a \nlot of tortuous effort to try to reduce. Now we have reached the point \nwhere we can honestly see a surplus in our future. I think we can use \nthat surplus to solidify Social Security and Medicare and, most \nimportantly, while we do that, eliminate the publicly held national \ndebt in America. To move from the point where a large portion of our \nbudget is being spent on interest on the debt to the point where \nvirtually none is being spent on interest on our debt is a great legacy \nto leave our children. I hope we can achieve that on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7815-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7815-S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ELECTION OF EHUD BARAK\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the election \nof Ehud Barak to Prime Minister of Israel and his efforts to form a new \ngovernment. I congratulate him, not only on his most impressive \nvictory, but also for his commitment to reinvigorate the Middle East \npeace process. As Mr. Barak enters the critical stage in his efforts to \nforge a coalition government, I wish him luck. And I applaud his \ninitial steps of talking with Egyptian President Mubarak and declaring \nhis intent to form a ``peace administration'' of three negotiating \nteams, one each for Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, reporting \ndirectly to him. We must not risk losing momentum toward achieving a \nlasting peace.\n  As Israel continues to take risks for peace, it is all the more \nimportant that America's commitment toward Israel be unquestioned. Our \nstrong commitment helps Israel take risks and makes it clear to \nIsrael's neighbors that Israel is a permanent reality that must be \ndealt with directly. Our dedication to Israel must take many shapes. We \nmust continue aid to Israel. We must help Israel militarily. We must \nactively support the peace process. We must maintain our support for \nJerusalem as Israel's capital.\n  America's support for the peace process, for the security of this \nregion, and for Israel itself must be unwavering. Israel, the only \npluralistic democracy in the Middle East, deserves our continued strong \nsupport. Helping Israel survive and thrive is the right thing to do. In \na particularly volatile part of the world, Israel is strategically \nimportant to America's interests. We cannot help but benefit by \nstrengthened economic, political, military and cultural ties with \nIsrael.\n  I have the greatest respect for Israel, its citizens, and its \nfounders. The creation of the state of Israel is a remarkable story of \na great people who overcame the Holocaust, rebuffed repeated foreign \nhostility, and created an industrialized democracy in a desert. The \nstory of Israel appeals to me because it is a story of faith and it is \na story of justice. I respect all who stand up to powerful forces \nagainst great odds for a just cause.\n  No issue is more important to our relationship than aid to Israel. It \nis one of America's most cost-effective foreign policy investments. The \neconomic and military aid that America provides Israel serves the \ninterests of both countries by promoting peace, security, and trade. \nIsrael recently initiated an agreement with the United States under \nwhich the United States will gradually reduce the amount of economic \naid in the coming years while ensuring an adequate amount of military \nassistance. I commend Israel for this initiative, and I believe that \nthe United States should stand by it.\n  The Middle East's unstable mixture of unconventional weaponry, \nadvanced military technology, political instability, and radical \nfundamentalism\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\nthreatens both Israel's security and America's vital interests in the \nregion and around the world. I am committed to the expansion of the \nUnited States-Israel strategic cooperation that was formalized in 1983.\n  In addition, it is our national interest to help ensure that Israel \nmaintains her qualitative military edge. Furthermore, the Unites States \nshould not sell sophisticated weaponry that could erode that edge to \nnations hostile toward Israel. And, of course, the United States must \ndo all it can to stop the development or acquisition of nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons by rogue states such as Libya, Iraq \nand Iran.\n  True and lasting peace between Israel and her neighbors can be \nachieved only through direct negotiations between the parties. \nNevertheless, the United States has played a critical role with Israel \nand her neighbors in helping bridge the differences between them. We \nmust continue to invest the time and energy necessary to help continue \nthis very complex series of negotiations.\n  Israel's capital of Jerusalem is important to Jews, Christian, and \nMuslims. I commend Israel for allowing all three faiths open access to \nworship at their holy places. Jerusalem is and ought to remain a united \ncity under Israeli sovereignty.\n  Israel is the only country where the United States chooses not to \nlocate our embassy in that country's capital city. I support the \nJerusalem Embassy Act that recognizes the united city of Jerusalem as \nIsrael's capital and mandates the moving of our embassy from Tel Aviv \nto Jerusalem.\n  Finally, I want to discuss Israel's special relationship with my home \nstate of North Carolina. Since 1993, North Carolina and Israel have had \none of the most comprehensive official exchange programs in the \ncountry. Both North Carolina and Israel have economies that depend on \nhigh technology, agriculture, and education. Both states benefit from \ntheir ongoing economic, social, and cultural exchanges. I look forward \nto doing all I can to promote this valuable relationship between Israel \nand the great state of North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Israel's soon-to-be \nformed government to pursue our nations' many mutual interests.

This continued spending on R is very important for \nthe U.S. economy as we head into the next century, and I believe this \nbill serves an important purpose in achieving this goal.\n  I look forward to cosponsoring this bill and gaining support for it \nin the days ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7816-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7816-S7817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION AND LOCAL AUTHORITY \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on June 10, 1999 I joined as a co-\nsponsor of legislation introduced by my Midwestern colleagues, the \nJunior Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, and the Junior Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Bayh, S. 872, The Municipal Solid Waste Interstate \nTransportation and Local Authority Act of 1999. I am pleased to be \nworking with them on this very important issue. I know that they, as \nformer Governors, are intimately aware of the concerns that the growing \ntrash trade poses for the States we represent.\n  We in the Midwest, especially those of us fortunate enough to be from \nthe Great Lakes States, enjoy a very high quality of life--beautiful \nscenery, small, neighborly towns, and spectacular natural resources. We \nhold it as a particular point of pride that we, in many instances, have \nthe luxury of avoiding many environmental problems and we have \nstructured our State and local governments in Wisconsin to try to be \nsure that we continue to avoid them. However, Mr. President, we in \nWisconsin are unable to protect our communities, which have done a good \nregulatory job, from having to deal with the solid waste mess created \nby our neighboring communities in other States. Instead, my State has \nbeen forced to accept other States' municipal solid waste in ever \nincreasing amounts.\n  We need to enact legislation to re-empower States to be able to \ncontrol the flow of waste into state-licensed landfills from out-of-\nstate sources. This legislation would give States the tools to do just \nthat. It gives states, like mine, the power to freeze solid waste \nimports at the 1993 levels. States that did not accept out of State \nwaste in 1993 would be presumed to prohibit receipt of out-of-State \nwaste until the affected unit of local government approves it. \nFacilities that already have a host community agreement or permit that \naccepts out-of-State waste would remain exempt from the ban. States \nwould also be allowed to set a State-wide percentage limit on the \namount of waste that new or expanding facilities could accept. The \nlimit can not be lower than 20 percent. Finally, States, under this \nbill, are also given the ability to deny the creation of either new \nfacilities or the expansion of existing in-State facilities if it is \ndetermined that there is no in-State need for the new capacity.\n  My home State has tried to address this issue repeatedly on its own, \nwithout success. On January 25, 1999, a federal appeals court struck \ndown as unconstitutional a 1997 Wisconsin law that prohibits landfills \nfrom accepting out-of-State waste from communities that don't recycle \nin compliance with Wisconsin's law. We are now examining options for \nlimiting out-of-State trash in Wisconsin including: appealing the \ndecision to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear an \nappeal of a similar Wisconsin case in 1995, passing new State \nlegislation, or pursuing the option before us today--seeking specific \nauthority from Congress to regulate trash from other States.\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\n  Wisconsin's law bans 15 different recyclables from State landfills. \nUnder the law, communities using Wisconsin landfills must have a \nrecycling program similar to those required of Wisconsin communities \nunder Wisconsin law, regardless of the law in their home State. About \n27 Illinois towns rely on southern Wisconsin landfills. Since the law \ntook effect, waste haulers serving those communities have had to find \nalternative landfills for their clients, incurring higher \ntransportation costs in the process. IL-based Waste Management Inc. and \nthe 1,300-member National Solid Waste Management Association were the \nentities that challenged Wisconsin's law, arguing that the law violated \nthe Interstate Commerce Clause.\n  By recycling, Wisconsin residents have reduced the amount of \nmunicipal waste heading to landfills. Since the State's previous out-\nof-State waste law was struck down by the appeals court in 1995, the \namount of non-Wisconsin waste in Wisconsin landfills has tripled. When \nthe law was in effect, 7.7 percent of the municipal waste in Wisconsin \ncame from out of State. That has risen to more than 22.9 percent since \nthe law was struck down. Though this legislation will not afford \nWisconsin the ability to block garbage containing recyclables from our \nlandfills, it will at least give my State the ability to address the \noverall volume of waste entering our State.\n  In 1995, I supported flow control legislation sponsored by the \nSenator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and drawn substantially from the \nwork of the former Senator from Indiana, Mr. Coats. I have been shocked \nthat the Senate, which passed that bill by a significant majority vote \nof 94-6, has not taken up legislation to address this issue since that \ntime, shocked until I examined the relationship between the interests \nopposing that legislation and political campaigns. According to the \nCenter for Responsive Politics, in the 1998 election cycle, one of the \ninterests that opposes flow control legislation, Waste Management Inc., \ncontributed $422,275 in soft money to the two major political parties--\n$85,000 to the Democratic Party and $337,275 to the Republican Party. \nMr. President, the issue of interstate waste control effects my home \nState and 23 other States. For years States have been faced with the \nchallenge of ensuring safe responsible management of out-of-State \nwaste, and the need for State control is even more acute today than in \nwas in 1995. Congress is the only body that can give the States the \nrelief they need from being overwhelmed by a tidal wave of trash. We \nhave not acted on a problem that effects nearly half of our States, and \ncitizens are left to try to understand our inaction by following the \nmoney trail behind the trash truck.\n  We need to take prompt action on this matter, and I think this \nlegislation is a good first step. I urge my other colleagues to \nconsider lending this bill their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7817-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be transmitted \n     to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of Colorado's delegation of the United States \n     Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-228.

This high-level \n     radioactive waste material demands exceptional care in all \n     facets of its storage and disposal, including the \n     transportation of this material; and\n       Whereas, In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy \n     Act of 1982. This legislation requires the federal \n     government, through the Department of Energy, to build a \n     facility for the permanent storage of high-level nuclear \n     waste. This act, which was amended in 1987, includes a \n     specific timetable to identify a suitable location and to \n     establish the waste facility. The costs for this undertaking \n     are to be paid from a fee that is assessed on all nuclear \n     energy produced; and\n       Whereas, In accordance with the federal act, customers of \n     utilities operating nuclear plants in Michigan have \n     contributed, directly and through accumulated interest, some \n     $700 million for the construction and operation of a federal \n     waste facility; and\n       Whereas, There are serious concerns that the federal \n     government is not complying with the timetables set forth in \n     federal law. Every delay places our country at greater risk, \n     because the large number of temporary sites at nuclear \n     facilities across the country makes us vulnerable to \n     potential problems.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Montana relative to national forest road closure \n     and obliteration; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Resolution 26\n\n       Whereas, there are 737 million acres of forested land \n     covering approximately one-third of the United States, a \n     nation that has created the largest legally protected \n     wilderness system in the world, while at the same time \n     sustaining a highly productive and efficient wood products \n     industry; and\n       Whereas, the federal government owns approximately two-\n     thirds of the land in western Montana and these lands are \n     primarily administered by the U.S. Forest Service; and\n       Whereas, the management of federal lands has a direct \n     impact on economic and recreational opportunities and the \n     quality of life for thousands of Montana residents; and\n       Whereas, Congress has declared in the federal Multiple-Use \n     Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 that national forests are \n     established and must be utilized for outdoor recreation, \n     range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fishery purposes; \n     and\n       Whereas, the national forest road system represents a \n     significant capital infrastructure investment and a valuable \n     existing forest asset for forest managers and the public, \n     providing access for a multitude of recreational \n     opportunities, for emergency response efforts, and for \n     resource management, protection, and improvement activities; \n     and\n       Whereas, the federal government continues to close roads to \n     public access by motorized vehicles and, in early 1998, the \n     forest service proposed and is now planning to implement an \n     18-month moratorium on all new road building in roadless \n     areas pending a review of its road management policies; and\n       Whereas, one stated purpose of the moratorium is to close \n     or obliterate existing roads, thus creating additional \n     defacto roadless areas contrary to the interests of Montana's \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, the scheduled destruction of nearly 2,000 miles of \n     roads in the 10 national forests in Montana can have \n     significant environmental, economic, and cultural impacts \n     upon the fabric of many Montana communities and its citizens; \n     and\n       Whereas, 650 miles of forest system roads in the Flathead \n     National Forest alone have been scheduled for obliteration \n     and 200 miles have already been destroyed; and\n       Whereas, destruction or obliteration of existing forest \n     system roads can cause short-term and long-term increased \n     discharges of sediment to streams, adversely affecting \n     certain sensitive or endangered fish species and resulting in \n     further restrictions on other multiple-use activities. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Montana:\n       (1) That the 56th Montana Legislature opposes the current \n     administration's policy on national forest road closure and \n     obliteration and urges the immediate suspension of road \n     closure and obliteration activities.\n       (2) That existing roads are a valuable and necessary \n     capital investment in public lands that should not be lost or \n     destroyed.\n       (3) That forest plans specifying multiple-use management \n     for timber harvest, outdoor recreation, range, watershed, and \n     fish and wildlife values should be given priority as the \n     appropriate and necessary management guidance to the forest \n     service. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent by the \n     Secretary of State to the Montana Congressional Delegation, \n     the Secretary of the federal Department of Interior, the \n     Secretary of the federal Department of Agriculture, the \n     Director of the United States Forest Service, the Director of \n     the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of \n     the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and the President and Vice \n     President of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7819-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. \n             Collins, and Mr. Levin):\n       S. 1297.

A bill to provide for professional liability insurance \ncoverage for Federal employees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                the federal employees equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nEmployees Equity Act of 1999.\n  My legislation expands a provision included in the omnibus \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1997 (P.L. 104-208) to allow \nfederal agencies to contribute to the costs of professional liability \ninsurance for their senior executives, managers and law enforcement \nofficials. While this important benefit contained in the Omnibus \nAppropriation bill was indeed enacted, it has not been made available \non as wide a basis to federal employees as we had hoped.\n  The Federal Employees Equity Act would ensure that federal agencies \nreimburse one-half the premiums for Professional Liability Insurance \nfor employees covered by this bill. Federal managers, supervisors, and \nlaw enforcement officials should not have to fear the excessive costs \nof legal representation when unwarranted allegations are made against \nthem for investigations of these allegations are conducted.\n  I was a strong supporter of the provision in 1996 because federal \nofficials often found themselves to be the target of unfounded \nallegations of wrongdoing. Sometimes allegations were\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nmade by citizens, against whom federal officials were enforcing the law \nand by employees who had performance or conduct problems. Although many \nallegations have proven to be specious, these federal officials were \noften subject to lengthy investigations and had to pay for their own \nlegal representation when their agencies could not provide it.\n  The affected federal managers, supervisors, and law enforcement \nofficials are generally prohibited from being represented by unions. \nFor employees who are in bargaining units represented by unions, \nCongress allows federal agencies to subsidize the time and expenses of \nunion representatives when they are needed by such employees, whether \nor not they are dues paying members of the union.\n  Because these federal officials are denied union representation, they \nhave found it necessary to purchase professional liability insurance in \norder to protect themselves when allegations are made against them to \nthe inspector general of their agency, to the Office of Special \nCounsel, or to the EEO office. The insurance provides coverage for \nlegal representation for the employees when they are accused, and will \npay judgements against the employee up to a maximum dollar amount if \nthe employee is found to have made a mistake while carrying out his \nofficial duties. Currently, these managers must hire their own lawyers \nin order to defend their reputation and careers when they are the \nsubject of a grievance, regardless of whether the complaint has merit.\n\n  The current law has had some success and has been implemented by \nseveral federal departments including: Departments of Agriculture, \nEducation, Interior, Labor, and such agencies as the Social Security \nAdministration, Small Business Administration, General Services \nAdministration, Securities and Exchange Commission, National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nNational Science Foundation, the Merit Systems Protections Board, the \nOffice of the Inspector General at the Office of Public Health and \nScience, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration at Department of Health and Human Services.\n  Regrettably, other departments such as Treasury, Justice, Defense, \nCommerce, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and agencies such as the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Office of Personnel \nManagement have not seen fit to do so.\n  The professional associations of these officials (the Senior \nExecutives Association, the Professional Managers Association, the FBI \nAgents Association, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association \nof Assistance U.S. Attorneys, and the National Treasury Employees \nUnion) have endorsed the concept for legislation to require federal \nagencies to reimburse half the cost of premiums for professional \nliability insurance.\n  The intent of this measure is simply to ``level the playing field'' \nso that supervisors and managers are treated equally by various federal \nagencies and have access to protections similar to those which are \nalready provided for rank and file federal employees.\n  I request your support for these federal officials and for this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1298\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncorporate alternative minimum tax reform; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' with a bipartisan group \nof my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee, Senators Nickles, \nRobb, Hatch and Mack. This bill is designed to improve the way the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax works for capital intensive and \ncommodity based companies. It is relatively modest in scope and I hope \nit will be part of any discussion we have about how we might deliver \nappropriate tax relief. Even though this bill does not change the \nfundamentals of the corporate AMT, it would eliminate some of the \nunfairness of current law by allowing companies with long term AMT \ncredits to recover those credits faster. I think this bill should be \npart of the Finance Committee's discussions about constructive ways to \nprovide corporate tax relief.\n  The alternative minimum tax imposes a significant long term tax \nburden on capital intensive industries --it is not a minimum tax, but \nis, in fact, a maximum tax which requires companies to calculate their \ntaxes two different ways and pay the higher of the two calculations. It \nhits our manufacturing sector hard because these businesses are most \nlikely to have to make large investments in plants and equipment. \nManufacturing businesses that make commodity products often have slim \nprofit margins and must contend with fierce international competition. \nThe coal and steel industry are perfect examples of these types of \nindustries. Other businesses with tight profit margins such as start up \ncompanies are also negatively affected by AMT.\n  Today, a taxpayer's AMT may be reduced by foreign tax credits and net \noperating losses, but they are limited to 90% of the alternative \nminimum tax. Under present law, if a taxpayer pays alternative minimum \ntax in any year, the amount of that payment is treated as an \nalternative minimum credit for future years. This was intended to \nensure that companies did not wind up paying more under the AMT than \nwas owed under the regular income tax. However, under current law, AMT \ncredits may be used to reduce regular tax but not alternative minimum \ntax. No carryback of credits is permitted.\n  The provisions of the ``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' \nwould allow a corporation with AMT credits that are unused after three \nor more years to reduce its tentative minimum tax by a maximum of 50% \nusing those credits. The portion which would be allowed would the \nlesser of the aggregate amount of the taxpayer's AMT credits that are \nat least three years old; or 50% of the taxpayer's alternative minimum \ntax. The taxpayer would use its oldest AMT credits first under both \ncurrent law that allows a company to use its AMT credits, and under the \nprovisions of this bill. The bill would enhance a company's ability to \nuse AMT credits to reduce its regular tax. Finally, the bill would \nallow a taxpayer with AMT net operating losses in the current and two \nprevious years to carry back AMT net operating losses up to 10 years to \noffset AMT paid in previous years. First-in, and first-\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\nout ordering would apply. This provision would help companies in the \ntoughest financial shape.\n  The ``Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999'' is designed to \nhelp prevent companies from being trapped permanently into AMT status. \nRecovering more AMT credits sooner will help ease the position of many \ncompanies who are now stuck with excess and unusable AMT credits. Too \nmany companies have paid AMT for years and see no possibility of using \ntheir AMT credits without this reform. Moreover, a great many U.S. \ncompanies have had to deal with sharply decreasing commodity prices due \nto the collapse of markets in Asia and around the world over the last \nfew years. Without some assistance it will be very hard for American \ncompanies to continue to modernize and remain competitive. Their \nposition of accumulating excess AMT credits hurts their cash flow and \ntheir bottomline profitability.\n  The Alternative Minimum Tax Reform Act of 1999 is something \nreasonable we can do to help companies that are the backbone of our \nmanufacturing base. I look forward to discussing this issue with my \ncolleagues and to a score of how much this proposal would cost from the \nJoint Tax Committee to inform our discussions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller, to introduce legislation to reform the \nalternative minimum tax, or AMT.\n  Congress created the AMT in 1986 to prevent businesses from using tax \nloopholes, such as the investment tax credit or safe harbor leasing, to \npay little or no tax. The use of these tax preferences sometimes \nresulted in companies reporting healthy ``book'' income to their \nshareholders but little taxable income to the government.\n  Therefore, to create a perception of fairness, Congress created the \nAMT. The AMT requires taxpayers to calculate their taxes once under \nregular tax rules, and again under AMT rules which deny accelerated \ndepreciation, net operating losses, foreign tax credits, and other \ndeductions and credits. The taxpayer then pays the higher amount, and \nthe difference between their AMT tax and their regular tax is \n``credited' to offset future regular tax liability if it eventually \nfalls below their AMT tax liability.\n  Unfortunately, the AMT has had a negative, unanticipated impact on \nmany U.S. businesses. As it is currently structured, the AMT is a \ncomplicated, parallel tax code which places a particularly heavy burden \non capital intensive companies. Corporations must now plan for and \ncomply with two tax codes instead of one. Further, the AMT's \nelimination of important cost-recovery tax incentives increases the \ncost of investment and makes U.S. businesses uncompetitive with foreign \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that several AMT reforms I began \npushing in 1995 were eventually enacted in 1997. The Taxpayer Relief \nAct of 1997 exempted small corporations from the AMT, and conformed the \ndepreciation cost-recovery periods for AMT and the regular corporate \ntax. The depreciation provisions in particular will relieve much of the \nAMT's negative impact on capital-intensive businesses.\n  However, even with these changes, some businesses continue to be \nchronic AMT taxpayers, a situation that was not contemplated when the \nAMT was created. These companies continue to pay AMT year after year, \naccumulating millions in unused AMT credits. These credits are a tax on \nfuture, unearned revenues which may never materialize, and because of \nthe time-value of money their value to the taxpayer decreases every \nyear.\n  The legislation Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today helps \nAMT taxpayers recover their AMT credits in a more reasonable time frame \nthan under current law. Our bill would allow businesses with AMT \ncredits which are three years old or older to offset up to 50 percent \nof their current-year tentative minimum tax. This provision will help \nchronic AMT taxpayers dig their way out of the AMT and allow them to \nrecoup at least a portion of these ``accelerated tax payments'' in a \nreasonable time-frame.\n  Mr. President, our legislation does not repeal the AMT, and it will \nnot allow taxpayers to ``zero out'' their tax liability. This bill \nspecifically addresses the problems faced by companies that are buried \nin AMT credits they might otherwise never be able to utilize. I \nencourage the Senate Finance Committee to consider our bill when \ndrafting this year's tax reconciliation legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1300. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to prevent the wearing \naway of an employee's accrued benefit under a defined plan by the \nadoption of a plan amendment reducing future accruals under the plan; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              older workers pension protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, older workers across America have been \npaying into pension plans throughout their working years, anticipating \nthe secure retirement which is their due. And now, as more Americans \nthan ever before in history approach retirement, we are seeing a \ndisturbing trend by employers to cut their pension benefits.\n  Many companies are changing to so-called ``cash balance'' plans which \noften saves them millions of dollars in pension costs each year by \ntaking a substantial cut out of employee pensions. This practice allows \nemployers to unfairly profit at the expense of retirees.\n  Employees generally receive three types of benefits for working: \ndirect wages, health benefits and pensions.\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nTwo of those are long-term benefits which usually grow in value as \nworkers become older. Pensions are paid entirely after a worker leaves. \nReducing an employee's pension years after it is earned should be no \nmore legal than denying a worker wages after work has been done.\n  In fact, our laws do prohibit employers from directly reducing an \nemployee's pension accrued benefit. Unfortunately, however, these \nprotections are being sidestepped and workers' pensions are being \nindirectly reduced through the creation of cash balance pension plans.\n  Under traditional defined benefit plans, a worker's pension is based \non their length of employment and their average pay during their last \nyears of service. Their pension is based on a preset formula using \nthose key factors rather than the amount in their pension account. \nUnder the typical cash balance plan, a worker's pension is based on the \nsum placed in the employee's account. That sum is based on their wages \nor salary year to year.\n  When a worker shifts from a traditional to a cash balance plan, the \nemployer calculates the value of the benefits they have accrued under \nthe old plan. The result for many older workers who have accrued \nsignificant sums in their pension that are higher than it would have \nbeen under the new cash balance plan. In that case, under many of these \ncash balance plans the employer simply stops contributing to the value \nof their pension till the value reaches the level provided for under \nthe new plan. And this can go on for significant periods--five years \nand sometimes more. Pension experts call this ``wear away'' others call \nit a ``plateau.''\n  This is not right. It is not fair. In fact, I believe it is a type of \nage discrimination. After all, a new employee, usually younger, would \neffectively be receiving greater pay for the same work: money put into \ntheir pension plan. And, there are some who believe this practice \nviolates the spirit and perhaps the letter of existing law in that \nregard.\n  What does this mean to real people?\n  Two Chase Manhattan banking executives hired an actuary to calculate \ntheir future pensions after Chase Manhattan's predecessor, Chemical \nBank, converted to a cash balance plan. The actuary estimated their \nfuture pensions had fallen 45 percent. John Healy, one of the \nexecutives, says ``I would have had to work about ten more years before \nI broke even.''\n\n  Ispat Inland, Inc, an East Chicago steel company, converted to a cash \nbalance plan January 1. Paul Schroeder, a 44-year-old engineer who has \nworked for Ispat for 19 years, calculated it could take him as long as \n13 years to acquire additional benefits.\n  Why are companies changing to these cash balance plans? They have \nlots of stated reasons: ease of administration, certainty in how much \nis needed to pay for the pension plan and that the plan is beneficial \nto those workers who move from company to company (with similar pension \nplans). But, the big reason is the companies save millions of dollars. \nThey save it because the pensions provided for with almost all cash \nbalance plans are, on average far less generous, and they immediately \nreduce their need to pay anything into a pension plan at all for a \nwhile, sometimes for years, because of this wear away or plateau \nfeature.\n  At one conference of consulting actuaries, Joseph M. Edmonds told \ncompanies:\n\n     . . . it is easy to install a cash balance plan in place of a \n     traditional defined benefit plan and cover up cutbacks in \n     future benefit accruals. For example, you might change from a \n     final average pay formula to a career average pay formula. \n     The employee is very excited about this because he now has an \n     annual account balance instead of an obscure future monthly \n     benefit. The employee does not realize the implications of \n     the loss of future benefits in the final pay plan. Another \n     example of a reduction in future accruals could be in the \n     elimination of early retirement subsidies.\n\n  Because traditional pension plans become significantly more valuable \nin the last years before retirement, the switch to cash balance plans \nalso can reduce older workers' incentive to stay until they reach their \nnormal retirement age.\n  I support Senator Moynihan's legislation that requires that \nindividuals receive clear individualized notice of what a conversion to \na cash balance plan would do to their specific pension. There is no \nquestion that shining the light on this dark practice can reduce the \nchance that it will occur. I certainly agree with his view that those \nnotices should not be generalized where obfuscation is easier and \nemployees will pay less attention to the result.\n  I also believe that more must be done. For that reason, I am \nintroducing the Older Workers Pension Protection Act of 1999 which \nprohibits the practice of ``wear away.'' It provides that a company \ncannot discriminate against longtime workers by not putting aside money \ninto their pension account without any consideration for the long term \npayments made to the employee's pension for earlier work performed. \nUnder my bill, there would be no wear away, no plateau in which a \nworker would be receiving no increases in pension benefits while \nworking when other employees received benefits. The new payments would \nhave to at least equal the payments made under the revised pension plan \nwithout any regard to how much a worker had accrued in pension benefits \nunder the old plan.\n  Some suggest that if such a requirement were put in place, companies \ncould and would opt out of providing any pension at all. I do not \nbelieve that would happen. Companies with defined benefit plans do not \nhave them because they are required to do so. They do it because of \nnegotiated contracts or because the company has decided that it is an \nimportant part of the benefits for employees to acquire and maintain a \nproductive workforce. Many suggest that the simple disclosure alone \nmight prevent a reduction in payment benefits.\n  Much is made about the gains of younger workers when companies switch \nto cash benefit plans. There is greater portability. But, none of the \nexperts I've consulted believes that is a dominant motivation of the \ncompanies for proposing these changes in pension law. And, the changes \nI am proposing would not reduce the benefits for younger workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a fresh look at the spirit of the \ncurrent law that prevents a reduction in accrued pension benefits. I \nbelieve it is only fair to extend that law with its current spirit by \nsimply requiring that any company which changes to a cash balance or \nsimilar pension plan treats all workers fairly and not penalize older \nemployees whose hard work has earned them benefits under the earlier \npension plan.\n  Mr. President, Ellen Schultz at the Wall Street Journal has done an \nexcellent series of articles on this issue. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of those articles appear in the Record at this point. I am \nalso including the text of a piece of this same subject done by NPR. If \nmy colleagues have not seen these articles I commend them to their \nattention. I believe that once you've read them, you'll agree with me \nthat we must take action to protect the pensions of older workers.\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 4, 1998]\n\n      Employers Win Big With a Pension Shift; Employees Often Lose\n\n             (By Ellen E. Schultz and Elizabeth MacDonald)\n\n       Largely out of sight, an ingenious change in the way big \n     companies structure their pension plans is saving them \n     millions of dollars, with barely a peep of resistance. Unless \n     they happen to have a Jim Bruggeman on their staff.\n       Sifting through his bills and junk mail one day last year, \n     Mr. Bruggeman found the sort of notice most people look at \n     but don't spend a lot of time on: His company was making some \n     pension-plan changes.\n       The company, Central & South West Corp., was replacing its \n     traditional plan with a new variety it said was easier to \n     understand and better for today's more-mobile work force. A \n     brochure sent to workers stressed that ``the changes being \n     made are good for both you and the company.''\n       Alone among Central & South West's 7,000 employees, Mr. \n     Bruggeman, a 49-year-old engineer in the Dallas utility's \n     Tulsa, Okla., office, set out to discover exactly how the new \n     system, known as a cash-balance plan, worked. During a year-\n     long quest to master the assumptions, formulas and \n     calculations behind it, Mr. Bruggeman found himself at odds \n     with his superiors, and labeled a troublemaker. In the end, \n     though, he figured out something about the new pension system \n     that few other employees have noticed: For many of them, it \n     is far from a good deal.\n       But it clearly was, as the brochure noted, good for the \n     company. A peek at a CSW regulatory filing in March 1998, \n     after the new plan took effect, shows that the company saved \n     $20 million in pension costs last year\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n     alone. Other government filings revealed that whereas the \n     year before, CSW had to set aside $30 million to fund its \n     pension obligations, after it made the mid-1997 switch it \n     didn't have to pay a dime to fund the pension plan.\n\n\n                             pension light\n\n       The switch to cash-balance pension plans--details later--is \n     the biggest development in the pension world in years, so big \n     that some consultants call it revolutionary. Certainly, many \n     call it lucrative; one says such a pension plan ought to be \n     thought of as a profit center. Not since companies dipped \n     into pension funds in the 1980s to finance leveraged buyouts, \n     have corporate treasurers been so abuzz over a pension \n     technique.\n       But its little-noticed dark side--one that many companies \n     don't make very clear to employees, to say the least--is that \n     a lot of older workers will find their pensions cut, in some \n     cases deeply.\n       So far, only the most financially sophisticated employees \n     have figured this out, because the formulas are so complex. \n     Even the Labor Department and the Internal Revenue Service \n     have trouble with them. So thousands of employees, while \n     acutely aware of how the stock market affects their \n     retirement next eggs, are oblivious to the effect of this \n     change. (See related article on page C1.)\n       One might get the impression, from the rise of 401(k) \n     retirement plans funded jointly by employer and employee, \n     that pensions are a dead species. In fact, nearly all large \n     employers still have pension plans, because pulling the plug \n     would be too costly; the company would have to pay out all \n     accrued benefits at once. Meanwhile, companies face growing \n     obligations as the millions of baby boomers move into their \n     peak pension-earning years.\n       Now, however, employers have discovered a substitute for \n     terminating the pension plan; a restructuring that often \n     makes it unnecessary ever to feed the plan again.\n\n\n                         pitfalls for employers\n\n       But this financially appealing move has its risks. The IRS \n     has never given its blessing to some of the maneuvers \n     involved. If employers don't win a lobbying battle currently \n     being waged for exemptions from certain pension rules, some \n     of these plans could be in for a costly fix.\n       In addition, the way employers are handling the transition \n     could result in employee-relations backlashes as more and \n     more older workers eventually figure out they are paying the \n     price for the transformation of traditional pension plans.\n       In those traditional plans, most of the benefits build up \n     in an employee's later years. Typical formulas multiply years \n     of service by the average salary in the final years, when pay \n     usually is highest. As a result, as much as half of a \n     person's pension is earned in the last five years on the job.\n       With the new plans, everyone gets the same steady annual \n     credit toward an eventual pension, adding to his or her \n     pension-account ``cash balance.'' Employers contribute a \n     percentage of an employee's pay, typically 4%. The balance \n     earns an interest credit, usually around 5%. And it is \n     portable when the employee leaves.\n       For the young, 4% of pay each year is more than what they \n     were accruing under the old plan. But for those nearing \n     retirement, the amount is far less. So an older employee who \n     is switched in to a cash-balance system can find his or her \n     eventual pension reduced by 20% or 50% or, in rare cases, \n     even more.\n       This is one way companies save money with the switch. The \n     other is a bit more complicated. Companies can also benefit \n     from the way they invest the assets in the cash-balance \n     accounts.\n       If the employer promised to credit 5% interest to \n     employees' account balances, it can keep whatever it earned \n     above that amount. The company can use these earnings to \n     finance other benefits, to pay for a work-force reduction, \n     or--crucially--to cover future years' contributions. This is \n     why the switch makes pension plans self-funding for many \n     companies.\n       Although employers can do this with regular pensions, the \n     savings are grater and easier to measure in cash-balance \n     plans. The savings often transform an underfunded pension \n     plan into one that is fully funded. ``Cash-balance plans have \n     a positive effect on a company's profitability,'' says Joseph \n     Davi, a benefits consultant at Towers Perrin in Stamford, \n     Conn. They ``could be considered a profit center.''\n\n\n                          motive for the move\n\n       Employers, however, are almost universally reticent about \n     how they benefit. ``Cost savings were not the reason the \n     company switched to a cash-balance plan,'' says Paul Douty, \n     the compensation director at Mr. Bruggeman's employer, CSW. \n     Sure, the move resulted in substantial cost savings, he says, \n     but the company's goal was to become more competitive and \n     adapt to changing times. Besides, he notes, the $20 \n     million in pension-plan savings last year were partly \n     offset by a $3 million rise in costs in the 401(k); the \n     company let employees contribute more and increased its \n     matching contributions.\n       There is another reason some employers like cash-balances \n     plans: By redistributing pension assets from older to younger \n     workers, they turn pension rights--which many young employees \n     ignore since their pension is so far in the future--into \n     appealing benefits today. At the same time, older workers \n     lose a financial incentive to stay on the job, since their \n     later years no longer can balloon the pension.\n       Some pension professionals think companies should be more \n     candid. ``If what you want to do is get rid of older workers, \n     don't mask it as an improvement to the pension plan,'' says \n     Michael Pikelny, an employee-benefits specialist at Hartmarx \n     Corp., an apparel maker in Chicago that decided not to \n     install a cash-balance plan.\n\n\n                           under a microscope\n\n       Most employees aren't equipped to question what employers \n     tell them. But Mr. Bruggeman was. He had a background in \n     finance, his hobby was actuarial science, he had taken \n     graduate-level courses in statistics and probability, and he \n     knew CSW's old pension plan inside and out. So when the \n     company announce it was converting to a cash-balance plan \n     last year, he began asking it for the documents and \n     assumptions he needed to compare the old pension to the new \n     one.\n       With each new bit of data, he gained another insight. \n     First, he figured out that future pension accruals had been \n     reduced by at least 30% for most employees. CSW got rid of \n     early-retirement and other subsidies and reduced the rates at \n     which employees would accrue pensions in the future.\n       Employees wouldn't necessarily conclude this from the \n     brochures the human resources department handed out. Like \n     most employers that switch to cash-balances plans, CSW \n     assured employees that the overall level of retirement \n     benefits would remain unchanged. But a close reading of the \n     brochure revealed that this result depended on employees' \n     putting more into their 401(k) plans, gradually making up for \n     the reduction in pensions.\n       At a question-and-answer session on the new plan before it \n     was adopted, Mr. Bruggeman spoke up and told co-workers how \n     their pensions were being reduced. The next day, he says, his \n     supervisors in Tulsa came to his office and told him that CSW \n     management in Dallas was concerned that his remarks would \n     ``cause a class-action suit'' or ``uprising,'' and said he \n     shouldn't talk to any other employees. He says the \n     supervisor, Peter Kissman, informed him that if he continued \n     to challenge the new pension plan, CSW officials would think \n     he wasn't a team player, and his job could be in jeopardy.\n       Asked about this, Mr. Kissman says: ``In my department I \n     would not tolerate employee harassment. I believe the company \n     feels the same way. Past that, I really can't speak to this \n     issue. It's being investigated by the company.''\n\n\n                            a few sweeteners\n\n       Employers, aware that switching to cash-balance plans can \n     slam older workers, often offer features to soften the blow. \n     They may agree to contribute somewhat more than the standard \n     4% of pay for older employees, or they may provide a \n     ``grandfather clause.'' CSW offered both options, saying \n     employees 50 or older with 10 years of service could stay in \n     the old plan if they wished. Mr. Bruggeman, a 25-year \n     veteran, was just shy of 49. He calculated that people in his \n     situation would see their pensions fall 50% under the new \n     plan, depending on when they retired.\n       Mr. Bruggeman told company officials that the plan wasn't \n     fair to some long-term employees. Subsequently, he says, in \n     his November 1997 performance evaluation, his supervisor's \n     only criticism was that he ``spends too much time thinking \n     about the pension plan.'' A CSW official says the company \n     can't discuss personnel matters.\n       What bothered Mr. Bruggeman even more was his discovery of \n     one of the least-known features of cash-balance plans: Once \n     enrolled in them, some employees don't earn any more toward \n     their pension for several years.\n       The reasons are convoluted, but in a nutshell: Most \n     employees believe that opening balance in their new pension \n     account equals the credits they've earned so far under the \n     old plan. But in fact, the balance often is lower.\n       When employers convert to a cash-balance plan, they \n     calculate a present-day, lump-sum value for the benefit each \n     employee has already earned. In Mr. Bruggeman's case, this \n     was $352,000--something he discovered only after obtaining \n     information from the company and making the calculations \n     himself. Yet Mr. Bruggeman's opening account in the cash-\n     balance plan was just $296,000, because the company figured \n     it using different actuarial and other assumptions.\n       This is generally legal, despite a federal law that bars \n     companies from cutting already-earned pensions. If Mr. \n     Bruggeman quit, he would get the full $352,000, so the law \n     isn't violated. But if he stays, it will take several years \n     of pay credits and interest before his balance gets back up \n     to $352,000.\n\n\n                              ``Wearaway''\n\n       Mr. Douty says this happened to fewer than 2% of workers at \n     CSW. But at some companies that switch to cash-balance plans, \n     far more are affected. At AT Corp., which adopted a cash-\n     balance plan this year, many older workers will have to work \n     three to eight years before their balance catches up and they \n     start building up their pension pot again. ``Wearaway,'' this \n     is called. Only if an employee knows what figures to ask for \n     can he or she make a precise comparison of old and new \n     benefits.\n       Indeed, the difficulty of making comparisons has sometimes \n     been portrayed as an advantage of switching to cash-balance \n     plans. A partner at the consulting firm that invented the \n     plans in the 1980s told a client in\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n     a 1989 letter: ``One feature which might come in handy is \n     that it is difficult for employees to compare prior pension \n     benefit formulas to the account balance approach.''\n       Asked to comment, the author of that line, Robert S. Byrne \n     of Kwasha Lipton (now a unit of PricewaterhouseCoopers), \n     says, ``Dwelling on old vs. new benefits is probably not \n     something that's a good way to go forward.''\n       At one company, employees did know how to make comparisons. \n     When Deloitte & Touche started putting a cash-balance plan in \n     place last year, some older actuaries rebelled. The firm \n     eventually allowed all who had already been on the staff when \n     the cash-balance plan was adopted to stick with the old \n     benefit if they wished.\n\n\n                           Struggle at Chase\n\n       At Chase Manhattan Corp., two executives in the private-\n     banking division hired an actuary and calculated that their \n     future pensions had fallen 45% as a result of a conversion to \n     a cash-balance plan by Chase predecessor Chemical Bank. ``I \n     would have had to work about 10 more years before I broke \n     even and got a payout equal to my old pension,'' says one of \n     the executives, John Healy, now 61.\n       He and colleague Nathan Davi say that after seven years of \n     their complaints, Chase agreed to give each a pension lump \n     sum of about $487,000, which was roughly $72,000 more than \n     what they would have received under the new cash-balance \n     plan. Although a Chase official initially said the bank had \n     ``never given any settlement to any employee over the bank's \n     pension plans,'' when told about correspondence about the \n     Healy-Davi case, Chase said that a review had determined that \n     about 1,000 employees could be eligible for additional \n     benefits. ``We amended the plan so that it would cover all \n     similarly situated employees,'' a spokesman said.\n       How many quiet arrangements have been reached is unknown. \n     But employees are currently pressing class-action suits \n     against Georgia-Pacific Corp. and Cummins Engine Co.'s Onan \n     Corp. subsidiary, alleging that cash-balance plans illegally \n     reduce pensions. (Both defendants are fighting the suits.) \n     Judges have recently dismissed similar suits against Bell \n     Atlantic Corp. and BankBoston N.A.\n\n\n                           Concern at the IRS\n\n       Not aware of any of this ferment, Mr. Bruggeman in August \n     1998 filed his multiple-spreadsheet analysis of the CSW cash-\n     balance plan with the IRS and the Labor Department, asking \n     them for a review. Soon after, he says, a manager in CSW's \n     benefits department called him in and ``wanted to know what \n     it would take for me to drop all this.'' The answer wasn't to \n     be ``grandfathered'' and exempted from the new plan. ``I told \n     him all I want is for the company to . . . be fair to \n     employees,'' he says, ``It's the principle of the thing.''\n       The manager couldn't be reached for comment, but a CSW \n     official says the company takes complaints ``very seriously \n     and they're thoroughly investigated. In every part of this \n     type of investigation an employee is interviewed by a company \n     representative, and in every initial interview the employee \n     is asked for suggestions on what might be a preferred \n     solution.''\n       Even without Mr. Bruggeman's input, the IRS has a lot of \n     cash-balance data on its plate. The agency is swamped with \n     paper-work from hundreds of new plans seeking its approval, \n     and applications are piling up. The delay is due in part to \n     concern at the IRS that such plans may violate various \n     pension laws, according to a person familiar with the \n     situation. Meanwhile, the consulting firms that create the \n     plans for companies are lobbying for exemptions from certain \n     pension rules.\n       They say they aren't worried. That's because ``companies \n     who now have these plans are sufficiently powerful, \n     sufficiently big and have enough clout that they could get \n     Congress to bend the law . . . to protect their plans,'' says \n     Judith Mazo, a Washington-based senior vice president for \n     consulting firm Segal Co. Regulators, meanwhile, are playing \n     catch-up. Bottom line, Ms. Mazo says: ``The plans are too big \n     to fail.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From ``Morning Edition,'' Feb. 1, 1999]\n\n       Pros and Cons of Cash Balance Plans for Retirement Savings\n\n       Bob Edwards, host. This is NPR's ``Morning Edition.'' I'm \n     Bob Edwards.\n       A new type of pension program is becoming popular with the \n     nation's top employers. The program is called the cash \n     balance plan. It's an innovative and complicated type of \n     retirement account suitable for today's modern work force, \n     especially many young mobile employees. And that's the \n     problem. Critics warn cash balance plans benefit the young at \n     the expense of older, longtime workers. NPR's Elaine Korry \n     reports.\n       Elaine Korry reporting. The traditional pension plan so \n     widespread a generation ago essentially promised long-term \n     employees a secure monthly income when they reached \n     retirement age. Eric Lofgren (ph), head of the benefits \n     consulting group (ph) at Watson Wyatt (ph), says that type of \n     pension made sense when people worked at the same job for \n     decades. But, he says, great changes in the workplace have \n     made those plans obsolete.\n       Mr. Eric Lofgren (Benefits Consulting Group, Watson Wyatt). \n     The traditional plan does a very good job for about one \n     person out of 20. But for the rest of us who have changed \n     jobs a couple times in our career, the traditional plan \n     really doesn't deliver, because it rewards long career with \n     one employer and that just isn't the situation for most \n     people.\n       Korry. The response of many large employers--so far about \n     300 of them--has been to quietly switch to a new plan that \n     turns the traditional pension on its head. Lofgren, who helps \n     companies formulate these new cash balance plans, says they \n     spread the wealth around so more employees prosper, perhaps \n     19 out of 20. But that's not the only reason companies are \n     lining up to make the switch. Edgar Pouk (ph), a New York \n     pension law attorney, says that the real winners in these \n     plan conversions are the employers.\n       Mr. Edgar Pouk (Pension Law Attorney). They stand to gain \n     by the change, and so they're trying to sell it, and they \n     sell it by emphasizing the advantages of the conversion for \n     younger workers, but not explaining the drawbacks, and \n     serious drawbacks, for older workers.\n       Korry. In fact, says Pouk, switching to a cash balance plan \n     can cost older employees tens of thousands of dollars, a loss \n     they may never figure out. This stuff is so technical, many \n     pension experts don't understand it, let alone the average \n     employee. In simple terms, here's what happens: Pension \n     regulations permit companies to use two different interest \n     rates when calculating the value of the old pension vs. the \n     opening balance of the new one. Employers usually choose the \n     formula that favors them, even though it leaves older workers \n     worse off. A pension balance of, say, $100,000 under the old \n     plan might be worth only $70,000 when converted to a cash \n     balance plan. Right there, the older worker is down 30 grand.\n       It gets worse. For some accounting purposes, the employer \n     can treat the $70,000 as if it were 100 grand. Then the \n     employer can freeze the account until the employee works the \n     five to 10 years it can take to make up the difference. Edgar \n     Pouk says the contributions the company doesn't have to make \n     during that time add up quickly.\n       Mr. Pouk. You're talking about tens of thousands of dollars \n     for each worker. You multiply that by thousands of workers \n     and the employer saves millions of dollars.\n       Korry. Often older workers don't know what happened. Some \n     employers, however, are careful to point out the differences. \n     Then older workers have a choice. They can recoup their \n     losses, but only by quitting, in which case they would \n     receive a lump-sum payment equal to their old balance. So \n     cash balance plans may be an inducement for older workers to \n     leave. Olivia Mitchell (ph), head of the Pension Research \n     Council at the Wharton School, says recent changes in labor \n     and law have given older workers many more job protections \n     than before, so employers are resorting to creative ways to \n     ease their older worker force out.\n       Ms. Olivia Mitchell (Pension Research Council, Wharton \n     School). They may be downsizing, they may be looking for a \n     different type of employee, perhaps with different skills, \n     and so they're taking the cash balance plan as one of many \n     human resource policies to essentially restructure the work \n     force. So it's seen as a tool toward that end.\n       Korry. Companies that convert to cash balance plans can \n     level the playing field so that all employees benefit. Some \n     companies will guarantee their older workers a higher rate of \n     return or allow them to keep the old plan until they retire. \n     But those are voluntary measures that eat up the cost \n     savings. For now, regulators have not caught up with the \n     growing momentum toward the new plans. But according to \n     attorney Edgar Pouk, employers who don't protect their older \n     workers are running the risk of landing in court.\n       Mr. Pouk. When you have a number of years where the older \n     worker receives no additional benefits that a plan is illegal \n     per se, because federal law prohibits zero accruals for any \n     year of participation.\n       Korry. So far, the Internal Revenue Service has not given \n     its blessing to cash balance plans. Employers have mounted an \n     intense lobbying effort to win a safe harbor within pension \n     law. On the other side, employees at a few large companies \n     have lawsuits pending against the conversions, and some \n     congressional leaders have expressed concern. Staffers on the \n     Senate Finance Committee are considering legislation that \n     would at least require employers to spell out what a pension \n     conversion would mean for older workers. Elaine Korry, NPR \n     News, San Francisco.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Dorgan):\n  S. 1301. A bill to provide reasonable and non-discriminatory access \nto buildings owned or used by the Federal government for the provision \nof competitive telecommunications services by telecommunications \ncarriers; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              competitive access to federal buildings act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with Senators \nLott, Hollings, and Dorgan, a bill to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment stands behind its pledge to foster true competition in the \nprovision of local telecommunications services.\n  While competition in the local telecommunications sector is growing, \nnew\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nentrants using terrestrial fixed wireless or satellite services lack of \nthe significant advantages of incumbent local exchange carriers when it \ncomes to gaining access to many buildings. This is particularly true \nwhen it comes to access to rooftops and to the internal risers and \nconduits linking the rooftop to the basement, where the access point to \nthe internal phone wiring is usually located.\n  In some instances these wireless local carriers are welcomed by \nbuilding owners and landlords with open arms; however, more often than \nnot they meet resistance, are rejected, or just plain ignored. I \nbelieve the Federal Government should do more to ensure a level playing \nfield for these new entrants to compete on.\n  Our bill is designed to spur competition and to hopefully save \ntaxpayer dollars. We focus in this legislation only upon buildings \nowned by the Federal Government or where the Federal Government is a \nlessee.\n  The inspiration of this bill comes from States which have moved to \nencourage access by competitors. Connecticut and Texas have both \nenacted measures to promote nondiscriminatory access by \ntelecommunications carriers to rooftops, risers, conduits, utility \nspaces, and points of entry and demarcation in order to promote the \ncompetitive provision of telecommunications and information services.\n  This bill takes a similar approach to that enacted by the States, and \nrequires that nondiscriminatory access be provided to all \ntelecommunications carriers seeking to provide service to federally-\nowned buildings and buildings in which Federal agencies are tenants. \nThe National Telecommunications and Information Administration of the \nDepartment of Commerce, the NTIA, which is the Agency that coordinates \ntelecommunications policy for Federal agencies, is tasked with \nimplementing this requirement.\n\n  Building owners can easily meet the requirements of this bill. They \ncan either certify that they are already bound to provide \nnondiscriminatory access under State law or they can commit in writing \nthat they will provide such access as a matter of contract.\n  This bill does not mandate that every building must use the services \nof these new competitors. What it does say is that the Federal \nGovernment should lead by example.\n  This bill does not mandate a takings. Owners and operators can charge \na nondiscriminatory fee for the rooftop and conduit space these \ntechnologies use to provide local service--which I am encouraged to say \nis quite small.\n  Owners and operators may impose reasonable requirements to protect \nthe safety of the tenants and the condition of the property.\n  Any damage caused as a result of installing these services will be \nborne by the telecommunications carrier.\n  The carriers must pay for the entire cost of installing, operating, \nmaintaining, and removing any facilities they provide.\n  The bill will not adversely impact the ability of Federal agencies to \nobtain office space. Federal agency heads may waive the requirements of \nthis bill if enforcement of the bill would result in the agency being \nunable to obtain suitable space in a geographic area.\n  The President may also waive the nondiscriminatory access provisions \nfor any building if they are determined to be contrary to the interests \nof national security.\n  I look forward to working with NTIA, the General Services \nAdministration, and private building owners who have a leasing \nrelationship with the Federal Government to carry out the purpose of \nthis bill.\n  My goal is to ensure that the Federal Government sets a good example. \nI hope it will become the standard in the private sector. Businesses \nshould demand that building owners provide every opportunity for \ncompetitive choice in telecommunications providers.\n  Access to Federal buildings or a building that is housing Federal \nworkers should be encouraged. This bill is a further step in \nimplementing the promise of the Telecommunications Act which Congress \nenacted.\n  It will help ensure that telecommunications providers can compete \nfairly on the basis of the cost and quality of the services provided.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Competitive Access to \n     Federal Buildings Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) non-discriminatory access to, and use of, the rooftops, \n     risers, telephone cabinets, conduits, points of entry or \n     demarcation for internal wiring, and all utility spaces in or \n     on federal buildings and commercial property is essential to \n     the competitive provision of telecommunications services and \n     information services;\n       (2) incumbent telecommunications carriers often enjoy \n     access to such buildings and property through historic rights \n     of way that were developed before the advent of new means of \n     providing such services, in particular the provision of such \n     services using terrestrial fixed wireless or satellite \n     services that enter a building through equipment located on \n     rooftops;\n       (3) the National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration is the Federal agency tasked with developing \n     policies for the efficient and competitive use of emerging \n     technologies that combine spectrum use with the convergence \n     of communications and computer technologies for the \n     utilization of telecommunications services and information \n     services by federal agencies;\n       (4) that several States, for example Connecticut and Texas, \n     have already enacted measures to promote non-discriminatory \n     access by telecommunications carriers to rooftops, risers, \n     conduits, utility spaces, and points of entry and demarcation \n     in order to promote the competitive provision of \n     telecommunications services and information services; and\n       (5) that the Federal government should encourage States to \n     develop similar policies by establishing as federal policy \n     requirements to promote non-discriminatory access to Federal \n     buildings and commercial property used by agencies of the \n     Federal government so that taxpayers receive the benefits and \n     cost savings from the competitive provision of \n     telecommunications services and information services by \n     telecommunications carriers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in this \ntribute to Rabbi Moshe Sherer. To all of us who knew him and worked \nwith him, Rabbi Sherer was a great friend, a great leader, and a great \nchampion of democracy and freedom.\n  Rabbi Sherer was an inspiration to all of us, especially in his work \non immigration and religious freedom. He worked skillfully and \ntirelessly to free prisoners of conscience in the former Soviet Union, \nto reunite divided families, and to protect freedom of religion across \nthe globe.\n  Even in the darkest hours of communism, Rabbi Sherer was an eloquent \nadvocate for the right of the oppressed to leave the Soviet Union. He \nhad an enduring belief that the freedom to emigrate to escape \npersecution is one of the most basic and fundamental human rights.\n  As the President of Agudath Israel of America for over three decades, \nRabbi Sherer was instrumental in developing that organization into a \npowerful force for justice in our nation and across the world. He \ninspired us all with his generous spirit of tolerance, his \nextraordinary knowledge and understanding, and his deep commitment to \nhuman rights and religious freedom.\n  We are fortunate to have worked with Rabbi Sherer, and we mourn his \nloss. His brilliant legacy will continue to be an inspiration for \nfuture generations. We miss his leadership and we miss his \nfriendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7829-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7829-S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JUVENILE CRIME IN AMERICA\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support \nfor the recent passage by the Senate of S. 254, the ``Violent and \nRepeat Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999.''\n  One of the most complex issues facing our society is how communities \nconfront the troubling trends in violent crime committed by young \npeople. In particular, the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado \nunderscores that all elements of our society, including parents, faith-\nbased organizations, local officials, educators, students, and law \nenforcement officials should be encouraged to work together to develop \ninnovative and effective solutions to reducing and preventing violent \nacts committed by our nation's youth.\n  In 1997, young people under the age of eighteen represented 17 \npercent of all violent arrests; 50 percent of all arson arrests; 37 \npercent of burglary arrests; and 14 percent of murder arrests. Overall \nin 1997, law enforcement agencies made approximately 2.8 million \narrests of persons under the age of eighteen. These sobering statistics \nindicate the need to combat youth violence in America to ensure that \nthe young offenders of today do not become the career criminals of \ntomorrow.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to have voted for passage of S. 254, \nthe ``Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \nRehabilitation Act.'' I believe that many of the provisions within this \nlegislation will hold violent juvenile offenders accountable for their \nactions and also integrate many young offenders back into their \ncommunities. We should all recognize that federal legislation is not a \n``silver bullet'' solution to the problem of youth violence, and that \nour response to this epidemic is only one aspect of nationwide efforts \nto reduce and prevent violent juvenile crime.\n  Among its most significant provisions, this bipartisan legislation \nwill provide assistance to Minnesota and other states to help develop \nlocal programs that hold young criminal offenders accountable for their \nactions, including such reforms as drug testing offenders upon arrest; \nimplementing graduated sanction programs for repeat offenders; and \nbuilding detention facilities for juvenile offenders. Equally \nimportant, states will also be empowered to prevent juvenile \ndelinquency through initiatives such as one-on-one mentoring programs \naimed toward at-risk juveniles and providing treatment for juveniles \nwho suffer from substance abuse.\n  Mr. President, this measure also addresses an area of increasing \nconcern to communities in my home state of Minnesota--gang violence. \nToday, there are more than 12,000 gang members in Minnesota, the \nnation's tenth-highest level of gang participation.\n  Throughout Minnesota, many communities have developed programs to \nstop the spread of gang activity, including the ``South Metro Gang and \nYouth Violence Project'' sponsored by Carver, Dakota and Scott \ncounties. Among its achievements, this project has developed a \ncomputerized database to identify gang members, established a telephone \nhotline for graffiti removal, and formed the ``South Metro Gang Task \nForce,'' through which law enforcement agencies meet monthly to share \ninformation regarding gang activity in their jurisdictions. Through \neducation, training and other community initiatives, this program has \nbegun to tackle the threat of gang and youth violence.\n  In my view, the federal government can supplement local anti-gang \ninitiatives by vigorously enforcing federal laws designed to combat \ninterstate gang crime. The anti-gang provisions within S. 254 will also \nhelp to deter gang involvement by imposing stiff penalties on anyone \nwho recruits a minor to become a member of a criminal street gang, or \nwho uses a minor to distribute illegal drugs or participate in crimes \nof violence--common activities of gangs. By imposing enhanced penalties \non those who wear body armor during crimes and prohibiting violent \nfelons from owning body armor, we will also help to protect the lives \nof law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line each day \nprotecting our communities from the threat of gang violence.\n  As someone who has always supported the important role of local \ncommunities in developing anti-crime strategies, I am pleased that the \nSenate modified this legislation to encourage the active role of State \nAdvisory Groups (SAGs) as part of the juvenile justice system. I am \nhopeful that the conference report to this legislation will preserve \nthe same level of responsibility for SAGs as provided under current \nlaw.\n  In my home state, the Minnesota Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee \n(JJAC) is composed of twenty-two individuals appointed by the Governor, \nincluding local prosecutors, students, police chiefs, judges, and state \nagency personnel, representative of communities throughout Minnesota. \nIn 1998, JJAC awarded more than $1 million in federal funds to \ncommunity-based organizations, schools, Indian reservations, and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to help develop effective and innovative \njuvenile offender programs. Statewide, more than 40,000 youth and their \nfamilies were served by local programs identified and evaluated by JJAC \nlast year. I ask that a list of the Minnesota Juvenile Justice Advisory \nCommittee membership and a letter to me from the JJAC Vice-Chair be \nincluded as part of the Record following my remarks.\n  Mr. President, over the last several months, I have given careful \nthought to the aspects of our society that may contribute to incidents \nof juvenile crime, including the influence of the entertainment \nindustry upon young people. My concerns are underscored by a recent e-\nmail I received from Andrew Backenstross, a young Minnesotan and Boy \nScout who is working on his Citizenship in the Nation merit badge in \nthe community of White Bear Lake.\n  Andrew wrote, ``All my teachers say that school should be a safe \nplace to go and study. But Colorado and other places show us how \nexposed we are and that it could happen to us. Public schools need to \nbe able to discipline or remove anyone who is not a threat or will not \nmeet standards. Metal detectors, searches and police walking the halls \nis not the answer. That was not needed when my Dad went to school. \nPeople thought differently. We have to ask, what has changed? Maybe we \nare being conditioned for violence.\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\n  ``My parents have taught me about standards, acceptable behavior and \nrespect for myself and others. Maybe more help could be given to \nparents to be parents. Maybe if they didn't have to give so much of \ntheir income away in taxes they could afford to stay home and be \nparents.''\n\n  In response to the concerns expressed by young people such as Andrew, \nand thousands of parents, I am pleased that the Senate bill encourages \nthe entertainment industry to voluntarily establish guidelines to \nreduce violence in motion pictures, television programming, video \ngames, and music lyrics. The bill also encourages Internet Service \nProviders (ISPs) to provide filtering software to consumers that could \nblock juvenile access to unsuitable material. These provisions will \nprovide parents with the tools needed to reduce their children's \nexposure to the culture of violence.\n  Mr. President, there were several amendments offered to this \nlegislation that would impose additional restrictions upon lawful \nAmericans, without contributing to a reduction in juvenile crime. \nThroughout the debate over these proposals, I urged the Senate to \npromote greater enforcement of our existing firearms laws before \npassing new gun control measures that would infringe upon the \nconstitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. I am very concerned that \nprosecutions of those who violate federal firearms laws have been far \nless zealous than what the American people deserve and expect.\n  According to the Executive Office of the United States Attorney, \nthere were only eight prosecutions in 1998 of those who violated the \nfederal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone. From 1996 \nthrough 1998, there was only one prosecution of felons who have been \ndenied the purchase of firearms after being subjected to a background \ncheck. These statistics underscore the reality that passing new, \nexpansive gun control laws will not prevent violent crime or the \nillegal use of firearms.\n  As an alternative to far-reaching gun control proposals, I supported \nan amendment that encouraged the enforcement of existing gun laws, the \nrights of law-abiding citizens, and keeping firearms from children and \ncriminals. This proposal provided $50 million to hire additional \nfederal prosecutors to prosecute those who violate our gun laws; a \nprospective ban on juveniles convicted of violent offenses from ever \nowning a firearm; and enhanced penalties for juveniles who illegally \nbring a gun or ammunition to school with the intent of possessing or \nusing the firearm to commit a violent crime.\n  Additionally, this proposal requires all firearms transactions at gun \nshows to be subject to the National Instant Check System (NICS) without \nsubjecting law-abiding purchasers to unnecessary fees or record-keeping \nrequirements. Importantly, this provision preserves legitimate business \ntransactions at gun shows while also addressing the public safety \nconcerns of millions of Americans. In my view, this proposal was more \nreasonable than a more-restrictive proposal by Senator Lautenberg that \nwas later passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Senate passage of this bill is an \nimportant contribution to the national response to youth violence. The \n106th Congress should seize the opportunity to pass meaningful and \nbalanced legislation that will encourage local solutions to the complex \nproblem of juvenile crime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7830-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF SISTER JANE FRANCIS BRADY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Sister \nJane Francis Brady, who is retiring after 30 years at St. Joseph's \nHospital and Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey. For 27 of those \nyears, Sister Jane served as the hospital's President and Chief \nExecutive Officer. This not only is a well-deserved public tribute, but \nalso a very personal tribute. Paterson is my hometown, and St. Joseph's \nHospital has been an institution both literally and figuratively for \ngenerations of Paterson families, including my own. To thousands of \npeople in New Jersey and the region, she is ``Sister Jane'' and the \nhospital is ``St. Joe's.'' They are a union that has put quality and \nhope into so many lives.\n  For many people in the Paterson area, Sister Jane has been the soul, \nthe spirit and the face of healthcare. I have been privileged to work \nwith her on a number of projects that have expanded St. Joe's to meet \nthe continually growing needs of the surrounding community. Under \nSister Jane's stewardship, St. Joseph's Hospital has become a focus of \nwellness care and training--the source for preventive, primary and \nemergency health services, and for more general education and \ncounseling.\n  Sister Jane's curriculum vitae is stellar. She has held the highest \nadvisory positions on healthcare, serving as Vice-Chair of the New \nJersey Commission on Legal and Ethical Problems in the Delivery of \nHealth Care; on New Jersey's Health Care Administration Board; on the \nSEEDCO Board of Trustees of New York; on the Leadership Task Force on \nHealth Policy Reform of the Catholic Health Association of the United \nStates; and on the Board of Trustees of the Catholic Health Association \nof the U.S.\n  She has been recognized for her contributions by numerous \norganizations, receiving, among others, the Paterson Community Service \nAward; the Citation of Merit from the NJ Association of Nonprofit Homes \nfor the Aging; the Paterson Community Support Fund Humanitarian Award; \n``Woman of the Year'' awards from the American Legion, the Paterson \nBoys and Girls Club, the NJ State Organization of Cystic Fibrosis, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, and Passaic County Community College; the \nFelician College Founders Day Award; the Paterson Historic Preservation \nCommission's Heritage Award; and the Palestinian Heritage Foundation \nHumanitarian Award.\n  Sister Jane's retirement presents a huge challenge. We have the \nlegacy of her intellect and passion; we have the solid foundation of \nher three decades of guidance; we have her enduring vision; but we will \nneed an extraordinary talent to fill the void she leaves.\n  The best tribute we can give, the tribute we owe to Sister Jane, is \nthe promise and commitment to find the best way to give the best \nhealthcare to the most people. That was what she did. That was her gift \nof faith and strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7830-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SESQUICENTENNIAL OF McDONALD COUNTY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this weekend will be doubly special \nfor the residents of McDonald County in my home state of Missouri. On \nMarch 3, 1849, McDonald county was established by the State Legislature \nand named after Revolutionary War hero Alexander McDonald. Not only \nwill this weekend mark the 223rd anniversary of the founding of our \ncountry, but it is also the formal celebration of the 150th anniversary \nof the founding of McDonald County.\n  McDonald County has a distinguished history, including a gold rush in \nthe last century. McDonald County was also the site for the filming of \na 1938 movie about Jesse James starring Tyrone Power, Randolph Scott, \nand Henry Fonda. More recently, every Christmas the Post Office in the \ncity of Noel receives thousands of cards to receive the stamp of ``The \nChristmas City.'' McDonald County is also a major economic force in the \nstate of Missouri, ranking first in agricultural sales, due to their \n$50 million poultry industry.\n  I join the citizens of McDonald County in celebrating this milestone \nin their history. I take great pride in recognizing this historic event \nand wish McDonald County prosperity in the next 150 years that is even \ngreater than the last. Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues in the \nSenate join me in recognizing the sesquicentennial of McDonald \nCounty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7830-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE\n\n Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, in the June edition of Leatherneck \nmagazine, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Charles Krulak, \nquotes his father as saying: ``The American people believe that Marines \nare downright good for the country.'' I agree with The Commandant's \nfather. And I am pleased General Krulak also holds that well founded \nopinion. The United States Marine Corps is collectively good for this \ncountry, and the services of individual marines such as General Krulak \nare a big part of that positive contribution made by the Corps.\n  Unfortunately, the title of the article in which General Krulak \nquoted his father was ``A farewell to the Corps.'' General Krulak will \nbe retiring after four years from his position as Commandant at the end \nof this month. I would like to thank him for his service and efforts on \nbehalf of his Corps and his nation.\n  Although I have been on the Armed Services Committee a short six \nmonths, I have had several good experiences with the Commandant.\n  I think the most notable was in May of this year, when a large group \nof my constituents were taking a tour of the Pentagon, and the \nCommandant invited them into his office. He said then that he usually \ntries to do something similar--bring tourists into his personal \noffice--everyday. I do not think Krulak was fully aware of what he was \ngetting himself into, but all fifty or so crowded their way into his \noffice, and listened while he spoke about the Corps, the moving of his \noffice down from the `barbed wire surrounded hill of the Naval Annex' \nto the corridors of the Pentagon, and the Corps' efforts and ability to \nturn young men and women into marines.\n  Let me tell you, they were impressed. They were impressed with his \nposition, they were impressed with his efforts, they were impressed \nwith his commitment, and they were impressed with the man.\n  I have also had correspondence with General Krulak relating to our \nwork on S.4, and for the process of preparing the defense \nauthorization. He consistently strikes me as a man who is well aware of \nthe challenges his position holds, and works to meet them. He has been \nstraightforward and dependable. Hearing testimony from him at committee \nhearings is always a pleasure. He does not rattle off bland platitudes. \nI felt that I could always rely on his opinion to be the truest \npossible interpretation of the situation, and one that held the best \ninterests of the country at the foremost.\n  Let me end by repeating: General Krulak has been fundamentally good \nfor this country. I wish him well in whatever new course he sets for \nhimself.\n  Also, I would like to welcome General James Jones into his role as \nthe 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. I have met with him only very \nbriefly, but I look forward to working with him. I am sure he will \nfollow in the able footsteps of all the past United States Marines \nCorps Commandants, and serve the Marines and America admirably.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7831-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, over the Memorial Day weekend, a \nseries of events and memorial services were held in Indianapolis \nhonoring our nation's Medal of Honor winners. Nearly 100 of all of the \nliving Medal of Honor recipients came to Indiana to participate in the \nceremonies as honored guests. In addition to paying tribute to these \nheroes and celebrating their remarkable accomplishments with a healthy \ndose of Hoosier hospitality, a new memorial to the Medal of Honor \nwinners was dedicated. This memorial is only one of its kind in the \nnation. All of this was made possible by countless numbers of \nvolunteers who worked tirelessly to carry out this program that was \ninitiated and undertaken by IPALCO Enterprises of Indianapolis.\n  Following this remarkable weekend. I received a letter from Major \nGeneral Robert G. Moorhead, USA (Ret.), who through his words captured \nthe sentiments of many of my State who were a part of these historic \nand moving events.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask that an excerpt from General \nMoorhead's letter be printed in the Record.\n  The excerpt follows.\n\n       As the last days of the 20th century continue to unfold, \n     Memorial Day weekend in the capital of Indiana was one to \n     remember. Nearly 100 Medal of Honor recipients were guests \n     for a series of stirring tributes. These included a solemn \n     Memorial Service; the dedication of the only memorial to \n     recipients of the Medal of Honor; grand marshals in the \n     IPALCO 500 Festival Parade; an outdoor concert by the \n     Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra; and a parade lap around the \n     famed Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval prior to the start of \n     the race.\n       As the 20th century draws to a close, many wonder if the \n     nation has lost sight of the sacrifices which have been made \n     to preserve freedom. After this Memorial Day weekend in \n     Indianapolis, my heart remains swollen with pride in our land \n     and my fellow citizens. The reception given these ordinary \n     men who did extraordinary things can never be equaled.\n       I am especially proud of the untold hundreds of volunteers \n     who gave of their time and talent to make these events \n     possible. Memorial Day Weekend 1999 did much to convince me \n     that our nation's freedom loving spirit is alive and well. It \n     also underscored the true meaning of ``Hoosier Hospitality.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                            MG Robert G.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the outstanding \nachievement of the students of Central High School from Cheyenne, \nWyoming in the national finals of We The People . . . The Citizen and \nthe Constitution program. They recently made a trip to the Nation's \nCapital to participate in a mock congressional hearing where they \nplayed the role of constitutional experts testifying before a panel of \njudges. Their fellow students at Central High, their families and \nfriends, along with the people of Cheyenne and the entire state of \nWyoming are very proud of these students who spent long hours studying \nthe Constitution and the related court cases to be able to answer \ndetailed and complex questions about the Constitution that would \nnormally be considered by the Supreme Court.\n  Guided by their teacher, Donald Morris, these students took on the \ndifficult task of competing against 1,250 other students from across \nthe nation. They worked together for a whole semester to master the ins \nand outs of the Constitution and the Supreme Court cases that set \nimportant precedents. In doing so they learned a great deal about the \nvalue of friendship and the importance of teamwork. I hope that more \nschools in Wyoming and around the nation take advantage of the We The \nPeople program.\n  When I was a Boy Scout back in Sheridan, Wyoming, I earned my \nCitizenship in the Nation merit badge by creating a series of charts \nshowing the system of checks and balances contained in the \nConstitution. Although it did not occur to me at the time, I am sure \npart of me was inspired and wanted to get more involved in government \nand our democratic process. Now I am a part of that system that relies \nso heavily on the Charters of Freedom that were crafted with such \ndiligence by our Founding Fathers. I hope that a love of the \nConstitution, the law and our nation's history will similarly inspire \nall our young people to become more involved in their government and by \nso doing take hold of the reins on their future.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize these students by \nname.

Mr. President, most of my colleagues in this body, \nI'm sure, remember my predecessor, Hank Brown. He represented me for 10 \nyears as the Congressman from Colorado's 4th district, and I had the \nfurther privilege of working with him during my 6 years in the House. \nSince he retired from this body in 1996, I have relied on\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nhis knowledge and experience. As you might know, Senator Brown is now \nPresident Brown, the head of the University of Northern Colorado, in \nGreeley, the Senator's hometown.\n  Recently, President Brown spoke at the Colorado Prayer Luncheon in \nDenver. He spoke on God's love, and our role in this world. His \nthoughts are, as always, particularly insightful and relevant.\n  I ask to have these inspirational words printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow.\n\n            Remarks of Hank Brown, Colorado Prayer Luncheon\n\n       Ladies and Gentlemen, today is a day of renewal. It is a \n     renewal of our commitment to our Maker as well as a renewal \n     of our commitment to each other. The fact that so many \n     different faiths join together in this luncheon is a sign of \n     our commitment to each other's religious freedom.\n       The incomprehensible tragedy at Columbine is on all of our \n     minds. It will reshape our lives as well as the families of \n     the victims. Its impact will be with us for many years.\n       Next month it will be 46 years since my brother died in a \n     gun accident. He was only 16--not much younger than the \n     children who were murdered at Columbine. The other day my \n     mother said to me that not a day goes by that she doesn't \n     think of him and miss him. I suspect that the parents and \n     loved ones of the victims at Columbine will be the same. The \n     memory of those children will be with them every day for the \n     rest of their lives.\n       How do we explain it? How do you reconcile the tragedy in \n     your own mind?\n       We believe our God is good, we believe our God, is love, we \n     believe our God is all-powerful and capable of controlling \n     everything. How could something this evil be allowed to \n     happen? It's not a new question. It's been with mankind \n     throughout history.\n       A few thousand years ago, a fellow by the name of Job had \n     the same questions. He was devout, religious and pious. He \n     was committed to carrying on the work of his Lord, yet great \n     tragedies were visited upon him. He lost his home. He lost \n     his fortune. He lost his health. He even lost his beloved \n     children. But he didn't lose his faith. And throughout it, he \n     asked ``Why?'' Was he being tested? Was he being punished? \n     I'm not sure we know. His friends came and talked to him, and \n     they suggested that he must be being punished, that he must \n     have done something wrong. And yet, of course Job hadn't. He \n     hadn't been evil; he hadn't sinned. He'd kept the faith. The \n     attitude of his friends perhaps is parallel to the way many \n     of us think. It is natural to think that if we are good, if \n     we follow the rules, if we observe the mandates, good things \n     will happen to us. And yes, if we sin, we'll be punished. And \n     yet, Job hadn't sinned. I don't pretend to know the answer. \n     But I want to speculate with you this afternoon, and I want \n     to suggest that part of the answer lies in God's purpose for \n     our lives in this world.\n       What if this earthly existence is not intended to be a \n     paradise? What if our Maker's real kingdom is not of this \n     world? What if the purpose of our earthly existence is to \n     train us, to prepare us, to test us--not for this world, but \n     for the next? What if the commandments of Moses and the \n     admonition to love each other is not a checklist for \n     prosperity in this world, but guidance for how we'll \n     behave when we truly accept grace? Not a way to earn \n     grace, but what we'll do if we accept it. What if those \n     commandments are the best advice in history on how to live \n     a joyous life and find happiness on earth? It's a \n     different thought, isn't it? If it's so, then our earthly \n     existence may not be about earning our way to heaven or \n     even enjoying a perfect life on earth. It may be about \n     learning and preparing for the next life.\n       Parents face every day, something of the challenge that our \n     Lord must experience. How do you prepare children for life? \n     We love our children more than life itself. Do we do their \n     homework for them? Perhaps some of you have faced that \n     question. If you don't help them with their homework, they \n     may fail and they may not have the chances you hope for them. \n     But the story doesn't end there. If you do it for them, what \n     do they learn? How do they learn that they have to prepare in \n     advance for the next time? How have you helped them learn a \n     lesson for life?\n       Growing up, I couldn't understand my mother. How could she \n     be so tough? She never once bought the stories I brought home \n     about how everyone did it, how it must be OK because everyone \n     else got by with it. In fact, she was never even tempted by \n     them. I recall a series of incidents of her forcing me to \n     confess my sins--once to a storeowner a few blocks from here \n     where I'd taken some gum, once to my grandmother, once at \n     school. Those forced confessions resulted in unbelievable \n     embarrassment. How could she do such a thing? If I wanted \n     something, her answer was, ``I'll help you find a job.'' I \n     worked 20-40 hours a week while I was in high school, and, in \n     the summers I had one or two full-time jobs, depending on the \n     summer. My parents were divorced. She worked full-time. She \n     didn't have a lot of time to supervise me. But her strength \n     was to keep me busy, and she kept me so busy I almost stayed \n     out of trouble. As I look back, I wonder whether I have been \n     near as good a parent as she was.\n       I will never forget the Clarence Thomas hearings, and I \n     suspect some of you may have that feeling as well. One of the \n     instances I recall was a question posed by a senator--a \n     person of great integrity--who had very strong doubts about \n     Clarence Thomas' judicial philosophy. When his turn came to \n     ask questions, the senator said, ``Clarence Thomas, I see two \n     Clarence Thomas's, not just one. I see one that seems so \n     kind, generous, thoughtful and warm. And then I see one that \n     is mean, cruel and hard. Which one are you?'' Justice Thomas \n     responded immediately. He said, ``There is only one Clarence \n     Thomas. And I am him. I used to wonder how my uncle could \n     pretend to care for me so much and be so hard on me. It \n     wasn't until later that I learned that he was the one who \n     loved me the most.''\n       I wonder if our Lord has in mind to prepare us for a life \n     to come. Could tragedies and trials in this life prepare us \n     for the next? It's a question worth asking. The year my \n     brother died, I was 13. My grandfather gave me a book, It was \n     written by Woodrow Wilson. It was a wonderful little book \n     called ``When a Man Comes To Himself.'' It had as strong an \n     influence on me as any book I've read. Wilson, as you know, \n     was an idealist. In the book he talks about what the real \n     joys in life are. He observes that the real pay one gets from \n     a job is not the paycheck at the end of the month, although \n     that's important. The real joy comes from what you do. A \n     bricklayer or carpenter can drive through town and see the \n     homes they've built providing shelter and warmth for \n     families. Others can look at the work they've done and see \n     how it impacts lives and changes the people they know. \n     Wilson's thesis was that you are what you do with your life. \n     You've seen those ads where they say you are what you eat. I \n     sincerely hope that's not true. His thesis was that you are \n     the role you play among your fellows. If that's true, ask \n     what your life amounts to. Wilson's thought was that we are \n     the sum total of how we help each other and the role we play \n     amongst others. Perhaps that's a good guide for us to \n     evaluate what we do in life. It's also a pretty good guide to \n     examine whether you've found the real joy in life.\n       I don't know the answer to Job's question. Like you, I am \n     troubled by the events and the currents of evil in the world. \n     I, like you, suspect that our responsibility is to do what we \n     can to make sure the tragedy never happens again. I'm not \n     sure there's a surefire formula to prevent disasters. But I \n     do believe that the freedom God gives us to live our lives \n     and make our choices surely must be designed to prepare us \n     for another world and help us understand that we have a role \n     in making this world better. If we learn from this, and all \n     of us go forth determined to make a difference from this \n     moment on, the tragedy, in one way, will have served to make \n     our world a better one.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/29/senate-section/article/S7832-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7832-S7833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GUIDANCE FOR THE DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCIES AS A PART OF THE BUDGET \n                       PROCESS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
