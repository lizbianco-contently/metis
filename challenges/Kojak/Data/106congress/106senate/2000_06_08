We are making progress on this bill.\n  I inquire first of the Chair with regard to time allocations. I \nbelieve, under the previous order, 1 hour has been reserved for the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts, to be assigned at some \npoint today; is that not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I inquire further about the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Robert Smith. I believe he has 30 minutes, and again \nthat is an undesignated time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think there are other designations of time we should \nrecite.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma has 10 minutes; \nSenator Snowe from Maine has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. If those Senators will counsel with the managers, we are \ngoing to do everything we can to arrange for their recognition at a \ntime mutually convenient.\n  I see the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts on the \nfloor.

PHILIP A. SMITH\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am delighted to welcome Father Philip \nSmith, the president of Providence College, our guest Chaplain.\n  Providence College is an extraordinary institution in my home State \nof Rhode Island. It is a place where many of my neighbors and friends \nhave been educated. More than that, it has been a source of strength, \npurpose, and inspiration for the whole community. Father Smith is the \n11th president of Providence College and has been a paramount leader \nboth for his institution and for the State of Rhode Island.\n  Providence College is a Dominican college, a college committed to not \nonly developing the minds but the character of its students. Its leader \nis a theologian, a scholar, and a leader in his own right. His \nleadership is not simply intellectual; he is a leader of integrity and \nof commitment.\n  Rhode Island is proud of Providence College, and particularly proud \nof the president of Providence College, Rev. Philip Smith. It was an \nhonor to have him in the Chamber today to lead us in prayer. I thank \nhim and I commend him. I wish him well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, at this juncture I ought to ask to associate \nmyself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. \nHe has spoken eloquently about Father Philip Smith and his wonderful \nleadership at Providence College.\n  I am honored to be a graduate of Providence, as was my father. I have \nfond memories of my years there, as my father did in his undergraduate \ndays.\n  Father Smith led this institution most admirably during his tenure. \nWe are delighted and honored he is performing the duties of assistant \nchaplain here today. I commend him for his opening prayer.\n  The Dominican priests are known as the order of preachers, Mr. \nPresident. Certainly Father Smith eloquently displayed that historic \nreputation of the Dominican order. The lives of the students who have \nattended Providence College have been so admirably altered as a result \nof the education of this wonderful institution. I know they join me in \nexpressing our gratitude, not only to Father Smith but the faculty and \nadministrator and others over the years who provided literally \nthousands of students and families with a wonderful educational \nopportunity in liberal arts, medicine and health, a very diverse \nacademic curricula that is offered at Providence College. But also as \nmy colleague from Rhode Island has adequately and appropriately \nidentified, it is the spiritual leadership as well which we appreciate \nimmensely.\n\n  It is truly an honor to welcome Father Smith to this Chamber, to \nthank him for his words, and to wish him and the entire family of \nProvidence College the very best in the years to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4722-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4722-S4809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, I would \nlike to pose a unanimous consent request with regard to the sequencing \nof speakers.\n  We have the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who has, under a \nprevious order, 1 hour. I suggest he be the first and lead off this \nmorning, followed by the distinguished Senator from Maine, the chair of \nthe Senate Seapower Subcommittee, and that would be for a period of 30 \nminutes thereafter. Following that, the distinguished ranking member \nand I have some 30 cleared amendments which we will offer to the Senate \nfollowing these two sets of remarks.\n  Then Senator Smith; as soon as I can reach him, I will sequence him \nin.\n  I just inform the Senate I will be seeking recognition to offer an \namendment on behalf of Senator Dodd and myself, and I will acquaint the \nranking member with the text of that amendment shortly.\n  Just for the moment, the unanimous consent request is the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, followed by the Senator from Maine followed by a \nperiod of time, probably not to exceed 30 minutes, for the ranking \nmember and myself to deal with some 30-odd amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would add the following: It is my \nunderstanding of the unanimous consent agreement that recognition of \nthe speakers who are listed here with a fixed period of time, including \nSenator Kerry, Senator Smith, Senator Snowe, and Senator Inhofe, is \nsolely for the purpose of debate and not for the purpose of offering an \namendment. Is the Senator correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir courtesy and I appreciate the time of the Senate to be able to \ndiscuss an issue of extraordinary importance. It is an issue that is \ncontained in this bill. It is a line item in this bill of some $85 \nmillion with respect to the issue of national missile defense.\n  President Clinton has just returned from his first meeting with the \nnew Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and arms control dominated their \nagenda, in particular, the plan of the United States to deploy a \nlimited national defense system, which would require amending the 1972 \nABM Treaty. Russia is still strongly opposed to changing that treaty, \nand I think we can all expect this will continue to be an issue of \ngreat discussion between the United States and Russia in the months and \npossibly years to come.\n  As I said, in the Senate today, this defense bill authorizes funding \nfor the construction of the national missile defense initial deployment \nfacilities. Regretfully, we do not always have the time in the Senate \nto lay out policy considerations in a thorough, quiet, and thoughtful \nway, and I will try to do that this morning. The question of whether, \nwhen, and how the United States should deploy a defense against \nballistic missiles is, in fact, complex--tremendously complex. I want \nto take some time today to walk through the issues that are involved in \nthat debate and to lay bare the implications it will have for the \nnational security of the United States.\n  No American leader can dismiss an idea that might protect American \ncitizens from a legitimate threat. If there is a real potential of a \nrogue nation, as we call them, firing a few missiles at any city in the \nUnited States, responsible leadership requires that we make our best, \nmost thoughtful efforts to defend against that threat. The same is true \nof the potential threat of accidental launch. If ever either of these \nthings happened, no leader could explain away not having chosen to \ndefend against such a disaster when doing so made sense.\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n  The questions before us now are several. Does it make sense to deploy \na national missile defense now, unilaterally, if the result might be to \nput America at even greater risk? Do we have more time to work with \nallies and others to find a mutually acceptable, nonthreatening way of \nproceeding? Have the threats to which we are responding been \nexaggerated, and are they more defined by politics than by genuine \nthreat assessment and scientific fact? Have we sufficiently explored \nvarious technologies and architectures so we are proceeding in the most \nthoughtful and effective way?\n  The President has set out four criteria on which he will base his \ndecision to deploy an NMD: The status of the threat, the status and \neffectiveness of the proposed system's technology, the cost of the \nsystem, and the likely impact of deploying such a system on the overall \nstrategic environment and U.S. arms control efforts in general. In my \njudgment, at this point in time none of these criteria are met to \nsatisfaction.\n  While the threat from developing missile programs has emerged more \nquickly than we expected, I do not believe it justifies a rush to \naction on the proposed defensive system, which is far from \ntechnologically sound and will probably not even provide the \nappropriate response to the threat as it continues to develop. More \nimportantly, a unilateral decision of the United States to deploy an \nNMD system could undermine global strategic stability, damage our \nrelationship with key allies in Europe and Asia, and weaken our \ncontinuing efforts to reduce the nuclear danger.\n  Turning first to the issue of the threat that we face, this question \ndeserves far greater scrutiny than it has thus far received. I hear a \nnumber of colleagues, the State Department, and others, saying: Oh, \nyes, the threat exists. Indeed, to some degree the threat does exist. \nBut it is important for us to examine to what degree. Recently, the \ndecades-long debate on the issue of deploying an NMD has taken on \nbipartisan relevance as the threat of a rogue ballistic missile program \nhas increased.\n\n  I want to be very clear. At this point, I support the deployment, in \ncooperation with our friends and allies, of a limited, effective \nNational Missile Defense System aimed at containing the threat from \nsmall rogue ballistic missile programs or the odd, accidental, or \nunauthorized launch from a major power. But I do not believe the United \nStates should attempt to unilaterally deploy a National Missile Defense \nSystem aimed at altering the strategic balance. We have made tremendous \nprogress over the last two decades in reducing the threat from weapons \nof mass destruction through bilateral strategic reductions with Russia \nand multilateral arms control agreements such as the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. We simply cannot allow these efforts to be undermined in \nany way as we confront the emerging ballistic missile threat.\n  Even as we have made progress with Russia on reducing our cold war \narsenals, ballistic missile technology has spread, and the threat to \nthe United States from rogue powers, so-called, has grown. The July \n1998 Rumsfeld report found that the threat from developing ballistic \nmissile states, especially North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, is developing \nfaster than expected and could pose an imminent threat to the U.S. \nhomeland in the next 5 years. That conclusion was reinforced just 1 \nmonth later when North Korea tested a three-stage Taepo Dong-1 missile, \nlaunching it over Japan and raising tensions in the region. While the \nmissile's third stage failed, the test confirmed that North Korea's \nprogram for long-range missiles is advancing towards an ICBM capability \nthat could ultimately--and I stress ultimately--threaten the United \nStates, as surely as its shorter range missiles threaten our troops and \nour allies in the region today.\n  A 1999 national intelligence estimate on the ballistic missile threat \nfound that in addition to the continuing threat from Russia and China, \nthe United States faces a developing threat from North Korea, Iran, and \nIraq.\n  In addition to the possibility that North Korea might convert the \nTaepo Dong-1 missile into an inaccurate ICBM capable of carrying a \nlight payload to the United States, the report found that North Korea \ncould weaponize the larger Taepo Dong-2 to deliver a crude nuclear \nweapon to American shores, and it could do so at any time, with little \nwarning. The NIE also found that, in the next 15 years, Iran could test \nan ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to the United States--and \ncertainly to our allies in Europe and the Middle East--and that Iraq \nmay be able to do the same in a slightly longer time frame.\n  The picture of the evolving threat to the United States from \nballistic missile programs in hostile nations has changed minds in the \nSenate about the necessity of developing and testing a national missile \ndefense. It has changed my mind about what might be appropriate to \nthink about and to test and develop.\n  If Americans in Alaska or Hawaii must face this threat, however \nuncertain, I do not believe someone in public life can responsibly tell \nthem: We will not look at or take steps to protect you.\n  But as we confront the technological challenges and the political \nramifications of developing and deploying a national missile defense, \nwe are compelled to take a closer look at the threat we are rushing to \nmeet. I believe the missile threat from North Korea, Iran, and Iraq is \nreal but not imminent, and that we confront today much greater, much \nmore immediate dangers, from which national missile defense cannot and \nwill not protect us.\n  To begin, it is critical to note that both the Rumsfeld Commission \nand the National Intelligence Estimate adopted new standards for \nassessing the ballistic missile threat in response to political \npressures from the Congress.\n  The 1995 NIE was viciously criticized for underestimating the threat \nfrom rogue missile programs. Some in Congress accused the \nadministration of deliberately downplaying the threat to undermine \ntheir call for a national missile defense.\n  To get the answer that they were looking for, the Congress then \nestablished the Rumsfeld Commission to review the threat. Now, that \ncommission was made up of some of the best minds in U.S. defense \npolicy--both supporters and skeptics of national missile defense. I do \nnot suggest the commission's report was somehow fixed. These are people \nwho have devoted their lives in honorable service to their country. The \nreport reflects no less than their best assessment of the threat.\n  But in reaching the conclusions that have alarmed so many about the \nimmediacy of the threat, we must responsibly take note of the fact that \nthe commission did depart from the standards that we had traditionally \nused to measure the threat.\n  First, the commission reduced the range of ballistic missiles that we \nconsider to be a threat from missiles that can reach the continental \nUnited States to those that can only reach Hawaii and Alaska.\n  I think this is a minor distinction because, as I said earlier, no \nresponsible leader is going to suggest that you should leave Americans \nin Hawaii or Alaska exposed to attack. But certainly the only reason to \nhit Hawaii or Alaska, if you have very few weapons measured against \nother targets, is to wreak terror. And insomuch as that is the only \nreason, one has to factor that into the threat analysis in ways they \ndid not.\n  Secondly, it shortened the time period for considering a developing \nprogram to be a threat from the old standard which measured when a \nprogram could actually be deployed to a new standard of when it was \nsimply tested.\n  Again, I would be willing to concede this as a minor distinction \nbecause if a nation were to be intent on using one of these weapons, it \nmight not wait to meet the stringent testing requirements that we \nusually try to meet before deploying a new system. It could just test a \nmissile, see that it works, and make plans to use it.\n  These changes are relatively minor, but they need to be acknowledged \nand factored into the overall discussion.\n  But the third change which needs to be factored in is not \ninsignificant because both the Rumsfeld Commission and the 1999 NIE \nabandoned the old standard of assessing the likelihood that a nation \nwould use its missile capacity in favor of a new standard of whether a \nnation simply has the relevant capacity for a missile attack,\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nwith no analysis whatsoever of the other factors that go into a \ndecision to actually put that capability to use.\n\n  This is tremendously important because, as we know from the cold war, \nthreat is more than simply a function of capability; it is a function \nof attention and other political and military considerations. Through \ndiplomacy and deterrence, the United States can alter the intentions of \nnations that pursue ballistic missile programs and so alter the threat \nthey pose to us.\n  This is not simply wishful thinking. There are many examples today of \nnations who possess the technical capacity to attack the United States, \nbut whom we do not consider a threat. India and Pakistan have made \ndramatic progress in developing medium-range ballistic missile \nprograms. But the intelligence community does not consider India and \nPakistan to pose a threat to U.S. interests. Their missile capacity \nalone does not translate into a threat because they do not hold \naggressive intentions against us.\n  Clearly, North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are hostile to us, and our \nability to use diplomacy to reduce the threat they pose will be \nlimited. But having the capacity to reach us and an animosity towards \nus does not automatically translate into the intention to use weapons \nof mass destruction against us.\n  In the 40 years that we faced the former Soviet Union, with the raw \ncapability to destroy each other, neither side resorted to using its \narsenal of missiles. Why not? Because even in periods of intense \nanimosity and tension, under the most unpredictable and isolated of \nregimes, political and military deterrence has a powerful determining \neffect on a nation's decision to use force. We have already seen this \nat work in our efforts to contain North Korea's nuclear and missile \nprograms. We saw it at work in the gulf war when Saddam Hussein was \ndeterred from using his weapons of mass destruction by the sure promise \nof a devastating response from the United States.\n  During the summer of 1999, intelligence reports indicated that North \nKorea was preparing the first test-launch of the Taepo Dong-2. Regional \ntensions rose, as Japan, South Korea and the United States warned \nPyongyang that it would face serious consequences if it went ahead with \nanother long-range missile launch. The test was indefinitely delayed, \nfor ``political reasons,'' which no doubt included U.S. military \ndeterrence and the robust diplomatic efforts by the United States and \nits key allies in the region.\n  Threatening to cut off nearly $1 billion of food assistance and KEDO \nfunding to North Korea should the test go forward, while also holding \nout the possibility of easing economic sanctions if the test were \ncalled off, helped South Korea, Japan and the United States make the \ncase to Pyongyang that its interests would be better served through \nrestraint. An unprecedented dialogue between the United States and \nNorth Korea, initiated by former Secretary of Defense William Perry \nduring the height of this crisis, continues today. It aims to \nverifiably freeze Pyongyang's missile programs and end 50 years of \nNorth Korea's economic isolation.\n  Acknowledging that these political developments can have an important \nimpact on the threat, the intelligence community, according to a May 19 \narticle in the Los Angeles Times, will reflect in its forthcoming NIE \nthat the threat from North Korea's missile program has eased since last \nfall. And if it has eased since last fall, indeed, we should be \nthinking about the urgency of decisions we make that may have a \nprofound impact on the overall balance of power.\n  In short, even as we remain clear-eyed about the threat these nations \npose to American interests, we must not look at the danger as somehow \npreordained or unavoidable.\n  In cooperation with our friends and allies, we must vigorously \nimplore the tools of diplomacy to reduce the threat. We must redouble \nour efforts to stop the proliferation of these deadly weapons. We \ncannot just dismiss the importance of U.S. military deterrence.\n\n  Only madmen, only the most profoundly detached madmen, bent on self-\ndestruction, would launch a missile against U.S. soil, which obviously \nwould invite the most swift and devastating response. One or two or \nthree missiles fired by North Korea or Iraq would leave a clear address \nof who the sender was, and there is no question that the United States \nwould have the ability to eliminate them from the face of this planet. \nAll people would recognize that as an immediate and legitimate \nresponse.\n  My second major concern about the current debate over the missile \nthreat is that it does nothing to address equally dangerous but more \nimmediate and more likely threats to U.S. interests.\n  For one, U.S. troops and U.S. allies today confront the menace of \ntheater ballistic missiles, capable of delivering chemical or \nbiological weapons. We saw during the gulf war how important theater \nmissile defense is to maintaining allied unity and enabling our troops \nto focus on their mission. We must continue to push this technology \nforward regardless of whether we deploy an NMD system.\n  The American people also face the very real threat of terrorist \nattack. The 1999 State Department report on Patterns of Global \nTerrorism shows that while the threat of state-sponsored terrorism \nagainst the U.S. is declining, the threat from nonstate actors, who \nincreasingly have access to chemical and biological weapons, and \npossibly even small nuclear devices, is growing. These terrorist groups \nare most likely to attack us covertly, quietly slipping explosives into \na building, unleashing chemical weapons into a crowded subway, or \nsending a crude nuclear weapon into a busy harbor.\n  An NMD system will not protect American citizens from any of these \nmore immediate and more realistic threats.\n  Finally, on the issue of the missile threat we are confronting, I \nremain deeply concerned about Russia's command and control over its \nnuclear forces. Russia has more than 6,000 strategic missiles armed \nwith nuclear warheads. Maintaining these missiles on high alert \nsignificantly increases the threat of an accidental or an unauthorized \nlaunch. In 1995, the Russian military misidentified a U.S. weather \nrocket launched from Norway as a possible attack on the Russian \nFederation. With Russia's strategic forces already on high-alert, \nPresident Yelstin and his advisors had just minutes to decide whether \nto launch a retaliatory strike on the United States. And yet, in an \neffort to reassure Russia that the proposed missile defense will not \nprompt an American first strike, the administration seems to be \nencouraging Russia to, in fact, maintain its strategic forces on high \nalert to allow for a quick, annihilating counterattack that would \noverwhelm the proposed limited defense they are offering.\n  In effect, in order to deploy the system the administration is \ncurrently defining, they are prepared to have Russia, maintain with a \nbad command-and-control system weapons on hair trigger or targeted in \norder to maintain the balance.\n  In sum, the threat from rogue missile programs is neither as imminent \nnor is as mutable as some have argued. We have time to use the \ndiplomatic tools at our disposal to try to alter the political \ncalculation that any nation might make before it decided to use \nballistic missile capacity.\n  Moreover, the United States faces other, more immediate threats that \nwill not be met by an NMD. To meet the full range of threats to our \nnational security, we need to simultaneously address the emerging \nthreat from the rogue ballistic missile program, maintain a vigorous \ndefense against theater ballistic missiles and acts of terrorism, and \navoid actions that would undermine the strategic stability we have \nfought so hard to establish.\n  Let me speak for a moment now about the technology. In making his \ndeployment decision, the President will also consider the technological \nreadiness and effectiveness of the proposed system. Again, I have grave \nconcerns that we are sacrificing careful technical development of this \nsystem to meet an artificial deadline, and, may I say, those concerns \nare shared by people far more expert than I am. Moreover, even if the \nproposed system were to work as planned, I am not convinced it would \nprovide the most effective defense against a developing missile threat.\n  Let's look for a moment at the system currently under consideration. \nThe\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nadministration has proposed a limited system to protect all 50 States \nagainst small-scale attacks by ICBMs. In the simplest terms, this is a \nground-based, hit-to-kill system.\n  An interceptor fired from American soil must hit the incoming missile \ndirectly to destroy it. Most of the components of this system are \nalready developed and are undergoing testing. It will be deployed in 3 \nphases and is to be completed by about 2010, if the decision to deploy \nis made this year. The completed system will include 200, 250 \ninterceptors deployed in Alaska and North Dakota, to be complemented by \na sophisticated array of upgraded early-warning radars and satellite-\nbased launch detection and tracking systems. I have two fundamental \nquestions about this proposed system: Will the technology work as \nintended, and is the system the most appropriate and effective defense \nagainst this defined threat?\n  There are three components to consider in answering the first \nquestion: The technology's ability to function at the most basic level, \nits operational effectiveness against real world threats, and its \nreliability.\n  I do not believe the compressed testing program and decision deadline \npermit us to come close to drawing definitive conclusions about those \nthree fundamental elements of readiness.\n\n  In a Deployment Readiness Review scheduled for late July of this \nyear, the Pentagon will assess the system, largely on the results of \nthree intercept tests. The first of these in October of 1999 was \ninitially hailed as a success because the interceptor did hit the \ntarget, but then, on further examination, the Pentagon conceded that \nthe interceptor had initially been confused, it had drifted off course, \nultimately heading for the decoy balloon, and possibly striking the \ndummy warhead only by accident. That is test No. 1.\n  The second test in January of 2000 failed because of a sensor coolant \nleak.\n  The third test has not even taken place yet. The third test, \ninitially planned for April 2000, was postponed until late June and has \nrecently been postponed again. It is expected in early July, just a few \nweeks before the Pentagon review.\n  To begin with, after two tests, neither satisfactory, it is still \nunclear whether the system will function at a basic level under the \nmost favorable conditions. Even if the next test is a resounding \nsuccess, I fail to see how that would be enough to convince people we \nhave thoroughly vetted the potential problems of a system.\n  On the second issue of whether the system will be operationally \neffective, we have very little information on which to proceed. We have \nnot yet had an opportunity to test operational versions of the \ncomponents in anything such as the environment they would face in a \nreal defensive engagement. We are only guessing at this point how well \nthe system would respond to targets launched from unanticipated \nlocations or how it would perform over much greater distances and much \nhigher speeds than those at which it has been tested.\n  Finally, the question of reliability is best answered over time and \nextensive use of the system. Any program in its developing stages will \nrun into technical glitches, and this program has been no different. \nThat does not mean the system will not ever work properly, but it does \nmean we ought to take the time to find out, particularly before we do \nsomething that upsets the balance in the ways this may potentially do.\n  That is one more reason to postpone the deployment decision, to give \nthe President and the Pentagon the opportunity to conduct a thorough \nand rigorous testing program.\n  This recommendation is not made in a vacuum. Two independent reviews \nhave reached a similar conclusion about the risks of rushing to \ndeployment. In February of 1998, a Pentagon panel led by former Air \nForce Chief of Staff Gen. Larry Welch, characterized the truncated \ntesting program as a ``rush to failure.'' The panel's second report \nrecommended delaying the decision to deploy until 2003 at the earliest \nto allow key program elements to be fully tested and proven. The \nconcerns of the Welch Panel were reinforced by the release in February \n2000 of a report by the Defense Department's office of operational test \nand evaluation (DOT).\n  The Coyle report decried the undue pressure being applied to the \nnational missile defense testing program and warned that rushing \nthrough testing to meet artificial decision deadlines has \n``historically resulted in a negative effect on virtually every \ntroubled DOD development program.'' The Report recommended that the \nPentagon postpone its Deployment Readiness Review to allow for a \nthorough analysis and clear understanding of the results of the third \nintercept test (now scheduled for early July), which will be the first \n``integrated systems'' test of all the components except the booster.\n  The scientific community is concerned about more than the risks of a \nshortened testing program. The best scientific minds in America have \nbegun to warn that even if the technology functions as planned, the \nsystem could be defeated by relatively simple countermeasures. The 1999 \nNIE that addressed the ballistic missile threat concluded that the same \nnations that are developing long-range ballistic missile systems could \ndevelop or buy countermeasure technologies by the time they are ready \nto deploy their missile systems.\n\n  Just think, we could expend billions of dollars, we could upset the \nstrategic balance, we could initiate a new arms race, and we could not \neven get a system that withstands remarkably simple, inexpensive \ncountermeasures. Now, there is a stroke of brilliant strategic \nthinking.\n  The proposed national missile defense is an exo-atmospheric system, \nmeaning the interceptor is intended to hit the target after the boost \nphase when it has left the atmosphere and before reentry. An IBM \nreleases its payload immediately after the boost phase. If that payload \nwere to consist of more than simply one warhead, then an interceptor \nwould have more than one target with which to contend after the boost \nphase.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists recently published a thorough \ntechnical analysis of three countermeasures that would be particularly \nwell suited to overwhelming this kind of system, chemical and \nbiological bomblets, antisimulation decoys, and warhead shrouds. North \nKorea, Iran, and Iraq are all believed to have programs capable of \nweaponizing chemical and biological weapons which are cheaper and \neasier to acquire than the most rudimentary nuclear warhead.\n  The most effective means of delivering a CBW, a chemical-biological \nwarfare warhead on a ballistic missile, is not to deploy one large \nwarhead filled with the agent but to divide it up into as many as 100 \nsubmunitions, or bomblets. There are few technical barriers to \nweaponizing CBW this way, and it allows the agents to be dispersed over \na large area, inflicting maximum casualties. Because the limited NMD \nsystem will not be able to intercept a missile before the bomblets are \ndispersed, it could quickly be overpowered by just three incoming \nmissiles armed with bomblets--and that is assuming every interceptor \nhit its target. Just one missile carrying 100 targets would pose a \nformidable challenge to the system being designed with possibly \ndevastating effects.\n\n  The exo-atmospheric system is also vulnerable to missiles carrying \nnuclear warheads armed with decoys. Using antisimulation, an attacker \nwould disguise the nuclear warhead to look like a decoy by placing it \nin a lightweight balloon and releasing it along with a large number of \nsimilar but empty balloons. Using simple technology to raise the \ntemperature in all of the balloons, the attacker could make the balloon \ncontaining the warhead indistinguishable to infrared radar from the \nempty balloons, forcing the defensive system to shoot down every \nballoon in order to ensure that the warhead is destroyed. By deploying \na large number of balloons, an attacker could easily overwhelm a \nlimited national missile defense system. Alternately, by covering the \nwarhead with a shroud cooled by liquid nitrogen, an attacker could \nreduce the warhead's infrared radiation by a factor of at least 1 \nmillion, making it incredibly difficult for the system's sensors to \ndetect the warhead in time to hit it.\n  I have only touched very cursorily on the simplest countermeasures \nthat could be available to an attacker with ballistic missiles, but I \nbelieve this discussion raises serious questions about\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\na major operational vulnerability in the proposed system and about \nwhether this system is the best response to the threats we are most \nlikely to face in the years ahead. I don't believe it is.\n  There is a simpler, more sensible, less threatening, more manageable \napproach to missile defense that deserves greater consideration. Rather \nthan pursuing the single-layer exo-atmospheric system, I believe we \nshould focus our research efforts on developing a forward-deployed, \nboost phase intercept system. Such a system would build on the current \ntechnology of the Army's land-based theater high altitude air defense, \nTHAAD, and the Navy's sea-based theaterwide defense system to provide \nforward-deployed defenses against both theater ballistic missile \nthreats and long-range ballistic missile threats in their boost phase.\n  The Navy already deploys the Aegis fleet air defense system. An \nupgraded version of this sea-based system could be stationed off the \ncoast of North Korea or in the Mediterranean or in the Persian Gulf to \nshoot down an ICBM in its earliest and slowest stage. The ground-based \nTHAAD system could be similarly adapted to meet the long-range and \ntheater ballistic missile threats. Because these systems would target a \nmissile in its boost phase, they would eliminate the current system's \nvulnerability to countermeasures. This approach could also be more \nnarrowly targeted at specific threats and it could be used to extend \nballistic missile protection to U.S. allies and to our troops in the \nfield.\n  As Dick Garwin, an expert on missile defense and a member of the \nRumsfeld Commission has so aptly argued, the key advantage to the \nmobile forward-deployed missile defense system is that rather than \nhaving to create an impenetrable umbrella over the entire U.S. \nterritory, it would only require us to put an impenetrable lid over the \nmuch smaller territory of an identified rogue nation or in a location \nwhere there is the potential for an accidental launch. A targeted \nsystem, by explicitly addressing specific threats, would be much less \ndestabilizing than a system designed only to protect U.S. soil. It \nwould reassure Russia that we do not intend to undermine its nuclear \ndeterrent, and it would enable Russia and the United States to continue \nto reduce and to secure our remaining strategic arsenals. It would \nreassure U.S. allies that they will not be left vulnerable to missile \nthreats and that they need not consider deploying nuclear deterrents of \ntheir own. In short, this alternative approach could do what the \nproposed national defense system will not do: It will make us safer.\n  There are two major obstacles to deploying a boost phase system, but \nI believe both of those obstacles can and must be overcome. First, the \ntechnology is not yet there. The Navy's theaterwide defense system was \ndesigned to shoot down cruise missiles and other threats to U.S. \nwarships. Without much faster intercept missiles than are currently \navailable, the system would not be able to stop a high speed ICBM, even \nin the relatively slow boost phase. The THAAD system, which continues \nto face considerable challenges in its demonstration and testing \nphases, is also being designed to stop ballistic missiles, but it \nhasn't been tested yet against the kinds of high speeds of an ICBM.\n  Which raises the second obstacle to deploying this system: the \ncurrent interpretation of the ABM Treaty, as embodied in the 1997 \ndemarcation agreements between Russia and the United States, does not \nallow us to test or deploy a theater ballistic missile system capable \nof shooting down an ICBM. I will address this issue a little more in a \nmoment, but let me say that I am deeply disturbed by the notion that we \nshould withdraw from the ABM Treaty and unilaterally deploy an ABM \nsystem, particularly the kind of system I have defined that may not do \nthe job. In the long run, such a move would undermine U.S. security \nrather than advance it. It is possible--and I believe necessary--to \nreach an agreement with Russia on changes to the ABM Treaty that would \nallow us to deploy an effective limited defense system such as I have \ndescribed. In fact, President Putin hinted quite openly at the \npotential for that kind of an agreement being reached. I commend the \nPresident for working hard to reach an agreement with Russia that will \nallow us both to deploy in an intelligent and mutual way that does not \nupset the balance.\n  I want to briefly address the issue of cost, which I find to be the \nleast problematic of the four criterion under consideration. Those who \noppose the idea of a missile defense point to the fact that, in the \nlast forty years, the United States has spent roughly $120 billion \ntrying to develop an effective defense against ballistic missiles. And \nbecause this tremendous investment has still not yielded definitive \nresults, they argue that we should abandon the effort before pouring \nadditional resources into it.\n  I disagree. I believe that we can certainly afford to devote a small \nportion of the Defense budget to develop a workable national missile \ndefense. The projected cost of doing so varies--from roughly $4 billion \nto develop a boost-phase system that would build on existing defenses \nto an estimated $60 billion to deploy the three-phased ground-based \nsystem currently under consideration by the Administration. These \nestimates will probably be revised upward as we confront the inevitable \ntechnology challenges and delays. But, spread out over the next 5 to 10 \nyears, I believe we can well afford this relatively modest investment \nin America's security, provided that our research efforts focus on \ndeveloping a realistic response to the emerging threat.\n  My only real concern about the cost of developing a national missile \ndefense is in the perception that addressing this threat somehow makes \nus safe from the myriad other threats that we face. We must not allow \nthe debate over NMD to hinder our cooperation with Russia, China, and \nour allies to stop the proliferation of WMD and ballistic missile \ntechnology. In particular, we must remain steadfast in our efforts to \nreduce the dangers posed by the enormous weapons arsenal of the former \nSoviet Union. Continued Russian cooperation with the expanded \nComprehensive Threat Reduction programs will have a far greater impact \non America's safety from weapons of mass destruction than deploying an \nNMD system. We must not sacrifice the one for the other.\n  Let me go to the final of the four considerations the President has \nset forward because I believe that a unilateral decision to deploy a \nnational missile defense system would have a disastrous effect on the \ninternational strategic and political environment. It could destabilize \nour already difficult relationships with Russia and China and undermine \nour allies' confidence in the reliability of the U.S. defensive \ncommitment. It would jeopardize current hard fought arms control \nagreements, and it could erode more than 40 years of U.S. leadership on \narms control.\n  The administration clearly understands the dangers of a unilateral \nU.S. deployment. President Clinton was not able to reach agreement with \nthe Russian President, but he has made progress in convincing the \nRussian leadership that the ballistic missile threat is real. To be \nclear, I don't support the administration's current proposal, but I do \nsupport its effort to work out with Russia this important issue. The \nnext administration needs to complete that task, if we cannot do it in \nthe next months.\n  While simply declaring our intent to deploy a system does not \nconstitute an abrogation of the ABM Treaty, it surely signals that the \nU.S. withdrawal from the treaty is imminent.\n  Mr. President, the first casualty of such a declaration would be \nSTART II. Article 2 paragraph 2 of the Russian instrument of \nratification gives Russia the right to withdraw from START II if the \nU.S. withdraws from or violates the 1972 ABM Treaty. Russia would also \nprobably stop implementation of START I, as well as cooperation with \nour comprehensive threat reduction program. I don't have time at this \nmoment to go through the full picture of the threat reduction problems. \nBut suffice it to say that really the most immediate and urgent threat \nthe United States faces are the numbers of weapons on Russian soil with \na command and control system that is increasingly degraded, and the \nsingle highest priority of the United States now is keeping the \ncomprehensive threat reduction program on target. To lose that by a \nunilateral statement of our intention to proceed would be one of the \nmost dramatic losses of the last 40 to 50 years.\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n  So continued cooperation with Russia on these arms control programs \nis critical. Furthermore, no matter how transparent we are with Russia \nabout the intent and capabilities of the proposed system, Russia's \nmilitary leadership will interpret a unilateral deployment as a direct \nthreat to their deterrence capacity. And while Russia doesn't have the \neconomic strength today to significantly enhance its military \ncapabilities, there are clear examples of Russia's capacity to wield \nformidable military power when it wants. We must not allow a unilateral \nNMD deployment to provoke the Russian people into setting aside the \ndifficult but necessary tasks of democratization and economic reform in \na vain effort to return to Russia's days of military glory.\n  Finally, with regard to Russia, a unilateral deployment by the United \nStates would jeopardize our cooperation on a whole range of significant \nissues. However imperfect it is, U.S.-Russian cooperation will continue \nto be important on matters from stopping Teheran's proliferation \nefforts and containing Iraq's weapons programs to promoting stability \nin the Balkans.\n  While the impact of a limited U.S. system on Russian security \nconsiderations would be largely perceptual, at least as long as that \nsystem remains limited, its impact on China's strategic posture is real \nand immediate. China today has roughly 20-plus long-range missiles. The \nproposed system would undermine China's strategic deterrent as surely \nas it would contain the threat from North Korea. And that poses a \nproblem because, unlike North Korea, China has the financial resources \nto build a much larger arsenal.\n  The Pentagon believes it is likely that China will increase the \nnumber and sophistication of its long-range missiles just as part of \nits overall military modernization effort, regardless of what we do on \nNMD. But as with Russia, if an NMD decision is made without \nconsultation with China, the leadership in Beijing will perceive the \ndeployment as at least partially directed at them. And given the recent \nstrain in U.S.-China relations and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait, \nthe vital U.S. national interest in maintaining stability in the \nPacific would, in fact, be greatly undermined by such a decision made \ntoo rashly.\n  Nobody understands the destabilizing effect of a unilateral U.S. NMD \ndecision better than our allies in Europe and in the Pacific. The steps \nthat Russia and China would take to address their insecurities about \nthe U.S. system will make their neighbors less secure. And a new \nenvironment of competition and distrust will undermine regional \nstability by impeding cooperation on proliferation, drug trafficking, \nhumanitarian crises, and all the other transnational problems we are \nconfronting together. So I think it is critical that we find a way to \ndeploy an NMD without sending even a hint of a message that the \nsecurity of the American people is becoming decoupled from that of our \nallies. In Asia, both South Korea and Japan have the capability to \ndeploy nuclear programs of their own. Neither has done so, in part, \nbecause both have great confidence in the integrity the U.S. security \nguarantees and in the U.S. nuclear umbrella that extends over them. \nThey also believe that, while China does aspire to be a regional power, \nthe threat it poses is best addressed through engagement and efforts to \nanchor China in the international community. Both of these assumptions \nwould be undermined by a unilateral U.S. NMD deployment.\n\n  First, our ironclad security guarantees will be perceived by the \nJapanese, by the South Koreans, and others, as somewhat rusty if we \npursue a current NMD proposal to create a shield over the U.S. \nterritory. U.S. cities would no longer be vulnerable to the same \nthreats from North Korea that Seoul and Tokyo would continue to face. \nAnd so they would say: Well, there is a decoupling; we don't feel as \nsafe as we did. Maybe now we have to make decisions to nuclearize \nourselves in order to guarantee our own safety.\n  China's response to a unilateral U.S. NMD will make it, at least in \nthe short term, a far greater threat to regional stability than it \nposes today. If South Korea and Japan change their perceptions both of \nthe threat they face and of U.S. willingness to protect them, they then \ncould both be motivated to explore independent means of boosting their \ndefenses. Then it becomes a world of greater tensions, not lesser \ntensions. It becomes a world of greater hair-trigger capacity, not \ngreater safety-lock capacity.\n  Our European allies have expressed the same concerns about decoupling \nas I have expressed about Asia. We certainly cannot dismiss the \ncalculations that Great Britain, France, and Germany will make about \nthe impact of the U.S. NMD system. But I believe their concerns hinge \nlargely on the affect a unilateral decision would have on Russia, \nconcerns that would be greatly ameliorated if we make the NMD decision \nwith Russia's cooperation.\n  Finally, much has been made of the impact a U.S. national missile \ndefense system would have and what it would do to the international \narms control regime. For all of the reasons I have just discussed, a \nunilateral decision would greatly damage U.S. security interests. I \nwant to repeat that. It will, in fact, damage U.S. security interests.\n  The history of unilateral steps in advancing strategic weapons shows \na very clear pattern of sure response and escalation. In 1945, the \nUnited States exploded the first atomic bomb. The Soviets followed in \n1949. In 1948, we unveiled the first nuclear-armed intercontinental \nbomber. The Soviets followed in 1955. In 1952, we exploded the first \nhydrogen bomb. The Soviets followed 1 year later. In 1957, the Soviets \nbeat us, for the one time, and launched the first satellite into orbit \nand perfected the first ICBM. We followed suit within 12 months. In \n1960, the United States fired the first submarine-launched ballistic \nmissile. The Soviets followed in 1968. In 1964, we developed the first \nmultiple warhead missile and reentry vehicle; we tested the first MIRV. \nThe Soviets MIRVed in 1973, and so on, throughout the cold war, up \nuntil the point that we made a different decision--the ABM Treaty and \nreducing the level of nuclear weapons.\n  The rationale for testing and deploying a missile defense is to make \nAmerica and the world safer. It is to defend against a threat, however \nrealistic, of a rogue state/terrorist launch of an ICBM, or an \naccidental launch. No one has been openly suggesting a public rationale \nat this time of a defense against any and all missiles, such as the \noriginal Star Wars envisioned, but some have not given up on that \ndream. It is, in fact, the intensity and tenacity of their continued \nadvocacy for such a system that drives other people's fears of what the \nU.S. may be up to and which significantly complicates the test of \nselling even a limited and legitimately restrained architecture.\n  Mr. President, in diplomacy--as in life--other nations and other \npeople make policies based not only on real fears, or legitimate \nreactions to an advocacy/nonfriend's actions, but they also make \nchoices based on perceived fears--on worst case scenarios defined to \ntheir leaders by experts. We do the same thing.\n  The problem with unilaterally deployed defense architecture is that \nother nations may see intentions and long-term possibilities that \nnegatively affect their sense of security, just as it did throughout \nthe cold war. For instance, a system that today is limited, but \nexclusively controlled by us and exclusively within our technological \ncapacity is a system that they perceive could be expanded and \ndistributed at any time in the future to completely alter the balance \nof power--the balance of terror as we have thought of it. That may \nsound terrific to us and even be good for us for a short period of \ntime--but every lesson of the arms race for the last 55 years shows \nthat the advantage is short lived, the effect is simply to require \neveryone to build more weapons at extraordinary expense, and the \nadvantage is inevitably wiped out with the world becoming a more \ndangerous place in the meantime. That is precisely why the ABM treaty \nwas negotiated--to try to limit the unbridled competition, stabilize \nthe balance and create a protocol by which both sides could confidently \nreduce weapons.\n\n  The negotiation of the ABM Treaty put an end to this cycle of \nratcheting up the strategic danger. After 20 years of trying to outdo \neach other--building an increasingly dangerous, increasingly unstable \nstrategic environment in the process--we recognized that deploying \nstrategic defenses, far from\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nmaking us safer, would only invite a response and an escalation of the \ndanger. There is no reason to believe that a unilateral move by the \nUnited States to alter the strategic balance would not have the same \naffect today as it had for forty years. At the very least, it would \nstop and probably reverse the progress we have made on strategic \nreductions. And it will reduce our capacity to cooperate with Russia on \nthe single greatest threat we face, which are the ``loose nukes'' \nexisting in the former Soviet Union.\n  Under START I levels, both sides agree to reduce those arsenals to \n6,500 warheads. Under START II, those levels come down to 3,500 \nwarheads. And we are moving toward further reductions in our \ndiscussions on START III, down to 2,000 warheads. With every agreement, \nthe American people are safer. A unilateral withdrawal from the ABM \nTreaty would stop this progress in its tracks. No NMD system under \nconsideration can make us safe enough to justify such a reckless act.\n\n  I strongly disagree with my colleagues who argue that the United \nStates is no longer bound by our legal obligations under the ABM \nTreaty. No president has ever withdrawn us from the Treaty, and \nPresident Clinton has reaffirmed our commitment to it. We retain our \nobligations to the Treaty under international law, and those \nobligations continue to serve us well. It would never have been \npossible to negotiate reductions in U.S. and Soviet strategic forces \nwithout the ABM Treaty's limit on national missile defense. The \nRussians continue to underscore that linkage. And since, as I've \nalready argued, Russia's strategic arsenal continues to pose a serious \nthreat to the United States and her allies, we must not take steps--\nincluding the unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty--that will \nundermine our efforts to reduce and contain that threat.\n  However, the strategic situation we confront today is worlds apart \nfrom the one we faced in 1972, and we must not artificially limit our \noptions as we confront the emerging threats to our security. Under the \nforward-deployed boost-phase system I have described, the United States \nwould need to seek Russian agreement to change the 1997 ABM Treaty \nDemarcation agreements, which establish the line between theater \nmissile defense systems that are not limited by the Treaty and the \nstrategic defenses the Treaty proscribes. In a nutshell, these \nagreements allow the United States to deploy and test the PAC-3, THAAD \nand Navy Theater-Wide TMD systems, but prohibit us from developing or \ntesting capabilities that would enable these systems to shoot down \nICBMs.\n  As long as we are discussing ABM Treaty amendments with Russia, we \nshould work with them to develop a new concept of strategic defense. A \nboost-phase intercept program would sweep away the line between theater \nand long-range missile defense. But by limiting the number of \ninterceptors that could be deployed and working with Russia, China, and \nour allies, so that we move multilaterally, we can maximize the \ntransparency of the system, we can strike the right balance between \nmeeting new and emerging threats without abandoning the principles of \nstrategic stability that have served us well for decades.\n  The most important challenge for U.S. national security planners in \nthe years ahead will be to work with our friends and allies to develop \na defense against the threat that has been defined. But how we respond \nto that threat is critical. We must not rush into a politically driven \ndecision on something as critical as this; on something that has the \npotential by any rational person's thinking to make us less secure--not \nmore secure.\n  I urge President Clinton to delay the deployment decision \nindefinitely. I believe, even while the threat we face is real and \ngrowing, that it is not imminent. We have the time. We need to take the \ntime to develop and test the most effective defense, and we will need \ntime to build international support for deploying a limited, effective \nsystem.\n  I believe that support will be more forthcoming when we are seen to \nbe responding to a changing security environment rather than simply \nbuckling to political pressure.\n  For 40 years, we have led international efforts to reduce and contain \nthe danger from nuclear weapons. We can continue that leadership by \nexploiting our technological strengths to find a system that will \nextend that defense to our friends and allies but not abrogate the \nresponsibilities of leadership with a hasty, shortsighted decision that \nwill have lasting consequences.\n  I hope in the days and months ahead my colleagues will join me in a \nthoughtful and probing analysis of these issues so we can together make \nthe United States stronger and not simply make this an issue that falls \nprey to the political dialog in the year 2000.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaine is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the President.\n  I want to begin my remarks by commending our Chairman, Senator John \nWarner, who has provided extraordinary leadership in crafting this \nmeasure which supports our men and women in uniform with funding for \nthe pay, health care, and hardware that they need and deserve. I can \nthink of no one with greater credibility on these issues or a wider \nbreadth of knowledge, and I thank him for his outstanding efforts.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished ranking member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, Senator Levin, who also has made invaluable \ncontributions to the development of this reauthorization.\n  This critical legislation which we are considering here today, with \nour distinguished chairman, and the bipartisan support of the ranking \nmember, Senator Levin, the senior Senator from Michigan, represents the \ncommittee's response to legitimate concerns and recognizes the \nsacrifices of those who are at the heart of the legislation--the men \nand women who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee and chair of the Seapower \nSubcommittee, I know we must never forget that the men and women in \nuniform are the ones who make our Nation's defense force the finest and \nstrongest in the world, and I salute each of them for their unwavering \nservice.\n  We are honor bound to ensure that they are provided the very best \nequipment, afforded the highest respect, and compensated at a level \ncommensurate with their remarkable service to this Nation. And I \nbelieve this bill reflects those principles.\n  Since the end of the cold war we have reduced the overall military \nforce structure by 36 percent and reduced the defense budget by 40 \npercent--a trend that this bill reverses.\n  And let me say that comes not a moment too soon. Because while the \nsize of our armed services has decreased, the number of contingencies \nthat our service members are called on to respond to has increased in a \nfashion that can only be described as dramatic.\n  In fact, the Navy/Marine Corps team alone responded to 58 contingency \nmissions between 1980 and 1989, while between 1990 and 1999 they \nresponded to 192--a remarkable threefold increase in operations.\n  During the cold war, the U.N. Security Council rarely approved the \ncreation of peace operations. In fact, the U.N. implemented only 13 \nsuch operations between 1948 and 1978, and none from 1979 to 1987. By \ncontrast, since 1988--just twelve years ago--38 peacekeeping operations \nhave been established--nearly three times as many than the previous 40 \nyears.\n  As a result of the challenges presented by having to do more with \nless, the Armed Services Committee has heard from our leaders in \nuniform on how our current military forces are being stretched too \nthin, and that estimates predicted in the fiscal year 1997 QDR \nunderestimated how much the United States would be using our military.\n  I fully support this bill which authorizes $309.8 billion in budget \nauthority, an amount which is consistent with the concurrent budget \nresolution. For the second year in a row--we recognize the shortfall \nand reverse a 14-year decline by authorizing a real increase in defense \nspending. This funding is $4.5 billion above the President's fiscal \nyear 2001 request, and provides a necessary increase in defense \nspending that is vital if we are to meet the national security \nchallenges of the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\n  This bill not only provides funds for better tools and equipment for \nour service men and women to do their jobs but it also enhances quality \nof life for themselves and their families. It approves a 3.7-percent \npay raise for our military personnel as well as authorizing extensive \nimprovements in military health care for active duty personnel, \nmilitary retirees, and their families.\n  As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee, I was particularly interested \nin an article that I read this morning in Defense News titled ``U.S. \nNavy: Stretched Too Thin?'' by Daniel Goure. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Defense News, June 12, 2000]\n\n U.S. Navy: Stretched Thin?--Surging Demands Overwhelm Shrinking Force\n\n                           (By Daniel Goure)\n\n       The term floating around Washington to describe the current \n     state of the U.S. armed forces is overstretched. This means \n     the military is attempting to respond to too many demands \n     with too few forces.\n       Clear evidence of this overstretch was provided by the war \n     in Kosovo. In order to meet the demands posed by that \n     conflict, the United States had to curtail air operations in \n     the skies over Iraq and leave the eastern Pacific without an \n     aircraft carrier.\n       The number of missions the U.S. military has been asked to \n     perform has increased dramatically in the last decade--by \n     some measures almost eight-fold--while the force posture has \n     shrunk by more than a third.\n       In testimony this year before Congress, senior Defense \n     Department officials and the heads of the military services \n     revealed the startling fact that by their own estimates the \n     existing force posture is inadequate to meet the stated \n     national security requirement of being able to fight and win \n     two major theater wars.\n       Nowhere is the problem worse than for the Navy. This is \n     due, in large measure, to the Navy's unique set of roles and \n     missions. Unlike the other services which are now poised to \n     conduct expeditionary warfare based on power projection from \n     the continental United States, the Navy is required to \n     maintain continuous forward presence in all critical regions.\n       The Armed Forces Journal reported that in September 1998, \n     Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations, told the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee that ``On any given day, one-third \n     of the Navy's forces are forward deployed. . . . In addition, \n     it must ensure freedom of the seas and, increasingly, provide \n     time-critical strike assets for operations against the \n     world's littorals under the rubric of operations from the \n     sea.''\n       It should be remembered that the 1999 military strikes \n     against terrorist sites in Afghanistan, which is land-locked, \n     and Sudan, which has coastline only on the Red Sea, was \n     accomplished solely by cruise missiles launched from U.S. \n     Navy ships.\n       Naturally, naval forces are in demand during crisis and \n     conflict and have made significant, and in some instances, \n     singular contributions to military operations in the Balkans \n     and Middle East.\n       In fact, since the end of the Cold War, the Navy has \n     responded to some 80 crisis deployments, approximately one \n     every four weeks, while struggling to maintain forward \n     presence in non-crises regions.\n       So far, the Navy has been able to perform its missions and \n     respond to crises. This is unlikely to remain true in the \n     future. The size of the navy has shrunk by nearly half during \n     the last decade. From a force of well over 500 ships at the \n     end of the Cold War, the navy is reduced to some 300 ships \n     today.\n       The mathematics of the problem are simple: A force half the \n     size attempting to perform eight times the missions has an \n     effective 16-fold increase in its required operational tempo. \n     This increased burden results in longer deployments, reduced \n     maintenance, lower morale and less time on-station. \n     Ultimately, it means that on any given day, there will not be \n     enough ships to meet all the requirements and cover all the \n     crises.\n       The Navy understands the problem. In testimony before the \n     House of Representatives this year. Vice Adm. Conrad \n     Lautenbach, deputy chief of naval operations, stated that \n     ``it is no secret that our current resources of 316 ships is \n     fully deployed and in many cases stretched thin to meet the \n     growing national security demands.''\n       This is not merely the view from the headquarters. Adm. \n     Dennis McGinn, commander Third Fleet, stated in an appearance \n     before Congress in February that ``force structure throughout \n     the Navy is such that an increased commitment anywhere \n     necessitates reduction of operations somewhere else, or a \n     quality of life impact due to increased operating tempo.''\n       Vice Adm. Charles Moore, commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, \n     operating in the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf, told the House \n     Armed Services procurement subcommittee Feb. 29 that \n     ``Although I am receiving the necessary forces to meet Fifth \n     Fleet obligations, the fleet is stretched, and I am uncertain \n     how much longer they can continue to juggle forces to meet \n     the varied regional requirements, including the Fifth \n     Fleet's.\n       ``I am uncertain that we have the surge capability to a \n     major theater contingency, or theater war. Eventually, the \n     increased operational tempo on our fewer and fewer ships will \n     take its toll on their availability and readiness.''\n       The reality is that numbers matter, particularly for naval \n     forces. This is due in part to the tyranny of distance that \n     is imposed on every Navy ship, whether or not it is steaming \n     in harm's way. Deployments to the Persian Gulf, 8,000 miles \n     from the Navy's home ports on both coasts, mean ships must \n     travel from 10 to 14 days just to reach their forward \n     deployed positions.\n       Even deployments from Norfolk, Va., to the Caribbean take \n     several days. The conventional wisdom is that in order to \n     provide adequate rotation and maintain a tolerable \n     operational tempo, an inventory of three ships is required \n     for every one deployed forward.\n       However, when the time required for steaming to and from \n     global deployment areas, maintenance and overhaul, and \n     training and shakedowns are included, the ratio rises to \n     four, five and even six ships to one.\n       As a result of recent events such as Kosovo, in which U.S. \n     naval forces in the western Pacific were stripped of their \n     aircraft carrier in order to support naval operations in the \n     Adriatic, public and congressional attention was focused on \n     the inadequacy of the Navy's inventory of aircraft carriers. \n     The Joint Chiefs of Staff published an attack submarine study \n     that concluded the nation requires 68 attack boats instead of \n     the 50 they had been allowed.\n       Attention is particularly lacking on the Navy's surface \n     combatants. These are the destroyers and cruisers, the \n     workhorses of the Navy. Not only do they protect aircraft \n     carriers and visibly demonstrate forward presence, but due to \n     the advent of precision strike systems and advanced \n     communication and surveillance, increasingly are the \n     principal combat forces deployed to a regional crisis.\n       A recent surface combatant study concluded that the Navy \n     required up to 139 multimission warships to satisfy the full \n     range of requirements and meet day-to-day operations. \n     Instead, the navy has been allowed only 116. At least a \n     quarter of these are aging frigates and older destroyers that \n     lack the modern offensive and defensive capabilities \n     essential to a 21st-century Navy.\n       Speaking about the inadequate number of surface combatants, \n     one senior Navy source cited by Defense News in the Jan. 31 \n     issue said, ``We know we are broken. We are running our ships \n     into the ground, our missions are expanding and our force \n     structure is being driven down to 116 surface ships. We have \n     to address it before we hit the precipice.''\n       To avoid breaking the force, the Navy must increase its \n     number of surface combatants. This also will expand \n     significantly the number of vertical-launch system tubes \n     available in the fleet. The Navy needs to add 15-20 more \n     surface combatants to the fleet during the next decade, \n     beyond the new construction already planned, just to maintain \n     its current operational tempo.\n       In order to meet immediate needs, the Navy must retain \n     older DDG-51s and build more of them. When a new destroyer, \n     the DDG-21, becomes available later in the decade, the Navy \n     would like to purchase an additional 16 ships beyond the 32 \n     they are scheduled to buy.\n       It is time for the administration, Congress and the \n     American people to realize that U.S. national security and \n     global stability could be damaged by no maintaining an \n     adequate Navy.\n       To paraphrase an old rhyme, for want of a surface \n     combatant, forward presence was lost. For want of forward \n     presence, an important ally was lost. For want of an ally, \n     peace in the region was lost. For want of peace, the region \n     itself was lost. And all this for the want of surface \n     combatants.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this article describes the current state of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces and how they are overstretched. This means that \nthe military is attempting to respond to too many demands with too few \nforces. And I quote ``Nowhere is the problem worse than for the Navy.''\n  In the Seapower subcommittee's work this year in review of the fiscal \nyear 2001 budget request we continued the Congress' review of the \nadequacy of Navy and Marine Corps force structure to carry out the \nNational Security Strategy, which we all know has been signed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  This included hearings, visits to fleet units, and discussions with \nthe most junior personnel in the fleet to the highest flag officers and \ncivilian leaders in the Navy and Marine Corps.\n  The subcommittee constructed a firm foundation for review of the \nfiscal year 2001 budget request by requesting operational commanders to \ntestify on their ability to carry out the National Security Strategy.\n  The operational commanders confirmed what my colleagues and I had \nbeen hearing directly from fleet units which included discussions with \nindividual sailors and marines representing\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\na cross section of all ranks. The operational commanders provided \nconvincing evidence that their commands do not have a sufficient number \nof ships and airplanes to carry out the National Security Strategy to \nshape the international environment and respond to crisis within the \nrequired time frame.\n  They further testified that the Navy has reduced the force structure \nto the extent that the brunt of the burden of this inadequate force \nstructure is being borne, in their words, by the men and women in their \ncommands.\n  Simply put, in the words of the Sixth Fleet commander,\n\n       Nine years ago, we never anticipated the environment in \n     which we find ourselves operating. The sense that it was \n     going to be a much easier load, that we might actually be \n     able to take our pack off every now and again prevailed. And \n     it for the most part underpinned the decline in defense \n     spending in my estimation. We were wrong. And the facts have \n     borne that out with ever increasing consistency in those nine \n     years that have occurred.\n\n  And I quote the Second Fleet commander.\n\n       . . . back in the euphoric days at the end of the Cold War \n     as we were drawing down, we actually figured that we would \n     have a window of opportunity here where we could afford to, \n     in fact, decrease structure, turn some of that savings into a \n     long-term recapitalization, maybe forego an upgrade or \n     modernization here and there. And that just has not been the \n     case.\n\n  In this article, Mr. Goure quotes Vice Admiral Charles Moore, \ncommander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, he states ``I am uncertain how much \nlonger they can continue to juggle forces to meet the varied regional \nrequirements.''\n  And he further quotes Vice Admiral Dennis McGinn, commander of the \nThird Fleet, ``that force structure throughout the Navy is such that an \nincreased commitment anywhere necessitates reduction of operations \nsomewhere else, or a quality of life impact due to increased operating \ntempo.''\n  Again, those are the words of our commanders on the front lines \ncharged with carrying out the day-to-day operations of our naval forces \nand to the challenges and requirements around the world.\n  It is noteworthy that these commanders state that the prediction of \nhow much our naval forces could be reduced does not represent the \nreality of what is going on in the world.\n  I have two charts which I think explain graphically the numbers that \nare consistent with the commander's explanations and characterizations \nof the demands that have been placed on them as a result of a reduced \nforce structure, while at the same time increasing the number of \nresponses to contingency operations. Both charts use the same timeframe \nacross the board. The charts track data in 4-year increments starting \nin 1980 and continuing through 1990. Each chart shows the 8 years \nbefore the cold war, 1980 through 1987, then the period between the end \nof the cold war and the beginning of the Quadrennial Defense Review in \nassessing exactly how many ships will be required to meet the security \ndemands around the world. Here we have the ship force structure from \n1980 to 1999.\n  I bring to my colleagues' attention the last 8 years charted in the \ngraphs, the time period between 1992 to 1995, which is before the \nQuadrennial Defense Review; and then in 1996 to 1999, the post \nQuadrennial Defense Review in terms of the number of ships we have. We \nhave the ship force structure on the top chart, and on the bottom chart \nwe have the number of contingency operations during these same time \nperiods. These last two data points in these graphs are significant \nbecause they show the large force structure reductions of over 200 \nships while at the same time the contingencies more than triple, from \n31 to 103.\n  The QDR, we know, developed the exact force structure that was \nnecessary for both the Navy and the Marine Corps in this instance to \nrespond to the number of requirements around the world and what they \nanticipated would be the number of operations around the world. The QDR \nhas anticipated there would be a rise in contingency operations but not \nto the extent to which they have occurred.\n  The first chart shows the ship force structure, the dramatic decline \nin the number of ships, both in decommissioning and in the reduction, \nand the number of new constructions. At its peak during the cold war, \nwe were up to 500, going towards a 600-ship Navy. We can see we had 500 \nships in 1980 to 1983; up to 1988, we had 550 ships. We were building \nup to a 600-ship Navy. We declined to 417 ships at the end of the cold \nwar and, prior to the development of the Quadrennial Defense Review, to \na total of 316 ships. In those 8 short years where we declined from 500 \nships to 316 ships, we had a dramatic increase in the number of \ncontingency operations.\n  The second chart shows during the end of the cold war we had 31 \ncontingency operations, when we had 550 ships. During 1992 and 1995, \nprior to the Quadrennial Defense Review in terms of assessing how many \nships we would need, we had 68 contingency operations and 417 ships. In \nthe post QDR, in 1996 to 1999, we had 103 contingency operations, \ntripling the number we had during the cold war. Yet we only had 316 \nships during this period.\n  This is a dramatic increase in the number of contingency operations. \nWhile we had the highest number of ships, we had the lowest number of \ncontingency operations. While we now have the lowest number of ships, \nwe have the highest number of contingency operations. That is placing \ntremendous pressure on our Armed Forces and our personnel because of \nthe lack of ships to meet those responses. So not only is it a problem \nin trying to meet the demands around the world, but it also is \nproblematic for our men and women in uniform in terms of the quality of \nlife, in terms of morale, in terms of recruitment and retention. That \nis the end result of what is happening. It may be difficult to \nquantify. I think these charts illustrate very clearly the pressures \nthat are being placed on our naval forces and the Marine Corps today.\n  This is a disturbing and alarming trend. I think it does support the \ncommander's testimony that we are being stretched too thin in \nresponding to the increasing number of contingencies while reducing the \nnumber of ships. The assertion that a smaller number of more capable \nships resulting in a stronger Navy is just not being borne out. Some \nwould say it is quality that matters. That may well be true. In fact, \nwe are moving to enhance the quality of the ships in the future.\n  As the commanders have told us time and again and repeatedly in \ntestimony before the Seapower Subcommittee, numbers do count. Quantity, \nas one commander said, is a quality all its own. One ship, even though \nit is more capable than three ships it replaces, cannot cover two \ngeographic areas at once. The fact is, we found that out during the \ncourse of the Kosovo campaign and the onset of the Kosovo campaign. In \nfact, General Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander, had requested an \naircraft carrier presence in the Adriatic. It took 2 weeks before we \nwere able to have an aircraft carrier in the Adriatic, 2 weeks into the \nKosovo conflict.\n\n  We heard in testimony before the Seapower Subcommittee from Vice \nAdmiral Murphy, who is commander of the 6th Fleet, who told us that:\n\n     . . . if we had a Navy air wing--\n\n  And I am using his words--\n\n     in the fight from day one, we could only speculate as to the \n     difference the naval air would have made in the first 2 weeks \n     but I believe it would have been substantial.\n\n  In his words, he said it would have been substantial. It could have \nmade a difference, having that airpower there from day one of the \nKosovo conflict. But that did not happen. It took 2 weeks.\n  In the meantime, we left a gap in the Pacific command. We left the \nPacific command without an aircraft carrier because we had to cover the \nPersian Gulf and, of course, meet the demands in Kosovo. That is what \nhappens when we are stretched too thin and we do not have the number of \nships to meet our responsibilities around the world.\n  As I said in the course of my discussion this morning, the fact is, \nthe demands being placed on our naval forces and the Marine Corps are \nbecoming greater and greater. Yet the number of ships to meet those \ndemands is becoming fewer. So the question becomes, How many ships? \nThat is a good question, one we are striving to answer. Have we gone \ntoo far in bringing down\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nthe number of ships to 300? The operational commanders will tell us \nyes. Without a doubt, due to the high operational tempo that is \nreflected in this chart, as we have seen, tripling the number of \ncontingency operations compared to where we were during the cold war, I \nwould have to agree. We have had 103 contingency operations during the \nperiod of 1996 to 1999, with 316 ships. Yet during the cold war period, \nduring a 9-year period, we only had 31. So obviously the demands are \ngreater.\n  I think we have to make some decisions about where we need to go in \nthe future. As the commander of the 6th Fleet testified, again during \nthe course of his testimony, he said:\n\n       Numbers count. If there is an insufficiency of numbers, by \n     the time you figure it out, it is usually too late.\n\n  So these shortcomings become a concern, as I say, leaving gaps, for \nexample, in the Pacific command, not being able to respond to the \nSupreme Allied Commander by having an aircraft carrier for the duration \nof the entire conflict because we don't have enough ships; or because \nof the impact on the men and women because of the extended deployments, \nbecause of the quality of life, because of the recruitment and \nretention problems and the soaring cost of contingency operations--it \nis having an impact across the board. So, yes, there are higher risks \nin all respects. We have to address those risks.\n  We are trying. As chair of the Seapower Subcommittee and member of \nthe overall committee, we have been asking for a report from the \nPentagon as to what is their long-term shipbuilding plan that will \nascertain exactly how many ships will be required to respond to these \ndemands.\n  Senator Robb of Virginia had included an amendment to the Defense \nauthorization last year that asked for this long-term shipbuilding \nplan. The statutory requirement included a deadline of February of this \nyear for the Pentagon to submit this report to the committee and to the \nCongress. They have failed to meet this prescribed statutory \nrequirement of this analysis so the committee could make some decisions \nfor the long term because it is not easy to shift these decisions when \nit comes to shipbuilding. It takes 5 to 6 years, on average, to \nconstruct a ship.\n  If we are going to reverse some of the trends that are already \ninherent in the budgets that have been submitted by the Pentagon, and \nif we are going to respond to those shifts, it is going to take a \nrequired lead time to make those changes. Yet the Defense Department \nhas not submitted this analysis that was required under the law by \nFebruary of this year. We have asked time and again; we have submitted \nletters to the Pentagon. I plan to hold a hearing to find out exactly \nwhy this report has not been submitted to the committee so we, in turn, \ncan make the decisions, evaluate the analysis, and make some changes \nfor the future.\n  If we are being told by the top civilian and military leadership of \nthe Navy and Marine Corps that they are being stretched too thin, even \nwith today's force structure of about 316 ships, then we are required \nto make some decisions about the future. They have confirmed time and \nagain the predicted operating tempo of the Quadrennial Defense Review \nupon which this force structure of 316 ships is being based is \ndifferent, quite different from what is occurring around the world. In \nfact, in regard to the QDR, the Navy's Deputy Chief of Naval Operations \nfor Resources, Warfare Requirements and Assessments testified:\n\n       . . . prognostications for the future were different than \n     the reality has turned out in the last few years . . . we \n     need to build higher number of ships than we are building \n     today.\n\n  Other witnesses have also confirmed the budget request that was \nsubmitted by the administration did not include the construction of 8.7 \nnew ships required to recapitalize the fleet at a rate that would \nmaintain 308 ships, let alone increasing the number above the 316 ships \nin the fleet today.\n  We had testimony from a Congressional Research Service witness that a \n$10 billion to $12 billion investment on an annual basis, depending on \nthe actual ship mix, to build an average of 8.7 ships per year is \nrequired just to maintain a 308-ship Navy. However, as I said, the \nbudget request submitted by the Pentagon and by the administration for \nfuture years was only 7.5 ships per year on average. So that \nexacerbates the force structure problem rather than addressing it with \nthe required resources.\n  The fact is, the historical average for shipbuilding over the last 5 \nto 6 years has been 7.5 ships. That puts us on a course for 263 ships \nin the Navy. So it is obviously far below the 300-ship Navy that has \nbeen determined to be necessary by the Quadrennial Defense Review, \ncertainly less than the 316-ship Navy we have today, and certainly that \nis fewer ships than we need to be able to respond when it comes to the \nnumber of challenges around the world and the number of contingency \noperations that we have been engaged in and are responding to, just in \na 4-year period between 1996 and 1999, which has been 103 contingency \noperations.\n  The subcommittee has tried to respond to these challenges. We have \ntried to respond in a number of ways, at least to begin to reverse \ncourse until we get this analysis from the Pentagon. Again, as I said, \nwe will demand that analysis from the Pentagon so we can make a \ndecision whether it is going to be 300 ships or 263 ships--which we are \non a course towards, given the request and given the previous budgets \nby the administration--or if we are going to change that course, \nincreasing the number from 316 or 300 or whatever the number may be. \nBut we need to have a realistic assessment of where we should go in the \nfuture.\n  We have tried in this budget before us today in the reauthorization \nto respond to some of the issues. We have decided to do it in a number \nof ways. First, we included a legislative provision that will provide \nfor advanced procurement but at the same time save $1.1 billion in \ntaxpayers' dollars, if the Navy takes advantage of the opportunities \nthat are provided in this reauthorization. To attain $500 million of \nthe $1.1 billion in savings, the bill authorizes the Navy to buy the \nnext six DDG-51 ships under a multiyear agreement at an economic rate \nof three ships per year and provides $143 million in advanced \nprocurement to achieve economies of scale.\n  An additional $600 million in savings will result from the Navy \ncontracting for the LHD-8 with prior year funding, as well as $460 \nmillion in this bill, and future full funding.\n  These smart acquisition strategies are actions that leverage the ship \nconstruction funding. It also provides a number of other cost-saving \nprovisions. We authorize a block buy for economic order quantities for \nup to five Virginia class submarines and smart product modeling for our \nNavy's aircraft carriers. Both of these initiatives will result in \nshipbuilding savings.\n  Over the long haul, to sustain the minimum ship requirements, the \nNavy must find economies in all areas, including reducing operational \ncosts for its entire fleet. The key to reducing these operating costs \nof ships lies in research and development for the design of future \nships that can operate more efficiently and with less manning.\n  Our bill does approve ship design research and development which will \ndirectly result in reduced overall life-cycle costs of the Navy's next \ngeneration of ships. The research and development investment includes \n$550 million for the DD-21 program, $38 million for the CVN-77, $236 \nmillion for the CVN(X) and $207 million for the Virginia class \nsubmarine technologies.\n  In addition to the ship force structure issues, subcommittee \nwitnesses testified that capabilities must remain ahead of the threats \ndesigned to disrupt or deny maritime operations on the high seas and in \nthe littorals.\n  We also had testimony that indicated air and sea strategic lift and \nsupport are absolutely important to support all warfighting commanders \nin chief and all services, as well as supporting other Government \nagencies.\n  We tried to address the requirements to modernize the equipment as \nsoon as possible while continuing the research and development which \nhas the potential to provide our forces with the future systems they \nrequire.\n  We also supported the Marine Corps requirements of two LPD-17 class \namphibious ships, which is state-of-the-art advance transport ships, as \nwell as 12 MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft, one landing craft air cushion \nlife extension, and an additional $27 million for the advanced \namphibious assault vehicle research and development.\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n  We tried to address a number of the requirements for both the Navy \nand the Marine Corps to address what we consider to be the deficiencies \nthat were submitted in the budget request by the administration for the \nNavy and the Marine Corps. It is also an attempt to fill the gap that \nhas been placed on both of those services with respect to demands that \nnot only have been required of them in contingency operations, but also \nin terms of the reduced force structure that has been demonstrated by \nthese charts and by the realities in the world today.\n  I hope in the future we will be able to have the kind of analysis \nupon which we can develop what will be an adequate force structure, \nwhat will be an adequate number of ships, and other requirements for \nthe Navy and the Marine Corps. Whether it is a 300-ship Navy, 308-ship \nNavy, a 316-ship Navy or beyond, or a 263-ship Navy, which has been the \nhistorical trend, as I said, over the last 5 to 6 years and which this \nauthorization is attempting to reverse, it is going to take more than \nthat. Obviously, we need to have the numbers and the analysis upon \nwhich to base those numbers from the Defense Department so that \nCongress has the ability to analyze those numbers in terms of what is \nsufficient to meet the security challenges around the world.\n\n  As I said earlier, the Quadrennial Defense Review developed a number. \nThey said a 300-ship Navy would be adequate to respond to the security \nchallenges. They anticipated there would be an increase in contingency \noperations, but the problem is they did not anticipate the extent to \nwhich those operations would place demands on our naval forces and our \nMarine Corps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I again thank the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee for his leadership and the ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Seapower, Senator Kennedy. I also thank the \nprofessional staff: Gary Hall, Tom McKenzie, and John Barnes on the \nmajority side, and Creighton Greene on the minority side. I also thank \nmy personal staff: Tom Vecchiolla, Sam Horton, and Jennifer Ogilvie, \ndefense fellows in my office as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague for \nher contribution first as chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, and \nfor this very important message she has delivered to the Senate this \nmorning.\n  I understand our distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, \nand the Senator from Georgia have consulted, and the Senator from \nGeorgia desires some time now.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope the Chair will now recognize the next person \nseeking recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner and ranking \nmember Levin for their hard work during the Department of Defense \nauthorization process this year. They have done a tremendous job in \nenhancing the quality of life for our military personnel and their \nfamilies. I appreciate the support of Senators Levin, Bingaman, Reed, \nand Robb, who have cosponsored my GI bill enhancements which we are \nabout to adopt.\n  Specifically, I recognize the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, who \nhimself went to school on the GI bill after World War II. I thank him \nfor his support and his encouragement in improving the GI bill for \nmilitary personnel and their families.\n  My amendment will improve and enhance the current educational \nbenefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century.\n  One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the \nservice Secretaries the authority to authorize a service member to \ntransfer his or her basic Montgomery GI bill benefits to family \nmembers. It will make the GI bill for the first time family friendly. \nThis will give the Secretaries of the services a very powerful \nretention tool.\n  My amendment will also give the Secretaries the authority to \nauthorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, VEAP, \nparticipants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in the \nMontgomery GI bill to participate in the current GI bill program.\n  Another enhancement to the current Montgomery GI bill extends the \nperiod in which the members of Reserve components can use this benefit.\n\n  Other provisions of this amendment will allow the Service Secretaries \nto pay 100 percent of tuition assistance or enable service members to \nuse the Montgomery GI bill to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses \nwhen the services do not pay 100 percent.\n  This GI bill amendment is an important retention tool for the \nservices, as well as a wonderful benefit for the men and women who \nbravely serve our country. I believe that education begets education. \nWe must continue to focus our resources in retaining our personnel and \nmeeting their personal needs. It is cheaper and better all around to \nretain than retrain.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Cleland for making an \nextraordinary contribution, not just on this amendment but in so many \nways on the Armed Services Committee and in the Senate. This will be an \naid to recruitment and retention. I congratulate him for his usual \nperceptiveness of trying to improve the morale and conditions for the \nmen and women in our armed services. He is a supreme leader in that \nregard. I thank him for his continuing leadership and look forward to \nthe adoption of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan. The Senator and I have been here 22 years, and we have seen a \nlot of Senators come and go on the Armed Services Committee. When this \nfine American stepped on to our committee, from the first day he has \ntaken a position for which we all respect and value his guidance and \njudgment.\n  I will say, this man has a sense of humor. Now, it takes sometimes a \nlittle probing to get it out. He always combines his humor with \nhistory. He is a great student of military history and those who have \nbeen in public life in the past. He livens up the committee meetings \nand the markups. When things are sort of in a trough, he will inject \nhimself.\n  But this is something he and I have discussed for a number of years. \nI am very hopeful that we, in the course of the conference, can achieve \nsome measure of these goals, maybe the full measure, I say to the \nSenator, but I know not.\n  As I have said, with great humility, what modest military career I \nhave had in terms of periods of active duty, both at the end of World \nWar II and during the Korean War, in no way compares to the heroic \nservice that this fine Senator rendered his country.\n  But I will say, the greatest investment America made in post-World \nWar II, in those years when this country was returning to normalcy--\nthey were exciting years, 1946 to 1950--it was the GI bill, the \ninvestment by America in that generation of some 16 million men and \nwomen who were privileged to serve in uniform during that period, and I \nwas a modest recipient of the GI bill. I would not be here today, I say \nto the Senator, had it not been for that education given to me.\n  My father had passed on in the closing months of World War II, and my \nmother was widowed. We were prepared to all struggle together to do the \nbest we could in our family. Among the assets was not the money to go \nto college. Had it not been for the GI bill, I would not be here today.\n  So you have a strong shoulder at the wheel with this Senator. But I \nsalute you. We are going to do our very best. I thank you for working \ntirelessly on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces.\n\n  Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member and I are prepared to \noffer a number of amendments with our colleagues.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3216\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that obligations to make payments under the CVN-69 \n  contract for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 is subject to the \n                    availability of appropriations)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Snowe and Senator\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nKennedy, I offer an amendment, which is a technical amendment to \nsection 125 of the bill regarding the overhaul of CVN-69, the U.S.S. \nEisenhower.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside; am I correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN.

I want to thank him for his \nsupport and encouragement in improving the GI bill for military \npersonnel and their families.\n  I call this measure the HOPE--Help Our Professionals Educationally--\nAct of 2000. This measure is the same at my original legislation, S. \n2402.\n  Last year, Time magazine named the American GI as the Person of the \nCentury. That alone is a statement about the value of our military \npersonnel. They are recognized around the world for their dedication \nand commitment to fight for our country and for peace in the world. \nThis past century has been the most violent century in the\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nmodern era. The American GI has fought in the trenches during the First \nWorld War, the beaches at Normandy, in the jungles of Vietnam, in the \ndeserts of the Persian Gulf, and most recently in the Balkans and \nKosovo.\n  The face of our military and the people who fight our wars has \nchanged. The traditional image of the single, mostly male, drafted, and \ndisposable soldier is gone. Today we are fielding the force for the \n21st century. This new force is a volunteer force, filled with men and \nwomen who are highly skilled, married, and definitely not disposable. \nGone are the days when quality of life for a GI included a beer in the \nbarracks and a three-day pass. Now, we know we have to recruit a \nsoldier and retain a family.\n  We have won the cold war. This victory has changed the world and our \nmilitary. The new world order has given us a new world disorder. The \nUnited States is responding to crises around the globe--whether it be \nstrategic bombing or humanitarian assistance--and our military is the \nmost effective response. In order to meet these challenges, we are \nretooling our forces to be lighter, leaner and meaner. This is a \npositive move. Along with this lighter force, our military \nprofessionals must be highly educated and highly trained.\n  Our nation is currently experiencing the longest running peacetime \neconomic growth in history. This economic expansion has been a boom for \nour nation. However, there is a negative impact of this growing \neconomy. With the enticement of quick prosperity in the civilian sector \nit is more difficult than ever to recruit and retain our highly skilled \nforce.\n  In fiscal year 99, the Army missed its recruiting goals by 6,291 \nrecruits, while the Air Force missed its recruiting goal by 1,732 \nrecruits. Pilot retention problems persist for all services; the Air \nForce ended FY99 1,200 pilots short and the Navy ended FY99 500 pilots \nshort. The Army is having problems retaining captains, while the Navy \nfaces manning challenges for Surface Warfare Officers and Special \nWarfare Officers. It is estimated than $6 million is spent to train a \npilot. We as a nation cannot afford to train our people, only to lose \nthem to the private sector. It is better to retain than retrain.\n  There is hope that we are addressing these challenges. Last year was \na momentous year for our military personnel. The Senate passed \nlegislation that significantly enhances the quality of life for our \nmilitary personnel. From retirement reform to pay raises, this Congress \nis on record supporting our men and women in uniform. However, more \nmust be done.\n  In talking with our military personnel, we know that money alone is \nnot enough. Education is the number one reason service members come \ninto the military and the number one reason its members are leaving. \nLast year the Senate began to address this issue by supporting improved \neducation benefits for military members and their families. Since last \nyear, we have gone back and studied this issue further. In reviewing \nthe current Montgomery GI bill, we found several disincentives and \nconflicts among the education benefits offered by the services. These \nconflicts make the GI bill, an earned benefit, less attractive than it \ncould be.\n  My amendment will improve and enhance the current educational \nbenefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century.\n  One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the \nService Secretaries the authority to authorize a service member to \ntransfer his or her basic MGIB benefits to family members. Many service \nmembers tell us that they really want to stay in the service, but do \nnot feel that they can stay and provide an education for their \nfamilies. This will give them an Educational Savings Account, so that \nthey can stay in the service and still provide an education for their \nspouses and children. This will give the Secretaries a very powerful \nretention tool. The measure would allow the Services to authorize \ntransfer of basic GI bill benefits anytime after 6 years of service. To \nencourage members to stay longer, the transferred benefits could not be \nused until completion of at least 10 years of service. I believe that \nthe Services can use this much like a reenlistment bonus to keep \nvaluable service members in the service. It can be creatively combined \nwith reenlistment bonuses to create a very powerful and cost effective \nincentive for highly skilled military personnel to stay in the Service. \nIn talking with service members upon their departure from the military, \nwe have found that the family plays a crucial role in the decision of a \nmember to continue their military career. Reality dictates that we must \naddress the needs of the family in order to retain our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines.\n  My amendment would also give the Secretaries the authority to \nauthorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) \nparticipants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in MGIB \nto participate in the current GI bill program. The VEAP participants \nwould contribute $1200, and those who did not enroll in MGIB would \ncontribute $1500. The services would pay any additional costs of the \nbenefits of this measure.\n  Another enhancement to the current MGIB would extend the period in \nwhich the members of Reserve components can use this benefit. Currently \nthey lose this benefit when they leave the service or after 10 years of \nservice. They have no benefit when they leave service. My amendment \nwill permit them to use the benefit up to 5 years after their \nseparation. This will encourage them to stay in the Reserves for a full \ncareer. Other provisions of this amendment would allow the Service \nSecretaries to pay 100 percent tuition assistance or enable service \nmembers to use the MGIB to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses when \nthe services don't pay 100 percent.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this is a necessary next step for \nimproving our education benefits for our military members and their \nfamilies. We must offer them credible choices. If we offer them \nchoices, and treat the members and their families properly, we will \nshow them our respect for their service and dedication. Maybe then we \ncan turn around our current retention statistics. This GI bill is an \nimportant retention tool for the services. I believe that education \nbegets education. We must continue to focus our resources in retaining \nour personnel based on their needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the clerk could read for us the list of \ncosponsors on that amendment so any others who might wish \ncosponsorship.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the cosponsors.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan Mr. Levin, for Mr. Cleland, for \n     himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Reed of Rhode Island.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

On behalf of Senator McCain, I offer an amendment that \nwill enhance the survival benefit plan available to retired members of \nthe uniformed services, and I ask unanimous consent to be listed as \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3228.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing three amendments to \nS. 2549, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2001. The first \namendment will provide more pay for mid-career enlisted service \nmembers. The second amendment will authorize survivor benefit \nimprovements for the families of service members. The third amendment \nwill improve benefits for members of the National Guard and Reservists.\n  Last year, I was pleased to see military pay table reform enacted \ninto law. Our servicemembers will receive a much needed pay raise next \nmonth, and I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who voted \nfor this legislation.\n  However, there was one group of servicemembers that was under-\nrepresented in last year's pay table reform. Our E-5s, E-6s and E-7s \nhave seen their pay erode in comparison to other pay grades. With our \nsevere recruitment and retention issues still looming, we must \nadequately compensate our mid-grade enlisted servicemembers who are \ncritical to leading the junior enlisted force.\n  We have significantly underpaid these enlisted members since the \nadvent of the All-Volunteer Force. The value of their pay, compared to \nthat of a private/seaman/airman, has dropped 50% since the all \nvolunteer force was enacted by Congress.\n  The 1990s placed undue burdens on our career NCOs. Their expansion of \nduties during the drawdown came with little or no pay incentives, \nresulting in the departure of mid-grade NCOs and Petty Officers from \nthe uniformed services.\n  On promotion to grades E-5 through E-8, the gap between military and \ncivilian pay begins to widen. Last year's pay table reform, which \nhelped to alleviate this gap, increased the pay of mid-grade officers, \nbut is lacking for the mid-grade enlisted force.\n  My amendment would alleviate this inequity by increasing the pay for \nE-5s, E-6s and E-7s to the same level as those of officers with similar \nlengths of service. The amendment is estimated to cost approximately \n$200-300 million a year and is similar to legislation recently \nintroduced in the House.\n  My second amendment would provide low-cost survivor benefit plan \nimprovements for the survivors of active duty personnel who die in the \nline of duty. Under current SBP rules, only survivors of retired \nmembers or those of active duty members who have greater than 20 years \nof service are eligible for SBP.\n  My amendment, at an estimated cost of only $800 thousand in FY01 and \n$12.6 million over 5 years, would extend SBP coverage to all survivors \nof members who die on active duty with the annuities calculated as if \nthe member had been retired with a 100% disability on the date of \ndeath.\n  This is an inexpensive amendment that would greatly help the \nsurvivors of our courageous servicemembers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the defense of our country.\n  The second part of this amendment is a no-cost initiative that would \nallow the spouses and children of active duty personnel to participate \nin the Serviceman Group Life Insurance Program.\n  Junior servicemembers can rarely afford commercial insurance on their \nspouses and children, and the unexpected loss of their spouses--who in \nmany cases are the primary care givers of their children--places an \nextreme strain on the service members' ability to properly take care of \ntheir families.\n  Premiums for this insurance would be significantly lower than \ncomparable life insurance programs, because the Serviceman Group Life \nInsurance Program is composed of a consortium of insurance companies. \nThis amendment would simply authorize spouses to buy up to 50% of the \nservicemember benefits--a maximum of $100,000 in coverage, and each \ndependent child could be covered for up to $10,000.\n  The final amendment I have offered today increases benefits for the \nTotal Force--members of the National Guard and the Reserve Components. \nThe National Guard and Reserves have become a larger percentage of the \nTotal Force and are essential partners in a wide range of military \noperations. Due to the high operating tempo demands on the active \ncomponent, the Reserve components are being called upon more frequently \nand for longer periods than ever before. We must stop treating them \nlike a ``second class'' force.\n  This amendment will specifically authorize five improvements for the \nNational Guard and Reserves. First, it will urge through a sense of \nCongress that the President should adequately request in the DoD budget \nthe funds necessary to modernize these forces, and support their \ntraining and readiness accounts to ensure that the Total Force can \ncontinue to support our National Military Strategy.\n  Second, this amendment will authorize National Guard and reserve \nservicemembers to travel for duty or training on a space-required basis \non military airlift between the servicemember's home of record and \ntheir place of duty.\n  Third, it will authorize National Guard and reserve servicemembers \nwho travel more than 50 miles from their home of record to attend their \ndrills to be able to stay at Bachelor Quarters on military \ninstallations.\n  Fourth, it will increase from 75 to 90 the maximum number of reserve \nretirement points that may be credited in a year for reserve service.\n  Finally, it will authorize legal/JAG services be extended for up to \ntwice the length of period of military service after active duty recall \nfor National Guard and reserve servicemembers to handle issues or \nproblems under the Sailor and Soldier Act.\n  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance of enacting \nmeaningful improvements for our servicemembers; our Soldiers, Sailors, \nAirmen, Marines, their families and their survivors. They risk their \nlives to defend our shores and preserve democracy and we can not thank \nthem enough for their service. But we can pay them more, improve their \nbenefits to their survivors, and support the Total Force in a similar \nmanner as the active forces. Our servicemembers past, present, and \nfuture need these improvements, and these three amendments are just one \nstep we can take to show our support and improve the quality of life \nfor our servicemembers and their families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without further debate, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3228) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner for his help and \nleadership in accepting my amendment to help our National Guard and \nReserves. Without his steadfast support for our military personnel, the \nchanges being endorsed in my amendment would not be possible.\n  In an attempt to maintain a strong national defense despite budget \ncuts, the President has increasingly asked the Guard and Reserves to \nmake up the difference. Work days contributed by reservists have risen \nfrom 1 million days in 1992, to over 13 million days last year. If you \nlook at the Armed Forces personnel participating in the Bosnia and \nKosovo operations, 33 percent are members of the Guard and Reserves in \nBosnia and 22 percent in Kosovo. The National Guard can provide many of \nthe same services as the active duty personnel at a fraction of the \ncost. But what impact does this have on Guardsmen, Reservists, and \ntheir families?\n  I support the total force concept, but I don't believe we can afford \nto balance DoD's budget on the backs of our citizen soldiers and \nairmen. That's why I introduced this amendment to the Defense \nAuthorization bill, along with Senators McCain, Allard, Sessions, \nAshcroft, Warner, and Levin.\n  My amendment addresses quality of life issues. It extends space \nrequired travel to the National Guard and Reserves for travel to duty \nstations both inside and outside of the United States. It also provides \nthe same space available travel privileges for the Guard, Reserves, and \ndependents that the armed forces provides to retired military and their \ndependents. My amendment gives them the same priority status and \nbilleting privileges as active duty personnel when traveling for \nmonthly drills. It raises the annual reserve retirement point maximum, \nupon which retirement pensions are based, from 75 to 90. Finally, it \nwill extend free legal services to Selected Reservists by Judge \nAdvocate General officers for a time equal to twice the length of their \nlast period of active duty service.\n  I believe the dramatic increase in overseas active-duty assignments \nfor reserve members merits the extension of military benefits for our \nNation's citizen soldiers. It is only fair to close these disparities. \nThis amendment would restore fairness to Guard and Reserve members, and \nit would strengthen our national defense and increase our military \nreadiness by alleviating many of the recruitment and retention \nproblems.\n  These are difficult days, without clear and easy answers. But I'm \nglad that, as we often have during trying times, we're able to turn to \nthe men and women of the National Guard and Reserves to help ease the \nway. We must not forget their sacrifices. For in the words of President \nCalvin Coolidge, ``the nation which forgets its defenders will itself \nbe forgotten.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without further debate, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3230) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of amendment No. 3230.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3231\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the President to award the gold and silver \n    medals on behalf of the Congress to the Navajo Code Talkers, in \n           recognition of their contributions to the Nation)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bingaman, I offer an \namendment that would authorize the President to award gold and silver \nmedals on behalf of Congress to the Navaho Code Talkers in recognition \nof their contributions to the Nation during World War II.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows;\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     for himself and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3231.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 10____. CONGRESSIONAL MEDALS FOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl \n     Harbor and war was declared by Congress on the following day;\n       (2) the military code developed by the United States for \n     transmitting messages had been deciphered by the Japanese, \n     and a search was made by United States Intelligence to \n     develop new means to counter the enemy;\n       (3) the United States Government called upon the Navajo \n     Nation to support the military effort by recruiting and \n     enlisting 29 Navajo men to serve as Marine Corps Radio \n     Operators;\n       (4) the number of Navajo enlistees later increased to more \n     than 350;\n       (5) at the time, the Navajos were often treated as second-\n     class citizens, and they were a people who were discouraged \n     from using their own native language;\n       (6) the Navajo Marine Corps Radio Operators, who became \n     known as the ``Navajo Code Talkers'', were used to develop a \n     code using their native language to communicate military \n     messages in the Pacific;\n       (7) to the enemy's frustration, the code developed by these \n     Native Americans proved to be unbreakable, and was used \n     extensively throughout the Pacific theater;\n       (8) the Navajo language, discouraged in the past, was \n     instrumental in developing the most significant and \n     successful military code of the time;\n       (9) at Iwo Jima alone, the Navajo Code Talkers passed more \n     than 800 error-free messages in a 48-hour period;\n       (10) use of the Navajo Code was so successful, that--\n       (A) military commanders credited it in saving the lives of \n     countless American soldiers and in the success of the \n     engagements of the United States in the battles of \n     Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa;\n       (B) some Code Talkers were guarded by fellow Marines, whose \n     role was to kill them in case of imminent capture by the \n     enemy; and\n       (C) the Navajo Code was kept secret for 23 years after the \n     end of World War II;\n       (11) following the conclusion of World War II, the \n     Department of Defense maintained the secrecy of the Navajo \n     Code until it was declassified in 1968; and\n       (12) only then did a realization of the sacrifice and valor \n     of these brave Native Americans emerge from history.\n       (b) Congressional Medals Authorized.--To express \n     recognition by the United States and its citizens in honoring \n     the Navajo Code Talkers, who distinguished themselves in \n     performing a unique, highly successful communications \n     operation that greatly assisted in saving countless lives and \n     hastening the end of World War II in the Pacific, the \n     President is authorized--\n       (1) to award to each of the original 29 Navajo Code \n     Talkers, or a surviving family member, on behalf of the \n     Congress, a gold medal of appropriate design, honoring the \n     Navajo Code Talkers; and\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n       (2) to award to each person who qualified as a Navajo Code \n     Talker (MOS 642), or a surviving family member, on behalf of \n     the Congress, a silver medal of appropriate design, honoring \n     the Navajo Code Talkers.\n       (c) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the awards \n     authorized by subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall \n     strike gold and silver medals with suitable emblems, devices, \n     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n       (d) Duplicate Medals.--The Secretary may strike and sell \n     duplicates in bronze of the medals struck pursuant to this \n     section, under such regulations as the Secretary may \n     prescribe, and at a price sufficient to cover the costs \n     thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, \n     and overhead expenses, and the cost of the medals.\n       (e) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     section are national medals for purposes of chapter 51, of \n     title 31, United States Code.\n       (f) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund, not more than $30,000, to pay for the costs of the \n     medals authorized by this section.\n       (g) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate medals under this section shall be deposited in the \n     United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without further debate, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3231) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me expand on this and say how much I \nrespect Senator Bingaman for bringing this to the attention of the \nSenate and incorporating this most well-deserved recognition on behalf \nof these individuals.\n  Again, with brief service in the concluding months of the war, \nparticularly while I was in the Navy, the Marine Corps utilized these \nindividuals a great deal. What they would do is get on the walkie-\ntalkies in the heat of battle and in their native tongue communicate \nthe orders of the officers and noncommissioned officers to forward and \nother positions, subjecting themselves to the most intense elements of \ncombat at the time. They were very brave individuals. They performed a \nremarkable service. Here we are, some 56 years after the intensity of \nthe fighting in the Pacific, which began in 1941, honoring them. They \nwere magnificent human beings, and the men in the forward units of \ncombat appreciated what they did. I salute our distinguished colleague. \nI am delighted to be a cosponsor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join my good friend, Senator Warner, in \nthanking and commending the men for their gallant service during World \nWar II and to thank Senator Bingaman for remembering them and having us \nas a body remember them. That is a real service, too. We are both \ngrateful to Senator Bingaman.\n  Mr. WARNER. In other words, the enemy simply did not, if they picked \nup this language with their listening systems, have the vaguest idea. \nThere are stories of the confusion of the enemy: They didn't know who \nit was on the beach, what was coming at them. It was remarkable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is a great bit of history, and it is great to be \nreminded of it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Indeed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope it has been written up because it is not familiar \nto me. I am now going to become familiar with it.\n  Mr. WARNER. There were quite a few stories written about them. They \nwere self-effacing, humble people, proud to be identified with their \ntribes. They went back into the sinews of America, as so many of the \nmen and women did, to take up their responsibilities at home.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3232\n\n(Purpose: To revise the fee structure for residents of the Armed Forces \n                            Retirement Home)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lott, I offer an \namendment that would revise the fee structure for residents of the \nArmed Services Retirement Home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. WARNER], for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3232.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 236, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 646. FEES PAID BY RESIDENTS OF THE ARMED FORCES \n                   RETIREMENT HOME.\n\n       (a) Naval Home.--Section 1514 of the Armed Forces \n     Retirement Home Act of 1991 (24 U.S.C. 414) is amended by \n     striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Naval Home.--The monthly fee required to be paid by a \n     resident of the Naval Home under subsection (a) shall be as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) For a resident in an independent living status, $500.\n       ``(2) For a resident in an assisted living status, $750.\n       ``(3) For a resident of a skilled nursing facility, \n     $1,250.''.\n       (b) United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home.--Subsection \n     (c) of such section is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(c) Fixing Fees.--'' and inserting ``(c) \n     United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home.--'';\n       (2) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking ``the fee required by subsection (a) of \n     this section'' and inserting ``the fee required to be paid by \n     residents of the United States Soldiers' and Airmen's Home \n     under subsection (a)''; and\n       (B) by striking ``needs of the Retirement Home'' and \n     inserting ``needs of that establishment''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (2), by striking the second sentence.\n       (c) Savings Provision.--Such section is further amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Residents Before Fiscal Year 2001.--A resident of the \n     Retirement Home on September 30, 2000, may not be charged a \n     monthly fee under this section in an amount that exceeds the \n     amount of the monthly fee charged that resident for the month \n     of September 2000.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without further debate, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3232) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3233\n\n  (Purpose: To request the President to advance the late Rear Admiral \nHusband E.

SENIOR OFFICERS IN COMMAND IN HAWAII ON DECEMBER 7, \n                   1941.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, formerly the Commander \n     in Chief of the United States Fleet and the Commander in \n     Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and \n     unassailable record throughout his career in the United \n     States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (2) Major General Walter C. Short, formerly the Commander \n     of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had an \n     excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941, attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were not provided necessary and critical \n     intelligence that was available, that\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n     foretold of war with Japan, that warned of imminent attack, \n     and that would have alerted them to prepare for the attack, \n     including such essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl \n     Harbor Bomb Plot message of September 24, 1941, and the \n     message sent from the Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to \n     the Japanese Ambassador in the United States from December 6 \n     to 7, 1941, known as the Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his military \n     decisions and the disposition of his forces at the time of \n     the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor were proper ``by \n     virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had at hand \n     which indicated neither the probability nor the imminence of \n     an air attack on Pearl Harbor''; criticized the higher \n     command for not sharing with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very \n     critical period of November 26 to December 7, 1941, important \n     information . . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and, \n     concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that Lieutenant General Short had \n     not been kept ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation for war''; detailed information and \n     intelligence about Japanese intentions and war plans were \n     available in ``abundance'' but were not shared with the \n     General Short's Hawaii command; and General Short was not \n     provided ``on the evening of December 6th and the early \n     morning of December 7th, the critical information indicating \n     an almost immediate break with Japan, though there was ample \n     time to have accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were denied \n     their requests to defend themselves through trial by court-\n     martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral J. L. \n     Holloway, Jr., on April 27, 1954, recommended that Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (12) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that Lieutenant General Short \n     ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl Harbor \n     disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' to \n     advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the retired \n     list.\n       (13) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and recommended \n     that the case of Admiral Kimmel be reopened.\n       (14) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear \n     Admiral Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set \n     forth as a conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for \n     the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the \n     shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it \n     should be broadly shared''.\n       (15) The Dorn Report found that ``Army and Navy officials \n     in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic \n     communications . . . which provided crucial confirmation of \n     the imminence of war''; that ``the evidence of the handling \n     of these messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some \n     unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, limited \n     coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification \n     and followup at higher levels''; and, that ``together, these \n     characteristics resulted in failure . . . to appreciate fully \n     and to convey to the commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus \n     and urgency that these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (16) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from Admiral \n     Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.\n       (17) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (18) Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the \n     only two eligible officers from World War II who were \n     excluded from the list of retired officers presented for \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement on the \n     retired list serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a \n     distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two \n     of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States.\n       (20) Major General Walter Short died on September 23, 1949, \n     and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, without \n     the honor of having been returned to their wartime ranks as \n     were their fellow veterans of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, \n     and other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through \n     their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their \n     highest wartime grades.\n       (b) Advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General \n     Short on Retired Lists.--(1) The President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to \n     the grade of admiral on the retired list of the Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General Walter C. Short to \n     the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list of the \n     Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or change the \n     compensation or benefits from the United States to which any \n     person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon the \n     military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding the Professional \n     Performance of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.--\n     It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel performed his \n     duties as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on the naval \n     base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other targets on the island \n     of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a result of \n     dereliction in the performance of those duties by the then \n     Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General Walter C. Short performed his \n     duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on Hickam Army \n     Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and other targets \n     on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not \n     a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by \n     the then Lieutenant General Short.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in again \noffering this amendment to restore the reputations of two distinguished \nmilitary officers who have unfairly borne the sole blame for the \nsuccess of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor at the beginning of \nWorld War II--Admiral Husband E. Kimmel of the United States Navy and \nGeneral Walter C. Short of the United States Army.\n  The Senate passed this same amendment as part of last year's \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act, but unfortunately it was \ndropped in conference. Now, our amendment is part of this year's House \nversion of the Defense Authorization Act.\n  At last, we have an excellent opportunity to correct a serious wrong \nfrom World War II that has unfairly tarnished the reputation of our \nmilitary and our nation for justice and honor.\n  Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the Navy and Army commanders at \nPearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941. Despite their loyal \nand distinguished service, they were unfairly turned into scapegoats \nfor the nation's lack of preparation for that attack and the \ncatastrophe that took place.\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\n  Justice for these men is long overdue. Wartime investigations after \nthe attack concluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the command of \nAdmiral Kimmel and our land forces under the command of General Short \nhad been properly positioned, given the information they had received. \nThe investigations also found that their superior officers in \nWashington had not passed on vital intelligence information that could \nhave made a difference in America's preparedness for the attack. These \nconclusions of the wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to \nprotect the war effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification \nfor ignoring these facts.\n  Since these initial findings, numerous military, governmental, and \ncongressional investigations have concluded that the blame for this \nattack should have been widely shared. This amendment, and the case for \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short, have received strong support from \nformer Chiefs of Naval Operations, Army Chiefs of Staff, and Chairmen \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, \nAdmiral Carlisle Trost, Admiral J.L. Holloway III, Admiral William J. \nCrowe, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, General Andrew J. Goodpaster, and General \nWilliam J. McCaffrey.\n  Our amendment recommends that the President posthumously advance \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short to their highest wartime rank in \naccord with the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short are the only two officers eligible under this act who did \nnot receive advancement on the retired list. The amendment involves no \nmonetary compensation. It simply asks that now, at this late date, \nthese two military leaders finally be treated the same as their peers.\n  I first became interested in this issue when I received a letter 2 \nyears ago from a good friend in Boston who, for many years, has been \none of the pre-eminent lawyers in America, Edward B. Hanify. As a young \nNavy lawyer and Lieutenant J.G. in 1944, Mr. Hanify was assigned as \ncounsel to Admiral Kimmel.\n  He accompanied Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board \nof Investigation, and he later heard the testimony in the lengthy \ncongressional investigation of Pearl Harbor by the Roberts Commission.\n  Mr. Hanify is probably one of the few surviving people who heard \nKimmel's testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry, and he has \nclosely followed all subsequent developments on the Pearl Harbor \ncatastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that disaster.\n  I would like to quote a few brief paragraphs from Mr. Hanify's \nletter, because it eloquently summarizes the overwhelming case for \njustice for Admiral Kimmel. Mr. Hanify writes:\n\n       The odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made by the \n     Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable damage \n     to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel, despite the fact that \n     the finding was later repudiated and found groundless.\n       I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to callous \n     and cruel treatment by his superiors who were attempting to \n     deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, particularly \n     on account of their strange behavior on the evening of \n     December 6 and morning of December 7 in failing to warn the \n     Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army Department that a \n     Japanese attack on the United States was scheduled for \n     December 7, and that intercepted intelligence indicated that \n     Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack. Washington \n     had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and Army in \n     Hawaii did not have it, or any means of obtaining it.\n       Subsequent investigation by both services repudiated the \n     ``dereliction of duty'' charge. In the case of Admiral \n     Kimmel, the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and \n     dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the \n     information which he had from Washington.\n\n  Adequate and competent in light of the information which he had from \nWashington.\n  Mr. Hanify concludes, ``The proposed legislation provides some \nmeasure of remedial justice to a conscientious officer who for years \nunjustly bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor \ncatastrophe.''\n  Last year, the Senate took a giant step toward correcting this great \nwrong by passing our amendment. I urge the Senate to support this \namendment again this year.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of my colleague \nSenator Kennedy's amendment which would act on restoring the honor and \nrank of Admiral Kimmel and General Short. I have been working on this \nissue since 1985.\n  In my opinion, Admiral Kimmel and General Short are the two final \nvictims of Pearl Harbor. These men were doing their duty to the best of \ntheir ability.\n  The blame directed at these two WWII flag officers for nearly six \ndecades is undeserved. Neither Admiral Kimmel nor General Short was \nnotified before the attack that Washington had decoded top-secret \nJapanese radio intercepts that warned of the pending attack. Despite \nthe fact that the charge of dereliction of duty was never proved \nagainst the two officers, that charge still exists in the minds of many \npeople.\n  This perception is wrong and must be corrected by us now. History and \njustice argue for nothing less. Military, governmental, and \ncongressional investigations have provided clear evidence that these \ntwo commanders were singled out for blame that should have been widely \nshared.\n  The following are several basic irrefutable facts about this issue:\n  The intelligence made available to the Pearl Harbor commanders was \nnot sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was \nmaintained prior to the attack.\n  Neither officer knew of the decoded intelligence in Washington \nindication the Japanese had identified the United States as an enemy.\n  Both commanders were assured by their superiors they were getting the \nbest intelligence available at the time.\n  There were no prudent defensive options available for the officers \nthat would have significantly affected the outcome of the attack.\n  On numerous occasions, history has vindicated the axiom that \n``victory finds a hundred fathers but defeat is an orphan.'' Admiral \nKimmel and General Short have been solely and unjustly rendered the \n``fathers of Pearl Harbor.'' Responsibility for this catastrophe is \njust not that simple.\n  It is extremely perplexing that almost everyone above Kimmel and \nShort escaped censure. Yet, we know now that civilian and military \nofficials in Washington withheld vital intelligence information which \ncould have more fully alerted the field commanders to their imminent \nperil.\n  The bungling that left the Pacific Fleet exposed and defenseless that \nday did not begin and end in Hawaii. In 1995, I held an in-depth \nmeeting to review this matter which included the officers' families, \nhistorians, experts, and retired high-ranking military officers, who \nall testified in favor of the two commanders.\n  In response to this review, Under Defense Secretary Edwin Dorn's \nsubsequent report disclosed officially--for the first time--that blame \nshould be ``broadly shared.'' The Dorn Report stated members of the \nhigh command in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese messages \nthat in their totality ``. . . pointed strongly toward an attack on \nPearl Harbor on the 7th of December, 1941 . . .'' and that this \nintelligence was never sent to the Hawaiian commanders.\n  The Dorn Report went so far as to characterize the handling of \ncritically important decoded Japanese messages in Washington as \nrevealing ``ineptitude . . . unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, \nlimited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification and \nfollowup at higher levels.''\n  They are eligible for this advancement in rank by token of the \nOfficer Personnel Act of 1947, which authorizes retirement at highest \nwartime rank. All eligible officers have benefited. All except for two: \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short. This advancement in rank would \nofficially vindicate them. No retroactive pay would be involved.\n  The posthumous promotion of Admiral Kimmel and General Short will be \na small step in restoring honor to these men.\n  It is time for Congress and the administration to step forward and do \nthe right thing.\n  This year is the 59th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack, \nproviding an appropriate time to promote Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort. I urge adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and Senator Kennedy, and Senator Thurmond to \nsponsor an amendment whose intent is to\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nredress a grave injustice that haunts us from the tribulations of World \nWar II.\n  On May 25 of last year, this body held an historically important vote \nrequesting the long-overdue, posthumous advancement of two fine World \nWar II officers, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. The \nSenate voted in support of including the Kimmel-Short resolution as \npart of the Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2000, but the \nprovision was not included in the final legislation. This year, the \nHouse of Representatives had included the exact language of the Senate \namendment adopted last year, and so we are again seeking the Senate to \nsupport inclusion of this important resolution.\n  Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short were the two senior \ncommanders of U.S. forces deployed in the Pacific at the time of the \ndisastrous surprise December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the attack, they were unfairly and publicly \ncharged with dereliction of duty and blamed as singularly responsible \nfor the success of that attack.\n  Less than 6 weeks after the Pearl Harbor attack, in a hastily \nprepared report to the President, the Roberts Commission--perhaps the \nmost flawed and unfortunately most influential investigation of the \ndisaster--levelled the dereliction of duty charge against Kimmel and \nShort--a charge that was immediately and highly publicized.\n  Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a member of this \nCommission, later disavowed its report, stating that these two officers \nwere ``martyred'' and ``if they had been brought to trial, they would \nhave been cleared of the charge.''\n  Later, Admiral J.O. Richardson, who was Admiral Kimmel's predecessor \nas Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet wrote:\n  ``In the impression that the Roberts Commission created in the minds \nof the American people, and in the way it was drawn up for that \nspecific purpose, I believe that the report of the Roberts Commission \nwas the most unfair, unjust, and deceptively dishonest document ever \nprinted by the Government Printing Office.''\n  After the end of World War II, this scapegoating was given a \npainfully enduring veneer when Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nnot advanced on the retired lists to their highest ranks of war-time \ncommand--an honor that was given to every other senior commander who \nserved in war-time positions above his regular grade.\n  Admiral Kimmel, a two star admiral, served in four star command. \nGeneral Short, a two star general, served in a three star command. Let \nme repeat, advancement on the on retired lists was granted to every \nother flag rank officer who served in World War II in a post above \ntheir grade.\n  That decision against Kimmel and Short was made despite the fact that \nwar-time investigations had exonerated these commanders of the \ndereliction of duty charge and criticized their higher commands for \nsignificant failings that contributed to the success of the attack on \nPearl Harbor. More than six studies and investigations conducted after \nthe war, including one Department of Defense report completed in 1995 \nat Senator Thurmond's request, reconfirmed these findings.\n\n  Our amendment is a rewrite of Senate Joint Resolution 19, the Kimmel-\nShort Resolution, that I, Senator Biden, Senator Thurmond, Senator \nHelms, Senator Stevens, Senator Cochran, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Specter, Senator Enzi, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nAbraham, Senator Craig, Senator Durbin, Senator John Kerry, Senator \nKyl, Senator Hollings, Senator Bob Smith, Senator Collins, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Voinovich, Senator DeWine, and Senator Feinstein--a \ntotal of 23 co-sponsors--introduced last April. It is the same \namendment this body adopted by a rollcall vote last May. It is the same \namendment accepted by the House Armed Services Committee as part of \ntheir version of the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The amendment calls upon the President of the United States to \nadvance posthumously on the retirement lists Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort to the grades of their highest war-time commands. Its passage \nwould communicate the Senate's recognition of the injustice done to \nthem and call upon the President to take corrective action.\n  Such a statement by the Senate would do much to remove the stigma of \nblame that so unfairly burdens the reputations of these two officers. \nIt is a correction consistent with our military's tradition of honor.\n  Mr. President, the investigations providing clear evidence that \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame \ninclude a 1944 Navy Court of Inquiry, the 1944 Army Pearl Harbor Board \nof Investigation, a 1946 Joint Congressional Committee, and a 1991 Army \nBoard for the Correction of Military Records.\n  The findings of these official reports can be summarized as four \nprincipal points.\n  First, there is ample evidence that the Hawaiian commanders were not \nprovided vital intelligence that they needed, and that was available in \nWashington prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Second, the disposition of forces in Hawaii were proper and \nconsistent with the information made available to Admiral Kimmel and \nGeneral Short.\n  In my review of this fundamental point, I was most struck by the \nhonor and integrity demonstrated by General George Marshall who was \nArmy Chief of Staff at the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl \nHarbor.\n  On November 27 of that year, General Short interpreted a vaguely \nwritten war warning message sent from the high command in Washington as \nsuggesting the need to defend against sabotage. Consequently, he \nconcentrated his aircraft away from perimeter roads to protect them, \nthus inadvertently increasing their vulnerability to air attack. When \nhe reported his preparations to the General Staff in Washington, the \nGeneral Staff took no steps to clarify the reality of the situation.\n  In 1946 before a Joint Congressional Committee on the Pearl Harbor \ndisaster General Marshall testified that he was responsible for \nensuring the proper disposition of General Short's forces. He \nacknowledged that he must have received General Short's report, which \nwould have been his opportunity to issue a corrective message, and that \nhe failed to do so.\n  Mr. President, General Marshall's integrity and sense of \nresponsibility is a model for all of us. I only wish it had been able \nto have greater influence over the case of Admiral Kimmel and General \nShort.\n  A third theme of these investigations concerned the failure of the \nDepartment of War and the Department of the Navy to properly manage the \nflow of intelligence. The 1995 Department of Defense report stated that \nthe handling of intelligence in Washington during the time leading up \nto the attack on Pearl Harbor was characterized by, among other faults, \nineptitude, limited coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of \nclarification and follow-up.\n  The fourth and most important theme that permeates the aforementioned \nreports is that blame for the disaster at Pearl Harbor cannot be placed \nonly upon the Hawaiian commanders. They all underscored significant \nfailures and shortcomings of the senior authorities in Washington that \ncontributed significantly--if not predominantly--to the success of the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  The 1995 Department of Defense report put it best, stating that \n``responsibility for the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely \non the shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and General Short; it should be \nbroadly shared.''\n  This is an important quote. It shows that the Department of Defense \nrecognizes that these two commanders should not be singled out for \nblame. Yet, still today on this issue, our government's words do not \nmatch its actions. Kimmel and Short remain the only two officials who \nhave been forced to pay a price for the disaster at Pearl harbor.\n  Let me add one poignant fact about the two wartime investigations. \nTheir conclusions--that Kimmel's and Short's forces had been properly \ndisposed according to the information available to them and that their \nsuperiors had failed to share important intelligence--were kept secret \non the grounds that making them public would have been detrimental to \nthe war effort.\n  Be that as it may, there is no longer any reason to perpetuate the \ncruel\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nmyth that Kimmel and Short were singularly responsible for the disaster \nat Pearl Harbor. Admiral Spruance, one of our great naval commanders of \nWorld War II, shares this view. He put it this way:\n  ``I have always felt that Kimmel and Short were held responsible for \nPearl Harbor in order that the American people might have no reason to \nlose confidence in their government in Washington. This was probably \njustifiable under the circumstances at that time, but it does not \njustify forever damning those two fine officers.''\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of justice and fairness that goes to \nthe core of our military tradition and our nation's sense of military \nhonor. That, above, all should relieve us of any inhibition to doing \nwhat is right and just.\n  Mr. President, this sense of the Senate has been endorsed by \ncountless military officers, including those who have served at the \nhighest levels of command. These include former Chairmen of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas H. Moorer and Admiral William J. Crowe, \nand former Chiefs of Naval Operations Admiral J.L. Holloway III, \nAdmiral Elmo R. Zumwalt and Admiral Carlisle A.H. Trost.\n  Moreover a number of public organizations have called for posthumous \nadvancement of Kimmel and Short. The VFW passed a resolution calling \nfor the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and General Short.\n  Let me add that Senator Robert Dole, one of our most distinguished \ncolleagues and a veteran who served heroically in World War II, has \nalso endorsed this sense of the Senate resolution.\n  Yesterday, June 6, is a day that shall forever be remembered as a \ndate of great sacrifice and great accomplishment for the men who took \npart of Operation Overload. D-Day marked the turning of the tide in the \nallied war effort in Europe, and led to our victory in the Second World \nWar.\n  December 7, 1941, is also a date that will forever be remembered. \nThat day will continue to be ``a date which will live in infamy.'' It \nwill serve as a constant reminder that the United States must remain \nvigilant to outside threats and to always be prepared.\n  However, this amendment is about justice, equity, and honor. Its \npurpose is to redress an historic wrong, to ensure that Admiral Kimmel \nand General Short are treated with the dignity and honor they deserve, \nand to ensure that justice and fairness fully permeate the memory and \nthe important lessons learned from the catastrophe at Pearl Harbor.\n  As we commemorate another anniversary of the success of D-Day, it is \na most appropriate time to redress this injustice. After 50 years, this \ncorrection is long overdue. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I and my colleagues--Senators Roth, \nKennedy, and Thurmond--are reintroducing an amendment that the Senate \npassed last year to provide long overdue justice for the two fine \nmilitary officers, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short.\n  Last year the Senate voted to include this amendment in the Defense \nauthorization bill, but because the House had not considered such a \nprovision, it was not included in the final conference report.\n  This year, having had time to consider the facts, the House Armed \nServices Committee included the exact same language that the Senate \npassed last year in their fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill, \nwhich passed the full House on May 18.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that this resolution has the \nsupport of various veterans groups, including the Veterans of Foreign \nWars (VFW) and the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. It is also a \nmove supported by former Chiefs of Naval Operations, including Admirals \nThomas H. Moorer, Carlisle Trost, J.L. Holloway III, William J. Crowe, \nand Elmo Zumwalt.\n  As most of you know, Admiral Kimmel and General Short commanded U.S. \nforces in the Pacific at the time of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. \nAfterwards, they were blamed as completely responsible for the success \nof that attack.\n  I will not go through an exhaustive review of this case. I think the \namendment itself provides the facts and the record from last year's \ndebate was also quite thorough. Instead, I want to review the reasons I \nthink this is the right action to take.\n  For me, this issue comes down to basic fairness and justice. It was \nentirely appropriate for President Roosevelt to decide to relieve these \nofficers of their command immediately following the attack. Not only \nwas it his prerogative as Commander in Chief, he also needed to make \nsure the nation had confidence in its military as it headed into war. \nSo, I can understand the need, at that time, to make them the \nscapegoats for the devastating defeat. What I do not accept is that the \ndecisions of this government in those extreme times have been left to \nstand for the past 59 years.\n  To be more specific, it was a conscious decision by the government to \nactively release a finding of ``dereliction of duty'' a mere month \nafter Pearl Harbor. Not one of the many subsequent and substantially \nmore thorough investigations to follow agreed with that finding. Even \nworse, the findings of the official reviews done by the military in the \nArmy and Navy Inquiry Boards of 1944--saying that Kimmel and Short's \nforces were properly disposed--were classified and kept from the \npublic.\n\n  Think about it. We are a nation proud to have a civilian led \nmilitary. The concept of civilian rule is basic to our notion of \ndemocracy. This means that the civilian leadership also has \nresponsibilities to the members of its military. The families of \nAdmiral Kimmel and General Short were vilified. They received death \nthreats. Yet, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were denied their \nrequests for a court martial. They were not allowed to properly defend \nthemselves and their honor.\n  Whatever the exigencies of wartime, it is unconscionable that \ngovernment actions which vilified these men and their families should \ncontinue to stand 59 years later. It is appropriate that government \naction be taken to rectify this. There are very few official acts we \ncan take to rectify this. The one suggested by this amendment is to \nadvance these officers on the retirement list. They were the only two \nofficers eligible for such advancement after Congress passed the 1947 \nOfficer Personnel Act, denied that advancement.\n  I also want to point out that I do not believe this is rewriting \nhistory or shifting blame, instead, it is acknowledging the truth. The \n1995 report by then Undersecretary Edward Dorn said, ``Responsibility \nfor the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the shoulders \nof Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it should be broadly \nshared.'' To say that and then take no action to identify others \nresponsible or to rectify the absolute scapegoating of these two \nofficers is to say that military officers can be hung out to dry and \ncannot expect fairness from their civilian government.\n  Again, with civilian leadership, comes responsibility. This \nadvancement on the retirement ranks involves no compensation. Instead, \nit upholds the military tradition that responsible officers take the \nblame for their failures, not for the failures of others. The \nunfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were \nblamed entirely and forced into early retirement. As Members of \nCongress we face no statute of limitations on treating honorable people \nwith frankness and finding out the truth so that we can learn from our \nmistakes.\n  By not taking any action to identify those who Undersecretary Dorn \nsays share the blame, we have denied our military the opportunity to \nlearn from the multiple failures that gave Japan the opportunity to so \ndevastate our fleet.\n  This is not to say that the sponsors of this amendment want to place \nblame in a new quarter. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those \nsuperior officers who were advanced in rank and continued to serve, \ndespite being implicated in the losses at Pearl Harbor. Instead, it \nvalidates that the historic record, as it is becoming clearer and \nclearer, is correct to say that blame should be shared. This amendment \nvalidates the instincts of those historians who have sought the full \nstory and not the simply black-and-white version needed by a grieving \nnation immediately following the attack.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment again this year. \nQuite simply, in the name of truth, justice,\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nand fairness, after 59 years the government that denied Admiral Kimmel \nand General Short a fair hearing and suppressed findings favorable to \ntheir case while releasing hostile information owes them this official \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3233) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Roth has worked tirelessly on the \nissue of revisiting that chapter of our history, the attack on Pearl \nHarbor. Those listening to this debate will recall that Admiral Kimmel \nwas the Navy commander and General Short was the Army commander.\n  There has been a great deal of controversy throughout history as to \ntheir role and the degree of culpability they had for the actions that \nbefell our Armed Forces on that day. This is an action of some import \nbeing taken by the Senate. I remember a debate on the floor one night \nin the context of last year's authorization bill when Senator Roth sat \nright here in this chair for hour upon hour when we debated this issue.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I tip my hat in tribute to Senators Kennedy \nand Biden, Senator Roth and Senator Thurmond, and others, who have \nbrought this to our attention repeatedly over the years. Hopefully, \nthis matter can now be resolved in the appropriate way. Senator Kennedy \nand his colleagues have been absolutely tenacious in this matter. \nHopefully, it will result in a good ending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 3 or 4 days ago, I received a letter from \nthe grandson of Admiral Kimmel. It was a very moving letter. I wasn't \npersonally familiar with this issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter written to me by the \nadmiral's grandson be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 24, 2000.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     McLean, VA.\n       Dear Senator Reid: There is a matter of great interest to \n     me that I would like to bring to your attention as a member \n     of the Senate. I'm particularly interested in your opinion \n     because I know you as a man of great integrity.\n       Last year, May 25th, the Senate voted (52 yeas, 47 nays, 1 \n     not voting) in favor of Amendment No. 388 to the Senate \n     Defense Authorization Act of FY 2000 recommending to the \n     President that he restore the rank of Admiral for my \n     grandfather, Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel. Amendment No. \n     388 was subsequently deleted from the Joint Defense \n     Authorization Act for FY 2000.\n       On May 18, 2000 the House voted (353 yeas, 63 nays) in \n     favor of the House Defense Authorization Act for FY 2001, \n     which contains the same rank-restoration language for my \n     grandfather that the Senate voted for last year.\n       It appears that the Senate will soon be asked to again vote \n     on the rank-restoration matter for my grandfather. Since I \n     have never talked to you about this subject, I do not know \n     why you voted against the Amendment last year. I would very \n     much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this issue with \n     you. My interest in this matter goes beyond the familial. I \n     spent ten years in the navy, twenty-five years in the FBI, \n     and a lifetime of study, which I believe gives me unique \n     perspective and insight into this seminal event.\n       I have enclosed a copy of Admiral Kimmel's Facts About \n     Pearl Harbor, and thank you for your attention to this \n     matter.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Thomas K. Kimmel, Jr.\n       Enclosure (1).\n\n                        Facts About Pearl Harbor\n\n                         (By Husband E. Kimmel)\n\n\n                                          Groton, Connecticut,\n\n                                                     June 3, 1958.\n     Hon. Clarence Cannon,\n     Congressman from Missouri, House Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Sir: Your remarks on the floor of the House of \n     Representatives on May 6, 1958 were recently called to my \n     attention. They included the following passages which I quote \n     from the Congressional Record of May 6, 1958.--\n       ``A subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations held \n     hearings in which it was testified that at the time of the \n     attack the Naval Commander, Admiral Kimmel and the Army \n     Commander General Short were not even on speaking terms. And \n     the exhaustive investigations by the commission appointed by \n     the President and by the Joint Committee of the House and \n     Senate showed that although both had been repeatedly alerted \n     ``over a period of weeks prior to the attack'' they did not \n     confer on the matter at any time.\n       ``At one of the most critical periods in the defense of the \n     nation, there was not the slightest cooperation between the \n     Army and the Navy.\n       ``Had they merely checked and compared the official \n     message; received by each, they could not have failed to have \n     taken the precautions which would have rendered the attack \n     futile and in all likelihood have prevented the Second World \n     War and the situation in which we find ourselves today. . . .\n       ``It was not the Japanese superiority winning the victory. \n     It was our own lack of cooperation between Army and Navy \n     throwing victory away. . . .\n       ``When the Jap naval code was broken and when for some time \n     we were reading all official messages from Tokyo to the \n     Japanese fleet, much of this information came to Admiral \n     Kimmel at his Hawaiian headquarters.''. . .\n       From your remarks I have learned for the first time the \n     origin of the lie that General Short and I were not on \n     speaking terms at the time of the attack. I would like very \n     much to know the identity of the individual who gave this \n     testimony before a subcommittee of the Appropriations \n     Committee.\n       In regard to the alleged lack of cooperation between \n     General Short and me your statement is completely in error. \n     We did consult together frequently. As a man in your position \n     should know before making the charges you have made, the \n     Naval Court of Inquiry which was composed of Admiral Orin G. \n     Murfin, Admiral Edward C. Kalbfus and Vice Admiral Adolphus \n     Andrews, all of whom had held high commands afloat, made an \n     exhaustive investigation and reached the following \n     conclusion:--\n       ``Finding of Fact Number V.\n       ``Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short were personal \n     friends. They met frequently, both socially and officially. \n     Their relations were cordial and cooperative in every respect \n     and, in general, this is true as regards their subordinates. \n     They frequently conferred with each other on official matters \n     of common interest, but invariably did so when messages were \n     received by either which had any bearing on the development \n     of the United States-Japanese situation or on their general \n     plans in preparing for war. Each was mindful of his own \n     responsibility and the responsibilities vested in the other. \n     Each was informed of measures being undertaken by the other \n     to a degree sufficient for all practical purposes.''\n       Your statement that the actions of the 1941 Hawaiian \n     Commanders might have prevented the Second World War and the \n     situation in which we find ourselves today is utterly \n     fantastic. The Hawaiian Commanders had no part in the \n     exchange of notes between the two governments and were never \n     informed of the terms of the so called ultimatum of November \n     26, 1941 to Japan, nor were they notified that the feeling of \n     informed sources in Washington was that the Japanese reply to \n     this ultimatum would trigger the attack on the United States. \n     To blame the Hawaiian Commanders of 1941 for the situation in \n     which we find ourselves today is something out of Alice in \n     Wonderland.\n       With regard to the Japanese messages intercepted and \n     decoded, exhaustive testimony before the Naval Court of \n     Inquiry and the Joint Congressional Committee of \n     Investigation shows that none of these decoded messages \n     received after July 1941 were supplied to me and none were \n     supplied to General Short.\n       My book, ``Admiral Kimmel's Story'', contains a collection \n     of documented facts which support this statement and give the \n     text of important decoded intercepts which were withheld from \n     me and from General Short. These decoded intercepts were in \n     such detail that they made the Japanese intentions clear. Had \n     they been supplied to the Hawaiian Commanders the result of \n     the attack would have been far different if indeed the attack \n     would ever have been made.\n       I know of no other occasion in our military history where \n     vital information was denied the commanders in the field.\n       To make unfounded charges against me and General Short to \n     support your argument is grossly unfair and a \n     misrepresentation of facts. The success of the attack on \n     Pearl Harbor was not the result of inter-service rivalries at \n     Pearl Harbor. This success was caused by the deliberate \n     failure of Washington to give the Commanders in Hawaii the \n     information available in Washington to which they were \n     entitled. This information which was denied to the Hawaiian \n     Commanders was supplied to the American Commanders in the \n     Philippines and to the British.\n       I request you insert this letter in the Congressional \n     Record.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Husband E. Kimmel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Groton, Connecticut,\n\n                                                     July 7, 1958.\n     Hon. Clarence Cannon,\n     House of Representatives, Committee on Appropriations, Eighty \n         Fifth Congress, Washington, DC.\n       Sir: You have failed up to the present time to provide me \n     with the name of the individual whom you quoted in your \n     remarks appearing in the Congressional Record of May 6, 1958 \n     as authority for your statement that General Short and I were \n     not on speaking terms when the Japanese attacked Pearl \n     Harbor. I know that to be wholly false and believe I am \n     entitled to the name of the person so testifying. Whether or \n     not he testified under oath and his qualifications. Moreover \n     I would appreciate a definite reference to the hearing of the \n     Sub-Committee of the appropriations Committee if printed and \n     if not a\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n     transcript of that part of the record to which you refer.\n       The receipt of your remarks in the Congressional Record of \n     18 June is acknowledged. It was forwarded without \n     accompanying letter in a franked envelope bearing your name \n     and I presume sent by your direction.\n       Your remarks are a continuation of the frantic efforts of \n     the Roosevelt Administration to divert attention from the \n     failures in Washington and to place the blame for the \n     catastrophe on the Commanders at Pearl Harbor. Your account \n     of the testimony that General Short and I were not on \n     speaking terms given to your committee shortly after Pearl \n     Harbor was effectively publicized though sixteen years later \n     I am still denied the name of the individual who perpetrated \n     this lie.\n       For four years, from 1941 to 1945, the administration \n     supporters and gossip peddlers had a field day making \n     statements which the wall of government war time secrecy \n     prevented me from answering.\n       One of the most persistent and widespread was to the effect \n     that General Short and I were not on speaking terms at the \n     time of the attack. Another was that the uniformed services \n     in Hawaii were all drunk when the attack came. This is the \n     reason the Naval Court of Inquiry investigated these charges \n     thoroughly and set forth their falsity in unmistakable \n     language.\n       You still seek to sustain these charges by the simple \n     expedient of attacking the integrity of the investigators and \n     witnesses who reached conclusions or gave testimony which \n     does not suit you.\n       You have slandered the honorable, capable, and devoted \n     officers who served as members of the Army Board of \n     Investigation and the Navy Court of Inquiry. You have also \n     slandered the personnel of the Army and Navy stationed in \n     Hawaii in 1941, many of whom gave their lives in defense of \n     this country.\n       It is astounding to me that you should charge General Short \n     and me of falsely testifying as to our personal and official \n     cooperation even when as you phrase it ``all but life itself \n     depended on their convincing the world that they had been \n     friends when they should have been friends.''\n       The testimony on this matter given before the Naval Court \n     of Inquiry was given under oath and was true to my personal \n     knowledge and is substantiated by much other testimony.\n       You, yourself, refer to the statements in the Roberts \n     Report to the effect that General Short and I conferred on \n     November 27 and December 1, 2 and 3. You further state from \n     the Roberts Report--``They did not then or subsequently hold \n     any conferences specially directed to the meaning and \n     significance of the warning messages received by both.'' \n     (General Short--Admiral Kimmel).\n       How ridiculous it is to assume that the Commander in Chief \n     of the Pacific Fleet is unable to understand a message sent \n     by the Navy Department without conferring with the Commanding \n     General of the Hawaiian Department to determine what the Navy \n     Department meant by the messages that were sent to him and \n     conversely that the Commanding General Hawaiian Department \n     had to confer with the Commander in Chief Pacific Fleet in \n     order for him to know what the messages sent to him by the \n     War Department meant. If the messages were so worded the \n     fault lay neither with me or General Short.\n       You imply that my request to revise the transcript of my \n     testimony before the Roberts Commission is censurable and \n     completely ignore the published statement of Admiral William \n     H. Standley, USN, retired, a former Chief of Naval Operations \n     and a member of the Roberts Commission. He wrote regarding \n     Admiral Kimmel--``He was permitted no counsel and had no \n     right to ask questions or to cross examine witnesses as he \n     would have had if he had been made a defendant. Thus both \n     Short and Kimmel were denied all of the usual rights accorded \n     to American citizens appearing before judicial proceedings as \n     interested parties.'' Even communists plotting the overthrow \n     of our country are accorded far more legal safeguards than \n     were granted to me and General Short. Admiral Standley also \n     wrote, ``In spite of the known inefficiency of the \n     Commission's reporters, when Admiral Kimmel asked permission \n     to correct his testimony in which he had found so many errors \n     that it took him two days to go over it, the Commission voted \n     to keep the record as originally made although the answers \n     recorded to many questions were obviously incorrect and many \n     of them absurd. At my urgent insistences, the Commission did \n     finally authorize Admiral Kimmel's corrected testimony to be \n     attached to the record as an addendum.''\n       Your remarks with regard to the conduct of both officers \n     and men on the evening preceding the Pearl Harbor attack is \n     an insult to the gallant men who died in the treacherous \n     Japanese attack and to all the members of both Army and Navy \n     stationed on the Island of Oahu. Infrequently there might be \n     an individual who overindulged in intoxicants but these were \n     promptly apprehended by the shore patrol or military police \n     and returned to their ship or station. The evidence as to the \n     sobriety of officers and men was clear in the documentary \n     evidence available to the investigation boards and yet in \n     spite of their findings you state, ``But the very fact that \n     it was considered necessary to emphasize this testimony \n     naturally gives rise to some doubt.'' You apparently are \n     quite willing to doubt the testimony given and believe the \n     worst of the fine young men in the armed forces that were \n     stationed in Hawaii.\n       I was not permitted to know what testimony was presented to \n     the Roberts Commission and was never given an opportunity to \n     clarify or refute any statement made before it.\n       I was not made a defendant before the Hawaii one-man \n     investigation, was not called to testify, and was not \n     permitted to have any knowledge of the proceedings. I \n     requested authority to attend this investigation and was \n     advised that time did not permit. When I repeated my request \n     the Secretary of the Navy did not even reply. Perhaps the \n     reason may be found in the testimony of Captain Safford who \n     narrated before the Joint Congressional Committee the \n     pressure to which he was subjected by the Committee Counsel \n     to make him change his testimony. All did not have the \n     strength of character of Captain Safford and some modified \n     their preceding sworn statements.\n       Although I requested the Joint Congressional Committee to \n     call certain witnesses many of them were not called to \n     testify. Among these was Fleet Admiral F. Halsey, my senior \n     Fleet Air Officer at the time of the attack.\n       The Navy court of Inquiry was the only investigation of \n     Peal Harbor before which I was permitted to cross examine and \n     call witnesses. You are substantially correct in your \n     statement that this inquiry ``found Admiral Kimmel as pure as \n     the driven snow.'' In more moderate language expressed by \n     Admiral Murfin, the President of the Court, years later, ``We \n     found Admiral Kimmel had done everything possible under the \n     circumstances.''\n       On Advice of Counsel I declined to take part in the Hart \n     Investigation because the stipulations demanded of me would \n     have placed my fate completely in the hands of the Secretary \n     of the Navy. This I did regretfully because it was through my \n     efforts that this investigation was initiated. The \n     proceedings of the Hart Investigation were a valuable \n     contribution.\n       Why were the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War \n     so anxious to have the damaging testimony in both the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Inquiry changed? The answer is \n     very simple, both inquiries had found that the responsibility \n     for the Pearl Harbor disaster rested in large part at the \n     Headquarters of our government in Washington. Admiral \n     Standley whom I have referred to above wrote:\n       ``From the beginning of our investigation I held a firm \n     belief that the real responsibility for the disaster at Pearl \n     Harbor was lodged many thousands of miles from the Territory \n     of Hawaii.''\n       Even the Hewitt Investigation found--\n       ``During his incumbency as Commander in Chief Pacific \n     Fleet, Admiral Kimmel was indefatigable, resourceful and \n     energetic in his efforts to prepare the Fleet for war.''\n       You refer to the information that had been forwarded to me \n     and to General Short and specifically to a message based upon \n     information from our Ambassador in Tokyo, Mr. Grew, dated 27 \n     January 1941 to the effect that the Peruvian Ambassador in \n     Tokyo had heard rumors that in the event of trouble breaking \n     out between the United States and Japan, the Japanese \n     intended to make a surprise attack against Pearl Harbor but \n     you make no mention of the letter of the Chief of Naval \n     Operations which forwarded this information to me on 1 \n     February 1941 to the effect that, ``The Division of Naval \n     Intelligence places no credence in these rumors. Furthermore \n     based upon known data regarding the present disposition and \n     employment of Japanese Naval and Army forces no move against \n     Pearl Harbor appears imminent or planned for the foreseeable \n     future.''\n       This estimate was never changed.\n       When you refer to--``A position so admirable defended as \n     Pearl Harbor with every facility, submarine nets, radar, \n     sonar, planes and ships of the line'' you create a very false \n     impression. Admiral Richardson was relieved because he so \n     strongly held that the Fleet should not be based in the \n     Hawaiian area.\n       The Army anti-aircraft batteries were woefully lacking but \n     the War Department was unable to supply more.\n       Of 180 long range bombing planes authorized by the War \n     Department early in 1941 only 12 had arrived and of these six \n     were out of commission as they had been stripped of vital \n     parts to enable other planes of similar type to continue \n     their flight to their destination in the Philippines.\n       Of 100 Navy patrol planes authorized for the 14th Naval \n     District at Pearl Harbor not one had arrived prior to \n     December 7, 1941.\n       With regard to the radar installations, these had just been \n     installed and their personnel were under training. The \n     installation of these stations had been delayed due to the \n     inability of the Army and the Interior Department to agree \n     upon the location of these stations.\n       With reference to personnel for the ships there were \n     serious shortages of both officers and enlisted personnel and \n     men were constantly being detached to provide crews for ships \n     being newly commissioned.\n       No one has ever explained why the weaknesses so clearly \n     described in the Secretary of the Navy's letter of 24 \n     January, 1941 were permitted to continue during all the \n     months at this outlying station whose security was vital to \n     the safety of the fleet and of the United States.\n       Facilities to fuel the fleet were inadequate and a severe \n     handicap to all fleet operations.\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\n       The only planes in Hawaii suitable for long distance \n     scouting were the patrol planes assigned to the fleet and \n     they were totally inadequate to cover the approaches to \n     Hawaii. The only planes suitable for long range bombing were \n     the six B-17 Army planes and those attached to the two \n     carriers.\n       At the time of the attack the two carriers were on missions \n     initiated by the Navy Department.\n       These and other deficiencies had been repeatedly reported \n     by General Short and me as well as by our predecessors.\n       The messages of October 16, November 24 and November 27, \n     1941 from the Navy Department to the Commander of the Pacific \n     Fleet and the messages of November 27 and November 29, 1941 \n     to General Short from the War Department stressed sabotage \n     and that an attack if made would be directed against ports in \n     South East Asia or the Philippines. With the benefit of the \n     intercepted Japanese messages, how they arrived at this \n     conclusion will always be a mystery to me.\n       To add to our difficulties the messages also directed that, \n     ``If hostilities cannot, repeat cannot be avoided, the United \n     States desires that Japan commit the first overt act. . . .''\n       The message of November 27, 1941 from the War Department to \n     General Short specifically directed him to, ``Report measures \n     taken''. On the same date General Short replied, ``Department \n     alerted to prevent sabotage. Liaison with Navy.''\n       Recorded testimony shows this report was read by the \n     Secretary of War, the Chief of Staff of the Army, the Chief \n     of War Plans Army, and the Chief of War Plans Navy. There can \n     be no reasonable doubt that this report was read and \n     understood by these responsible officials in Washington. For \n     nine days and until the Japanese attack the War Department \n     did not express any disapproval of this alert and did not \n     give General Short any information calculated to make him \n     change the alert.\n       What was most needed at Pearl Harbor at this time was the \n     information in Washington from the Japanese intercepts that \n     indicated clearly an attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       The Navy Department sent me various messages quoting from \n     intercepted Japanese dispatches. I believed I was getting all \n     such messages and acted accordingly. After the attack I found \n     that many vitally important messages were withheld from the \n     Hawaiian Commanders.\n       I was never informed that Japanese intercepted messages had \n     divided Pearl Harbor into five areas and sought minute \n     information of the berthing of ships in those areas.\n       A Japanese dispatch decoded and translated on October 9, \n     1941 stated,\n       ``With regard to warships and aircraft carriers, we would \n     like to have you report on those at anchor, (those are not so \n     important) tied up at wharves, buoys, and in docks. \n     (Designate types and classes briefly. If possible we would \n     like to have you make mention of the fact when there are two \n     or more vessels alongside the same wharf)''.\n       On October 10, 1941, another dispatch was decoded and \n     translated in Washington which described an elaborate and \n     detailed system of symbols to be used thereafter in \n     designating the location of vessels in Pearl Harbor.\n       A dispatch of November 15 decoded and translated in \n     Washington on December 3, 1941 stated,\n       ``As relations between Japan and the United States are most \n     critical, make your ``ships in harbor report'' irregular but \n     at the rate of twice a week. Although you already are no \n     doubt aware, please take extra care to maintain secrecy.''\n       A dispatch of November 18 decoded and translated in \n     Washington on December 5, 1941 stated,\n       ``Please report on the following areas as to vessels \n     anchored therein: Area N. Pearl Harbor, Mamala Bay \n     (Honolulu), and the Areas adjacent thereto. (Make your \n     investigation with great secrecy)''.\n       A dispatch of November decoded and translated in Washington \n     on December 6, 1941, stated the Japanese Consul General in \n     Honolulu had reported that in area A there was a battleship \n     of the Oklahoma Class; that in Area O there were three heavy \n     cruisers at anchor, as well as carrier ``Enterprise'' or some \n     other vessel; that two heavy cruisers of the Chicago Class \n     were tied up at docks ``KS''. The course taken by destroyers \n     entering the harbor, their speed and distances apart were \n     also described.\n       On December 4 a dispatch was decoded and translated in \n     Washington which gave instructions to the Japanese Consul in \n     Honolulu to investigate bases in the neighborhood of the \n     Hawaiian military reservation.\n       On December 5, 1941 a dispatch was decoded and translated \n     in Washington which stated.\n       ``We have been receiving reports from you on ship \n     movements, but in future you will also report even when there \n     are no movements''.\n       In no other area was the Japanese Government seeking the \n     detailed information that they sought about Pearl Harbor.\n       In the period immediately preceding the attack reports were \n     demanded even when there were no ship movements. This \n     detailed information obtained with such pains-taking care had \n     no conceivable usefulness from a military viewpoint except \n     for an attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       No one had a more direct and immediate interest in the \n     security of the fleet in Pearl Harbor than its Commander-in-\n     Chief. No one had a greater right than I to know that Japan \n     had carved up Pearl Harbor into sub areas and was seeking and \n     receiving reports as to the precise berthings in that harbor \n     of the ships of the fleet. I had been sent Mr. Grew's report \n     earlier in the year with positive advice from the Navy \n     Department that no credence was to be placed in the rumored \n     Japanese plans for an attack on Pearl Harbor. I was told \n     then, that no Japanese move against Pearl Harbor appeared, \n     ``imminent or planned for the forseeable future''. Certainly \n     I was entitled to know what information in the Navy \n     Department completely altered the information and advice \n     previously given to me. Surely I was entitled to know of the \n     intercepted dispatches between Tokyo and Honolulu on and \n     after September 24, 1941, which indicated that a Japanese \n     move against Pearl Harbor was planned in Tokyo.\n       Yet not one of these dispatches about the location of ships \n     in Pearl Harbor was supplied to me.\n       Knowledge of these foregoing dispatches would have \n     radically changed the estimate of the situation made by me \n     and my staff.\n       General Willoughby in his book MacArthur 1941-1945 quotes a \n     staff report from MacArthur's Headquarters.\n       ``It was known that the Japanese consul in Honolulu cabled \n     Tokyo reports on general ship movements. In October his \n     instructions were ``sharpened''. Tokyo called for specific \n     instead of general reports. In November, the daily reports \n     were on a grid-system of the inner harbor with coordinate \n     locations of American men of war: this was no longer a case \n     of diplomatic curiosity; coordinate grid is the classical \n     method for pin-point target designation; our battleships had \n     suddenly become targets.''\n       ``Spencer Akin was uneasy from the start. We drew our own \n     conclusions and the Filipino-American troops took up beach \n     positions long before the Japanese landings.''\n       If MacArthur's Headquarters which had no responsibility for \n     Pearl Harbor were impressed by this information it is \n     impossible to understand how its significance escaped all the \n     talent in the War and Navy Department in Washington.\n       The dispatches about the berthing of ships in Pearl Harbor \n     also clarified the significance of other Japanese dispatches \n     decoded and translated in the Navy Department prior to the \n     attack.\n       The deadline date was first established by a dispatch \n     decoded and translated on November 5, 1941 the date of its \n     origin.\n       ``Because of various circumstances, it is absolutely \n     necessary that all arrangements for the signing of this \n     agreement be completed by the 25th of this month. I realize \n     that this is a difficult order, but under the circumstances \n     it is an unavoidable one. Please understand this thoroughly \n     and tackle the problem of saving the Japanese-United States \n     relations from falling into a chaotic condition. Do so with \n     great determination and with unstinted effort, I beg of you.\n       ``This information is to be kept strictly to yourself \n     alone''.\n       The deadline was reiterated in a dispatch decoded and \n     translated in the Navy Department on November 12, 1941.\n       ``Judging from the progress of the conversations, there \n     seem to be indications that the United States is still not \n     fully aware of the exceedingly criticalness of the situation \n     here. The fact remains that the date set forth in my message \n     #736 is absolutely immovable under present conditions. It is \n     a definite deadline and therefore it is essential that a \n     settlement be reached by about that time. The session of \n     Parliament opens on the 15th (work will start on (the \n     following day?)) according to the schedule. The government \n     must have a clear picture of things to come in presenting its \n     case at the session. You can see, therefore, that the \n     situation is nearing a climax, and that time is indeed \n     becoming short . . .''\n       ``Whatever the case may be, the fact remains that the date \n     set forth in my message #736 is an absolutely immovable one. \n     Please, therefore, make the United States see the light, so \n     as to make possible the signing of the agreement by that \n     date''.\n       The deadline was again repeated in a dispatch decoded in \n     Washington on November 17.\n       ``For your Honor's own information.\n       1. I have read your #1090 and you may be sure that you have \n     all my gratitude for the efforts you have put forth, but the \n     fate of our Empire hangs by the slender thread of a few days, \n     so please fight harder than you ever did before''.\n       ``2. In you opinion we ought to wait and see what turn the \n     war takes and remain patient. However, I am awfully sorry to \n     say that the situation renders this out of the question. I \n     set the deadline for the solution of these negotiations in my \n     #736 and there will be no change. Please try to understand \n     that. You see how short the time is; therefore, do not allow \n     the United States to sidetrack us and delay the negotiations \n     any further. Press them for a solution on the basis of our \n     proposals and do your best to bring about an immediate \n     solution''.\n       The deadline was finally extended on November 22 for four \n     days in a dispatch decoded and translated on November 22, \n     1941.\n       ``It was awfully hard for us to consider changing the date \n     we set in my #736. You should know this, however, I know you \n     are working hard. Stick to our fixed policy and do your very \n     best. Spare no efforts and try to bring about the solution we \n     desire. There are reasons beyond your ability to guess why we \n     wanted to settle Japanese-American relations by the 25th, but \n     if within the next three or four days you can finish your \n     conversations with the Americans; if the signing\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n     can be completed by the 29th, (let me write it out for you--\n     twenty-ninth); if the pertinent notes can be exchanged; if we \n     can get an understanding with Great Britain and the \n     Netherlands; and in short, if everything can be finished, we \n     have decided to wait until that date. This time we mean it, \n     that the deadline absolutely cannot be changed. After that \n     things are automatically going to happen. Please take this \n     into your careful consideration and work harder than you ever \n     have before. This, for the present, is for the information of \n     you two Ambassadors alone.''\n       Again on November 24, 1941, Tokyo specifically instructed \n     its ambassadors in Washington that the November 29 deadline \n     was set in Tokyo time.\n       In at least six separate dispatches on November 5, 11, 15, \n     16, 22 and 24 Japan established and extended the deadline \n     finally advanced to November 29.\n       After the deadline date a Japanese plan was automatically \n     going into operation. It was of such importance that the \n     Japanese Government declared: ``The fate of our Empire hangs \n     by the slender thread of a few days.''\n       On December 1, 1941 Tokyo advised its ambassadors in \n     Washington:\n       ``The date set in my message #812 has come and gone and the \n     situation continues to be increasingly critical.''\n       A dispatch on November 28 decoded and translated on the \n     same day, stated:\n       ``Well, you two ambassadors have exerted superhuman efforts \n     but, in spite of this, the United States has gone ahead and \n     presented this humiliating proposal. This was quite \n     unexpected and extremely regrettable. The Imperial Government \n     can by no means use it as a basis for negotiations. \n     Therefore, with a report of the views of the Imperial \n     Government on this American proposal which I send you in two \n     or three days, the negotiations will be de facto ruptured. \n     This is inevitable.''\n       Not one of the Japanese messages about the ``Deadline'' \n     were supplied to me although the American Commanders in the \n     Philippines were supplied with this information as they were \n     also supplied with all the information in the decoded \n     Japanese intercepts that were denied to the Hawaiian \n     Commanders.\n       The Commanders at Pearl Harbor were not kept informed of \n     the progress of negotiations with Japan. I was never supplied \n     with the text of Mr. Hull's message of November 26, 1941 to \n     the Japanese Government which has been referred to frequently \n     as an ultimatum. Mr. Stimson characterized it as Mr. Hull's \n     decision to ``kick the whole thing over.''\n       Among other terms this note provided:\n       ``The Government of Japan will withdraw all military, \n     naval, air and police forces from China and Indo China.\n       ``The Government of the United States and the Government of \n     Japan will not support--militarily, politically, \n     economically--any government or regime in China other than \n     the National Government of the Republic of China with Capital \n     temporarily at Chunking.\n       ``Both Governments will agree that no agreement which \n     either has concluded with any third power or powers shall be \n     interpreted by it in such a way as to conflict with the \n     fundamental purpose of this agreement, the establishment and \n     preservation of peace throughout the Pacific Area.''\n       The reply to this note was delivered in Washington within \n     hours of the Japanese attack.\n       My information on this and previous exchanges between the \n     two governments was obtained from newspapers and radio. I \n     believe Washington newspaper correspondents and the editors \n     of our leading newspapers were kept better informed than were \n     the Commanders at Pearl Harbor.\n       After receipt by Tokyo of the American note of November 26, \n     the intercepted Japanese dispatches indicate that Japan \n     attached great importance to the continuance of negotiations \n     in order to conceal the plan that would take effect \n     automatically on November 29, as evidenced by the Japanese \n     dispatch of November 28:\n       ``. . . I do not wish you to give the impression that the \n     negotiations are broken off. Merely say to them that you are \n     awaiting instructions and that, although the opinions of your \n     government are not yet clear to you, to your own way of \n     thinking the Imperial Government has always made just claims \n     and has borne great sacrifices for the sake of peace in the \n     Pacific. . . .''\n       I never received this information.\n       Again the dispatches from Tokyo to Washington of December \n     1, 1941:\n       ``. . . to prevent the United States from becoming unduly \n     suspicious we have been advising the press and others that \n     though there are some wide differences between Japan and the \n     United States, the negotiations are continuing. (The above is \n     for only your information.)''\n       I never received this information.\n       Again in the transpacific telephone conversations and \n     dispatches the same theme is stressed, be careful not to \n     alarm the Government of the United States and do nothing to \n     cause a breaking off of negotiations.\n       This information was decoded and translated in Washington \n     on November 30 and was never sent to me.\n       The intercepted Japanese diplomatic dispatches show that on \n     and after November 29 a Japanese plan of action automatically \n     went into effect: that the plan was of such importance it \n     involved the fate of the Empire: that Japan urgently wanted \n     the United States to believe that negotiations were \n     continuing after the deadline date to prevent suspicion as to \n     the nature of the plan.\n       What was the plan? Why such elaborate instructions to \n     stretch out negotiations as a pretext to hide the unfolding \n     of this plan? Anyone reading the Japanese intercepted \n     messages would face this question.\n       No effort was made to mask the movements or presence of \n     Naval Forces moving southward, because physical and radio \n     observation of that movement were unavoidable. The troop \n     movements to southern Indo China were the subject of formal \n     exchanges between the Governments of Japan and the United \n     States as evidenced by the communication which Mr. Wells \n     handed to Mr. Nomura on December 2, 1941.\n       Other dispatches were received in Washington which gave \n     evidence of the deepening crisis.\n       On the afternoon of December 6, 1941 a Japanese intercept \n     was decoded which warned that a fourteen part message from \n     Japan was on its way to the Ambassadors in Washington. That \n     the time for presenting this message to our State Department \n     would be supplied later.\n       By 3:00 p.m. December 6, 1941 thirteen of the fourteen \n     parts had been received. The decoding and translation was \n     completed by 9:00 p.m. and distributed to the most important \n     officers of the government by midnight. Nine p.m. in \n     Washington was 3:30 in the afternoon in Hawaii. At midnight \n     it was 6:30 p.m. in Hawaii.\n       When the thirteen parts were delivered to Mr. Roosevelt \n     about 9:00 p.m., he remarked, ``This means war''.\n       The time of delivery message and the fourteenth part were \n     decoded and translated by 9:00 a.m. December 7, 1941, the \n     time for delivery was set at 1:00 p.m. Washington time which \n     was 7:30 a.m. at Honolulu and 2:00 a.m. at Manila.\n       Yet not one word of the receipt of these messages which \n     again clearly indicated an attack on Hawaii were ever given \n     to General Short and me.\n       The story of the whereabouts of the Chief of Staff of the \n     Army and the Chief of Naval Operations and their \n     unaccountable lapse of memory has been publicized so much \n     that it is unnecessary for me to repeat it.\n       I have written a documented account of Pearl Harbor. Other \n     accounts which also tell the true story have been published \n     by Charles A. Beard, Charles Callan Tansill, Frederic R. \n     Sanborn, Harry Elmer Barnes, Admiral Robert A. Theobald, John \n     T. Flynn, George Morgenstern, Walter Trohan, Percy L. \n     Greaves, Jr. and many others.\n       I repeat to you once more Mr. Cannon, the success of the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor was not the result of inter-service \n     rivalries at Pearl Harbor. This success was caused by the \n     deliberate failure of Washington to give the Commanders in \n     Hawaii the information available in Washington to which they \n     were entitled. This information which was denied to the \n     Hawaiian Commanders was supplied to the American Commanders \n     in the Philippines and to the British.\n       Finally, Mr. Congressman, the officers and men stationed in \n     the Hawaiian Islands were fine, upstanding and well \n     disciplined young Americans whom the American People should \n     ever remember with gratitude and honor. In the attack \n     launched by the Japanese they showed themselves fearless, \n     resourceful and self-sacrificing and I shall always be proud \n     of having commanded such men but I cannot forgive those \n     responsible for the death of the more than 3000 soldiers, \n     sailors and marines who died for their country on the 7th of \n     December 1941 nor accept your insinuation that hangovers from \n     intemperance ashore on the night of 6 December may have \n     contributed to the delay in opening fire on the attacking \n     Japanese planes. As a matter of fact many anti-aircraft guns \n     on the ships were manned at the time of the attack and all \n     anti-aircraft guns of the fleet were in action in less than \n     ten minutes.\n       It is requested that you insert this letter in the \n     Congressional Record.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Husband E. Kimmel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Groton, Connecticut,\n\n                                                     July 8, 1958.\n     Mr. J. Edgar Hoover,\n     Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington 25, DC.\n       My Dear Mr. Hoover: Thank you for your letter of 25 June, \n     1958, and your references to the Robert's Commission, The \n     Army Pearl Harbor Report, the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Hewitt Inquiry. I am familiar with them, but all except the \n     Roberts Commission Report were long after the hearings of a \n     sub committee of the Appropriations Committee of the House of \n     Representatives in 1942. Congressman Cannon advised me the \n     information given to the Committee immediately after Pearl \n     harbor was from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       I judge from your letter there was no evidence in the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1942 to the effect that \n     General Short and I were not on speaking terms at the time of \n     the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n       Is this correct?\n       If this is not correct will you kindly cite the evidence in \n     order that I may learn the name of the individual who \n     instigated this infamous lie.\n           Yours very truly,\n     Husband E. Kimmel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  January 28 1962.\n       Mr. Cannon refused to publish my letters in the \n     Congressional Record, but some Congressmen friends of mine \n     did so.\n       I never received a reply to my letter of 8 July, 1958 to \n     Mr. J. Edgar Hoover and I have\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n     never been supplied with the name of the individual who is \n     alleged to have testified that General Short and I were not \n     on speaking terms.\n                                                Husband E. Kimmel.\n\n  Mr. REID. The letter was very moving, about what the whole family has \ngone through as a result of this incident. It affected the life of not \nonly the admiral but his entire family. I also extend my appreciation \nto the Senators who have been so tenacious in allowing this matter to \nmove forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcCain be listed as a cosponsor on the amendment by the Senator from \nGeorgia on the Montgomery GI bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the context of the Kimmel/Short matter, \nrecently I have had an opportunity to be visited by the former Chief of \nNaval Operations, Adm. James Holloway, who would strongly endorse the \naction that is before the Senate with regard to these two officers.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid \nof Nevada be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 378, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1027. REPORT ON SPARE PARTS AND REPAIR PARTS PROGRAM OF \n                   THE AIR FORCE FOR THE C-5 AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There exists a significant shortfall in the Nation's \n     current strategic airlift requirement, even though strategic \n     airlift remains critical to the national security strategy of \n     the United States.\n       (2) This shortfall results from the slow phase-out C-141 \n     aircraft and their replacement with C-17 aircraft and from \n     lower than optimal reliability rates for the C-5 aircraft.\n       (3) One of the primary causes of these reliability rates \n     for C-5 aircraft, and especially for operational unit \n     aircraft, is the shortage of spare repair parts. Over the \n     past 5 years, this shortage has been particularly evident in \n     the C-5 fleet.\n       (4) NMCS (Not Mission Capable for Supply) rates for C-5 \n     aircraft have increased significantly in the period between \n     1997 and 1999. At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, an average \n     of 7 through 9 C-5 aircraft were not available during that \n     period because of a lack of parts.\n       (5) Average rates of cannibalization of C-5 aircraft per \n     100 sorties of such aircraft have also increased during that \n     period and are well above the Air Mobility Command standard. \n     In any given month, this means devoting additional manhours \n     to cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft. At Dover Air Force Base, \n     an average of 800 to 1,000 additional manhours were required \n     for cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft during that period. \n     Cannibalizations are often required for aircraft that transit \n     through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those \n     that are based there.\n       (6) High cannibalization rates indicate a significant \n     problem in delivering spare parts in a timely manner and \n     systemic problems within the repair and maintenance process, \n     and also demoralize overworked maintenance crews.\n       (7) The C-5 aircraft remains an absolutely critical asset \n     in air mobility and airlifting heavy equipment and personnel \n     to both military contingencies and humanitarian relief \n     efforts around the world.\n       (8) Despite increased funding for spare and repair parts \n     and other efforts by the Air Force to mitigate the parts \n     shortage problem, Congress continues to receive reports of \n     significant cannibalizations to airworthy C-5 aircraft and \n     parts backlogs.\n       (b) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2001, and September \n     30, 2001, the Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the overall \n     status of the spare and repair parts program of the Air Force \n     for the C-5 aircraft. The report shall include the \n     following--\n       (1) a statement the funds currently allocated to parts for \n     the C-5 aircraft and the adequacy of such funds to meet \n     current and future parts and maintenance requirements for \n     that aircraft;\n       (2) a description of current efforts to address shortfalls \n     in parts for such aircraft, including an assessment of \n     potential short-term and long-term effects of such efforts;\n       (3) an assessment of the effects of such shortfalls on \n     readiness and reliability ratings for C-5 aircraft;\n       (4) a description of cannibalization rates for C-5 aircraft \n     and the manhours devoted to cannibalizations of such \n     aircraft; and\n       (5) an assessment of the effects of parts shortfalls and \n     cannibalizations with respect to C-5 aircraft on readiness \n     and retention.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that addresses \na problem that I have seen directly impact the moral and readiness of \nunits at the base I am most familiar with, Dover Air Force Base. First, \nI want to thank the committee for all of its hard work on this issue \nand for accepting this amendment. Despite the fact that we in Congress \nhave increased the funding levels for spare parts for the past three \nyears, the supply of spare and repair parts for the C-5's at Dover has \nbeen inadequate.\n  What does this mean? It means maintenance crews must work two-to-\nthree times as hard because they have to cannibalize parts from other \nairplanes. It means planes that should be performing missions are being \nused for parts so that other planes may fly. It means that planes spend \nbetween 250 and 300 days on average in depots, waiting for regular \nmaintenance, modernizations, and part replacements.\n  At Dover, from 1997 to 1999, an average of 7 to 9 C-5 aircraft were \nnot available because of a lack of parts. This is out of a total fleet \nat Dover of only 36 aircraft! In addition, the average manhours \nrequired for cannibalizations during that period was between 800 and \n1,000. Those are additional hours, above what is normally expected to \nreplace a part.\n  Think of that in terms of a typical 40 hour work week--that's 20 to \n25 additional weeks of work! Clearly, our maintenance teams cannot be \nexpected to continue working like this. These are highly skilled \nprofessionals who are willing to sacrifice for this nation because they \nknow how important the C-5's mission is to national security. It is \nabsolutely wrong of this nation to continue to ask them to make those \nsacrifices year in and year out. We must get them the tools, and in \nthis case, the parts, to do their jobs the right way.\n  In his testimony March 3, 2000 before the Readiness Subcommittee of \nthe Armed Service Committee, Secretary of the Air Force F. Whitten \nPeters talked about the problem, pointing out that, ``The C-5 related \nMICAP rate had increased over the last two quarters by 36 percent.'' \nJust to clarify, MICAP rate is defined by the Secretary ``as the total \nhours a maintenance technician waits for all the parts that have been \nordered to fix an aircraft.''\n  In that same testimony, the Secretary also said, ``The impact of \nthese additional MICAP hours has been a decline in readiness.''\n  The problem is not just a Dover problem. On March 7, 2000, Major \nGeneral Larry D. Northington, the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Budget) \nfor the Air Force testified on the problem of parts shortages \nthroughout the Air Force to Readiness Subcommittee. He pointed out that \nwe must look at all aspects of this problem. ``We must, therefore, \nexpect significant spares investments for along time to come. We also \nneed to understand that mission capable rates are not a product of \nspares funding alone. It requires dollars, deliveries of the right \nparts, trained and experienced technicians, and, over time, a sustained \neffort to upgrade the fleet to achieve higher levels of reliability and \nmaintainability.''\n  In other words, this is not a problem that can be solved by increased \nfunding alone. We must also look at the entire structure that is \nsupposed to be delivering parts and making sure we have adequate \nnumbers of experienced people to maintain aircraft. In addition, we \nhave to look at long-term modernization.\n  I am very pleased that this committee has fully supported the three \nC-5 modernization programs that are critical to improving reliability \nand maintainability--High Pressure Turbine Replacement, Avionics \nModernization Program, and Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining \nProgram.\n  Already, the High Pressure Turbine replacements that have occurred \nhas meant that engines stay on their wings\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\nat least double the time they had in the past before needing to be \nremoved for maintenance. This is an easy mid-term fix that is already \npaying for itself. For the longer term, new engines are essential. The \nCommittee authorized full funding for the necessary testing and design \nto put new engines on the C-5 and to replace antiquated parts that are \nparticularly prone to breaking.\n  The C-5 engine was one of the first large jet engines ever made. \nCommercial planes are a good 5 generations of engines beyond the C-5. \nIt is no wonder that there are no longer parts suppliers available. In \nfact, it can take up to two years to get parts because manufacturers no \nlonger make those parts and so new versions must be created. Two years \nis not acceptable. With new engines, reliability will increase and \noperations and maintenance costs will go down. This not only means \nenhanced readiness, it also means that our military personnel doesn't \nhave to work 20 to 25 extra weeks a year.\n  In addition, the committee fully supported the Avionics Modernization \nProgram. This program will ensure that C-5's can fly in operationally \nmore efficient airspace under the new Global Air Traffic Management \nSystem. In addition, this program improves the safety of aircrews by \ninstalling systems like Traffic Collision and Avoidance Systems (TCAS) \nand enhanced all weather navigation systems. Clearly, as the committee \nrecognized, we cannot justify delaying these important upgrades to the \nentire C-5 fleet.\n  Until these modernization programs are completed though, the \nimmediate problem is the day-to-day maintenance needs. Foremost among \nthose needs is that parts be available to keep planes flying and that \nthe cannibalization rates be reduced.\n  The current situation cannot continue. It daily hurts the morale of \nour personnel and lowers the readiness of our military force. The C-5 \nis the long-legged workhorse of our strategic airlift fleet. It carries \nmore cargo and heavier cargo further than any other plane in our \ninventory. It is what gets our warfighters and their heavy equipment to \nthe fight. It is also what gets humanitarian assistance to needy \nvictims quickly enough to make a difference.\n  My amendment simply requires the Secretary of the Air Force provide \ntwo reports to Congress, one by January 31 and one by September 30 of \nnext year on the exact situation of C-5 parts shortages, what is being \ndone to fix this problem, what the impacts of the problem are for \naircraft readiness and reliability ratings, and what the impacts of the \nproblem are for personnel readiness and retention. It is my hope that \nsuch a thorough review will allow us to take the necessary steps to fix \nthis problem once and for all. I know that the Air Force is concerned \nand taking steps to improve the parts shortage problem. I want to make \nsure that those efforts are comprehensive and that the hardworking men \nand women at Dover Air Force Base get some relief.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment offered by my \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Joe Biden, and myself. This amendment \ndeals with the vital importance of the C-5 Galaxy to our nation's \nstrategic airlift capability. No other aircraft has the capabilities of \nthis proven workhorse, and as we look to prepare our military for the \nfuture we must not overlook the need to ensure the Galaxy has the parts \nnecessary to perform safely and effectively.\n  I would like to commend the chairman and the ranking member for \naccepting this very important amendment, which requires the Secretary \nof the Air Force to report on ``the overall status of the spare and \nrepair parts program of the Air Force for the C-5 aircraft.''\n  The C-5 is the largest cargo transport plane in our Air Force. It is \nproven, and we depend on it to perform a vital role in our nation's \nStrategic Airlift. Currently, spare parts shortages have resulted in \nthe grounding of nearly one quarter of the C-5 fleet. Needless to say, \nthis is a serious problem.\n  The report required by this amendment will detail the funds currently \nallocated to parts for the C-5, the adequacy of those funds to meet \nfuture requirements for the C-5, the descriptions of current efforts to \naddress short-term and long-term shortfalls in parts, an assessment of \nthe effects of the shortfalls on C-5 readiness and reliability ratings, \na description on cannibalization rates for the C-5 aircraft and man \nhours devoted to cannibalizations, and the effects of these shortfalls \non readiness and retention.\n  I believe this report will shed light on a problem of which my \ncolleague from Delaware and I are painfully aware. Dover Air Force \nBase, in my state of Delaware, is home to 36 C-5 Galaxies. At Dover, \nthe spare parts shortage has truly hit home.\n  ``Cann Birds'', or C-5 Galaxies that have been cannibalized for their \nparts, is an unfortunate sight on the base. Men and women at Dover must \nspend long hours cannibalizing aircraft to find parts necessary for \nother C-5s. These long hours have led to increased frustration and \nlowered morale among some of the hardest working and most valuable \npeople in our Air Force and civilian personnel. We are losing expertise \nin this area due to this decreased morale.\n  The lack of spare parts is not the only issue. Often, when the need \nfor a part is recognized, there is a long lag-time between requests for \nparts and delivery. I hope that this amendment, by shining light on \nthese problems and requiring the Air Force to examine the issues, will \nresult in greater understanding of how to reach a solution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3234) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are several colleagues desiring to \nbe recognized for debate on this bill. Senator Levin and I will proceed \nto ask of the Chair that a group of amendments be adopted en bloc.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nan amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2549) that \nwould establish a commission to assess the future of the United States \naerospace industry and to make recommendations for actions by the \nFederal Government to improve this industries global competitiveness.\n  The modern aerospace industry fulfills vital roles for our nation. It \nis a pillar of the business community that employs 800,000 skilled \nworkers. It is an engine of economic growth that generated a net trade \nsurplus of $37 billion in 1998, larger than any other industrial \nsector. It is a working model of private-public partnership, yielding \ncommercial and military benefits that have enhanced our communication \nand transportation networks while enabling the aerospace dominance \ndemonstrated in both Kosovo and the Gulf War. And its well-known \nproducts, from the Boeing 777 to the Blackhawk helicopter to the Space \nShuttle, serve as fitting symbols of American preeminence in an inter-\nconnected world that thrives on speed and technology.\n  Unfortunately, this key industrial sector is facing new challenges to \nits leadership role in the global economy. Since 1985, foreign \ncompetition has cut the American share of the worldwide aerospace \nmarket from 72 percent to 56 percent. In order to remain competitive, \nwe must reevaluate industrial regulations enacted during the Cold War, \nthat might hamper innovation, flexibility, and growth. We must \nreconsider our defense research priorities, to counteract the 50% \ndecline in domestic funding for aerospace research and development \nduring the last decade. We must reexamine the rules that govern export \nof aerospace products and technologies, and develop policies that \npermit access to global markets while protecting national security. we \nmust assess all of these areas in light of new trade agreements that \nmay require adjustments to federal regulations and policies. \nUltimately, we must assess the future of the aerospace industry and \nensure that government policy plays a positive role in its development.\n  To accomplish this goal, this amendment calls for the creation of a \nPresidential commission empowered to recommend action to the federal \ngovernment regarding the future of the aerospace industry. The \ncommission shall be composed of experts in aerospace manufacturing, \nnational security, and related economic issues, as well as \nrepresentatives of organized labor. The commission is directed to study \neconomic and national security issues confronting the aerospace \nindustry, such as the state of government funding for aerospace \nresearch and procurement, the rules governing exportation of aerospace \ngoods and technologies, the effect of current taxation and trade \npolicies on the aerospace industry, and the adequacy of aerospace \nscience and engineering education in institutions of higher learning. I \nurge the Congress to support the creation of the Commission and the \nnext President to support its activities and heed its counsel. By \ncreating such a commission and through careful consideration of these \ncomplex issues, we can ensure that this valuable American industry \nsoars into the 21st century, turbulence-free.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3241\n\n(Purpose: To guarantee the right of all active duty military personnel \nmerchant mariners, and their dependents to vote in Federal, State, and \n                            local elections)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, last year, I introduced S. 763, a bill \nthat would correct a long-standing injustice to the widows of our \nmilitary retirees. Although my bill was accepted by the Senate as an \namendment to the fiscal year 2000 defense authorization bill, it was \ndropped during the conference at the insistence of the House conferees.\n  Today, I am again offering S. 763 as an amendment to the national \nDefense authorization bill. My amendment would immediately increase the \nminimum Survivor Benefit Plan annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of \nthe Survivor Benefit Plan for survivors over the age 62. The amendment \nwould provide a further increase to 45 percent of covered retired pay \nas of October 1, 2004.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that each senator has received mail \nfrom military spouses expressing their dismay that they are not \nreceiving the 55 percent of their husband's retirement pay as \nadvertised in the Survivor Benefit Plan literature provided by the \nmilitary. The reason that they do not receive the 55 percent of retired \npay is that current law mandates that at age 62 this amount be reduced \neither by the account of the Survivors Social Security benefit or to 35 \npercent of the SBP. This law is especially irksome to those retirees \nwho joined the plan when it was first offered in 1972. These service \nmembers were never informed of the age-62 reduction until they had made \nan irrevocable decision to participate. Many retirees and their \nspouses, as the constituent mail attests, believed their premium \npayments would guarantee 55 percent of retired pay for the life of the \nsurvivor. It is not hard to imagine the shock and financial \ndisadvantage these men and women who so loyally served the Nation in \ntroubled spots throughout the world undergo when they learn of the \nannuity reduction.\n  Mr. President, uniformed services retirees pay too much for the \navailable SBP benefit both, compared to what is promised and what is \noffered to other federal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was \nenacted in 1972, the Congress intended that the government would pay 40 \npercent of the cost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal \ncivilian survivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \ngovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe federal civilian SBP, which has a 42 percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50 \npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the federal \ncivilian retiree.\n  Mr. President, the bill that we are currently considering contains \nseveral\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\ninitiatives to restore to our military retirees benefits that they have \nearned, but which gradually were eroded over the past years. My \namendment would add a small, but important, earned benefit for our \nmilitary retirees, especially their survivors.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senators Lott, Cleland, Cochran, \nLandrieu, Snowe, McCain, Sessions, Inouye, and Dodd for joining me as \ncosponsors of this amendment and ask for its adoption.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3244\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate an inequity in the applicability of early \n  retirement eligibility requirements to military reserve technicians)\n\n       On page 236, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 646.

Mr. President, my amendment affects every State in the \nNation--the Bond-Bryan amendment to S. 2549. As co-chair of the Senate \nGuard Caucus, I firmly believe that this important piece of legislation \nis critical to meeting the number one priority of the National Guard--\nfull-time support. As you know, the National Guard relies heavily upon \nfull-time employees to ensure readiness. By performing their critical \nduties on a daily basis, these\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\nhard-working men and women ensure drill and annual training remain \nfocused on preparation for war fighting and conducting peacetime \nmissions.\n  During the cold war, Guard and Reserve forces were underutilized. \nDuring the 1980's, for example, they numbered more than one million \npersonnel but contributed support to the active forces at a rate of \nfewer than 1 million work days per year.\n  At the end of the cold war, force structure and personnel endstrength \nwere drastically cut in all the active services. Almost immediately, \nthe nation discovered that the post-cold-war world is a complex, \ndangerous, and expensive place. Deployments for contingency operations, \npeacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and \ncounter-terrorism operations increased dramatically. Most recently, our \nforces have been called upon to destroy the capability of Saddam \nHussein and his forces, bring peace and stability to Haiti, force \nSlobodan Milosevic and his forces out of Kosovo, ensure a safe, stable \nand secure environment in the Balkans, and rescue and rebuild from \nnatural disasters at home and abroad.\n  Because of the increased deployments and the reduction in the active \nforce, we became significantly more dependent on the Army and Air \nNational Guard. In striking contrast to cold war levels of contributory \nsupport, today's Guard and Reserve forces are providing approximately \n13 million work days of support to the active components on an annual \nbasis--a thirteen-fold increase and equivalent to the addition of some \n35,000 personnel to active component end strength, or two Army \ndivisions. For example, the 49th Armored Division from the Lone Star \nState is currently leading operations in Kosovo, and the Army just \nidentified four more Guard units for deployment to Kosovo.\n  With this shift in reliance from the active force to the Guard came \nthe obligation to increase Guard staffing to keep pace with the \nexpanded mission. The Army and Air National Guard established increased \nfull-time staffing as their number one priority. We agreed with them, \nbut we have not yet held up our end of the bargain. We gave them the \nmission; we must now give them the personnel resources to accomplish \nit.\n  The Department of Defense has identified a shortfall in full-time \nmanning of 1,052 ``AGRs'' (Active Guard/Reserves) and 1,543 \nTechnicians. Frankly, I agree with their numbers, but I do not see how \nwe can afford immediately to increase their staffing to those levels. \nAccordingly, the Bond-Bryan amendment proposes an incremental increase \nin the number of full-time positions. We ask that S. 2549 be amended to \nprovide for an additional 526 ``AGRs'' (Active Guard/Reserves) and 771 \nTechnicians. As you can see, this is about half of what the Guard \nrequested, and far less than what was requested in the past. We believe \nthese additional positions will give the Guard the minimum it needs to \ndo the job, while providing the opportunity to reexamine the situation \nduring the next fiscal year.\n  When we expand the mission, when we increase operating tempo, and \nwhen we ask for greater effort; we have to realize that increased \nfunding is often necessary and appropriate. In this case, we have \nattempted to provide the minimum additional personnel to accomplish a \nmission we previously assigned but did not fully resource. Your support \nfor this amendment sends a strong message to your constituents and the \nGuard units in your state that you support the National Guard in its \nsignificant role in our Nation's defense, and that you are willing to \ngive the men and women in its ranks the resources to do the job.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner, Senator Levin, my co-chair, \nSenator Bryan, and our esteemed colleagues for your support of this \ncritical issue.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, as well as the distinguished ranking \nmember, for agreeing to accept this critical amendment relating to \nfull-time manning for the National Guard. Both of these leaders have \nbeen strongly supportive of our efforts, past and present, to ensure \nthat the National Guard has the resources it needs to perform its dual \nmissions, and I want to express my personal gratitude for their \nleadership and support of the National Guard over the course of several \nyears.\n  As co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, there is clearly \nno higher priority for the National Guard in this fiscal year than the \nneed to provide sufficient resources for full-time operational support. \nThese full-time personnel are the backbone of the National Guard, and \nmake no mistake about it, if we fail to provide sufficient full-time \nsupport, there will be a noticeable and precipitous decline in the \nability of the National Guard to fulfill its mission both to the states \nand as part of the National Force Structure.\n  The amendment we are offering today will authorize $38 million to \nprovide an additional 526 AGRs and 771 Technicians for the Army \nNational Guard. Frankly, Mr. President, I would have liked to have gone \nfurther, and provided the Guard with the personnel they need to achieve \nthe minimal personnel levels identified by the National Guard Bureau of \n23,500 AGRs and 25,500 Technicians. But like the incremental increases \nthat were provided last year, this amendment represents an important \nstep towards achieving that overall goal.\n  Our amendment has well over 60 cosponsors from both sides of the \naisles. Not many issues attract this much support from across the \nideological spectrum, and I interpret that as a Senate endorsement of \nthe critical missions the National Guard performs, ranging from \nproviding important emergency and other support services to their \nstates, to participating in international peacekeeping missions across \nthe globe, including Bosnia and Kosovo. It should be noted that both \nthe Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader are original \ncosponsors, as are the chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee. The amendment is also supported by the \nNational Guard Bureau, the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the Adjutants General Association of the United States, and \nother organizations.\n  The National Guard represents 34 percent of our Total Force Army \nStrength and 19 percent of our Total Air Force Strength. Nearly half a \nmillion Americans serve in the National Guard, playing a critical \ncomplementary role to their active duty counterparts, and we have an \nobligation and a responsibility to make sure every Guard unit and \narmory across the country has the support personnel it requires to \nfunction efficiently and effectively.\n  I am hopeful that with such broad, bipartisan support from the \nmembers of the Senate and the Armed Services Committee, we can continue \nto provide the resources required by the National Guard that will allow \nthese dedicated Americans to perform their mission in support of the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank my fellow co-chairman of the \nSenate National Guard Caucus, Senator Bond, for his authorship and \nleadership on this amendment. Senator Bond continues to demonstrate an \nimpassioned commitment to the National Guard, our reserve components, \nand all of our Armed Forces. I also wish to recognize and thank Mr. \nJames Pitchford and Ms. Shelby Bell of Senator Bond's staff for their \nhard work on this successful, bipartisan effort.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3250\n\n(Purpose: To provide compensation and benefits to Department of energy \n     employees and contractor employees for exposure to beryllium, \n                 radiation, and other toxic substances)\n\n  (The text of the Amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this important step to \ncompensate workers who became sick from occupational exposure to \nberyllium, radiation, and other toxic substances as part of the Cold \nWar build-up. I commend my colleagues Senator Thompson, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator DeWine, and Senator Bingaman for their leadership on \nthis issue.\n  During the cold war, thousands of men and women who worked at the \nnation's atomic weapons plants were exposed to unknown hazards. Many \nwere exposed to dangerous radioactive and chemical materials at far \ngreater levels than their employers revealed. The debilitating, and \noften fatal, illnesses\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nsuffered by these workers came in many forms of cancer, as well as \nother illnesses that are difficult to diagnose. This provision brings \nlong overdue relief to these workers and their families.\n  The Department of energy investigated this issue. It found that \nworkers who served for years to maintain and strengthen our defenses \nduring the cold War were not informed or protected against the health \nhazards they faced at work. Only during the Clinton Administration has \nthe government openly acknowledged that these workers were exposed to \nmaterials that were much more radioactive--and much more deadly--than \npreviously revealed.\n  I commend Secretary Richardson for his leadership in bringing this \nissue to light, and for his efforts to close this tragic chapter in the \nnation's history for the thousands of workers and their families whose \nlives were affected.\n  On of the earliest instances of the health dangers of beryllium \noccurred during World War II at the Sylvania Company in Salem, \nMassachusetts. At this plant, doctors first identified cases of \nberyllium disease, an acute and often fatal lung illness that seemed \nsimilar to tuberculosis. At the time, the company used beryllium in \nmanufacturing fluorescent light bulbs.\n  Some of the earliest radiation experiments were conducted at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge as part of the \nManhattan Project. Scientists at MIT were also among the first to \nconduct experiments with beryllium oxide ceramics for the Manhattan \nProject and the Atomic Energy Corporation. Many of the first cases of \nberyllium disease occurred among these scientists.\n  We have an opportunity today to remedy the wrongs suffered by these \nDepartment of Energy workers. Our amendment creates a basic framework \nfor compensation. It is the least we can do for workers who made such \ngreat sacrifices for our country during the cold war. They have already \nwaited too long for this relief.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment along with \na bipartisan group of Senators, including Senator Bingaman, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Kennedy, Senator DeWine, Senator Reid, Senator \nThurmond, Senator Bryan, Senator Frist, Senator Murray, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Harkin, and Senator Stevens.\n  Mr. President, watching President Clinton's summit meeting with \nRussian President Vladimir Putin last weekend, I think we were all \nreminded of how far our two nations have come over the past decade, \nsince President Reagan implored President Gorbachev to ``tear down (the \nBerlin) Wall,'' and President Bush presided over its destruction. While \ndangerous new threats have emerged, the Cold War that dominated the \npolitics of our security for four decades is over, and the United \nStates won. We should be proud of that victory and we should never \nforget the strength and resolve through which it was achieved.\n  But it has become clear in recent months that that victory came at a \nhigh price for some of those who were most responsible for producing \nit. I am talking about workers in our nuclear weapons facilities run by \nthe Department of Energy or their contractors. We now have evidence \nthat, in at least some instances, the federal government that they had \ndedicated themselves to serving put these workers in harm's way without \ntheir knowledge.\n  I first became concerned about this issue three years ago when my \nhometown newspaper, the Nashville Tennessean, published a series of \nstories describing a pattern of unexplained illnesses in the Oak Ridge, \nTennessee area. Many of the current and former Oak Ridge workers \nprofiled in the stories believed that their illnesses were related to \ntheir service at the Department of Energy site. In 1997, I asked the \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control to send a team to Oak Ridge \nto assess the situation and to try to determine if what we were seeing \nthere was truly unique. Unfortunately, in the end, the CDC did not take \na broad enough look at the situation to really answer the questions \nthat had been raised.\n  And that, of course, has been a pattern at Oak Ridge and at many DOE \nsites over the years. Countless health studies have been done, some on \nvery narrow populations and some on larger ones, some showing some \ncorrelations and some not able to reach any conclusions at all. The \ndata is mixed, some of it is flawed, and we are left with a situation \nthat is confusing and from which it is very difficult to draw any \ndefinite conclusions.\n  And yet, there is a growing realization that there are illnesses \namong current and former DOE workers that logic tells us are related to \ntheir service at these weapons sites. For example, hundreds of current \nand former workers in the DOE complex have been diagnosed with Chronic \nBeryllium Disease. Many more have so-called ``beryllium sensitivity,'' \nwhich often develops into Chronic Beryllium Disease. The only way to \ncontract either of these conditions is to be exposed to beryllium \npowder. The only entities that use beryllium in that form are the \nDepartment of Energy and the Department of Defense.\n  And there are other examples, perhaps less clear cut, but certainly \nworthy of concern. Uranium, plutonium, and a variety of heavy metals \nfound in people's bodies. Anecdotes about hazardous working conditions \nwhere people were unprotected against both exposures they knew were \nthere and exposures of which they were not aware. It's time for the \nfederal government to stop automatically denying any responsibility and \nface up to the fact that it appears as though it made at least some \npeople sick.\n  The question now is: what do we do about it? And how do we make sure \nit never happens again?\n  This amendment attempts to answer the first of those two questions. \nIt would set up a program, administered by the Department of Labor, to \nprovide compensation to employees who are suffering from chronic \nberyllium disease, or from a radiation-related cancer that is \ndetermined to likely have been caused by exposures received in the \ncourse of their service at a DOE facility. It would also provide a \nmechanism for employees suffering from exposures to hazardous chemicals \nand other toxic substances in the workplace to gain access to state \nworkers' compensation benefits, which are generally denied for such \nillnesses at present.\n  Mr. President, our amendment takes a science-based approach. It is \nnot a blank check. It does not provide benefits to anyone and everyone \nwho worked at a DOE facility who has taken ill.\n  In the case of beryllium, we can say with certainty that if someone \nhas chronic beryllium disease and they worked around beryllium powder, \ntheir disease is work-related; there is no other way to get it.\n  The same is not true of cancer, of course. A physician cannot look at \na tumor and say with certainty that it was caused by exposure to \nradiation, or by smoking, or by a genetic disposition, or by any other \nfactor. However, we do know that radiation in high doses has been \nlinked to certain cancers, and we now know that some workers at DOE \nfacilities were exposed to radiation, often with inadequate \nprotections.\n  What this amendment does is employ a mechanism developed by \nscientists at the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer \nInstitute to determine whether a worker's cancer is at least as likely \nas not related to exposures received in the course of their employment \nat a DOE facility. The model takes into account the type of cancer, the \ndose received, the worker's age at the time of exposure, sex, lifestyle \nfactors such as whether the worker smoked, and other relevant factors.\n  In many, if not most, cases, it should be possible to determine with \na sufficient degree of accuracy the radiation dose a particular worker \nor group of workers received. However, in some cases--because the \nDepartment of Energy kept inadequate or incomplete records, altered \nsome of its records, and even tampered with the dosimetry badges that \nworkers were supposed to wear--it may not be possible to estimate with \nany degree of certainty the radiation dose a certain worker received. \nFor these workers, who are really the victims of DOE's bad behavior, \nour amendment provides an expedited track to compensation for a \nspecified list of radiation-related cancers.\n  Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs Committee, which I chair, \nheld a\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nhearing on this issue back in March. We heard testimony from several \nworkers from Oak Ridge, Tennessee and Piketon, Ohio who are suffering \nfrom devastating illnesses as a result of their service to our country. \nAnd of course, it is not just the workers who are affected--it is their \nentire family that suffers emotionally, financially, and even \nphysically.\n  In the end, we must remember that these workers were helping to win \nthe cold war, to defend our Nation and protect our security. They were \npatriotic and proud of the work that they were doing. If the Federal \nGovernment made mistakes that jeopardized their health and safety, then \nwe need to do what we can to make it right. That is what this amendment \nwould do. I want to thank the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, for his support, as well as Senator Levin. I urge the \nrest of my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nThompson and others in offering this strongly bipartisan amendment. It \naddresses occupational illnesses scientifically found to be associated \nwith the DOE weapons complex, that have occurred and are now occurring \nbecause of activities during the cold war.\n  This amendment is a joint effort of a bipartisan group of Senators. \nSpecifically, it has been put together by staff for myself, Senator \nFred Thompson, Senator George Voinovich, Senator Mike DeWine, and \nSenator Ted Kennedy. We have worked with the administration, with \nworker groups, and with manufacturers. The staff have met with Armed \nServices Committee staff during the development of this amendment, and \nI want to acknowledge the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee for their support for this amendment.\n  The workers in the DOE nuclear weapons complex, both at the \nproduction plants and the laboratories, helped us win the cold war. But \nthat effort left a tragic environmental and human legacy. We are \nspending billions of dollars each year on the environmental part--\ncleaning up the physical infrastructure that was contaminated. But we \nalso need to focus on the human legacy.\n  This amendment is an attempt to put right a situation that should not \nhave occurred. But it proposes to do so in a way that is based on sound \nscience.\n  The amendment focuses federal held on three classes of injured \nworkers.\n  The first group is workers who were involved with beryllium. \nBeryllium is a non-radioactive metal that provokes, in some people, a \nhighly allergic lung reaction. The lungs become scarred, and no longer \nfunction.\n  The second group is workers who dug the tunnels for underground \nnuclear tests and are today suffering from chronic silicosis due to \ntheir occupational exposures to silica, which were not adequately \ncontrolled by DOE.\n  The third group of workers are those who had dangerous doses of \nradiation on the job.\n  These workers were employed at numerous current and former DOE \nfacilities. We have included a general definition of DOE and other type \nof facilities in the legislation, in lieu of including a list that \nmight be incomplete, but for purposes of helping in the implementation \nof this amendment, if enacted into law, I would like to ask unanimous \nconsent that a non-exclusive list of the facilities intended to be \ncovered under this amendment be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. For beryllium workers, there are tests today that can \ndetect the first signs of trouble, called beryllium sensitivity, and \nalso the actual impairment, called chronic beryllium disease. If you \nhave beryllium sensitivity, you are at a higher risk for developing \nchronic beryllium disease. You need annual check-ups with tests that \nare expensive. If you develop chronic beryllium disease, you might be \ndisabled or die.\n  This amendment sets up a federal workers' compensation program to \nprovide medical benefits to workers who acquired beryllium sensitivity \nas a result of their work for DOE. It provides both medical benefits \nand lost wage protection for workers who suffer disability or death \nfrom chronic beryllium disease.\n  For radiation, the situation is more complex. Radiation is proven to \ncause cancer in high doses. But when you look at a cancer tumor, you \ncan't tell for sure whether it was caused by an alpha particle of \nradiation from the workplace, a molecule of a carcinogen in something \nyou ate, or even a stray cosmic ray from outer space. But scientists \ncan make a good estimate of the types of radiation doses that make it \nmore likely than not that your cancer was caused by a workplace \nexposure.\n  This amendment puts the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nin charge of making the causal connection between specific workplace \nexposures to radiation and cancer. Within the HHS, it is envisioned by \nthis amendment that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and \nHealth (or NIOSH) take the lead for the tasks assigned by this \namendment. Thus, the definition section of the amendment specifies that \nthe Secretary of HHS act with the assistance of the Director of NIOSH. \nThis assignment follows a decision made in DOE during the Bush \nAdministration, and ratified by the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 1993, to give NIOSH the lead in identifying levels of \nexposure at DOE sites that present employees with significant health \nrisks.\n  HHS was also given a Congressional mandate, in the Orphan Drug Act, \nto develop and publish radioepidemiolog-\nical tables that estimate ``the likelihood that persons who have or \nhave had any of the radiation related cancers and who have received \nspecific doses prior to the onset of such disease developed cancer as a \nresult of those doses.'' I would like to ask unanimous consent that a \nmore detailed discussion of how the bill envisions these guidelines \nwould be used be included as an exhibit at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 2.]\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Under guidelines developed by the HHS and used in this \namendment, if your radiation does was high enough to make it at least \nas likely as not that your cancer was DOE-work-related, you would be \neligible for compensation for lost wages and medical benefits.\n  The HHS-based method will work for many of the workers at DOE sites. \nBut it won't work for a significant minority who were exposed to \nradiation, but for whom it would be infeasible to reconstruct their \ndose.\n  There are several reasons why reconstructing a dose might be--this \ninfeasibility might exist. First, relevant records of dose may be \nlacking, or might not exist altogether. Second, there might be a way to \nreconstruct the dose, but it would be prohibitively expensive to do so. \nFinally, it might take so long to reconstruct a dose for a group of \nworkers that they will all be dead before we have an answer that can be \nused to determine their eligibility.\n\n  One of the workers who testified at my Los Alamos hearing might be an \nexample of a worker who could fall into the cracks of a system that \noperated solely on dose histories. He was a supervisor at what was \ncalled the ``hot dump'' at Los Alamos. All sorts of radioactive \nmaterials were taken there to be disposed of. It is hard to reconstruct \nwho handled what. And digging up the dump to see what was there would \nnot only be very expensive, it would expose new workers to radiation \nrisks that could be large.\n  There are a few groups of workers that we know, today, belong in this \ncategory. They are specifically mentioned in the definition of Special \nExposure Cohort. For other workers to be placed in this special \ncategory, the decision that it was infeasible to reconstruct their dose \nwould have to be made both by HHS and by an independent external \nadvisory committee of radiation, health, and workplace safety experts. \nWe allow groups of workers to petition to be considered by the advisory \ncommittee for inclusion in this group. Once a group of workers was \nplaced in the category, it would be eligible for compensation for a \nfixed list of radiation-related cancers.\n  The program in this amendment also allows, in section 3515, for a \nlump-sum payment, combined with ongoing medical coverage under section \n8103 of title 5, United States Code. This could be\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nhelpful, for example, in settling old cases of disability. It may be a \ngood deal for survivors of deceased workers whose deaths were related \nto their work at DOE sites.\n  The provisions of the workers' compensation program in this amendment \nare largely modeled after the Federal Employee's Compensation Program \nor FECA, which is found in chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code. \nIn many parts of the amendment, entire sections of FECA are \nincorporated by reference. In other sections, portions of FECA are \nrestated in more general language to account for the fact that the \nspecific language in FECA would cover only Federal employees, while in \nthis amendment we are covering Federal contractor and subcontractor \nemployees, as well. In some instances, we modified provisions in FECA \nto address known problems in its current implementation or to reflect \ncurrent standards of administrative law. One example of this is a \ndecision not to incorporate section 8128(b) of title 5, United States \nCode, into this amendment. That section absolutely precludes judicial \nreview of decisions concerning a claim by the Department of Labor. \nSince such decisions involve the substantive rights of individuals \nbeing conferred by this amendment, and since they are made through an \ninformal administrative process, it seems appropriate to the sponsors \nof this amendment that there be external review to guard against, for \nexample, arbitrary and capricious conduct in processing a claim.\n  The amendment also had numerous administrative provisions to ensure a \nfair process and to guard against double compensation for the same \ninjury.\n  As the sponsors were developing this amendment, we received a lot of \ninterest in federal compensation for exposure to other toxic \nsubstances. This amendment does not provide federal compensation for \nchemical hazards in the DOE workplace, but does authorize DOE to work \nwith States to get workers with adverse health effects from their \nexposure to these substances into State worker compensation programs. \nIt also would commission a GAO study of this approach so that we can \nevaluate, in the context of a future bill, whether such an approach is \neffective.\n  We have a duty to take care of sick workers from the nuclear weapons \ncomplex today. It is a doable task, and a good use of our national \nwealth at a time of budget surpluses. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bipartisan amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Examples of DOE and Atomic Weapons Employer Facilities That Would Be \n            Included Under the Definitions in This Amendment\n\n\n                 (Not an Exclusive List of Facilities)\n\n       Atomic Weapons Employer Facility: The following facilities \n     that provided uranium conversion or manufacturing services \n     would be among those included under the definition in section \n     3503(a)(4):\n       Allied Signal Uranium Hexafluoride Facility, Metropolis, \n     Illinois.\n       Linde Air Products facilities, Tonowanda, New York.\n       Mallinckrodt Chemical Company facilities, St. Louis, \n     Missouri.\n       Nuclear Fuels Services facilities, Erwin, Tennessee.\n       Reactive Metals facilities, Ashtabula, Ohio.\n       Department of Energy Facility: The following facilities \n     (including any predecessor or successor facilities to such \n     facilities) would be among those included under the \n     definition in section 3503(a)(15):\n       Amchitka Island Test Site, Amchitka, Alaska.\n       Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho and Illinois.\n       Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, New York.\n       Chupadera Mesa, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.\n       Fermi Nuclear Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois.\n       Fernald Feed Materials Production Center, Fernald, Ohio.\n       Hanford Works, Richland, Washington.\n       Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho.\n       Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, Burlington, Iowa.\n       Kansas City Plant, Kansas City, Missouri.\n       Latty Avenue Properties, Hazelwood, Missouri.\n       Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, \n     California.\n       Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, \n     California.\n       Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico, \n     including related sites such as Acid/Pueblo Canyons and Bayo \n     Canyon.\n       Marshall Islands Nuclear Test Sites, but only for period \n     after December 31, 1958.\n       Maywood Site, Maywood, New Jersey.\n       Middlesex Sampling Plant, Middlesex, New Jersey.\n       Mound Facility, Miamisburg, Ohio.\n       Niagara Falls Storage Site, Lewiston, New York.\n       Nevada Test Site, Mercury, Nevada.\n       Oak Ridge Facility, Tennessee, including the K-25 Plant, \n     the Y-12 Plant, and the X-10 Plant.\n       Paducah Plant, Paducah, Kentucky.\n       Pantex Plant, Amarillo, Texas.\n       Pinellas Plant, St. Petersburg, Florida.\n       Portsmouth Plant, Piketon, Ohio.\n       Rocky Flats Plant, Golden, Colorado.\n       Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico.\n       Santa Susanna Facilities, Santa Susanna, California.\n       Savannah River Site, South Carolina.\n       Waste Isolation Pilot Project, Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n       Weldon Spring Plant, Weldon Spring, Missouri.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n           Determining ``Causation'' for Radiation and Cancer\n\n       Different cancers have different relative sensitivities to \n     radiation.\n       In 1988, the White Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     endorsed the use by the Veterans Administration of the \n     concept of ``probability of causation'' (PC) in adjudicating \n     claims of injury due to exposure to ionizing radiation. Given \n     that a radiogenic cancer cannot be differentiated from a \n     ``spontaneously'' occurring one or one caused by other \n     dietary, environmental and/or lifestyle factors, the PC--that \n     is, the ``likelihood'' that a diagnosed cancer has been \n     ``caused'' by a given radiation exposure or dose--has to be \n     determined indirectly.\n       To this end, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was \n     tasked to develop radioepidemiology tables. These tables, \n     which are currently being updated by the NIH, include data on \n     35 cancers compared to the 13 cancers in the original tables \n     from 1985. These tables account for the fact that different \n     cancers have different relative sensitivities to ionizing \n     radiation.\n       The determination of a PC takes into account the radiation \n     dose and dose rate, the types of radiation exposure \n     (external, internal), age at exposure, sex, duration of \n     exposure, elapsed time following exposure, and (for lung \n     cancer only) smoking history. Because a calculated PC is \n     subject to a variety of statistical and methodological \n     uncertainties, a ``confidence interval'' around the PC is \n     also determined.\n       Thus, a PC is calculated as a single, ``point estimate'' \n     along with a 99% confidence interval which bounds the \n     uncertainty associated with that estimate. If we have 99% \n     certainty that the upper bound of a PC is greater than or \n     equal to 0.5 (i.e., a 50% likelihood of causality), then the \n     cancer is considered at least as likely as not to have been \n     caused by the radiation dose used to calculate the PC.\n       For example, for a given worker with a particular cancer \n     and radiation exposure history, the PC may by 0.38 with a 99% \n     confidence interval of 0.21 to 0.55. This means that it is \n     38% likely that this worker's cancer was caused by their \n     radiation dose, and we can say with 99% confidence that this \n     estimate is between 21% and 55%. Since the upper bound, 55% \n     is greater than 50%, this person's cancer would be considered \n     to be at least as likely as not to have been caused by \n     exposure to radiation, and the person would be eligible for \n     benefits under the proposed program.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators DeWine, Thompson, Frist, Thurmond, Murkowski, Bingaman, Reid, \nBryan, Kennedy, Harkin, and Murray in support of an important amendment \nthat will provide financial and medical compensation to Department of \nEnergy workers who have been made ill while working to provide for the \ndefense of the United States.\n  Since the end of World War II, at facilities all across America, tens \nof thousands of dedicated men and women in our civilian federal \nworkforce helped keep our military fully supplied and our nation fully \nprepared to face any threat from our adversaries around the world. The \nsuccess of these workers in meeting this challenge is measured in part \nwith the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  However, for many of these workers, their success came at a high \nprice. They sacrificed their health, and even their lives--in many \ninstances without knowing the risks they were facing--to preserve our \nliberty. I believe these men and women have paid a high price for our \nfreedom, and in their time of need, this nation has a moral obligation \nto provide some financial and medical assistance to these Cold War \nveterans.\n  Last month, I introduced legislation, along with many of the Senators \nwho have co-sponsored this amendment, that would provide financial \ncompensation to Department of Energy workers whose impaired health has \nbeen caused\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nby exposure to beryllium, radiation or other hazardous substances. Our \nbill, S. 2519, the ``Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \nAct of 2000,'' also provides that compensation be paid to survivors of \nworkers who have died and suffered from an illness resulting from \nexposure to these substances.\n  Need for this type of legislation was further solidified when on May \n25th, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson released a Department of Energy \nreport on safety and management practices at the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio. The report, which was based on an \nindependent investigation authorized by Secretary Richardson, \nhighlighted unsafe conditions at Piketon and deemed past management \npractices as shoddy and in many cases, inadequate to protect the health \nand safety of Piketon's workforce. The report confirmed many of the \nfears that these workers have quietly faced for years, and it is why it \nis imperative that we pass legislation this year that will compensate \nthese cold war heroes.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that is being offered today by my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Thompson is similar to S. 2519 except \nfor minor differences.\n  Under S. 2519, a federal program is created for all workers who are \ndue compensation because of an illness suffered due to the nature of a \nperson's job. This amendment creates a federal program for workers \nsuffering from beryllium disease, silicosis and cancer due to radiation \nexposure. Workers suffering from illnesses due to other chemical \nexposures would be covered under state workers compensation programs. \nThe Department of Energy's Office of Workers' Compensation Advocate--\ncreated by this amendment--will help employees apply for compensation \nwith their particular state's worker compensation program.\n  In addition, S. 219 allows a broad burden of proof to be placed on \nthe government, one that provides a greater number of Department of \nEnergy workers who have cancer related to radiation exposure to receive \nfederal compensation benefits. This amendment maintains that burden of \nproof for workers at the nation's three Gaseous Diffusion Plants, but, \nthe amendment assumes that other workers will be able to find records \nshowing whether or not their federal service made them sick. If it is \nnot possible for the Department to find an employee's records, or, \nadequately estimate dose history, then the burden of proof threshold \nestablished for workers at the Gaseous Diffusion Plants will apply to \nthat particular employee.\n  Some of my colleagues may question whether or not the Federal \nGovernment should be making an expenditure of this amount of money. \nSome may ask how we will know which worker or family member has a bona \nfide claim for compensation. These are legitimate concerns. However, \nthe nature of the illnesses involved suggests more than a coincidental \nrelationship with their victims.\n  For example, beryllium disease is a ``fingerprint'' disease. That \nmeans it is particularly identifiable and cannot be mistaken for any \nother disease, leaving no doubt as to what caused the illness of the \nsufferer. Additionally, the processing of the beryllium metals that \ncause Chronic Beryllium Disease is singularly unique to our nuclear \nweapons facilities.\n  In cases of radiation exposure at DoE facilities, it is \nunderstandable that some may question whether a person was exposed to \nradioactive materials from another source, primarily because records \nmay not reflect that an employee was exposed to such materials. The \nDepartment of Energy's independent investigation at Portsmouth showed \nthat, in some cases, the destruction and alteration of DoE workers' \nrecords occurred. There have been anecdotes indicating similar \noccurrences at other DoE facilities around the nation.\n  Additionally, dosimeter badges, which record radiation exposure, were \nnot always required to be worn by DoE workers. And when they were \nrequired, they were not always worn properly or consistently. Workers \nat the Piketon plant also have stated that plant management not only \ndid not keep adequate dosimetry records, in some cases, they chanted \nthe dosimetry records to show lower levels of radiation exposure. There \nhave been reports that DoE plant management would even change dosimeter \nbadges to read ``zero''--which means the level of exposure to radiation \nwould be officially recorded as zero, regardless of the exposure level \nthat actually registered on the badge.\n  In too many instances, records do not exist, and where they do exist, \nthere is adequate reason to doubt their accuracy. The amendment \nrecognizes that this is the case at the Department of Energy's three \nGaseous Diffusion Plants--Piketon, Ohio, Paducah, Kentucky and Oak \nRidge, Tennessee--and takes the unusual step of placing the burden of \nproof on the government to prove that an employee's illness was not \ncaused by workplace hazards.\n  This amendment allows for sound science where it is available, \nspecifically, if it is possible to adequately and accurately estimate \nradiation doses, and scientifically assure that a worker's cancer is \nwork-related or not. However, if it is not reasonably possible to \nadequately and accurately reconstruct doses, then ill workers covered \nunder this amendment would be eligible for compensation that is based \non criteria that exists for workers at our nation's Gaseous Diffusion \nPlants.\n  To be clear, Mr. President, under normal circumstances, I am not one \nwho would advocate a ``guilty until proven innocent'' approach. I \nfirmly believe that we should use sound science to determine exposure \nlevels and relationship to illness. Yet, these are not normal \ncircumstances, and the reason we are offering this amendment today is \nbecause in too many instances, sound science either does not exist in \nDoE facility records, or it cannot be relied upon for accuracy.\n  For example, in my own state of Ohio, at the Portsmouth Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant--a plant that processes high-quality nuclear material--\nworkers had little or no idea that they had been exposed to dangerous \nlevels of radioactive material. As the Department of Energy's own \nindependent investigation has shown, such exposure went on for decades.\n  The independent investigation at Portsmouth, also demonstrated that \nuntil recently, proper safety precautions at Piketon were rarely taken \nto adequately protect workers' safety. Even when precautions were \ntaken, the use of protective standards was inconsistent and in some \ninstances were deemed only ``moderately effective.''\n  If consistent, reliable and factual data is not available, Mr. \nPresident, then it will be quite difficult if not impossible to utilize \nsound science in order for employees to prove their claims.\n  Similar situations like those that have been documented at Piketon \nhave been reported at other Ohio facilities including the Fernald Feed \nMaterials Production Center in Fernald, Ohio and the Mound Facility in \nMiamisburg, Ohio, not to mention a host of other facilities nationwide. \nAt this time, the Department of Energy is only acknowledging these \nsituations at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant.\n  In addition to shoddy or non-existent record keeping, the DoE has \nadmitted that at some facilities, workers were not told the nature of \nthe substances they were handling. They weren't told about the \nramifications that these materials may have on their future health and \nquality of life. It is truly unconscionable that DoE managers and other \nindividuals in positions of responsibility could be so insensitive and \nuncaring.\n  Last year, the Toledo Blade published an award-winning series of \narticles outlining the plight of workers suffering from Chronic \nBeryllium Disease (CBD). While government standards were met in \nprotecting the workers from exposure to beryllium dust, many workers \nstill were diagnosed with CBD. Were the standards too low? Was the \nprotective equipment faulty? Whatever the cause, it is estimated that \n1,200 people across the nation have contracted CBD, and hundreds have \ndied from it, making CBD the number-one disease directly caused by our \ncold war effort.\n  Mr. President, there may be some who think that this amendment costs \ntoo much, so we shouldn't do it. I strongly disagree.\n  Congress appropriates billions of dollars annually on things that are \nnot\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nthe responsibility of the federal government--and I have voted against \nmost of the bills that include this kind of funding. Here we have a \nclear instance where the actions of the federal government is \nresponsible for the actions it has taken and the negligence it has \nshown against its own people. Peoples' health has been compromised and \nlives have been lost. In many instances, these workers didn't even know \nthat their health and safety were in jeopardy. It is not only a \nresponsibility of this government to provide for these individuals, it \nis a moral obligation.\n  My belief that we have a moral obligation to these people was \nstrengthened last October when I attended a public meeting of workers \nfrom the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. I learned an incredible \namount about the integrity of the hard-working men and women and what \nthey have been through.\n  I heard heart-wrenching stories from people like Ms. Anita George, a \n23 year employee at Piketon who testified that ``I only know of one \nwoman that works in my department that has not had a hysterectomy and \nother reproductive problems.'' Ms. George described a situation where \nshe and two of her colleagues were exposed to an ``outgassing'' on a \n``routine'' decontamination job.\n  After the exposure, the women started to experience health problems, \nincluding heavy bleeding, elevated white blood cell counts and kidney \ninfections. Plant physicians told them that they should ``just lie down \nand rest'' if they had any problems while they were working. Three \nyears after the exposure, all three women had had hysterectomies. The \nplant denied their workers' compensation claims.\n  I also heard from people like Mr. Jeff Walburn, another 23-year plant \nemployee and former councilman and vice mayor of the city of \nPortsmouth, who testified that while working in one of the buildings, \nhe became so sick that his lungs ``granulated.'' When he went to the \ninfirmary, they said he was ``okay for work.'' Later that day, he went \nto the hospital because in his words, ``my face was peeling off.'' \nAccording to Mr. Walburn, he couldn't speak, his hair started falling \nout, his lungs started ``coming out'' and his bowels failed to function \nfor more than 6 days. When he went to get his records to file his \nworker's compensation claim, he was told that his diagnosis had been \n``changed, been altered.''\n  The Department of Energy has held similar public meetings at \nfacilities across the nation--these stories are not unique to the \nPortsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate that this amendment is necessary in \nthe first place; the compensation it will provide is little consolation \nfor the pain, health problems and diminished quality of life that these \nindividuals have suffered. These men and women won the cold war. Now, \nthey simply ask that their government acknowledge that they were made \nill in the course of doing their job and recognize that the government \nmust take care of them.\n  Until recently, the only way many of these employees believed they \nwould ever receive proper restitution for what the government has done \nto them is to file a lawsuit against the Department of Energy or its \ncontractors. But, in the time that I have been involved in this issue \nin the Senate, the Department of Energy has come a long way from its \ndecades-long stance of stonewalling and denial of responsibility. \nToday, they admit that they have wronged our cold war heroes. Still, we \nmust do more.\n  I believe that all those who have served our nation fighting the cold \nwar have a right to know if the federal government was responsible for \ncausing them illness or harm, and if so, to provide them the care and \ncompensation that they need and deserve. That is the purpose of our \namendment, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of \nits acceptance in this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor in support of the \namendment, and thank all the sponsors for their work in this area.\n  The purpose of this amendment, put simply, is to provide compensation \nto workers who have gotten sick as a result of their exposure to \nhazardous materials in the course of their efforts to build and test \nnuclear weapons. We must do right by these workers. They were \ninstrumental in winning the cold war. Their efforts deterred hostile \nattack and safeguarded our security.\n  I want to highlight a small group of those workers who toiled on a \nremote island in Alaska to test the largest underground nuclear weapons \ntest our nation ever conducted.\n  Amchitka is an island in the Aleutian arc 1340 miles southwest of \nAnchorage. As I mentioned, it is the site of the largest underground \nnuclear test in U.S. history--the so-called ``Cannikin'' test of 1971. \nThis 5 megaton test was preceded by two prior tests: ``Long Shot,'' an \n80 kiloton test in 1965; and ``Milrow,'' a 1 megaton test in 1969.\n  According to an independent investigator, Dr. Rosalie Bertell, the \nionizing radiation exposure above normal background levels experienced \nby Amchitka workers ranged from 669 up to 17,240 milliren/year. Workers \nexposures at Amchitka were primarily due to:\n  Groundwater transport of tritium from the Longshot test;\n  Radionuclides stored on site or used in the shaft, including scandium \n46, cesium 137, and other radioactive diagnostic capsuled sources;\n  Radioactive thermoelectric generator (RTG) use;\n  Material released from the Cannikin re-entry operations in 1972;\n  Unfortunately, it appears that The Atomic Energy Commission--the \npredecessor of today's Department of Energy--did not provide for the \nproper protection of these workers. According to Dr. Bertell:\n\n       Although the workers were apparently told that their work \n     was not `hazardous,' they were actually classified as nuclear \n     workers and were exposed to levels of ionizing radiation from \n     non-natural and/or non-normal sources, above the level which \n     at that time was permitted yearly for the general public, \n     namely 500 mrem/year . . . Doses received by the men during \n     special assignments and during the post-Cannikin cleanup, \n     exceeded the permissible quarterly dose of 1250 mrem and the \n     maximum permissible yearly dose of 5000 mrem.\n\n  I would note that the allowable exposure standards for both workers \nand the general public are much lower today.\n  The actual amount of radiation the Amchitka workers were exposed to \nis difficult to quantify, Mr. President. These workers generally did \nnot have the protection of radiation safety training or instruction in \nthe proper usage of Thermoluminescent Dosimeters (TLDs). To make \nmatters even worse, exposure records were not kept in many cases by the \nAEC. Some of the records that were kept by AEC were later lost. While \nthis was not unusual in the very early years of the nuclear age, \nradiation protection formalities were well established by the late \n1960s and 1970s at the time of the Amchitka tests. Yet the proper \nprocedures were not followed and the proper records were not kept.\n  So although these were some likely exposures, the records that could \nhelp these workers make a claim under existing authority do not exist \nthrough no fault of their own. That is the reason that Amchitka workers \nare included in the ``Special Exposure Cohort'' with the workers at the \nGaseous Diffusion Plants in Portsmouth, Ohio; Paducah, Kentucky; and \nOak Ridge, Tennessee. If a member of the special exposure cohort gets a \nspecified disease listed in the amendment that is known to be \nassociated with ionizing radiation, her or she is entitled to \nappropriate compensation.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Thompson and others, and the \nconsideration given us by the floor managers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3251\n\n (Purpose: To conform standards of judicial review of actions relating \n        to selection boards; and to make a technical correction)\n\n       Beginning on page 144, strike line 22 and all that follows \n     through page 145, line 4, and insert the following:\n\n     may be, only if the court finds that recommendation or action \n     was contrary to law or involved a material error of fact or a \n     material administrative error.\n       On page 145, strike lines 8 through 12, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     only if the court finds the decision to be arbitrary or \n     capricious, not based on substantial evidence, or otherwise \n     contrary to law.\n       On page 148, line 24, strike ``off Defense'' and insert \n     ``concerned''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation for the work done \nby the\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\nmanagers of this bill. Also, I want to briefly focus on one amendment \nthat was adopted.\n  The fact that these amendments were agreed to en bloc doesn't take \naway from the importance of this legislation. We can come out here and \ntalk for hours on a piece of legislation, and it has no more meaning \nthan some of these that have just been adopted by the managers of the \nbill. The one I want to discuss is by Senators Thompson, Voinovich, \nReid, and a number of other people, dealing with nuclear test site \nworker compensation.\n  I had a meeting last week in Las Vegas with a woman named Dorothy \nClayton, who, coincidentally, is in town today. Her husband was one of \nthe people working at the test site for over three decades. One of his \nfirst duties was to go in after the blast was set off in one of these \ntunnels and bring out the devices. He had protective equipment on, but \nof course it didn't work. We didn't know that at the time.\n  This man, who literally gave his life for the country, developed \nnumerous cancers and died a very difficult death. This legislation \nwould compensate people such as Dorothy Clayton's husband and many \nothers who worked at the Nevada Test Site and other nuclear complexes \naround the country. People such as this made the cold war something we \nnow look back on saying that we won.\n  I want everyone to know that this legislation, which has been around \nfor a long time, is now passed. Not only was the meeting in Las Vegas \none where Mrs. Clayton talked about her husband's death, but we had \nAssistant Secretary of Energy Michaels there, who came to express his \napologies to Mrs. Clayton and all such people who have been injured and \ndied over the years. He did this by saying that we, the Federal \nGovernment, didn't know at the time that problems would develop. It was \na very moving occasion, where the Federal Government--looked upon by \nmany as a big brother--stepped forth and said we made a mistake.\n  With this legislation, we hope to be able to compensate these people \nin a minimal way for their efforts. So the veil of secrecy in existence \nfor many years is lifted. People have attempted through litigation to \nhave a right to protect themselves, and they could not because it was \nagainst the law. Through this legislation, other things we are doing \nwill be made part of the law, and through the appropriations process we \nwill be able to compensate these people.\n  I very much appreciate the managers agreeing to this amendment. It is \nextremely important to the thousands and thousands of people in America \ntoday, some of whom have lost loved ones.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our colleague. Might I engage the Senator from \nNevada and the Senator from Michigan in a colloquy about the procedural \nefforts. I compliment the Senator from Nevada.\n  I ask the Senators to inform the managers of the amendments they \nintend to bring forward. I recognize that the text of the amendments in \ncertain instances cannot be provided at this time. But we need as much \ninformation as possible. Hopefully, Members will provide that to the \nmanagers. At some point in time, I am going to urge leadership today to \nhave a cutoff and that we at least have the name, the amendment, as \nmuch as we can know about it, so that our leadership can have some \nestimate from the managers as to the time in which this bill could be \nconcluded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know how hard Senator Reid is working to \nput together that list. We hope we will have such a list. Senator Reid \ncan comment more directly on that. I thank him for the work he is doing \nso that we can try to expedite this process.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy in this instance to be Senator Levin's assistant \nto help move this legislation along. I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, at noon, or thereabouts, we expect the staff will exchange \namendments that have now been presented in the various cloakrooms to \nthe managers of the bill. They will work to determine what amendments \nthey want to add or subtract, and, hopefully, at 1 o'clock we will have \na finite list of both majority and minority amendments. We can work \nfrom that list. As a result of the work done by the two managers, that \nlist is being narrowed significantly this morning.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  I assure you that on this side I have the support of my leadership, \nand we can begin to exchange the lists. I urge the leadership to come \nto the body and get unanimous consent to have some cutoff at some point \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to the chairman, the two leaders have been \nmeeting. They have had discussions about this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Indeed they have. There has been strong support.\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague, a member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services, about to address the Senate on a subject \non which I have been privileged to work with him for some time.\n  I must say that in the many years I have been on this committee I \nhave never seen a more diligent nor a more committed effort than that \nby the Senator from New Hampshire. It has been a matter of personal \npleasure to me to work with him and to go back into the history of the \nU.S. Navy about an event of great tragedy. I think what he is proposing \ntoday will be well received by the Senate and, indeed, hopefully by the \nnaval community which have labored with this burden for these many, \nmany years since the closing days of World War II.\n  I remember vividly at the time this particular ship was sunk, the \nNation was absolutely shocked and just couldn't believe it. Indeed, a \nfamous Virginian, Graham Clayton, who came along as Secretary of the \nNavy shortly after me, was the naval officer on board a ship that \narrived first on the scene. Graham Clayton used to recount to me his \npersonal recollections about this.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3210, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Before addressing the Senate on the issue of the Indianapolis, I have \nan amendment to my amendment 3210 at the desk, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the modification of my own amendment at the desk be agreed \nto.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is the modification which was \npreviously shared with the minority. We have no objection to the \npending Smith amendment being modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3210), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . PERSONNEL SECURITY POLICIES.\n\n       No officer or employee of the Department of Defense or any \n     contractor thereof, and no member of the Armed Forces shall \n     be granted a security clearance if that person--\n       (1) has been convicted in any court within the United \n     States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term \n     exceeding 1 year;\n       (2) is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled \n     substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act);\n       (3) is currently mentally incompetent; or\n       (4) has been discharged from the Armed Forces under \n     dishonorable conditions.''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nMichigan for working with me. I wish to clarify that he is not \nnecessarily agreeing with all of it, but he has agreed to the \nmodification allowing me to modify my amendment, which he did not have \nto do. I appreciate it very much.\n  Before getting into the detail of the tragedy of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis, which happened so many years ago in 1945, I commend my \ncolleague and the chairman of this committee, Senator John Warner, a \nformer Secretary of the Navy. When I first approached Senator Warner on \nthis topic, he was somewhat skeptical, as I was frankly, when I first \nlearned of it. But he took the time to listen to the details and the \nfacts that came forth. He granted a hearing at my request on the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis matter. We heard from survivors and we heard from the \nNavy. We heard from all sides. As a result of that hearing and the \ninformation provided, Senator Warner worked with me to draft language \nin this bill to correct an egregious mistake.\n  Some have said that we are rewriting history in this debate. I am a \nhistory teacher. I don't believe you can rewrite\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nhistory. I think history is either factual or it isn't. But I think we \ncan correct this. If a mistake is made, or has been made, then I think \nwe have an obligation to correct that mistake. In that view, I want to \nshare with my colleagues over the next few minutes what happened in \n1945.\n  Senator Warner mentioned an old colleague of his, a friend of his, \nwho had been one of the officers to rescue the crew of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. It was only 4 months before that my own father, a naval \naviator, was killed just prior to the end of the Second World War after \nhaving served in that war. This incident happened just days before the \nend of the war in which over 1,200 men went down and only 300 and some \nsurvived.\n  These tragedies happened. It is terrible. It is part of the war.\n  I wish to share with my colleagues what happened and why we are doing \nwhat we are doing. I believe that a grievous wrong was committed 55 \nyears ago, and it stained the reputation of an outstanding naval \nofficer. I refer to the late Capt. Charles Butler McVay, III, who was \ntried and convicted at a court-martial, unjustly I believe. I believe \nthat firmly. I believe that based on the facts. He was tried and \nconvicted unjustly as a result of the sinking by a Japanese submarine \nof his ship, the U.S.S. Indianapolis, shortly before the end of the \nSecond World War.\n  The loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis to a Japanese submarine attack \nhappened on July 30, 1945. It remains without question the greatest sea \ndisaster in the history of the U.S. Navy. Eight-hundred and eighty men \nperished. Of the 1,197 men aboard, 880 died at sea. An estimated 900 \nmen, however, survived the actual sinking, but they were left, in some \ncases, without lifeboats, without food, and without water. And they \nfaced shark attacks for 4 days and 5 nights.\n  If you can, imagine the horror of that experience of being thrown \ninto the sea in a matter of minutes after a torpedo attack by an enemy \nsubmarine and to be in the water with sharks for 4 days and 5 nights \nwithout lifeboats, in some cases, and without food and without water. \nOnly 317 of those men remained alive when they were discovered by \naccident 5 days later, because when their ship failed to arrive on \nschedule, believe it or not, it was not missed. The ship that was \nscheduled to arrive in port 4 or 5 days before was never even missed. \nThe Navy had completely lost track of this cruiser, the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis, and its entire crew. When it didn't come into port, \nnobody missed it. These men literally stayed at sea for 4 or 5 days. \nThe only hope they had was the fact that an SOS had been sent out and \nsomebody had heard it, and they would be found.\n\n  This tragedy, as you might expect, was a great embarrassment to the \nU.S. Navy. It was such an embarrassment to the Navy with a ship going \ndown that the news was not given to the public until the day that \nPresident Truman announced the surrender of Japan, thus, lessening its \ncoverage by the media, and as a result its impact on the American \npeople.\n  Let me frame this again: In the same day's news, President Truman \nannounces the surrender of Japan and then this footnote that the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis was sunk with 317 survivors.\n  Today, only 130 men still live who survived from the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. In April of 1998, I met for the first time with 12 of \nthose survivors.\n  I might add that, sadly, as the months go by survivors pass away. \nMost of these men are in their seventies and eighties. Every day that \ngoes by and we don't get this issue resolved is another day that we \nlose survivors.\n  But they were in Washington to plead for legislation for one simple \nreason: To clear their captain's name. They were accompanied by a young \nboy by the name of Hunter Scott of Pensacola, FL, whose school history \nproject had led him to join their cause. I learned from those survivors \nand from this young boy, who was only 13 years old at the time, the \nstory of the sinking. I had heard about it. I had read about it. But I \ndidn't really know all of the facts. I learned that the survivors had \nbeen unanimous for over a half a century in their efforts to have their \ncaptain's good name restored. For 50 years, they have fought to restore \ntheir captain's name, saying that he was unjustly court-martialed and \nfound guilty of the loss of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.\n  Hunter Scott's involvement had renewed interest in their cause, and \nHunter Scott's involvement, I think, as a young boy, came as a result \nof the book called ``Fatal Voyage: The Sinking of the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis,'' written by Dan Kurzman.\n  With no financial interest in the book, I would certainly recommend \nthat book to anyone who wishes to know the facts of what happened with \nthe U.S.S. Indianapolis.\n  But Mr. Scott had attracted the attention of the media as well as the \nattention of his Member of Congress in the House of Representatives, \nCongressman Joe Scarborough, who had already introduced legislation in \nthe House which called for a posthumous pardon for Captain McVay.\n  Hunter Scott can be very proud. He demonstrated that one person with \ngrit and perseverance, in search of justice, can find that justice in \nthe Halls of Congress. This boy, at the age of 12 or 13, brought the \nfacts of this case to the Congress. As a result, language now is in \nthis Defense authorization bill which will clear Captain McVay's name \nas a result of this 12 or 13-year-old boy.\n  When we hear stories about young people today, we always hear the bad \nthings. This is good. He is a very impressive young man. He testified \nbefore the Armed Services Committee. He wasn't nervous. He held his \nown. He answered tough questions. He had the answers without any \nhesitation.\n  Last April, I had another meeting with a second group of survivors, \nand young Hunter Scott, who had returned to Washington once again in \ntheir effort to right what they believed was a wrong. In spite of the \nhearing, we still haven't gotten it done. Their story, in turn, got my \nattention and led me to introduce Senate Joint Resolution 26, which \nexpresses the sense of Congress that Captain McVay's court-martial was \nmorally unsustainable; that his conviction was a miscarriage of \njustice, and that the American people should now recognize his lack of \nculpability for the loss of the ship and the lives of 880 men who died \nas a result of the sinking.\n  Mr. President, this language does not erase the conviction of Captain \nMcVay from his record. We in Congress don't have the authority to erase \nthe conviction of a court-martial. It must remain on his record. But it \nis not, in my view, a stain on Captain McVay's record. I believe it is \na stain upon the conscience of the Navy. Until this or some future \nPresident sees fit to order it be expunged, we can't do that. If I \ncould, I would, with the stroke of a pen. I urge President Clinton, or \nany other President in the future, to do it. But I can't do it. This \nSenate can't do it.\n  This resolution does something very important. It represents \nacknowledgment from one branch of this Government, the U.S. Congress, \nHouse and the Senate, that Captain McVay served capably, that his \nconviction was morally wrong, and that he should no longer be viewed by \nthe American people as responsible for this horrible tragedy which \nhaunted him to the end of his life.\n  I will take you back 55 years, the end of the Second World War, the \nlate summer of 1945. After surviving a kamikaze attack off Okinawa in \nMarch of 1945--which killed 17 of his crew--Captain McVay returned the \nIndianapolis safely to California for repairs. For those who are \nprobably too young to remember the war, a kamikaze attack was a \nJapanese aircraft that flew directly into the ship with the pilot of \nthe Japanese aircraft giving up his own life to crash land the aircraft \ninto the ship to blow it up. Kamikaze attacks killed a lot of \nAmericans.\n  McVay's ship and McVay survived, but it killed 17 of his crew. McVay \ngot the ship back to shore. Remember, this ship was just hit by \nkamikaze attack, but this captain was so well respected and admired by \nhis naval superiors that once the ship was repaired, they didn't even \nhave time to go out and have a shake-down cruise. It was selected to \ntransport components of the atomic bomb which was ultimately dropped on \nHiroshima by the Enola Gay. They were to deliver the components for \nthat bomb. McVay, among all other captains, and McVay's ship, the \nIndianapolis, was selected for that critically important duty. It \nsuccessfully delivered the bombing parts to the island of Tinian--and, \ncoincidentally,\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\nsetting a speed record across the Pacific for surface vessels which \nstands to this day.\n\n  Here is a ship that was hit by a kamikaze. There was very little time \nto check the repairs, no shake down, the repairs were performed, and \nthey were given the materials for the bomb and departed for the island \nof Tinian. The ship was routed on to Guam after that duty for sailing \nwaters to Leyte. At Guam, Captain McVay requested a destroyer escort--\nthis is very important. At Guam, Captain McVay requested a destroyer \nescort across the Philippine Sea. No capital ship without antisubmarine \ndetection equipment, such as the Indianapolis, had ever made that \ntransit unescorted throughout World War II. No ship had ever gone from \nGuam to Leyte during the war without an escort. McVay requested one. \nMcVay was denied. No escort. He was told it was not necessary.\n  Navy witnesses at a hearing last September on this resolution \nconceded that this was the case. The Navy conceded that no escort was \nprovided, even though it was requested. Even worse, McVay was not told \nthat shortly before his departure from Guam, an American destroyer \nescort, the U.S.S. Underhill, had been sunk by a Japanese submarine \nwithin the range of his path. Navy witnesses in our September hearing \non this bill conceded that this was the case. A request by McVay for a \ndestroyer escort to go from Guam to Leyte. Request denied. Never \nhappened before. They always had escorts.\n  Second, the U.S.S. Underhill had been sunk by a Japanese submarine in \nthe same sea route. They never admitted this.\n  Third, U.S. intelligence furthermore broke the Japanese code and \nlearned that the I-58, the Japanese submarine, the very submarine which \nsunk the Indianapolis, was operating in the path of the Indianapolis. \nSo we had U.S. intelligence that had broken the Japanese code and said \nthe I-58 Japanese submarine was operating in the path of the \nIndianapolis. Many responsible for routing the ship from Guam to the \nPhilippines were aware of the intelligence, but McVay was not told. \nNavy witnesses at our hearing conceded that was true. That is why, to \nhis credit, Senator John Warner came over to this issue.\n  Mr. President, upfront I will say my duty is not to dump on the Navy. \nI am a former Navy man. My dad was a naval aviator. I love the \nNavy. But if a mistake is made, we ought to admit the mistake. When the \nIndianapolis was sunk, naval intelligence intercepted a message from \nthe I-58 that it had sunk an American--they said battleship--along the \nroute of the Indianapolis. That message was dismissed as enemy \npropaganda. Naval witnesses at our hearing conceded that was also the \ncase.\n\n  So after the ship was sunk, they stayed in the sea for 4 to 5 days \nbecause they thought it was propaganda that the Japanese said they sunk \na ship. It was a reasonable mistake, I suppose, but maybe they could \nhave checked it out.\n  It should be remembered at this point that hostilities in July 1945 \nhad moved far to the north of the Philippine Sea. We were preparing for \nthe expected invasion of Japan over 1,000 miles away. The Japanese \nsurface fleet was virtually nonexistent. Only four Japanese submarines \nwere thought to be operational in the entire Pacific region. It is fair \nto conclude from these facts that there was a relaxed state of alert on \nthe part of naval authorities in the Marianas, and it is also fair to \nconclude, as a result that, Captain McVay and the men of the \nIndianapolis were sent into harm's way without a proper escort or the \nintelligence which could have saved the ship and the lives of the 880 \nmembers of its crew.\n  They were in a relaxed state. Captain McVay was basically given no \nreason to be alarmed about anything.\n  Following the sinking, the Navy maintained the ship had sunk so fast \nit had not time to send out an SOS. For many years, this was never \ncontested. But following appearances on several national TV programs, \nHunter Scott, this 13-year-old boy, had received word from three \nseparate sources, each providing details of a distress signal of which \nthey were aware which was received from the ship and which, in each \ncase, had been ignored. So the SOS did go out, but it was ignored.\n  At the September hearing, one of the survivors who had served as a \nradio man aboard the ship testified that a distress signal did, in \nfact, go out. He said he watched the needle ``jump,'' on one of the \nship's transmitters, signifying a successful transmission. Today, \nhowever, the Navy still holds to its position that a distress signal \nwas never received and the truth will likely remain a mystery in this \nincredible story, never to be resolved.\n  Following his rescue from the sea, Captain McVay was faced with a \ncourt of inquiry in Guam, which ultimately recommended a court-martial. \nFleet Adm. Chester Nimitz and Vice Adm. Raymond Spruance, who was \nMcVay's immediate superior and for whom the Indianapolis served as \nflagship, both of these legendary naval heroes of war went on record as \nopposed to a court-martial for McVay--opposed. Adm. Ernest King, then-\nChief of Naval Operations, overruled both Spruance and Nimitz and \nordered the court-martial. To the best of my knowledge, this is the \nfirst time in the Navy's history that the position taken by such high-\nranking officers has been countermanded in a court-martial case.\n  The question has to be, Why does the Chief of Naval Operations \noverrule the two officers in command? Admiral Nimitz, one of the most \nhighly respected officers in the entire war in the Navy, recommended no \non the court-martial. He was overruled by the CNO, who was not even \nthere. Why? Why?\n  I believe one of our witnesses at the September hearing, Dr. William \nDudley, Chief Naval Historian, may have given us the answer. He \ntestified that Admiral King was a strict disciplinarian who, ``when \nmistakes were made, was inclined to single out somebody to blame.''\n\n  I am forced in this instance to use the word ``scapegoat'' because I \nbelieve that is exactly what Captain McVay became. Brought here to the \nWashington Navy Yard to face his court-martial, Captain McVay was \ndenied his choice of a defense counsel and assigned a naval officer \nwho, although he had a law degree, had never tried a case before. \nNeither Captain McVay nor his counsel were notified of the specific \ncharges against him until 4 days before the court-martial convened and \nthe charges against him were specious at best.\n  The Navy settled on two charges against Captain McVay: No. 1, failing \npromptly to give the order to abandon ship, and, No. 2, hazarding his \nship by failing to zigzag. In other words, if you know there are enemy \nships in the area, if you zigzag, it is harder for the enemy ship to \nget a reading on you and sink you.\n  He was ultimately found innocent on the first charge, failing to \npromptly abandon ship, when it became apparent--and it should have been \nlong before the charge was brought--that there was no foundation for \nsuch charge because he did give the order. The torpedo attack had \nimmediately knocked out the ship's intercom and officers aboard the \nship were forced to give the abandon ship order by word of mouth to \nthose around them. The ship was hit and it sunk in a matter of minutes. \nThe entire intercom system was knocked out and you had to give the \norder to abandon ship one person at a time.\n  This charge, the second charge, failure to zigzag, including the \nphrase ``in good visibility,'' became the basis for his conviction. In \nother words, failure to zigzag in good visibility became the basis for \nhis conviction, one which effectively destroyed his career as a naval \nofficer.\n  Let's look at the validity of that charge. Captain McVay sailed from \nGuam with orders to zigzag at his discretion. Shortly before midnight \non July 29, 1945, the day before, with visibility severely limited--you \nzigzag in clear weather--visibility severely limited, and with every \nreason to believe the waters through which he is sailing were safe, \nMcVay exercised discretion with an order to cease zigzagging and \nretired to his cabin, leaving orders to the officer of the deck to wake \nhim if the weather conditions changed.\n  Whether weather conditions changed is debatable. Some survivors say \nit did. Some were not sure. But survivors were unanimous in depositions \ntaken shortly after their rescue that it was very dark prior to and at \nthe time of the attack; that the visibility was\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\npoor. Chief Warrant Officer Hines, for example, stated he could hardly \nsee the outlines of the turrets on the ship. His and other similar \ndepositions were not made available to Captain McVay's defense counsel.\n  Again, why not? The Navy maintained, and still does today, that the \nvisibility was good when the Indianapolis was spotted and subsequently \ntorpedoed and sunk that night, ignoring the sworn statements of those \nwho were there when it happened; ignoring them.\n  Why is this important? It is important because there were no Navy \ndirectives in place then, or today, which either ordered or even \nrecommended zigzagging at night in poor visibility. The order to zigzag \nwas discretionary even if the weather was poor.\n  Moreover, in voicing opposition to Captain McVay's court-martial, \nAdmiral Nimitz, in charge of the Pacific Fleet, pointed out:\n\n       The rule requiring zigzagging would not have applied, in \n     any event, since Captain McVay's orders gave him discretion \n     on that matter and thus took precedence over all other \n     orders.\n\n  This is a point, I might add, which Captain McVay's inexperienced \ndefense counsel never even addressed at the court-martial.\n  To bolster its case against McVay, the Navy brought two witnesses to \nthe court-martial. I have to say this has to be in the category of the \nunbelievable. One of the witnesses at Captain McVay's naval court-\nmartial, brought in by the U.S. Navy, was a man by the name of \nHashimoto, who was the captain of the submarine which sank the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis. The captain of the submarine which sank the U.S.S. \nIndianapolis, the enemy sub, the captain was brought in to testify \nagainst a naval captain. That, my colleagues, was uncalled for. It was \nthe height of insult. Imagine this captain, after losing his crew to an \nenemy torpedo, not even being told by his superiors that there were \nenemy ships in the area, has the captain of that ship testify against \nhim--an outrage.\n  The other witness was Glynn R. Dunaho, winner of four Navy Crosses as \nan American submarine captain during World War II. Neither helped the \nNavy's case. Both Hashimoto and Dunaho testified that, given the \nconditions that night, either one of them could have sunk the \nIndianapolis, whether it had been zigzagging or not.\n  They thought Hashimoto would have helped them. He said he could have \nsunk the ship; it didn't matter whether it was zigzagging or not. \nUnbelievably this testimony was brushed aside by the court-martial \nboard.\n  In our hearings in the Senate this year, high-ranking Navy witnesses \ninsisted Captain McVay was not charged with the loss of his ship; he \nwas not even considered responsible for the loss of the ship or the \nloss of life. They insisted he was guilty only of hazarding his ship by \nfailing to zigzag.\n  One question they declined to answer: Would he have been court-\nmartialed if he had arrived safely in the Philippines but had failed to \nzigzag that night? The answer, quite obviously, is no. And the Navy's \nargument simply denies logic.\n  In other words, if failure to zigzag is the problem, then you ought \nto nail an officer who doesn't do it before a tragedy, not after. If he \nhad arrived in port safely, would he have been charged? The answer is \nno, of course, he wouldn't have been charged. He had an unblemished \nrecord as a naval officer. It defies logic, but it happened.\n\n  In truth, McVay's orders gave him discretion to make a judgment, but \nwhen he relied on the best information he had, which indicated his path \nwas safe, and exercised that discretion on a dark night, he ended up \nwith a court-martial and humiliation.\n  No intelligence was given to him. Nobody told him there were enemy \nsubmarines in the area. Nobody told him the Underhill was sunk days \nbefore. No one told him any of that. They also told him he had \ndiscretion to zigzag.\n  In spite of all that, they court-martialed him. They humiliated him \nfor making a judgment call under circumstances which any one of us \nwould have done the same, including those who court-martialed him.\n  Captain McVay's judgment call to zigzag was not responsible for this \ndisaster, period. Other judgment calls may have been. Let's review some \nof them.\n  There was a judgment that his passage was safe; to deny him destroyer \nescort; to deny him the intelligence about the sinking in his path of \nthe Underhill; to ignore the Japanese submarine's report that it had \nsunk an American battleship along his route; to ignore the failure of \nthe Indianapolis to arrive on schedule; if they were, indeed, received, \nto ignore the distress signals which were reported to be sent out; and \nto deny Captain McVay the vital intelligence that the Japanese \nsubmarine which sank his ship was operating in its path.\n  Those responsible for these judgment calls were far more responsible \nfor the loss of the Indianapolis and its crew than its captain. Guess \nwhat happened to them. Nada. No court-martial. Nothing. Nothing \nhappened to those who ignored the intelligence. Nothing happened to \nthose who did not tell the captain about the Underhill. Nothing \nhappened to those who did not even report the loss of the ship. \nNothing.\n  Recently, my distinguished colleague and chairman, Senator Warner, \nreceived a personal letter from Hashimoto, the captain of the Japanese \nsubmarine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator's 30 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I follow \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in his letter, Hashimoto \nconfirmed his court-martial testimony by stating that he could have \nsunk the Indianapolis whether it had zigzagged or not. Then he went on \nto say:\n\n       Our peoples have forgiven each other for that terrible war \n     and its consequences. Perhaps it is time that your people \n     (to) forgave Captain McVay for the humiliation of his unjust \n     conviction.\n\n  That came from the man who sank McVay's ship. He was a dedicated, \ncommitted Japanese officer who, if you read Mr. Kurzman's book, was \nglad at the time he sank the ship and, in fact, was looking for a ship \nto sink.\n  Hashimoto attended that court-martial. In the English translation of \na recent interview Hashimoto gave to a Japanese journalist, here are \nsome excerpts about the court-martial of McVay:\n\n       I wonder (if) the outcome of that court-martial was set \n     from the beginning. . .because at the time of the court-\n     martial, I had a feeling it was contrived. . . .\n\n  That came from Hashimoto. There are other comments Hashimoto makes, \nMr. President.\n  There is one direct quote I want to give from his interview:\n\n       I understand English a little bit even then, so I could see \n     at the time I testified that the translator did not tell \n     fully what I said. I mean it was not because of the capacity \n     of the translator. I would say the Navy side did not accept \n     some testimony that were inconvenient to them.\n\n  As I conclude, I repeat, I love the Navy. I served the Navy in \nVietnam, and I would do it again. My father was a naval aviator and a \ngraduate of the Naval Academy. He was killed at the end of the Second \nWorld War after serving in the Pacific and in the North Atlantic. I \nhave no intention of embarrassing the Navy. That is not my purpose in \nsponsoring this legislation.\n  It is apparent that the old Navy made a mistake when they court-\nmartialed Captain McVay to divert attention from the many mistakes \nwhich led to the sinking of the Indianapolis, mistakes beyond McVay's \ncontrol and responsibility.\n  It is important to note that at least 350 ships were sunk by enemy \naction during World War II. No other captain was court-martialed. Only \nMcVay. Tell me, after listening to this testimony, how hard and \nconvincing was the evidence that he deserved to be court-martialed? The \nanswer is no hard evidence that he deserved to be court-martialed.\n  Captain McVay was a graduate of the Naval Academy in 1920. He was a \ncareer naval officer who had a decorated combat record, which included \nparticipation in the landings in North Africa and an award of the \nSilver Star for courage under fire earned during the\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\nSolomon Islands campaign. He was a fine officer and a good captain, and \nhis crew members who survived readily attest to it. To the man, to \ntheir dying breath, they have defended this captain after 50 years. \nWhat kind of a man would have that kind of capacity? What kind of man \nwould have the crew 50 years later, after enduring this, and with every \nreason to be angry with him, with every reason to hate him after almost \ndying in the sea, with him?\n  The court-martial board found McVay guilty of hazarding his ship by \nfailing to zigzag. His sentence of a loss of grade was remitted in \n1946, and he was restored to active duty by Admiral Nimitz who replaced \nAdmiral King as Chief of Naval Operations. But his naval career was \nruined. You do not survive that stigma. He served out his time as an \naide in the New Orleans Naval District before retiring in 1949 with a \nso-called ``tombstone promotion'' to rear admiral.\n  Sadly--and this is the worst part of the story--Captain McVay took \nhis own life in November 1968. Those who knew him feel strongly that \nthe weight of his conviction and the blame which that conviction \nimplied for the loss of the Indianapolis and the death of the crew was \na reason for his suicide.\n  Captain McVay is gone. It is too late for him to know what we propose \nto do, but the undeserved stain upon his name remains. Time is running \nout for the 130 people out of 300-some who survived, united and \nsteadfast for half a century to clear his name. We owe it to them, to \nhim, and to his family to clear his name.\n\n  We have forgotten that these men survived 4 terrifying days and 5 \nfrightening nights in the sea, fighting off sharks, starvation, and no \nwater. Let's not forget them again.\n  Again, I thank Senator Warner. Without Senator Warner, we would not \nbe able to make this happen. I am pleased to hear the House Armed \nServices Committee adopted the original legislation which I introduced \nin the Senate. I look forward to working out some language differences \non this matter in conference.\n  We now have the opportunity to give the remaining survivors of this \nterrible tragedy what they deserve and have fought for so hard and so \ntenaciously for so long: an acknowledgment by their Government, by \ntheir Navy that they made a mistake. After 55 years, we make it right \nthat their captain was not to be blamed for the loss of the \nIndianapolis nor the loss of their shipmates. This is not historical \nrevisionism. It corrects a longstanding historical mistake and rights a \nterrible wrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was not recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I did not know that order was entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Virginia, if \nmy colleague wants the floor right now, I ask unanimous consent that \nafter the Senator from Virginia, I follow him.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not hearing the Senator. The Senator is recognized, \nand that is open-ended; is that the order of the Chair? Unusual. I do \nnot know how it happened, but the Senator got it. What is the Senator \nadvising me?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am saying to my colleague, I am recognized. I intend \nto offer an amendment. I heard my colleague from Virginia seeking \nrecognition, and if there are a few things he wants to say right now, I \nwill yield for that. Otherwise, I will go forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator from Minnesota advise the Chair and the \nSenator from Virginia exactly how much time he wants and for what \npurpose? The time being consumed now can be charged to the managers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do not intend to take a long time. I intend to lay \nout a case for an amendment. I cannot give a time. I cannot do it in 5 \nminutes. There is no time limit, but I do not intend to be long.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. Of course, we have an order at 1 \no'clock to go straight to an amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I intend to be finished before that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to finish other things from now until 1 \no'clock. This is most unusual. I do not realize how we got to this. I \nam not sure how we got here, but it is here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield without losing his right to the \nfloor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I want to explain to the Senator from Virginia, Senator \nSmith asked to be recognized for an additional 5 minutes. Senator \nWellstone was standing here and said: I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized after Senator Smith. That is how it happened.\n  Mr. WARNER. What is done is done. You have it open-ended, I say to \nthe Senator, until 1 o'clock. What can you do to help us?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Virginia two things. No. 1, \nthere are two other Senators out here who want to speak briefly. I \nwould be pleased for them to do so--but I do not want to yield the \nfloor--after which I will have the floor.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, I do not think I will take a long \ntime. I will help the manager and try to do it in----\n  Mr. WARNER. If you can give us a time, then we can help our \ncolleagues. How about 10 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator from Virginia----\n  Mr. WARNER. Ten minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator from Virginia, 10 minutes will \nnot be sufficient. I will try to move forward expeditiously. All of us \nthink our amendments are important. I did not come out here intending \nto speak for hours, but I need to take about 20 minutes to make my \ncase. I do not want to be----\n  Mr. WARNER. If that is the case, it leaves very little time for the \nmanagers to recognize others who are waiting.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We all come and wait, and we all seek recognition.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Would you settle for 20 minutes?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will not because I do not know how long it will \ntake.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will try to keep it in that timeframe.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me for a comment \nwithout he losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield to the Senators from Delaware \nand Utah, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to the managers of the bill--if I can get Senator \nWarner's attention--as Senator Warner knows, the manager of the bill, \nthe chairman of the committee, and Senator Levin knows, I had planned \nto offer the Violence Against Women Act as an amendment. In the \nmeantime, the fellow with whom I have worked most on this legislation, \nand who has played the most major part on the Republican side of the \naisle on the violence against women legislation has been Senator Hatch.\n  He and I have been working to try to work out a compromise. We think \nwe have done that on the violence against women II legislation, \nreauthorization of the original legislation. Because of his cooperation \nand his leadership, actually, I am prepared to not offer my amendment. \nBut I do want the Record to show why. It is because of Senator Hatch's \ncommitment and leadership for us to move through the Judiciary \nCommittee with this and find another opportunity to come to the floor \nwith it.\n\n  With the permission of the managers, I will yield--without the \nSenator from Minnesota losing his right to the floor--to my friend from \nUtah to comment on the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I join Senator Biden this afternoon. We passed the \noriginal Violence Against Women Act in 1994. He deserves a great deal \nof credit for that. I would like to move forward with the passage of \nthe violence against women reauthorization this year.\n  For almost 10 years, I have stood with my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, on this particular issue. He and I have worked for \nalmost a year\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nnow to try to resolve any disagreements regarding specific provisions \nin our respective bills on this issue, S. 245 and S. 51.\n  What we want to do is combat violence against women. I believe we \nhave a good product. It is the Biden-Hatch Violence Against Women Act \nof the year 2000.\n  I have committed to Senator Biden that we plan to move this \nlegislation in the Judiciary Committee. I plan to have it on the \ncommittee markup for next week. Now, any member of the committee can \nput it over for a week. I hope they will not. Before the Fourth of July \nrecess, I hope we can pass the bill out of the Judiciary Committee. \nHopefully, the leadership will allow us some time on the floor to \ndebate it. It is a very important piece of legislation.\n  Millions and millions of women, men, and children in this country \nwill benefit by the passage of this bill. I am going to do everything \nin my power to help Senator Biden in getting it passed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, and the \nmanagers for yesterday accommodating my interest in this. I thank \nSenator Hatch for his leadership and look forward to us having the bill \non the floor in its own right in the near term.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3264\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n    report to Congress on the extent and severity of child poverty)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to talk about what \nthis amendment is about. Then I want to also make a couple of other \ncomments. I will try to stay within a reasonable time limit.\n  There have not been very many vehicles out here on the floor --if I \nsay that back in Minnesota, people look for cars or trucks, but what I \nam saying is that we have not had a lot of opportunity to bring \namendments out here that we think are important as they affect the \nlives of people we represent.\n  This amendment has been passed by the Senate, but every time it gets \npassed by the Senate, it gets taken out in conference committee. This \nwill be the third or fourth time. I think on the last vote there were \nover 80 Senators who voted for it.\n  The amendment calls for a policy evaluation, in which I think all of \nus should be interested. We should care enough to want to know about \nthe welfare bill because this is going to be coming up for \nreauthorization. In every single State in the country we are going to \nreach a drop-dead date certain where people are basically going to be \noff welfare. What this amendment calls for, and I will describe it more \ncarefully in a moment, is for Health and Human Services to basically \ncall on the States to aggregate the data and to get the data to us as \nto where these mothers and children are now.\n  In other words, we keep hearing about how the rolls have been cut by \n50 percent and that, therefore, represents success, but we do not know \nwhether or not the poverty has been cut and we need to know where these \nmothers are. We need to know what kind of jobs they have and at what \nkind of wages. We need to know whether or not the families still have \nhealth care assistance. There have been some disturbing reports that \nhave come out within the last several weeks that in too many States \neven though AFDC families--that is, aid to families with dependent \nchildren families--by law should be receiving the Medicaid coverage \neven when they are now working and off welfare, they are not getting \nthat coverage.\n  We need to know why there has been such a dramatic decline in food \nstamp participation, which is the most important nutritional safety net \nprogram for children in the country. There has been somewhere around a \n20-percent cut in participation, and there has been nowhere near that \nkind of reduction in poverty. We need to understand what is happening.\n  Most importantly, I would argue, although one can never minimize the \nimportance of whether or not these mothers are able to obtain even \nliving-wage jobs, it is the whole child care situation. I recommend to \ncolleagues a study that has recently been concluded by Yale and \nBerkeley which is devastating to me as a Senator. Basically, it is a \nstudy of what has happened to welfare children during this period of \nreform.\n  There have been 1 million more children who have now been pushed into \nchild care. But the problem is that the child care is woefully \ninadequate and the vast majority of these children are watching TV all \nday, without any real supervision, without any real education, and \ntherefore, not surprisingly, colleagues, they are even further behind \nby kindergarten age.\n  What this amendment would do would be to require the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to report to the Congress on the extent and \nseverity of child poverty. In particular, what we are interested in is \nwhat is happening with the TANF legislation.\n  Let me sort of summarize.\n  The amendment would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to submit to Congress by June 1, 2001, or prior to any \nreauthorization of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act--we ought to have this evaluation before we \nreauthorize--a report on the extent of child poverty in this country.\n  The report must include, A, whether the rate of child poverty has \nincreased under welfare reform; B, whether children living in poverty \nhave gotten poorer under welfare reform--that deals not with the extent \nof child poverty but the severity of child poverty--and C, how changes \nin the availability of cash and noncash benefits to poor families have \naffected child poverty under welfare reform.\n  In considering the extent and severity of child poverty, the \nSecretary must also use and report on alternative methods for defining \nchild poverty that more accurately reflect poor families' access to in-\nkind benefits as their work-related expenses as well as multiple \nmeasures of child poverty such as the extreme child poverty rate.\n  Finally, if the report does find that the extent or severity of child \npoverty has increased in any way since enactment of the welfare reform \nlegislation, the amendment requires the Secretary to submit with the \nreport a legislative proposal addressing the factors that have led to \nthe increase.\n  Let me be clear as to what this amendment is about, why I introduce \nit to this bill, and why I hope for a strong vote.\n  First of all, what is it about? It is about poor children. Why have I \nfocused on poor children? Because I think that should be part of our \nagenda. What is my concern? There has been a tremendous amount of \ngloating and a lot of boasting about how successful this welfare bill \nhas been. I have traveled in the country and spent quite a bit of time \nwith low-income families and with men and women who don't get paid much \nmoney but try to work with these families. That is not the report I get \nat the grassroots level.\n  What reports have come out--I won't even go through all of the \nreports today--should give all of us pause. Basically, what we are \nhearing is that there has perhaps been some reduction in the overall \npoverty rate but an increase in the poverty of the poorest families; \nthat is to say, families with half the poverty level income.\n  What I also found out from looking at some of the data, much less \nsome of the travel, is that there are some real concerns; namely, in \nall too many cases when these mothers now leave and go from welfare to \nwork, which is what this was supposed to be about, the jobs are barely \nabove minimum wage. When they move from welfare to work, all too often \nthey are cut off medical assistance. Families USA says there are \n670,000 fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage and health care \ncoverage because of the welfare bill.\n  When they move from welfare to work, they go from welfare poor to \nworking poor, but they are not being told that they still have their \nright to participate in the Food Stamp Program for themselves and their \nchildren and, therefore, are not participating in that program. When \nthey go from welfare to work, since they were single parents at home, \nthe child care situation is deplorable. It is dangerous.\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\n  When people keep talking about how great this bill is, and we haven't \neven done the policy evaluation, and it is coming up for \nreauthorization, I argue that it is a security issue for poor families \nin the United States of America.\n  Again, what this legislation calls for is a study of child poverty, \nboth to look at the extent of it and the severity of child poverty, to \nmake sure we get the data, to make sure we have the policy evaluation \nbefore reauthorization. There should be support for this because we \nshould be interested in policy evaluation.\n\n  Again, pretty soon we are basically going to have almost everyone \npushed off welfare. Before that happens, before a mother with a \nseverely disabled child is pushed off welfare or before a mother who \nhas been severely beaten and battered is pushed off welfare or before a \nmother who has struggled with substance abuse is pushed off welfare, \nand they may not be able to take these jobs--they may not find the kind \nof employment with which they can support their families--we had better \nknow.\n  I have quoted Gunnar Myrdal, the famous Swedish sociologist who once \nsaid that ignorance is never random; sometimes we don't know what we \nwant to know.\n  This is the fourth time I have brought this amendment to the floor. \nThe first time, it was defeated by one vote, although it was a \ndifferent formulation. The second time, it was accepted on a voice \nvote. That was my mistake. Then it was quickly taken out of conference. \nThe third time, it passed by a huge vote on a bill that then went \nnowhere. This is the fourth time. The reason I keep coming back is, I \nam determined that we do this policy evaluation.\n  Let me give one other example of why I will send this amendment to \nthe desk in a moment.\n  In focusing on this welfare bill, I know there was a conference \ncommittee I attended. This was all about an amendment which, again, the \nSenate passed, but it was taken out in conference committee, where I \nwas arguing that right now it is wrong not to enable a mother to at \nleast have 2 years of college; that she and the State in which she \nlives should not be penalized on work participation, and that if the \nState of Minnesota or California or Michigan or Virginia decided it \nmakes sense to let these mothers have 2 years of higher education, that \nthey and their children will be better off; they should not be \npenalized.\n  I went to the conference committee; it was dropped in conference \ncommittee. A number of different members of the conference committee \nwere saying: Wait a minute, this welfare bill is hallmark legislation. \nIt is one of the greatest pieces of legislation passed in the last half \na century. President Clinton tends to make the same kind of claim.\n  We can agree; we can disagree. The point is, there ought to be a \npolicy evaluation. There is a lot at stake. What is at stake is \nliterally the health and well-being of poor women and poor children. We \nought to at least have this data. We ought to at least make this policy \nevaluation. We ought to do it before we reauthorize this bill. That is \nwhy I introduce this amendment, and that is why in a moment I will send \nthis amendment to the floor.\n  Before I do, I also want to signal to colleagues that there is a \nreport--I think we will have a debate; I don't know whether it will be \ntoday or whether it will be tomorrow or when --on missile defense.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a minute? We want to try to \naccommodate him. It may well be we can accept the amendment. He has not \nshown me a copy of it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am getting ready to send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. We only have 21 minutes left. There is another Senator I \nwould like to accommodate on a matter unrelated to the bill. Is there \nany harm in looking at it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just received the amendment. I will \nbe pleased to send the amendment to the desk. I will say, my colleague \nhas a copy.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have a copy?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator does. I will also say to my colleague, I \nam actually trying to finish up in the next 4 or 5 minutes. It is just \nsort of a bad habit I have. When I keep getting pressed in the opposite \ndirection, I tend to speak longer. I am not trying to take up time, I \nam just trying to argue my case, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3264.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. REPORT TO CONGRESS REGARDING EXTENT AND SEVERITY \n                   OF CHILD POVERTY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than June 1, 2001 and prior to \n     any reauthorization of the temporary assistance to needy \n     families program under part A of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) for any fiscal year \n     after fiscal year 2002, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall report to Congress on the extent and severity of child \n     poverty in the United States. Such report shall, at a \n     minimum--\n       (1) determine for the period since the enactment of the \n     Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation \n     Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2105)--\n       (A) whether the rate of child poverty in the United States \n     has increased;\n       (B) whether the children who live in poverty in the United \n     States have gotten poorer; and\n       (C) how changes in the availability of cash and non-cash \n     benefits to poor families have affected child poverty in the \n     United States;\n       (2) identify alternative methods for defining child poverty \n     that are based on consideration of factors other than family \n     income and resources, including consideration of a family's \n     work-related expenses; and\n       (3) contain multiple measures of child poverty in the \n     United States that may include the child poverty gap and the \n     extreme poverty rate.\n       (b) Legislative Proposal.--If the Secretary determines that \n     during the period since the enactment of the Personal \n     Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n     1996 (Public Law 104-193; 110 Stat. 2105) the extent or \n     severity of child poverty in the United States has increased \n     to any extent, the Secretary shall include with the report to \n     Congress required under subsection (a) a legislative proposal \n     addressing the factors that led to such increase.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in many ways I would have liked to have \ntaken an hour to talk about this because I happen to believe that what \nis happening right now with poor women and poor children is a terribly \nimportant issue. I have summarized this amendment. I think about 89 \nSenators voted for this amendment last time. I hope I will get a strong \nvote this time.\n  By way of concluding, while I have the floor, I will mention to \ncolleagues, since I know we will have a thoughtful and careful debate \non missile defense, there is an excellent study that has come out that \nI commend to every Senator, done by the Union of Concerned Scientists \nat the MIT Security Studies Program. The title of it is \n``Countermeasures, a Technical Evaluation of the Operational \nEffectiveness of the Planned U.S. National Missile Defense System.''\n  These distinguished scientists argue that any testing program must \nensure that the baseline threat has realistically declined by having \nthe Pentagon's work in that area reviewed by an independent panel of \nqualified experts; provide for objective assessment of the design and \nresults of the testing program by an independent standing review; \nconduct tests against the most effective countermeasures. It is an \nexcellent analysis of the whole problem of countermeasures--that an \nemerging missile state could reasonably expect to build and to conduct \nenough tests against countermeasures to determine the effectiveness of \nthe system with high confidence.\n  We will have an amendment that I plan on doing with Senator Durbin \nand other Senators, where we will have a very thoughtful debate about \nthe whole question of the importance of having the testing. I just \nwanted to speak about this briefly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Minnesota will accept a voice vote. He wanted to address the \nSenate on that point. We will proceed to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, perhaps Senator Wellstone will yield to me \nfor 1 minute after he is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does Senator Wellstone have the floor?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Michigan for their support. We have had a resounding \nvote for this amendment before. I want to just keep this before the \nSenate. Somehow I want to get this policy evaluation done. So I think a \nvoice vote, which means this passes with the full support of the \nSenate, will suffice.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy and graciousness. I thank \nthe Senator from Virginia for allowing an unlimited amount of time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our good friend from Minnesota \nnot just for his good nature but also for his continuing to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate and the Nation the problem addressed in his \namendment, and his determination that he get a review of the impact of \nthe actions that we have taken on poor people in this country. He has \nbeen in the leadership of this effort continually. He raises this issue \nwith his extraordinarily powerful and eloquent voice. I commend him for \nthat. We will be accepting the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think we are ready to agree to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3264) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3267\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a National Bipartisan Commission on Cuba to \n          evaluate United States policy with respect to Cuba)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Mr. \n     Dodd, proposes an amendment numbered 3267.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 462, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, Senator Dodd is recognized as one who has \ndevoted much of his career to Central America. I have traveled with him \nin years past to those regions of the world, particularly in troubled \ntimes. I respect his judgment and I am pleased that he has joined on \nthe Warner-Dodd amendment. It relates to Cuba.\n  Senator Dodd and I, in the 105th Congress, put in legislation to \nallow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. Unfortunately, it was not \naccepted. We renewed that effort. That was in the 105th, and we renewed \nit in the 106th. Unfortunately, it was not able to be accepted by the \nSenate.\n  This Nation has experienced the Elian Gonzalez case, a most unusual \nchapter in history. I am not here to describe it because much of that \ncase is clearly in the minds of Americans. But if there is some value \nout of that case, it has awakened America to the seriousness of this \nproblem between the relationship of our Nation and Cuba.\n  We have had various policies in effect for some 30-plus years and, in \nmy judgment, those policies have not moved Fidel Castro. But Fidel \nCastro is a leader who does not have my respect, and I think many in \nthis Chamber would share my view, if not all.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n  There are certain ways we can bring to bear the influence of the \nmoney of America to try to help a change of the government, and to try \nto help the people to change their leadership.\n  While we may have put in these series of sanctions over the years \nwith the best of intentions, the simple fact is, there today Fidel \nCastro reigns, bringing down in a harsh manner on the brow of the \npeople of Cuba deprivations for many basic human rights, deprivation \nfrom even the basic fundamentals of democratic principles of \ngovernment.\n  One only needs to go to that country to see the low quality of life \nthat the people of Cuba have to face every day they get up, whether it \nis food, whether it is medicine, whether it is job opportunity, or \nwhether there is any certainty with regard to their future. It is very \ndisgusting and depressing.\n  Referring back to the Gonzalez case again, the only point I wish to \nmake is that it has opened the eyes of many in this country to the need \nfor the policies of the United States of America in relationship to \nCuba to be reexamined.\n  It is my hope and expectation that the next President will take \ncertain initiatives that will bring our Nation somehow into a \nrelationship where we can be of help to the people of Cuba.\n  All I wish is to help the people of Cuba. We have tried with food and \nmedicine unsuccessfully, although through various pieces of legislation \nthere is in some ways food and medicine going to those people.\n\n  I remember a doctor. Former Senator Malcolm Wallop brought an \nAmerican doctor to my office with considerable expertise in medicine. \nHe said to me that the medical equipment available to his colleagues in \nthe performance of medicine in Cuba was of a vintage of 30 years old--\nlacking spare parts, almost nothing in the state-of-art medical \nequipment.\n  What a tragedy to be inflicted upon human beings right here so close \nto America in Central America.\n  In this amendment, Senator Dodd and I simply address the need for a \ncommission to be put in place which would hopefully take an objective \nview of what we have done as a nation in the past with relation to Cuba \nand what we might do in the future. That commission would then report \nback to the next President of the United States and the Congress of the \nUnited States in the hopes that we can make some fundamental changes in \nour policy relationship with Cuba which would help--I repeat help--\nraise the deplorable quality of life for the people of Cuba.\n  I anticipate the appearance momentarily of my colleague from \nConnecticut. We weren't able to judge the exact time when he would \narrive.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senators Warner and Dodd for \ntheir work on a bipartisan basis to establish a bipartisan commission \non Cuba. It is important that we conduct a review of the achievements \nor lack thereof of the embargo. The amendment does not presume the \noutcome in any way of the commission's effort. It is not intended nor \nshould it be interpreted for a substitute for any other legislative \naction that Congress might take.\n  It is constructive. It is bipartisan. It is modest. I think it is, \nfrankly, long overdue. I hope we can adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Would he be kind \nenough to be a cosponsor of the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would be happy to be a cosponsor. I ask unanimous \nconsent I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I wrote President Clinton \nin 1998--we had 22 Senators join us in that letter--recommending that \nhe establish the very commission that is outlined in this legislation, \nbut for reasons which are best known to him, he decided not to do it.\n  Senator Dodd and I recommend this action because there has not been a \ncomprehensive review of U.S.-Cuba policy or a measurement of its \neffectiveness or ineffectiveness in achieving the goals of democracy \nand human rights that the people of the United States wanted and which \nthe people of Cuba deserve. We haven't had such a review in 40 years, \nsince President Eisenhower first canceled the sugar quota July 6, 1960, \nand we imposed the first total embargo on Cuba on February 7, 1962. \nMost recently, Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the \nHelms-Burton Act of 1996.\n  Since the passage of both of these bills, there have been significant \nchanges in the world's situation that warrant, in our judgment, a \nreview of our U.S.-Cuba policy, including the termination of billions \nof dollars of annual Soviet economic assistance to Cuba and the \nhistoric visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba in 1998.\n  In addition, in recent years numerous delegations from the United \nStates have visited Cuba, including current and former Members of \nCongress, representatives from the American Association of World \nHealth, and former U.S. military leaders.\n  These authoritative groups have analyzed the conditions and the \ncapabilities on the island and have presented their findings in areas \nof health, economy, religious view, freedom, human rights, and military \ncapacity. Also, in May of 1998, the Pentagon completed a study on the \nsecurity risk of Cuba to the United States. However, the findings and \nreports of these delegations, including the study by the Pentagon and \nthe call by Pope John Paul II for the opening of Cuba by the world, \nhave not been broadly reviewed by all U.S. policymakers.\n  We believe it is in the best interests of the United States, our \nallies, the Cuban people, and indeed the nations in the Central \nAmerican hemisphere with whom we deal in every respect.\n  We have a measure that hopefully will come through very shortly \nregarding a very significant amount of money to help Colombia in \nfighting the drug wars.\n  We are constantly working with the Central American countries, except \nthere sits Cuba in isolation.\n  We, therefore, believe that a national bipartisan commission on Cuba \nshould be created to conduct a thoughtful, rational, objective--let me \nunderline objective--analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba \nand its overall affect in this hemisphere--not only on Cuba but how \nthat policy is interpreted and considered by the other Central American \ncountries.\n  This analysis would in turn help shape and strengthen our future \nrelationships with Cuba. Members of the commission would be selected \nfrom a bipartisan list of distinguished Americans from the private \nsector who are experienced in the field of international relations. \nThese individuals should include representatives from a cross-section \nof U.S. interests, including public health, military, religion, human \nrights, business, and the Cuban American community.\n  The commission's tasks would include the delineation of the \npolicies--specifically achievements and the evaluation of:\n  No. 1, security risks, if any, Cuba poses to the United States, and \nan assessment of any role the Cuban Government may play in the \ninternational terrorism, or illegal drugs;\n  No. 2, the indemnification of losses incurred by U.S.-certified \nclaimants with confiscated property in Cuba;\n  No. 3, the domestic and international impact of the nearly 39-year-\nold U.S.-Cuba economic trade and travel embargo; U.S. international \nrelations with our foreign allies; the political strength of Cuba's \nleader; the condition of human rights; religious freedom; freedom of \nthe press in Cuba; the health and welfare of the Cuban people; the \nCuban economy and U.S. economy and business, and how our relations with \nCuba can be affected if we changed that.\n  More and more Americans from all sectors of our Nation are becoming \nconcerned about the far-reaching effects of our present U.S.-Cuba \npolicy on U.S. interests and the Cuban people.\n  Establishment of this national bipartisan commission will demonstrate \nleadership and responsibility on behalf of this Nation towards Cuba and \nthe other nations of that hemisphere. I urge my colleagues to join \nSenator Dodd and myself.\n  I ask the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Presiding Officer state the exact parliamentary \nsituation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours equally divided on amendment \nNo. 3214.\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Do I understand that 1 hour of that is under the control \nof the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not see Senator McCain here. I think \nperhaps he should lead off. Does Senator Feingold wish to lead off? \nSenator Feingold is a principal cosponsor, as I understand.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent following the remarks of Senator \nFeingold the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I begin our side of the debate.\n  I rise in favor of the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment. I hope we \nwill have an overwhelming vote later this afternoon in favor of full \ndisclosure of the contributions and expenditures of 527 organizations. \nAs we discussed yesterday on the floor, these organizations are the new \nstealth player in our electoral system. They claim a tax exemption \nunder section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code, a provision that was \nintended to cover political committees such as party organizations or \nPACs. At the same time, they refuse to register with the Federal \nElection Commission and report their activities like other political \ncommittees because they claim they are not engaged so-called express \nadvocacy.\n\n  In other words, these groups admit they exist for the purpose of \ninfluencing elections for purposes of the tax laws, but deny they are \npolitical committees for purposes of the election laws. That, my \ncolleagues, is the very definition of evading the law. If it is legal, \nit is, as some have called it, the ``mother of all loopholes.''\n  I make one point crystal clear because our debates on campaign \nfinance reform often get bogged down in arguments over whether someone \nis engaged in electioneering or simply discussing issues. These groups \ncannot claim that their purpose is simply to raise issues or promote \ntheir views on issues to the public. Why is that? They can't make that \nclaim because to qualify for the section 527 tax exemption, they have \nto meet the definition of a political organization in the tax code. And \nthat definition is as follows:\n\n       The term ``political organization'' means a party, \n     committee, association, fund, or other organization . . . \n     organized and operated primarily for the purpose of directly \n     or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures, \n     or both, for an exempt function.\n\n  And the term exempt function means:\n\n\n       The function of influencing or attempting to influence the \n     selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any \n     individual to any Federal, State, or local public office or \n     office in a political organization, or the election of \n     Presidential or Vice-Presidential electors.\n\n  These groups self-identify as groups whose primary purpose is to \naccept contributions or make expenditures to influence an election. \nThese are by definition election-related groups. They refuse to \nregister with the FEC, and they therefore can take any amount of money \nfrom anyone--from a wealthy patriotic American, or a multi-national \ncorporation, or a foreign dictator, or a mobster.\n  Indeed the groups seem to revel in the fact that their activities are \ncompletely secret. This chart we will be presenting in a moment shows a \npublic statement by a 527 organization called ``Shape the Debate.'' \nThis organization, according to news reports, is connected with our \nformer colleague and the former Governor of California, Pete Wilson. On \nits webpage, Shape the Debate advertises for contributions. \nContributions, it says, can be given in unlimited amounts, they can be \nfrom any source, and they are not political contributions and are not a \nmatter of public record. They are not reported to the FEC, to any State \nagency, or to the IRS.\n  Mr. President, the amendment we will vote on this afternoon won't \nchange the fact that the contributions can be in any amount. It won't \nchange the fact that the contributions can come from any source, even \nforeign contributions, even the proceeds of criminal activity. I regret \nthat all it will do is address this third claim--that the contributions \nare not a matter of public record. If a group is going to accept money \nfrom a foreign government, the American people should know that. That's \nall we're saying here.\n  This is something the Congress has to do. Now. It is clear that the \nFEC is not going to act on this issue this year. It held a meeting on \nMay 25 to discuss a proposal by Commissioner Karl Sandstrom to get a \nhandle on all the secret money that is now flowing into elections. The \nFEC voted to have the staff prepare a recommendation, but made it very \nclear that it is not going to act in time to have any impact on the \nupcoming elections. In fact one commissioner even said ``I want to \nspeak in favor of secrecy.''\n\n  As Commissioner Scott Thomas said recently when the FEC deadlocked on \nwhether it should pursue enforcement actions against the Clinton and \nDole presidential campaigns for their issue ads in 1996: ``You can put \na tag on the toe of the Federal Election Commission.'' The Commission \nis moribund, it is powerless even to address the most serious loophole \never to arise. This is why Congress must act.\n  We don't know just how big this problem will be. And we won't ever \nreally know because these groups don't even disclose their existence. \nOnly enterprising news reporters have been able to get information on \nthese groups and their spending. Some estimate that over $100 million \nin political advertising will come from 527 groups this year.\n  Here are some of the examples that we know of so far. The executive \ndirector of the Sierra Club admitted that a handful of wealthy \nanonymous donors have given about $4.5 million to the group's 527 \norganization. Shape the Debate, the group whose website advertisement I \ncited earlier, has said it expects to raise $2 to $3 million for phone \nissue ads. It has already run ads against Vice President Gore. We know \nthat Republican for Clear Air, with money from the Wyly brothers who \nare big contributors to Governor Bush ran over $2 million in ads \nattacking Senator McCain in the New York primary election earlier this \nyear. And a report in Roll Call a few weeks ago indicates that a \ngroupcalled Council for Responsible Government has formed a 527 and \nwill raise over $2 million and target 25 races this fall.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that newspaper articles about \n527 organizations be included in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I do want to emphasize that there is no \nconstitutional problem with this bill. First, there is no \nconstitutional right to a tax exemption, the Supreme Court has made \nthat abundantly clear. This amendment simply requires disclosure as a \ncondition of receiving a tax exemption. If a group doesn't want to make \nthese disclosures, it can simply pay taxes on its income like any other \nbusiness in the United States. Second, we don't have a problem of \nvagueness or line drawing here that might implicate first amendment \nrights. The disclosure requirements are not triggered by any particular \naction or communication that a group might make. It is triggered by its \ndecision to claim a tax exemption under section 527. Thus, as I said \nbefore, these groups self-identify. They make the decision whether they \nare 527 and if they do, they have to disclose.\n  There is a simple principle at stake here. It is a question of \ndisclosure versus secrecy. I say to all my colleagues who have argued \nhere on the floor that we do not need reform, we do not need a soft \nmoney ban, that all we need is disclosure: Now is the time to put your \nmoney where your mouth is. If you vote against this amendment--if you \nvote against this amendment for disclosure, you will never again be \nable to argue with any credibility that you support full disclosure. \nThe time has come to put an end to secret money funding secret \norganizations. As I said yesterday, the combination of money, politics, \nand secrecy is a dangerous invitation to scandal. What these \norganizations have done so far in this election cycle, in my view, \nalready is a scandal. Let's agree to this amendment and put a stop to \nit.\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 29, 2000]\n\nThe 2000 Campaign: The Money Factor; a Political Voice, Without Strings\n\n                 (By John M. Broder and Raymond Bonner)\n\n       Washington, Mar. 28.--The tiny remnant of the American \n     peace movement had a little money and was looking for a voice \n     in the political process. The pharmaceutical industry had a \n     lot of money and was looking for a bullhorn.\n       Both found it in an obscure corner of the Internal Revenue \n     Code known as Section 527, a provision that opens the way for \n     groups to raise and spend unlimited sums on political \n     activities without any disclosure, as long as they do not \n     expressly advocate voting for a candidate. Section 527 has \n     become the loophole of choice this year for groups large and \n     small, left and right, to spread their messages without \n     revealing the sources of their income or the objects of their \n     spending.\n       The provision was written into the tax code more than 25 \n     years ago as a way of protecting more income of political \n     parties from taxation. But only recently, after court rulings \n     and Internal Revenue Service opinions broadened its scope, \n     has it been exploited by nonprofit political organizations \n     trying to avoid the donor disclosure rules and contribution \n     limits of federal election laws.\n       Republicans for Clean Air, the group that broadcast \n     advertisements critical of Senator John McCain in several \n     states before the Super Tuesday primaries, was established \n     under Section 527 by Sam Wyly, a Texas businessman and big \n     contributor to Gov. George W. Bush.\n       Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which is led by \n     Ben Cohen, a founder of Ben & Jerry's Homemade ice cream, has \n     set up a 527 committee to agitate in 10 Congressional races \n     for less spending on weapons and more spending on schools, \n     Duane Peterson, vice president of the group, said last week. \n     He declined to say which races the group planned to focus on.\n       And on Monday, a Section 527 entity calling itself Shape \n     the Debate began running television commercials in \n     California, New York and Washington that call Vice President \n     Al Gore a hypocrite and ridicule his positions on campaign \n     finance reform and tobacco. The group, which expects to raise \n     $2 million to $3 million this year, was formed by allies of \n     Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor of California.\n       Two of Shape the Debate's officers are $1,000 contributors \n     to Mr. Bush, but the group's founder, George Gorton, said the \n     organization had no ties to the Bush campaign.\n       Following an I.R.S. ruling last year that essentially \n     endorsed the practice, conservative lawmakers, liberal \n     interest groups, rich individuals and large corporations have \n     begun to quietly pour tens of millions of dollars into the \n     political cauldron. The organizations say they plan to use \n     the money for advertising, polling, telephone banks and \n     direct mail appeals--all the major functions of a candidate \n     committee or a political party, but without requirements for \n     public disclosure or accountability.\n       Because there is no law requiring these groups to report \n     their existence, neither the Federal Election Commission nor \n     the Internal Revenue Service can say how many are in place. \n     But lawyers who set them up and campaign finance specialists \n     say that scores of 527's exist and more are being created \n     every week.\n       Their full impact will probably not be seen until the fall, \n     when the airwaves will most likely be filled with \n     advertisements from previously unknown organizations, \n     mirroring the 11th-hour attack on Mr. McCain by Republicans \n     for Clean Air.\n       Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created last summer \n     under Section 527 by major drug makers and allied \n     organizations, expects to spend as much as $30 million this \n     year to oppose legislation that the industry thinks will \n     impose government price controls on medicines, the group's \n     officers say.\n       The group's plans include a national campaign of political \n     advertising this fall, said Timothy C. Ryan, its executive \n     director.\n       Peace Action, the antiwar group once known as SANE/Freeze, \n     created a 527 operation called the Peace Voter Fund late last \n     year to try to influence the debate this year in eight \n     Congressional races, including the Senate races in New Jersey \n     and Michigan and contests for House seats in Michigan, \n     California, Illinois, and the 3rd, 7th and 12th Congressional \n     Districts in New Jersey.\n       The fund's $250,000 in seed money came from a handful of \n     wealthy benefactors who insisted on remaining in the shadows, \n     said Van Gosse, organizing director of Peace Action.\n       Mr. Gosse speaks rhapsodically of Section 527. It offers \n     freedom from the requirements of Federal Election Commission \n     reporting, he noted, and relief from the Internal Revenue \n     Service rules on political activity by charitable \n     organizations.\n       Mr. Gosse said he would not reveal the names of his major \n     donors. ``That's the whole point,'' he said.\n       ``Unlike a PAC,'' he added, referring to political action \n     committees, which are regulated by the election commission \n     because they work directly on behalf of candidates, ``there's \n     no cap on how much you can spend or accept. There's no I.R.S. \n     gift tax or reporting. It's a thing of beauty from an \n     organizing perspective. It gives one a lot of freedom and \n     fluidity.''\n       As long as a Section 527 group does not expressly advocate \n     the election or defeat of individual candidates--by using the \n     words ``vote for'' or ``vote against''--there is no \n     requirement to report to the Federal Election Commission. \n     These groups are free to engage in ``issue advocacy,'' which \n     to most voters has become virtually indistinguishable from \n     pro-candidate electioneering.\n       The new Shape the Debate advertisement could pass for an \n     attack ad sponsored by the Bush campaign as it concludes with \n     the line, ``Al Gore has a lot to answer for.''\n       Advocates of campaign finance reform see the 527 loophole \n     as a pernicious and proliferating vehicle for getting and \n     spending tens of millions of undisclosed dollars.\n       ``The new Section 527 organizations are a campaign vehicle \n     now ready for mass production,'' Frances R. Hill, a professor \n     of law at the University of Miami, wrote in a recent issue of \n     Tax Notes, a publication for taxation specialists. The 1996 \n     election was marked by concerns and scandals over the \n     unregulated contributions known as soft money, she noted. \n     ``The 2000 federal election may be equally important in \n     campaign finance history for the flowering of the new Section \n     527 organizations,'' she said.\n       Mr. Gore called for disclosure of the officers and finances \n     of Section 527 organizations as part of his campaign finance \n     proposal released this week. He called such groups, ``the \n     equivalent of Swiss bank accounts for campaigns.''\n       Representative Lloyd Doggett, a Texas Democrat, is \n     preparing legislation to regulate Section 527 groups, \n     requiring, at a minimum, disclosure of contributors and \n     expenditures.\n       ``The problem is, our political system is being polluted \n     with substantial amounts of secret contributions and secret \n     expenditures used to attack candidates,'' Mr. Doggett said.\n       Congress' bipartisan Joint Taxation Committee has \n     recommended steps to open Section 527 groups to greater \n     public scrutiny by publishing their tax returns, among other \n     things. But Congress is not likely to act quickly on any \n     proposal to rein in such groups, Mr. Doggett said.\n       Representatives Tom Delay of Texas and J.C. Watts of \n     Oklahoma, both Republicans, have established Section 527 \n     funds to burnish their party's image and promote conservative \n     ideas on taxation, the military and education. Former \n     Representative Pat Saiki of Hawaii has created Citizens for \n     the Republican Congress as another safe haven for anonymous \n     big donors.\n       Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's presidential campaign in \n     1996, has established a 527 group to attract Hispanic voters \n     to the Republican Party. New Gingrich is affiliated with a \n     527 organization advocating Social Security reform and tax \n     cuts.\n       Recently, attention has focused on the Section 527 \n     operations of conservatives. But the Sierra Club was one of \n     the first nonprofit organizations to set up a 527 subsidiary, \n     in 1996, and the League of Conservation Voters, which is \n     generally partial to Democrats, followed a year later.\n       ``We agree it's a loophole,'' said Carl Pope, executive \n     director of the Sierra Club. He said a handful of wealthy, \n     anonymous donors had given about $4.5 million to the Sierra \n     Club's 527 committee to use during this year's elections.\n       Mr. Pope said that his organization would support \n     legislation to eliminate the loophole, but that until then \n     the Sierra Club intended to keep using its 527 political \n     fund.\n       Karl Gallant, an adviser to Mr. DeLay, said conservatives \n     began to get into the game in a big way after a San Francisco \n     law firm that represents liberal nonprofit organizations \n     announced last April that it had been successful in setting \n     up a 527 political organization for one of its clients. Mr. \n     Gallant set up Mr. Delay's 527 group, the Republican Issues \n     Majority Committee.\n       The organization has begun hiring workers and has been \n     spending to mobilize conservative voters in two dozen \n     competitive Congressional districts, Mr. Gallant said. The \n     group expects to spend $25 million this year, he said.\n       Section 527 was added to the tax code in 1974, primarily to \n     clarify the tax status of purely political, nonprofit \n     organizations, including the Democratic and Republican \n     national parties and PAC's. Under the provision, they do not \n     pay taxes on contributions from donors, only on investment \n     income. But the parties and PAC's are required to report \n     donations and expenditures to the election commission. While \n     these organizations are exempt from taxation, contributions \n     are not tax deductible.\n       The pure Section 527 organizations like those proliferating \n     today operate in a protected niche of the tax code governing \n     political groups, but because they do advocate on behalf of \n     an individual candidate or candidates, they fall short of \n     election-commission disclosure laws. That is what \n     distinguishes them from a political party or a PAC. Donations \n     are not tax deductible, but the groups' contributions and \n     expenditures do not have to be disclosed to the I.R.S. or the \n     F.E.C.\n       By 1996, a convergence of factors caused many nonprofit \n     organizations to embrace this kind of vehicle to cover their \n     political activities, said Greg Colvin, a San Francisco \n     lawyer who set up some of the first 527 organizations, for \n     liberal groups.\n       ``Donors were looking for a way to put large, anonymous \n     money into organizations that would have a political \n     effect,'' he said. He added that many groups were eager to \n     flex their political muscle beyond what was permissible under \n     their tax-exempt status\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\n     without opening themselves up to a requirement to report \n     their activities to the election commission. And last year \n     the Internal Revenue Service issued an opinion in the case of \n     a group Mr. Colvin represented, endorsing the use of Section \n     527 by a wide range of political organizations.\n       Another factor in prompting the interest in Section 527 was \n     a ruling last year by the I.R.S. denying tax-exempt status to \n     the Christian Coalition because of its political activities.\n       Lawyers who specialize in campaign and tax law have been \n     approaching groups of all ideological stripes for several \n     months, selling them on the benefits of Section 527.\n       Grover Norquist, the executive director of Americans for \n     Tax Reform, a conservative antitax group, said that a lawyer \n     had recently offered to set up a 527 arm for him for $500.\n       Mr. Norquist said that at first the new structure did not \n     appear to offer any advantages over his current nonprofit \n     status. But when the law was explained to him more fully, he \n     said, ``Maybe I should have two.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 2, 2000]\n\n             A New Player Enters the Campaign Spending Fray\n\n                          (By Todd S. Purdum)\n\n       Los Angeles, Apr. 1.--George Gorton is hardly a political \n     novice.\n       For 30 years, since he was a college student supporting \n     James L. Buckley's campaign for the United States Senate from \n     New York, he has worked for candidates from Richard M. Nixon \n     to Pete Wilson to Boris N. Yeltsin. But even he had not \n     thought much about Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code--\n     at least not until last year.\n       ``I was walking around complaining to everybody that I \n     could find about the amount of money that organized labor was \n     spending on issue advocacy,'' said Mr. Gorton, who cut his \n     teeth as national college coordinator for Nixon's Committee \n     for the Re-election of the President in 1972.'' And somebody \n     said to me, `George that's their First Amendment right.' And \n     I decided labor wasn't wrong to do it; they were right to do \n     it, and so I decided pro-business people should do it, too.''\n       So Mr. Gorton, who runs a Republican consulting business \n     based in San Diego, started Shape the Debate, a nonprofit \n     political organization that, under Section 527, can raise and \n     spend unlimited amounts of money, with no disclosure \n     requirements for donors, as long as it does not expressly \n     advocate the election or defeat of any candidate. Its \n     inaugural television advertisement, which began airing this \n     week in California and New York, accuses Vice President Al \n     Gore of political hypocrisy, in a mock game show in which \n     contestants answer questions on various topics, including Mr. \n     Gore's support for campaign finance overhaul despite his \n     appearance at an illegal fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.\n       ``Shape the Debate strongly believes that free enterprise \n     and conservative ideas are more likely to become public \n     policy when candidates and public officials honestly and \n     publicly discuss their positions on them,'' according to the \n     group's credo, which can be found on its Web site, \n     shapethedebate.com. ``Shape the Debate will therefore use \n     stinging ads of rebuke, where appropriate, or gentle praise \n     to remind leading candidates and public officials to honestly \n     discuss our issues, as a means to keep conservative and free \n     enterprise issues uppermost in the minds of the American \n     public.''\n       The group is among the latest entrants in a growing field \n     of independent campaign expenditure efforts, spurred on by \n     recent court rulings interpreting the tax law. The group's \n     literature emphasizes that contributions are not a matter of \n     public record, and Mr. Gorton said that was an appealing \n     point for donors, most of them Republicans and many of them \n     Californians who supported Mr. Wilson's past campaigns for \n     governor and senator. So far the group has raised about $1.5 \n     million, in chunks of multiple thousands of dollars; Mr. \n     Gorton hopes to raise another $2 million to $3 million for \n     advertising campaigns this year.\n       ``In the atmosphere that's been created by the Clinton-Gore \n     administration, where the secret F.B.I. files of Republican \n     appointees turned up in White House hands, you have to wonder \n     about retribution,'' he said. ``The heart of the First \n     Amendment is that you can criticize your government without \n     fear of retribution.''\n       Mr. Wilson, who was forced out of office by term limits \n     last year, has helped raise money for the group. As governor, \n     he tangled repeatedly with public employee unions that \n     undertook campaigns opposing his policies, and former Wilson \n     aides say they see the latest effort as a way of evening the \n     score a bit.\n       ``Television is what really does shape the debate,'' said \n     Mr. Wilson, who since last fall has been working for Pacific \n     Capital, an investment banking concern in Beverly Hills. \n     ``The candidates certainly have that obligation, and \n     sometimes they fulfill it and sometimes they don't. But the \n     fact is, there are very definite limits on what they can \n     reasonably expect to raise through their own efforts. \n     Arguably, Bob Dole in 1996 was dead before he ever got to the \n     convention in San Diego, because of the tremendous pummeling \n     he took in the interim in independent expenditures directed \n     against him.''\n       Mr. Wilson added, ``I think what you've got now is a \n     situation in which most of the spending on television on both \n     sides is going to be financed by independent groups and not \n     the candidates themselves.''\n       State and national Democratic officials swiftly denounced \n     Shape the Debate's efforts as ``underground financing'' waged \n     by ``George W. Bush's ally,'' in the words of a Democratic \n     National Committee news release. In fact, Mr. Wilson's former \n     aides say, he has never had particularly warm relations with \n     Mr. Bush and has regarded him warily for years as a rival. \n     When Mr. Wilson decided last year not to pursue his own \n     presidential campaign, and Mr. Bush telephoned to wish him \n     well, at least one senior Wilson aide urged him not even to \n     return the call.\n       Mr. Wilson, who battled a severe recession in his first \n     term before presiding over a sharp recovery, nevertheless \n     remains controversial in California, where his strong stands \n     against affirmative action and illegal immigration provoked a \n     backlash. Mr. Bush has not generally tapped the old network \n     of Wilson advisers in his campaign here, and Mr. Gorton said \n     he did not believe the two men had talked in months.\n       ``I think Peewee's trying to find a way that George Bush \n     will give him a call,'' said former State Senator Art Torres, \n     the chairman of the California Democratic Party, using his \n     party's derisive nickname for Mr. Wilson. ``The problem is, \n     he's now created even more of a fire wall, because of the \n     sensitivity he's created with this ad. They have no sense of \n     subtlety and they never did.''\n       But Mr. Wilson said: ``I have gotten into this because I \n     think George W. Bush should be president. I also think that \n     had he faltered, John McCain should have been president. And \n     I don't think the vice president should be. It's as simple as \n     that.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, May 11, 2000]\n\n             Contributor ``Loophole'' Skirts Campaign Laws\n\n                            (By Jon Kamman)\n\n       In the frenzy of fund-raising leading to next fall's \n     elections, an old form of political organization has found \n     new life as the perfect vehicle for concealing who is giving \n     and how much.\n       Variously labeled ``the mother of all loopholes'' and \n     ``black hole groups,'' the so-called section 527 committees \n     are ``the brashest, boldest'' method seen to date for \n     circumventing campaign-finance laws, Common Cause President \n     Scott Harshbarger said.\n       Arizona Sen. John McCain, who made campaign-finance reform \n     the centerpiece of his bid for the Republican presidential \n     nomination, has termed the groups the ``latest manifestation \n     of corruption in Washington,''\n       The Section 527 committees take their name from the section \n     of federal tax code under which they are organized, Section \n     527 dates from the early 1970s, when Congress wanted to make \n     clear that political parties, political-action committees and \n     the like needn't pay taxes on contributions they received.\n       Recent court and Internal Revenue Service interpretations \n     of the law have given non-profit organizations free rein to \n     engage in political advocacy while maintaining the privacy \n     they otherwise are denied under election law.\n       Activists of every hue on the political spectrum, from the \n     Sierra Club to the Republican Issues Majority Committee set \n     up by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, have hopped on the 527 \n     bandwagon.\n       Among 527 committees that have revealed themselves are one \n     set up by Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream, \n     to focus on education issues, and another supported by the \n     pharmaceutical industry to protect against limits on \n     prescription prices.\n       The stealth-funding groups have no obligation to reveal, to \n     the Federal Election Commission or IRS, membership, \n     contributors or expenditures. Even foreigners, otherwise \n     prohibited from making political donations, may set up a \n     secret 527 committee.\n       About the only restriction on a 527 group is that it stop \n     short of using explicit terms such as ``vote for'' or ``vote \n     against'' in backing a candidate.\n       Immunity from disclosure won't continue for long, advocates \n     of campaign-finance reform vow. A bipartisan group of \n     congressional lawmakers, McCain among them, joined with \n     Common Cause last month in denouncing 527 committees and \n     pledging to press for legislation to make them accountable.\n       The committees are replicating at a pace that's impossible \n     to track because of their secrecy. But the ones that have \n     chosen to identify themselves are set to pour tens of \n     millions of dollars--possibly more than $100 million--into \n     political advertising this year.\n       That, combined with more traditional forms of ``soft \n     money'' controlled by political parties, is sure to produce a \n     record volume of so-called issue ads, said Sean Aday of the \n     Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of \n     Pennsylvania/\n       Spending for such ads ranged from $135 million to $150 \n     million in the 1995-96 campaign, and the amount more than \n     doubled for the congressional elections two years ago, Aday \n     said.\n       Many new 527 committees bear vague names, such as the Shape \n     the Debate group, affiliated with former California Gov. Pete \n     Wilson, that has sponsored ads attacking Vice President Al \n     Gore.\n       McCain himself felt the sting of a 527 committee when $2 \n     million worth of television\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n     ads paid for by ``Texans for Clean Air'' were aired just \n     before the Super Tuesday primaries in March. The ads assailed \n     McCain's environmental record and extolled that of his \n     opponent, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.\n       Although nothing required them to do so, oil-rich brothers \n     Sam and Charles Wyly revealed themselves as the backers of \n     the ads.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From The Hill, May 17, 2000]\n\n     New VA-based ``527'' Will Target 25 Races; Starts in Idaho, NJ\n\n                            (By John Kruger)\n\n       The Council for Responsible Government joined the ranks of \n     new ``527'' organizations two weeks ago when it incorporated \n     in Virginia and immediately began running radio and \n     television ads in Idaho against Republican candidate Butch \n     Otter, accusing him of being soft on pornography. It also \n     commenced a direct-mail campaign in New Jersey.\n       The group, based in Burke, Virginia, intends to raise $2- \n     to 2.5-million and target 25 races around the country this \n     year, according to William Wilson, the group's registered \n     agent.\n       ``We want to promote free market ideas and traditional \n     moral and cultural issues,'' Wilson said. ``We want true \n     accountability to voters,'' which Wilson defined as making \n     sure voters know what a politician's true record it.\n       ``They speak to different sides of an issue with different \n     audiences,'' he explained. ``That's developed a lot of \n     cynicism [among voters].''\n       Wilson said the group does not engage in issue advocacy or \n     endorse candidates. ``We engage in voter education,'' Wilson \n     said.\n       Section 527 of the tax code permits political committees to \n     raise and spend unlimited funds without having to disclose \n     their contributors, provided that those funds are not used to \n     expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.\n       Organizations formed under Section 527 have come under fire \n     from campaign finance groups and members of Congress for \n     eliminating the line between issue advocacy and candidate \n     support.\n       One such group, the Republican Majority Issues Committee, a \n     group close to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), was \n     sued last month by the Democratic Congressional Campaign \n     Committee (DCCC).\n       Wilson said the group registered in Virginia because \n     ``there are some of the finest federal judges in the country, \n     ``alluding to their strong record on First Amendment issues. \n     Wilson said any time a group does something the ``powers that \n     be'' don't like, they are likely to be attacked in court.\n       ``I think it's wise to be afraid of the government,'' he \n     said.\n       Wilson said the group would not disclose its donors.\n       ``We have a lot of donors, but we want to keep that to \n     ourselves,'' Wilson said. ``We want them to be able to give \n     without the fear of retaliation.''\n       The group has also started a direct mail campaign warning \n     New Jersey voters that Republican candidate Joel Weingarten \n     had cast votes in favor of tax increases.\n       Weingarten's campaign has sued the group charging that the \n     council is using soft money and coordinating its mailings \n     with Jamestown Associates, a Princeton, N.J.-based media firm \n     hired by Weingarten's rival Mike Ferguson.\n       Larry Weitzner, president of Jamestown Associates, denied \n     any connection with the council, dismissing Weingarten's \n     claims as coming from a campaign that is ``desperate'' and \n     ``behind in the pools.''\n       Gary Glenn, director of the Accountability Project, an arm \n     of the council, also denied any coordination.\n       ``I have no knowledge of the firm whatsoever,'' Glenn wrote \n     in a statement.\n       Glenn is also president of the American Family Association \n     of Michigan, a Midland-based conservative organization. He \n     said the project is not a separate organization, merely a \n     ``marketing phrase.''\n       Wilson said the council will also target primary races in \n     August and September, as well as several general election \n     races.\n       Wilson, who is listed on FEC records as being the political \n     director for U.S. Term Limits, said the council has no ties \n     with any other group.\n       ``It's a volunteer organization. We have no connection with \n     any other organizations,'' Wilson said. ``To the extent we're \n     permitted, we share ideas, sure.''\n       Wilson said there is no paid staff, just a group of 40 to \n     45 volunteers around the country. He said the group does not \n     intend to hold any fundraising events, but would rely on one-\n     on-one meetings ``with like-minded people.''\n       Tom Kean Jr., who is running against Weingarten and \n     Ferguson in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, decried \n     the mailing.\n       ``We, as voters, deserve the right to know who is defining \n     the candidates seeking this office as well as any office in \n     this nation,'' Kean said in a press release. ``Unfortunately, \n     I fear this is only the first of many such expenditures in \n     this race.''\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, a number of colleagues are present on the \nfloor seeking recognition. May we alternate?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will simply say to the chairman, I \nwill be happy to do that. I ask in this instance that Senator Schumer \ngo next because the understanding last night was that he start the \nprocess, and then after that alternate.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia inquires as to the amount of \ntime the Senator from New York wants.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I inform the Senator I will take \napproximately 10 minutes. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize there is a unanimous consent \nagreement in effect, but I am trying as best I can to work this in a \nfair and equitable manner.\n  It is important, in your judgment, that Senator Schumer follow you \nfor a period of 10 minutes?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is not, in my view, essential.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If somebody else has a pressing need and will speak for \nless than a half hour or so, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I did put in a request, of which I thought he was aware, \nthat the President pro tempore will follow.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield and thank the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will proceed under the unanimous consent agreement, \nafter the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon not to speak about \nthe specifics of the National Defense Authorization Bill, but to speak \nto the importance of the Senate passing a defense authorization bill. I \nam very concerned that this bill will be so burdened with non-germane \namendments that our House colleagues may challenge it on constitutional \ngrounds--the so-called Blue Slip. If the Senate persists with these \ntype of non-germane amendments there is the strong possibility that for \nthe first time in my 41 years on the Armed Services Committee there \nwill not be a National Defense Authorization Bill.\n  Mr. President, if there is no authorization bill we will deny the \nfollowing critical quality of life and readiness programs to our \nmilitary personnel, both active and retired, and their families:\n  No 3.7 percent pay raise;\n  No Thrift Savings Plan;\n  No concurrent receipt of military retirement pay and disability pay;\n  No comprehensive lifetime health care benefits; and\n  No military construction and family housing projects.\n  Mr. President, it is ironic that two days ago, members were \ncommemorating D-Day and the sacrifices of the thousands of men who \ncharged across the beaches of Normandy. Now only two days later, the \nSenate is jeopardizing the bill that would ensure that a new generation \nof soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have the same support as those \nheroes of World War II and the Korean War whose 50th anniversary we \nwill be celebrating. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider the \nimpact of their votes on this strong bipartisan defense authorization \nbill. We must not jeopardize our 40 year record of providing for the \nmen and women who proudly wear the uniforms of the Nation and make \nuntold sacrifices on a daily basis to ensure the security of our great \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin yields. How much \ntime does the Senator from Wisconsin yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Ten minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nyielding this time and for the leadership on this issue. I also praise \nmy friend from Arizona who has, throughout, been courageous on this \nissue as on many others, as well as the Senator from Connecticut, whose \nproposal it is and who has stood as a beacon, in terms of reform.\n  If you wanted to design a corrupting statute that would blow over our \nbody politic, you would come up with a statute like 527. Although it \nwas inadvertently drafted, and was never intended for this purpose, its \neffect eats at the very core of our Republic.\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\n  Imagine if someone came to you and said: Let's make political \ncontributions tax deductible, unlimited, and secret. Most people, if \nthey were given that case de novo, would say: What? We could not do \nthat. That would be the most pernicious violation of the kinds of \nthings we stand for in this democracy that one could imagine.\n  Yet that is where we stand today. If this statute is not changed, \nanyone can give unlimited amounts of money and get tax deductions for \nthem.\n  Organized crime could contribute to a candidate--not to a candidate, \nbut organized crime could contribute to one of these funds, put ads on \nthe air, and dramatically influence elections. Drug dealers, criminals, \ncould set up funds and affect candidacies. Foreign governments, people \nfrom afar, could do this, and there would be no way to track them down \nor find it out. If the American people knew with some degree of \nprecision what is happening with these accounts, these 527 accounts, \nthey would be shocked. Again, if you were to choose a way of corrupting \nthis democracy, you would design a system similar to these accounts.\n  Here we are with the Senators from Arizona, Wisconsin, and \nConnecticut. Their amendment and mine and others simply says: Don't \nlimit the amount of money--although I would like to do that; don't take \naway the tax deductibility--although I find it absurd that you should \nget a tax deduction for this but the person who gives $25 aboveboard to \nthe candidate he or she believes in gets no tax deduction, but a large \nspecial interest does and influences an election just as profoundly. \nBut we are not doing that. All we are saying is disclose.\n  I am looking forward to hearing from my colleague from Kentucky. I \nrespect his view on the first amendment, which is, frankly, at least in \nthis area, more absolute than mine, but he put his money where his \nmouth is when he opposed, for instance, the flag burning amendment.\n  But disclosure does not violate free speech in any way. If it did, \nall the disclosure regulations that we have should be abolished. Why is \nit that, for these accounts which benefit politicians and political \nparties, there should be secrecy, but for any other kind of account \nthere should not? It is clearly not a first amendment argument.\n  Mr. President, today is the 211th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. \nIt is the most farsighted document dedicated to freedom and humanity \nthat has been created. We should consecrate that birthday by cleaning \nup one part of the campaign finance system that would offend the \nFounding Fathers.\n  When we see what these accounts do, imagine a Jefferson or a Hamilton \nor a Madison looking down and saying: These accounts are being defended \nin the name of the Constitution and of free speech?\n  Just when we think our campaign system could not possibly get any \nworse, along comes the discovery of this new loophole, section 527. \nSection 527 is the largest, most disturbing, and most pernicious \nloophole in a system rife with backdoor ways to influence Government \nthrough hidden money. Mark my words, I say to my colleagues, if we do \nnot close this loophole, or at least expose it to the sunlight of \ndisclosure, the 527 accounts will dominate our elections. The so-called \nhard money will become unimportant. Even the disclosed soft money will \nbecome unimportant. All kinds of people, none of whom we would want to \nsee contributing to campaigns and influencing elections, will come \nabove ground. The effects on our democracy will be profound and \nprofoundly disturbing.\n  The upshot of the crazy system we have, done by accident almost, is \nthat any group can spend any amount on ads that anyone can see are \ndesigned to sway elections, all without disclosure of any kind.\n  The Judiciary Committee spent months examining whether the Chinese \nGovernment improperly funneled money into the 1996 elections. Many of \nmy colleagues on the other side are saying this was improper. If they \nhad used one of these accounts, they never would have known about it, \nand it would have been perfectly legal. The 527 loophole is an open \ninvitation to foreign governments, or anyone else, to secretly pump as \nmuch money as they want into this election. To me, it would be \ncontradictory--no, hypocritical--for those who correctly inveigh \nagainst the abuses of the 1996 election not to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona because if my colleagues want to \nstop foreign government influence and have contributions open and not \nsecret, we must close this loophole.\n  The amendment offered yesterday would end the system of secret \nexpenditures, hidden identities, and sullied elections. It would \nprevent not only foreign governments but organized crime, money \nlaunderers, and drug lords from contributing.\n  When this election is over, the sad fact of the matter is that we \nwill not even know if the Chinese Government sought to influence our \nelections through 527 accounts unless this amendment is adopted because \nthere is no disclosure at all. All we want to do is let the people see \nthe groups, who is paying the tab, and how the contributions are being \nspent.\n  The Supreme Court, on this anniversary of the Bill of Rights, has \nsaid the right to vote is the most important right we have because in a \ndemocracy, the right to vote guarantees all other rights. That basic \nfreedom is tarnished when we prevent the American people from seeing \nwho is trying to influence their vote and how.\n  One of our great jurists, Justice Brandeis, wrote famously that \nsunlight is the best disinfectant. The bottom line is simple: Do we \nwant to disinfect a system which has become worse each year, or do we \nwant to, under some kind of contrived argument, keep the present system \ngoing for someone's own advantage?\n  Finally, I stress this amendment is not an attempt to advance the \nfortunes of one party or another. It is bipartisan, and it is far more \nimportant than that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds to \nfinish my point.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. This is not a liberal or conservative amendment. All \ngroups have availed themselves of this kind of loophole. All groups \nmust be stopped. This is basic information that the people of America \nhave a right to know, and we have a duty to see that they get it. I \nthank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I seek recognition and charge it to the \ntime under my control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened to the interesting \nintroductory remarks by our two distinguished colleagues, and \nmomentarily we may receive the remarks of another distinguished \ncolleague associated with this amendment.\n  I tell my colleagues straightforward, they have my vote. I support \nthem, but I ask them to address the question of the matter that is \npending before the Senate: The annual Armed Forces bill. This is a list \nthat goes back to 1961. The Senate of the United States unfailingly has \npassed an authorization bill for the men and women of the Armed Forces. \nI say to my dear friend and colleague, a former distinguished naval \nofficer, this amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the \nbottom of the sea where only Davy Jones could resurrect it.\n  To what extent have my colleagues who are proposing this thought \nabout breaking 40 years of precedent of the Senate by sinking the \nannual authorization bill at a time when the threats facing the United \nStates of America are far more diverse, far more complicated than ever \nin contemporary history; when the men and women of the Armed Forces of \nthe United States are absolutely desperate in terms of pay and benefits \nto keep them in the jobs as careerists?\n  We now have one of the lowest retention rates ever. There are no \nlines of young men and women waiting to volunteer to be recruited. This \nbill goes a long way. This bill helps with the benefits they rightly \ndeserve. For the first time in the history of the United States of \nAmerica, we have provisions caring for the medical assistance of the \nretirees. First time, Mr. President. It is the first time in the \nhistory of this\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\ncountry, and add on the ships and the aircraft.\n  I read the Constitution of the United States. What are the \nresponsibilities of the Congress as delineated by our Founding Fathers? \n``To declare War . . . To raise and support Armies . . . To provide and \nmaintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the \nland and naval Forces . . . .''\n  That is what this bill does. That is our constitutional fulfillment.\n  Yet my colleagues who are proposing this know full well this bill is \nsubject to what is known as the blue-slip procedure if it leaves this \nChamber with this amendment and goes to the House of Representatives. \nThe House will blue slip it, and this bill is torpedoed.\n  I await reply of the sponsors of the amendment to the points I have \nraised and how it could jeopardize and end the fulfillment of the \nobligation of the Senate under the Constitution of the United States. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield to no one in my concern for the \nmen and women in the military in defense of this Nation. I yield to no \none in this body.\n  I deeply regret that the distinguished chairman of the committee \nwould be part of this red herring which has been raised so Members on \nboth sides of the aisle who oppose disclosure, who have publicly stated \ntime after time they are in favor of full disclosure--I see the Senator \nfrom Colorado on the floor. Senator Wayne Allard stated, in reference \nto campaign finance reform:\n\n       I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant.\n\n  That is from the Congressional Record, page 145, Monday, October 18, \n1999. He will now be on the floor, I believe, in trying to cover up for \nthat statement. I tell you what, I say to the distinguished chairman. \nRight now I will ask him to agree to a unanimous consent agreement--\nright now--that if this provision causes the House, the other body, to \nblue-slip this, on which they have no grounds to do so, the next \nappropriate vehicle that the Parliamentarian views is appropriate, this \namendment will be made part of. I ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thought the Senator from Virginia would object. So I \nwill ask another unanimous consent agreement, that in case this \namendment does cause it to be blue-slipped, it be in order on the next \nappropriate vehicle, as determined by the Parliamentarian, that a vote \nbe held on this amendment with no second-degree amendments. I ask \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object. I object, Mr. President, on \nbehalf of the leadership of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Arizona yield to me for a point of \norder?\n  Mr. McCAIN.. I will not yield to the Senator from Colorado until I \nhave finished my statement.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I just resent the fact that the Senator suggests in some \nway----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  The Senator from Colorado said, on October 18, 1999:\n\n       I strongly believe that sunshine is the best disinfectant.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Concerning campaign finance reform. So if the Senator \nfrom Colorado and the Senator from Virginia are basing their objections \nto this amendment on the grounds that it would harm the Defense \nauthorization bill, then they should have no objection--no objection--\nto the unanimous consent agreement that this amendment be placed on the \nnext appropriate vehicle by the Parliamentarian.\n  But instead, the Senator from Virginia is objecting--I take it the \nSenator from Colorado would object--clearly revealing that the true \nintentions here have a lot more to do with this amendment than with the \ndefense of this Nation.\n  So the fact is, on blue slips, all revenue bills must originate in \nthe other House. The precedents of the Senate on pages 1214 and 1215 \nknow eight types of amendments. I ask unanimous consent that this be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Revenue\n\n       See also ``Constitutionality of Amendments,'' pp. 52-54, \n     683-686.\n\n                   Constitution, Article I, Section 7\n\n\n                      [Proposals To Raise Revenue]\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     Amendments as on other Bills.\n     Bills Raising Revenue Originate in the House\n       The House on various occasions has returned to the Senate \n     bills which the Senate had passed which the House held \n     violated its prerogatives to originate revenue measures.\n       The following types of proposals originating in the Senate \n     were returned by the House or decided by the Senate to be an \n     infringement of the House's constitutional privilege with \n     respect to originating revenue legislation:\n       (1) Providing for a bond issue;\n       (2) Increasing postal rates on certain classes of mail \n     matter;\n       (3) Exempting for a specific period persons from payment of \n     income taxes on the proceeds of sales of certain vessels if \n     reinvested in new ship construction;\n       (4) Providing for a tax on motor-vehicle fuels in the \n     District of Columbia and other District of Columbia tax \n     measures;\n       (5) Agricultural appropriation bill in 1905 with a \n     particular amendment on revenue thereto;\n       (6) Repealing certain provisions of law relative to \n     publicity of income tax rates, with an amendment increasing \n     individual income tax rates;\n       (7) Concurrent resolution interpreting the meaning of the \n     Tariff Act of 1922 with respect to imported broken rice; and\n       (8) The Naval Appropriation bill for 1918 amended to \n     provide for a bond issue of $150,000,000.\n     Constitutionality of Amendments or Bills--Question of Passed \n         on by Senate\n       See also ``Constitutionality of Amendments,'' pp. 52-54, \n     683-686.\n       Under the precedents of the Senate, points of order as to \n     the constitutionality of a bill or amendments proposing to \n     raise revenue will be submitted to the Senate for decision; \n     the Chair or Presiding Officer has no power or authority to \n     pass thereon.\n       A point of order on one occasion was made against a bill \n     that it was revenue raising; it was submitted to the Senate, \n     and subsequently laid on the table by voice vote.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are eight types of amendments that have been \noffered in the Senate in the past that were returned by the House after \nthe House decided that the Senate's action was an infringement on the \nHouse's constitutional privilege with respect to originating revenue \nlegislation.\n  In each of the eight noted examples in the precedents, it is clear \nthat the Senate was seeking to raise revenue of one sort or another, \nfrom increasing postal rates to raising bonds or taxing fuel.\n  This amendment in no way raises any revenue nor does it change in any \nway the amount of revenue collected by the Treasury pursuant to the Tax \nCode. It is simply a clarification in what information must be \ndisclosed by entities seeking to claim status under section 527 of the \nTax Code.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia, the American people will see \nthrough this. The American people will understand what is being done \nhere--an effort to contravene what literally every Member of this body \nhas said, that we need full disclosure of people who donate to American \npolitical campaigns. And if that were not the reason--if that were not \nthe reason--then the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from \nColorado would agree to my unanimous consent agreement, which I repeat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on the next appropriate \nvehicle that is viewed appropriate by the Parliamentarian, this \namendment be made in order for an up-or-down vote with no second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have just totally disclosed what this is all about. \nThis is not about the defense of the Nation. This is a defense of a \ncorrupt system which, in the view of objective observers, has made a \nmockery of existing campaign finance laws, which has caused Americans \nto become alienated from the system.\n  We were worried about Chinese money in the 1996 elections. Under the\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\npresent system of 527, Chinese money, drug money, Mafia money, \nanybody's money can come into American political campaigns, and there \nis no reason to disclose it.\n  So now here we are with 100 Members of this Senate all saying we need \nfull disclosure, using a constitutional facade which is not correct as \na reason to vote against this amendment and vote it down.\n  I say again, for the third time, if it is a constitutional objection, \nand that objection is legitimate, then the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Colorado have no reason to object to this amendment \nbeing made part of the next appropriate vehicle which is deemed \nappropriate by the Parliamentarian. And by so objecting to that \nunanimous consent agreement, their defense or their argument that \nsomehow we are harming the Defense authorization bill does not have \ncredibility.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to yield all the time. I would be glad \nto engage in this. But I wondered what would happen last night after we \nproposed this amendment for full disclosure. I wondered. I wondered \nwhat the defense against cleaning up at least to some degree, allowing \nthe American people to know who are contributing to American political \ncampaigns in unprecedented amounts of money, would be.\n  I repeat, one more time, I yield to no one in this body as to my \nadvocacy for our Nation's defense and the men and women in the \nmilitary. But if we want to give these men and women in the military \nconfidence in their Government, we should have fully disclosed who it \nis that contributes to the political campaigns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona and \nI go back a very long way. When I was Secretary of the Navy, he was \nincarcerated as a consequence of his heroic service in Vietnam. His \nfather was among if not the most valued adviser I had during the \nturbulent period of that war when I had the responsibility for the \nDepartment of the Navy. That was for over 5 years, 1969 through 1974.\n  I have the highest personal regard for my friend and my colleague, \nwhom I have worked with from the day he returned to the United States \nof America to be welcomed quite properly as a hero.\n  I know for a fact that he has always foremost in his mind, every day \nthat he draws a breath, every day the great Lord of ours gives him the \nstrength to take up his responsibilities, the welfare of the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces. I find it very awkward to be in a position \nto be in opposition to my friend, but the rules are quite clear of the \nHouse that it is a matter of privilege of the House regarding the \nconstitutional provision as it relates to taxation.\n  It has been a matter of privilege since the inception of this \nRepublic. That privilege is determined by the House in the course of \nresolutions. If this bill goes over, then they adopt a resolution. We \nknow from consultation there are Members of the House who will \nabsolutely take that resolution to the floor, and there is no doubt \nthat this bill will be blue-slipped, and it will be torpedoed and go to \nthe bottom of Davy Jones' locker.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Arizona to require the disclosure of donors \nto tax-exempt groups who engage in political activities. These groups \nuse an obscure provision of the Tax Code--section 527--to shield the \nidentity of contributors and use the funds to make anonymous attacks on \ncandidates for public office.\n  Section 527 organizations represent the latest attempt to bypass \ncampaign finance laws and pour undisclosed money in the electoral \nprocess. There is no official public information about the number of \nsuch groups, who their officers are, where the money is coming from, \nand how it is being spent.\n  Section 527 of the Tax Code was enacted to provide candidates, \npolitical parties, and PAC's with special tax treatment. These groups \nare required to register with the Federal Election Commission and \ndisclose contribution and expenditure information.\n  In recent years, however, the IRS has ruled that organizations which \nintend to influence the outcome of an election but do not expressly \nadvocate the election of a candidate qualify as a political \norganization but are not required to file with the FEC. These groups \ncan raise and spend as much money as they want to influence an \nelection, but the public has no information on who or what they are.\n  This is precisely the sort of activity that makes the political \nprocess appear corrupt and undemocratic. The American public is \nbecoming increasingly disenchanted and uninterested in electoral \nprocess because they feel their voices are being drowned out by soft \nmoney donations to political parties.\n  In the case of soft money, however, at least the amount of the \ncontribution and the name of the group or person who is making the \ndonation must be registered with the Federal Election Commission. These \ngroups spend unlimited amounts of money and none of it has to be \ndisclosed. This insidious hijacking of the campaign finance system must \nbe corrected.\n  It is a simple fact that the American public believes that large \ncontributions are made to influence decisions being made in Washington. \nThey are becomingly increasingly cynical of the process and fewer and \nfewer people are participating in elections.\n  In 1996, voter turnout was 48.8 percent--the lowest level since 1924. \nTurnout for the 1998 mid-term election was 36 percent--the lowest for a \nnonpresidential election in 56 years. Congress has a responsibility to \ntake steps to reverse this trend.\n  The first step should be to require the disclosure of contributors to \ntax-exempt organizations. The Senate must act to close this loophole \nand we must do it now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as my distinguished \ncolleague desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the importance of \nthe authorization of the Department of Defense. This is an important \npiece of legislation. I am not here to impugn the motives of some of \nthe other Members of the Senate or to try to mischaracterize what their \nreasons might be for coming to the floor.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. Senator McCain from Arizona is \ncertainly a hero in my mind; he continues to be that. I know he is \ntrying to do what he thinks is best for this country. I respect that. I \nthink we have before us a very important piece of legislation. We \nshould not put it at risk.\n  This is an authorization bill that increases, by some $4.5 billion, \ndefense spending over what the President proposed. It is a 4.4-percent \nincrease in real terms over what we spent last year. If there is \nanything we have neglected over the last several years in the budget, \nit is our defense.\n  We have been obligating our troops overseas. In fact, if we look at \nthe record, between 1956 and 1992, our troops were deployed some 51 \ntimes. Between 1992 and today, we had the same number of deployments. \nAt the same time we are increasing our reliability on our fighting men \nand women, we are cutting their budget. I think that is inexcusable.\n  It is time Congress recognized what the problem is that the President \nof the United States in particular recognizes: We are not appreciating \nthe service of our men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  With this legislation, we begin to appreciate the dedication and hard \nwork of the men and women who have been serving us in the Armed Forces. \nAgain, I thank Chairman Warner for allowing me another opportunity to \nspeak in strong support of this essential bill for our men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  This bill is a fitting tribute for those who served, are serving, and \nwill serve in the armed services in the future. The defense bill is \nsimply too important to be mired in political goals but should show \nthem respect and provide them the best defense authorization bill we \npossibly can.\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\n  The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan \neffort. For the second year in a row, we have reversed the downward \ntrend in defense spending by increasing this year's funding by $4.5 \nbillion over the President's request for a funding level of $309.8 \nbillion.\n  As the Strategic Subcommittee chairman, we held four hearings. The \nfirst hearing was on our national and theater and missile defense \nprograms. The second hearing was on our national security space \nprograms. We had a third hearing, the first congressional hearing on \nthe newly-created and much-needed National Nuclear Security \nAdministration, NNSA, and we had a fourth hearing on the environmental \nmanagement programs at the Department of Energy.\n  In response to the needs we have heard during the hearings, the \nStrategic Subcommittee has a net budget authority increase of $266.7 \nmillion above the President's budget. This includes an increase of \n$503.3 million to the Department of Defense account and a decrease of \n$263.3 million to the Department of Energy accounts.\n  There are two provisions I will highlight which pertain to the future \nof our nuclear forces. The first relates to the great debate we had on \nTuesday and Wednesday regarding the amendment by Senator Kerrey and the \nsecond degree by Senator Warner. The original provision requires the \nSecretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to \nconduct an updated Nuclear Posture Review. It was in 1994 that we had \nthe last Nuclear Posture Review. However, with the adoption of the \nWarner amendment, there is not in place a mechanism by which the \nPresident may waive the START I force level requirements.\n\n  The second provision requires the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Energy, to develop a long-range plan \nfor the sustainment and modernization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces. \nWe are concerned that neither Department had a long-term vision about \ntheir current modernization efforts. Both of these provisions are \nimportant pieces of the puzzle for the future of our nuclear weapons \nposture.\n  A few budget items I will highlight include an increase of $92.4 \nmillion for the airborne laser program that requires the Air Force to \nstay on the budgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and a 2007 \ninitial operational capability; an increase of $30 million for the \nspace-based laser program; a $129 million increase for national missile \ndefense risk reduction; an increase of $60 million for Navy \ntheaterwide; and an extra $8 million for the Arrow system improvement \nprogram; and for the tactical high energy program, an increase of $15 \nmillion.\n  For the Department of Energy programs, we increase by $87 million a \nprogram within the NNSA, which is an increase of $331 million over last \nyear. In the Department of Energy's environmental management account, \nwe decrease the authorization by $132 million. However, I will stress \nthat this bill still increases the environmental management account by \nmore than $250 million over last year's appropriated amount.\n  Again, I will mention a few important highlights of the authorization \nbill outside of the Strategic Subcommittee. There are many significant \nimprovements to the TRICARE program for active-duty family members. The \nbill includes a comprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy \nprogram for eligible beneficiaries, no enrollment fees or deductible, \nresulting in the first medical entitlement for the military Medicare-\neligible population. I am very happy with the extensions and expansions \nof the Medicare subvention program to major medical centers and the \nnumber of sites for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Demonstration \nProgram. Yesterday, the Senate, by a vote of 96-1, supported Warner-\nHutchinson, which eliminated the law that forced military retirees out \nof the military health care system when they became eligible for \nMedicare. Now they have all the rights and benefits of any other \nretiree.\n  With regard to the workers at the Department of Energy, we provide \nemployee incentives for retention and separation of Federal employees \nat closure project facilities. These incentives are needed in order to \nmitigate the anticipated high attrition rate of certain Federal \nemployees with critical skills. Just today, we accepted a very \nimportant amendment which established an employee compensation \ninitiative for Department of Energy employees who were injured as a \nresult of their employment at Department of Energy sites.\n  As the Strategic Committee chairman, I believe this bill is the only \nvehicle to provide such an initiative for these workers and their \nfamilies. I think that is very important. This bill is the only vehicle \nto provide such initiative for those workers and their families who \nwork at the Department of Energy sites.\n  On Tuesday, this bill added an additional piece of funding for a \nmemorial which should have already been built. The amendment added $6 \nmillion for the World War II memorial.\n  I will include for the record a copy of the opinion editorial I wrote \nconcerning the World War II memorial. I ask unanimous consent that that \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Time Has Come To Honor the ``Greatest Generation'' With a Great \n                                Memorial\n\n                       (By Senator Wayne Allard)\n\n       June 6 marked the 56th Anniversary of D-Day, the greatest \n     battle fought by what has become known as the ``greatest \n     generation''--the men and women who served our country in \n     World War II.\n       Although it might seem incredible, there is no national \n     monument to recognize those who served our country in Second \n     World War. The Iwo Jima sculpture near Arlington Cemetery is \n     sometimes thought as holding that distinction, but it \n     actually commemorates the Marine Corps alone. There has long \n     been an effort to build something to serve as a focal point \n     dedicated to the memory of what our entire country and its \n     armed forces went through--the memory of what was lost and of \n     what was won--and this project is finally nearing the \n     construction phase.\n       I had the honor of listening to former U.S. Senator Bob \n     Dole recently talk about his life and service in the 10th \n     Mountain Division during World War II. To the many roles this \n     undeniably great man has had over the years--Senate Majority \n     Leader, president and vice president nominee, Congressman, \n     and W.W.II platoon leader--he has added fundraiser for the \n     national World War II Memorial. As we remember those who \n     sacrificed to make D-Day a success, I think it is entirely \n     appropriate to pass along his request to me for support from \n     my fellow Coloradans in raising the needed funds to complete \n     this most worthy memorial.\n       Construction on the memorial is scheduled to begin soon on \n     the National Mall in a powerful location between the \n     Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial on Veterans Day, \n     2000. But the $100 million goal has still not quite been \n     reached, and that money needs to be raised to complete the \n     memorial project.\n       The memorial was conceived to be privately supported. This \n     is how many other monuments that line the Washington Mall--\n     the Vietnam and Korean War memorial, and the Washington and \n     Lincoln memorials, for instance--were financed. The \n     government has given support in the form of land and will \n     contribute operation and maintenance requirements as well, \n     but the remaining funding still needs to be found.\n       The preliminary design features a lowered plaza surrounding \n     a pool. The amphitheater-like entrance will be flanked by two \n     large American flags. Within two granite arches at the north \n     and south ends of the plaza, bronze American eagles hold \n     laurels memorializing the victory of the W.W.II generation. \n     Fifty-six stone pillars surrounding the plaza represent the \n     48 states and 8 territories that comprised the U.S. during \n     W.W.II; collectively, they symbolize the unit and strength of \n     the nation.\n       If we look closely, everyone of us knows someone who served \n     our country during World War II. Be it a father, uncle, \n     brother, sister, neighbor or friend, I encourage you to \n     contribute to this cause in their honor. It is time the \n     ``great generation'' had a great memorial to honor their \n     sacrifice and service to our country.\n       Information on the project can be obtained through the \n     National World War II Memorial, 2300 Clarendon Blvd., Suite \n     501 Arlington, Virginia 22201 or at wwiimemorial.com and 1-\n     800-639-4WW2.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Finally, I want to mention my strong support for the \nSmith amendment, of which I am a cosponsor. This amendment would \nprohibit the granting of security clearances for DOD or contractor \nemployees who have been convicted and sentenced for a felony, an \nunlawful user or addict to any controlled substance, and any other \ncriteria. To be brief, our U.S. national security is too important to \nrisk by granting clearances to felons. We are all concerned about \npersonal rights, but when it comes to security issues, these must \noverride all others.\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\n  Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner for the opportunity to point \nout some of the highlights in the bill which the Strategic Subcommittee \nhas oversight of and to congratulate him and Senator Levin for the \nbipartisan way in which this bill was developed. I ask all Senators to \nstrongly support S. 2549. One of Congress' main responsibilities is to \nprovide for the common defense of the United States. I am proud of what \nthis bill provides for our men and women in uniform.\n  We must not be blinded by political motives when it comes to our men \nand women in the armed services. All of the issues that come before the \nSenate are critical, but I hope that when it comes to this bill, we \nwill remember why we are doing this. This bill is not for us and our \npolitical goals, but for our young men and women in the armed services.\n  I see this bill as a tribute to the dedication and hard work of these \nyoung men and women--the same men and women I had the opportunity to \nvisit a few weeks ago on the U.S.S. Enterprise.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that a piece I wrote regarding \nthat visit and dedication be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Armed Forces Day 2000--A Tribute To Our Men and Women In Uniform\n\n                     (By U.S. Senator Wayne Allard)\n\n       Saturday, May 20th was Armed Forces Day and I can think of \n     no better time to honor those who serve this great country in \n     the United States military. The millions of active duty \n     personnel who have so unselfishly dedicated their lives to \n     protecting freedom deserve the highest degree of respect and \n     a day of honor.\n       I recently had the privilege of being invited to tour the \n     U.S.S. Enterprise during a training mission off the Florida \n     coast. My experience aboard Enterprise reminded me of the \n     awesome power and strength of the United States military. But \n     more importantly it reminded me of the hard work and \n     sacrifice of the men and women serving in our armed forces.\n       The U.S.S. Enterprise was commissioned on Sept. 24, 1960 \n     and was the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. \n     This incredible ship is the largest carrier in the Naval \n     fleet at 1,123 feet long and 250 feet high. While walking \n     along the 4.47 acre flight deck with Captain James A. \n     Winnefeld, Jr., Commanding Officer, it was amazing to learn \n     that ``The Big E'' remains the fastest combatant in the \n     world.\n       Spending two days touring the Enterprise showed me what a \n     hard working and knowledgeable military force we have. As I \n     moved through the ship I was greeted with enthusiasm, as \n     sailors explained the ship's equipment and their role as part \n     of the Enterprise crew. At full staff, the ``Big E'', as it \n     is affectionately known, has over 5,000 crew members from \n     every state of the union, most of whom are between 18 and 24 \n     years old. These young adults are charged with maintaining \n     and operating the largest air craft carrier in the world and \n     guiding multi million dollar airplanes as they land on a \n     floating runway. I was in awe of these men and women who work \n     harder and have more responsibility than many people do in a \n     lifetime.\n       ``The Big E'' is a ship that never sleeps, it operates \n     twenty four hours a day, a seven days a week. I watched as a \n     handful of tired pilots sat down for `diner' at 10:30 p.m. on \n     a Sunday night. Hungry and tired, they wanted it no other \n     way. I had the privileged of joining Captain Winnefeld in \n     honoring the `Sailor of the Day,' Machinist Mate 1st Class \n     Michael Gibbons, for spending three conservative days \n     repairing the main condensation pump which is critical to the \n     propulsion plant, taking only a few 30 minutes breaks to \n     sleep. I witnessed the same degree of commitment in a \n     separate part of the ship as Aviation Boatswains May 2nd \n     Class Andre Farrell showed me how the a cables on the flight \n     deck operate and are maintained below. His task for the past \n     two days was to create the metal attachment which holds the \n     one of the four arresting tailbook cables together and his \n     voice was filled with pride as explained the entire 8 hours \n     process. Between giving orders to his crew, he pointed out a \n     few tiny air bulles that formed during the cooling process of \n     the metal attachment. Although he started his shift at 4:30 \n     a.m. and probably won't sleep for the next 24 hours, he \n     smiles and tells me it will be redone, that it must be \n     perfect--lives of our pilots are at risk if it is not. The \n     amazing thing is, they all do it with a smile.\n       When I think about Armed Forces Day, I think about two \n     events I experienced on the Enterprise. First, are the \n     sailors from across Colorado who has down for breakfast with \n     me in the enlisted mess hall, who gleamed with pride for the \n     job they do and the important role they play in our nations \n     defense. Second, was the ``Town Hall meeting'' I held, where \n     I responded to questions and concerns ranging from military \n     health care to social Security, from members of the crew. \n     These one on one interactions were extremely valuable to me \n     and I learned as much from these events as the crew did.\n       I have never witnessed a more dedicated or hard working \n     group of people than the draw of the U.S.S. Enterprise. It \n     makes me proud when I realize that the ``Big E'' crew is \n     representative of the millions of American military personnel \n     throughout the World. Never-mind that many of them could be \n     paid more money for less work work in a civilian job, may not \n     get eight hours sleep each night or see their for weeks at \n     the time--they have those sacrifices for the country they \n     love.\n       I hope that Coloradan's joint me join me in using Armed \n     Forces Day to thank those who are serving in the best \n     military force in the world.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for a strong vote on this bill in \norder to get the much needed and well-deserved resources to our \nmilitary personnel.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nReid of Rhode Island be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and my friend from Wisconsin. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Feinstein of California be added as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have watched the steady \ndeterioration of the vitality of our democracy under assault not from \nthe kinds of foreign enemies that the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill is aimed at protecting us against, but in some \nsenses, an assault from ourselves. We have allowed our political \nsystem--particularly the post-Watergate reforms that were adopted to \nput limits on how much people could give to campaigns, to require full \ndisclosure of those contributions--to be evaded, eroded, made a mockery \nof. The result is that the people of this country rightly conclude that \nmoney buys access and influence and affects our Government, and it \nturns millions of them off from the process.\n  The vitality of this democracy, which is the pulsating virtue and the \nessence of America that generations of our soldiers have fought and \ndied for, is under attack domestically.\n  The question is whether we will respond, whether we will defend our \ndemocracy. We have had terrible controversies here on the floor over \nthis question, focused particularly in recent months and years on the \nwork that the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin have done--Senators \nMcCain and Feingold--particularly trying to focus in on soft money. The \ncontroversies have not produced yet the 60 votes we need to adopt a \nchange. But even in the case of soft money, though it clearly violates \nthe intention of the law, which is to limit contributions, there is \ndisclosure. So that part of the post-Watergate reform is still honored.\n  Now we have the appearance of these 527s, stealth PACs--spending \nenormous amounts of money in advertising, buying time for what has \nbecome ``Big Brother'' propaganda over TV to influence voters, without \nletting them or those who are the targets of those advertisements or \nthe opponents of those for whom they are being placed know who is \npaying for them, how much are they paying, and where is the money \ncoming from. Is it coming from America? Is it coming from abroad?\n  So a bipartisan group of us--breaking through the division on party \nlines that has characterized too much of this debate about campaign \nfinance reform and too much debate here generally--earlier this year, \nproposed two responses. The amendment before the Senate now is the \nsecond of those responses. It simply requires disclosure. It doesn't \nend the mockery of saying one thing to the Federal Elections Commission \nand another to the IRS--yes, I am in the business of influencing \nelections, so I deserve the tax exemption; or, no, I am not, so I don't \nhave to register under the campaign finance laws. All this amendment \ndoes is ask for disclosure.\n\n  Where is the money coming from? Who is giving it? Who is running \nthese organizations? Who is coming in to try to influence the sacred \nright of voting--the franchise that is at the heart of our democracy? I \nhad hoped that this amendment, which is reasonable,\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nmoderate, and only invoking the ideal of the right to know, would not \nevoke controversy on the floor.\n  So I am disappointed at the response today and disappointed \nparticularly that it comes from those who apparently support the \nessence of the amendment. I understand this question of an objection--\nthe so-called blue-slip objection being raised in the House because, \ntechnically--though really in a very minimal way, if at all--this may \naffect revenue. This is about political freedom, about electoral \nreform, about disclosure to the public. It is hardly at all, if at all, \na revenue measure.\n  I understand the fear that if this amendment passes, it may be \nobjected to in the House, and as my distinguished chairman from \nVirginia, who I dearly love and respect, said before, it could sink \nthis bill, which I enthusiastically support, to the bottom of the \nocean, such that hardly Davy Jones could rescue it. Here is my response \nto that, respectfully: I hope not. I say that this amendment is so \nimportant and gives us such a unique opportunity in the recent history \nof this body to come together across party lines and to do something in \nthe direction of campaign finance reform that it is worth putting it on \nthe bill. I say, as one of the proponents of this amendment, that if, \nin fact, the fears expressed here are realized, which is that in the \nHouse the bill is blue-slipped, objected to on constitutional grounds \nthat it is a revenue-raising measure and should start in the House, \nthen we can do what has been done with many bills, including the DOD \nauthorization bills, in past years--bring it back here under unanimous \nconsent. Who would object to bringing it back? Take this amendment off, \nsend the bill back, and play the role.\n  They may continue referring to the metaphor of Davy Jones rescuing \nthe bill, but let's not, on a technical basis, miss the opportunity to \ntake one significant step to defend our democracy against the insidious \nforces of unlimited, secret cash that are corrupting it and distancing \nmillions of our fellow citizens from the process itself.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on the time yielded to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute of his 8 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Some may ask why disclosure is so \nimportant. Well, the Supreme Court has spoken about the appearance of \ncorruption. Here, there is the profound suspicion of corruption; but \nwithout information, we don't even have the ability to know whether \nthere is corruption, let alone to have the appearance of corruption--\nbig money, secret money, perhaps not even American money, raised by \nelected officials, raised by left-leaning, right-leaning ideological \ngroups, raised by political groups, and trade and economic groups, do \nnothing but undermine our system. The least that we can ask is for \ndisclosure.\n  Mr. President, I appeal to my colleagues, let's break the reflex \naction and let's rise to the moment. Let's do something correct and \ncourageous here. Let's adopt this amendment and agree together, arm in \narm, that if the House refuses to take the bill with this amendment on \nit, we will strip it off and find the next appropriate vehicle, having \nspoken for this amendment to attach this principle and to advance the \nhealth and vitality of our democracy. No less than that is at stake \nhere.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of my \ncolleague. I will charge the time of the entire colloquy to that under \nmy control.\n  As always, the Senator from Connecticut is fair and straightforward, \nand clearly in his dissertation to the Senate he said, yes, there is a \nvestige that this blue-slip procedure could send it to the bottom to \nDavy Jones' Locker, which I accept.\n  I read from Descher's House Precedents, which is the ``bible'' that \nguides the House.\n  This is fascinating. Listen to the title: ``Invasion of House \nJurisdiction or Prerogatives.''\n  Isn't that interesting?\n\n       Invasion of the House prerogative to originate revenue-\n     raising legislation granted by article I, section 7, of the \n     Constitution raises a question of privilege of the House.\n\n  I have studied all of this very carefully. Once that question of \nprivilege is raised, the Senate is left to their interpretation.\n  Colleagues are clearly putting forward this amendment with the best \nof intentions. I said I would support the amendment in any other venue \nbut this. It does raise it, and the House will not allow it. I can \nrecite dozens of precedents. A year or two ago, they sent a blue slip \nto us on S. 4, the thrift savings accounts for sailors, soldiers, and \nmarines.\n  I am saying to my dear friend: Why should we take the risk, given the \nfew legislative days left, and given all the work? It is interesting. \nOur committee has had 50 committee hearings and 11 markup sessions. \nThat is a year's work by 20-plus members of our committee and by the \nstaff, paid for by the Senate, out of taxpayers' funds. All of that is \nfor naught if this bill goes down. It would be the first time in 40 \nyears.\n  I say to my colleagues: No matter how strongly you feel about the \nmerits of this bill, consider our own constitutional responsibility to \nprovide under the Constitution for the men and women of the Armed \nForces.\n  I say to my colleague: I would like to know what his reasoning is to \ntake this risk. The Senator from Connecticut is not known as a risk \ntaker.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I will not respond to the description \nof the Senator from Connecticut. But let me say, if there is a risk, \nhere is a risk that has a remedy. The reason the Senator from \nConnecticut is prepared to take the risk is the balance of equities \ninvolved and the balance of interests involved.\n  I am so incensed by the proliferation. We are using military terms, \nquite appropriately, on this campaign finance amendment. I note the \nHouse chose to use appropriately a militaristic term--``invasion''--\nwhen talking about their privileges.\n  But our democracy is so much under threat from the corrosive spread \nof money in our system that I think we have a moment of opportunity \nhere to get together to pass this amendment and make the statement; in \nother words, a procedural vote on this. My dear friend and chairman in \nthe House on this very matter on another bill a week or so ago fell \nshort of passage on a motion to recommit, I believe, by barely 10 \nvotes.\n  I am not prepared to make a judgment about how the House will vote on \nthis matter. But I think we have a chance to speak.\n\n  I pledge to the Senator from Virginia, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, under whose leadership this committee on \nwhich I am honored to serve had a very busy and productive year \nresulting in this bill. I can't imagine that any Member of this Chamber \nwould deny a unanimous consent request. If, in fact, the House saw this \nas an invasion of their privilege and stopped the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill, we would come back here and take this amendment \noff, and find another vehicle for it.\n  I appeal to my chairman just finally on this point. I appreciate very \nmuch his statement that he supports the substance of the amendment. If \nhe proceeds on the course of a constitutional objection based on House \nprerogatives, I appeal to him to find a way to join with us, since we \nagree on the merits of this amendment, to get a guarantee that the \nSenate will be able to speak as soon and as clearly as possible on the \nnext available bill to at least require disclosure of contributions and \nsources of contributions to these 527 stealth PACs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. When I regain the \nfloor later I will talk about how long 527 has been around. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut sounds as if it has just come on the horizon. It has \nbeen around. I don't know why we are taking it up today when it has \nbeen around for some time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield such time as my colleague from New \nHampshire may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. The ``U.S.S. \nWarner'' has been under siege on the floor for the last few days, but, \nas usual, he\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\nholds up well under hostile fire and keeps his ship on course.\n  If anyone needs to be reminded, this is a debate supposedly about the \nbill to fund the operation of our armed services. It is a good bill for \nour military. It doesn't do everything we would like, but it certainly \nmakes a vast improvement over what we have been doing.\n  I rise to show support for that bill. As a member of the committee, I \nhelped to write it, and also to show support for my chairman who has \nendured some hostile fire, I think, unfairly.\n  During the recess last week, the Members had the opportunity to \nremember those who fought for the freedom that we enjoy in this Nation, \nand remember those who paid the ultimate price in giving their lives. \nThat was the Memorial Day recess.\n  I think in deference to those and to those who now serve us, I think \nwe ought to stay focused, as the chairman has tried to do here, on the \nissue at hand. This is not a debate about campaign finance, nor should \nit be. We owe it to the soldiers, sailors, and airmen who serve today, \nwho will serve in the future, and to those who have already served, to \nget this bill passed, and to do so quickly.\n  I think we should be reminded that this bill authorizes over $300 \nbillion in defense spending--a 4.4-percent real increase--reversing \nsome 14 years of neglect.\n\n  You can go down the list: But aircraft, helicopters, submarines, \nsurface ships, many other weapons systems, and missile defense, on and \non--not to mention addressing some real critical needs in readiness.\n  The bill adds about $1.5 billion for key programs in readiness, \nincluding ammunition, spare parts, maintenance, operation, and \ntraining. This is very important.\n  I think it is below the dignity of those who have served and will \nserve and who are serving to reduce this debate to something other than \nwhat the issue is at hand. That is what disturbs me.\n  I understand and fully respect the right of any colleague to offer an \namendment that is within the rules, and I respect it. But I also don't \nthink it is good judgment to do it.\n  This bill is going to modernize our forces. It will allow us to \ndevelop the technologies that we need to address the threats that we \nface in the coming century in areas such as missile defense.\n  My colleague, Senator Allard, who chairs the subcommittee I used to \nchair on strategic forces, has done an outstanding job in addressing \nthat, as have so many of my other colleagues. This will allow us to \naddress the quality of life of our service men and women and their \nfamilies. There is a 3.7-percent pay raise in this bill.\n  I am not commenting on the importance or lack of importance of the \nother issues that we debate here. But it is not the appropriate place \nto do it. Is it within the rules of the Senate to do it? Yes. In that \nsense, I suppose you can say it is appropriate. But is it the right \nthing to do on a military budget and on the defense budget of the \nUnited States? I don't think so. I think it does not dignify the \ndebate. I think it reflects badly on the Senate. That is my honest \nopinion.\n  I know the frustrations. We have had debates on campaign finance and \nthe proponents of campaign finance reform have lost, repeatedly. I \nunderstand the frustration. I have been on the losing side on many of \ndebates many times. I look forward to the day some of the debates will \nhave a majority to win.\n  Maybe that is the approach we ought to take, rather than, with all \ndue respect, dragging this defense bill into this debate.\n  I will highlight a couple of other things. As chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, this bill has $1.27 billion for \nenvironment restoration. I thank the chairman for his outstanding \nleadership in putting this together, as well as Senator Levin.\n  The bill also authorizes additional funds for programs important to \nNew Hampshire and the Nation. These programs address unfunded military \nrequirements, continue or enhance current promising Department of \nDefense programs, or support the technology base needed for future \nmilitary systems. Inclusion of these additional funds is testament to \nthe technical expertise and successful competition for DOD contracts of \ndefense companies and institutions in my home State of New Hampshire.\n  In addition to authorizing a $350 million increase for important \nmissile defense programs that I support, this bill provides important \nfunds that the President neglected in his budget that are important for \nthe U.S. to maintain its leadership in military space power. It \nauthorizes $25 million for the Kinetic Energy Anti-Satellite (KE-ASAT) \nprogram that will provide a last-resort ``hard-kill'' capability for \nthe U.S. to protect our troops from enemy surveillance. It authorizes \nan additional $15 million for the Space Maneuver Vehicle to leverage \nthe NASA X-37 investment in an area that also holds great promise for \nmilitary applications. It also authorizes an additional $12 million for \nmicro-satellite technology that demonstrates key future space-control \nconcepts.\n  The bill also pays a fitting tribute to our former President Ronald \nReagan and his vision for our nation's missile defense by renaming the \nKwajalian missile test range in his honor--a facility we use to test \nand refine our missile defense concepts making an NMD deployment \npossible today.\n  Finally, it includes additional tasks for the Space Commission which \nis just getting started not only to assess the organizational and \nmanagerial changes needed to ensure U.S. space power in the years ahead \nbut also address the cultural issues in the military that dampen our \nability to become a true space power.\n  I will mention one other item before I yield the floor. I have an \namendment I have offered that has not yet been voted on. I will \nhighlight it for a minute. The amendment was modeled on the \nrestrictions which have been placed on gun ownership. It says if you \nare a felon, you don't get a security clearance. That is the essence of \nit. It is pretty well refined. The language is a little tighter than \nthat so the definition of ``felon'' is restricted.\n  It is very interesting that under current law you can have access to \nsome of the highest ranking military secrets, about some of the biggest \nweapons in America's arsenal, but you can't buy a handgun. What does \nthat say about the security clearances we are issuing, if you can't \nhave access to a pistol or rifle, but you can have access to the most \nlethal weapons in America's arsenal? It is happening now. Murderers, \nrobbers, and pedophiles are getting security clearances, and they \ncouldn't have access to a handgun. I think it is pretty interesting \nthat we are in this situation.\n  My amendment, which, hopefully, will be added to the bill, prohibits \nsecurity clearances for persons actually sentenced to over a year--in \nessence, a felon. If you plead, bargain down a sentence to under a \nyear, you can still never own a firearm but you could, without my \namendment, get a security clearance.\n  I hope we will pass my amendment. I look forward to a vote on that \namendment. If it is accepted, that will be fine. If it is not accepted, \nI look forward to the vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, to refrain from the \ndebate that might delay the passage of this legislation, and send a \nmessage to our troops that we care about them, we are ready to help \ntheir readiness, we are ready to help with the new weapon systems they \nneed, and we are ready to give them the pay raise they deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent Senators Durbin, Bryan, and \nBoxer be added as cosponsors to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I state my regret over the position in \nwhich we find ourselves with Senator Warner. There is no one in this \ninstitution more committed to the Armed Forces. His legislation \ndeserves being supported.\n  I regret this amendment has become a complication. However, it is a \nnecessity. This is an extraordinary moment in the national political \nprocess. Make no mistake, if this Senate fails to deal\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nwith the problem of 527 organizations and their influence in the \nAmerican political process, what little remains of campaign finance \nlaws in this Nation will collapse before our eyes.\n  The Justice Department may be investigating foreign contributions and \nthe media may be discussing soft money, but the Members of the Senate \nknow that the newest and largest challenge to the integrity of the \nAmerican political financial system are the 527 organizations. It would \nbe difficult for most Americans to even believe the scale of the \nproblem. It is not a new problem. In 1996, $67 million was introduced \nto the American political systems through these organizations; 2 years \nago, it was $250 million. It could easily be hundreds of millions of \ndollars in the ensuing months if the Senate does not act.\n  It is a contradiction with everything this Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis has attempted to do to preserve some integrity in the American \nfinancial political system in the last 30 years. The donors to these \norganizations are secret. They are not necessarily American. They use \ntax deductions. They distort the national political debate. Everything \nwe are now investigating is legal if they are done through these \norganizations: foreign governments, illegal organizations, individuals \nwho simply want to distort the system through the exclusive use of \ntheir own money.\n  Some of these organizations may not be organizations at all. It could \nbe a single individual writing $1 million or a multimillion-dollar \ncheck in the disguise of an organization. Compounding the problem, \nadding insult to injury, they are reducing it from their taxes.\n  Only a few days ago, in the State of New Jersey, two Republican \nprimaries were influenced by these organizations. Candidates were \ncampaigning, raising funds, gaining support, and these organizations \nwith secret donors began their advertising campaigns. Not a single \nvoter knew who they were, where they came from, what the moneys were \nabout. They only heard the advertisements.\n  In some respects, this is not a policy question; it is a law \nenforcement problem. If these organizations coordinate with candidates \nand their campaigns, it already violates laws. It is incumbent upon the \nJustice Department to investigate them and prosecute them if necessary.\n  I trust on this day while the Senate debates this issue, the Justice \nDepartment will meet its responsibilities. But if they are not \ncoordinated, they are legal. That burden falls on us.\n  I regret the difficulty this causes for Senator Warner on this very \nimportant piece of legislation. His constitutional argument may be \nsound regarding the reaction of the House of Representatives. But the \nconsequences of not acting are enormous. As chairman of the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee, I have urged every Democratic senatorial \ncandidate in the Nation not to engage in this practice of 527s, not to \ncoordinate with them, because it is unethical and it is illegal--\ndenounce them.\n  If we have learned anything by the soft money example and other \nexceptions that have been taken to the prevailing campaign finance \nlaws, it is when a precedence is established and a campaign expenditure \nenters the political culture, it expands exponentially. This may be our \nlast opportunity before the 2000 elections to close this new avenue of \nexpression through large, unregulated, undisclosed political \ncontributions.\n  Make no mistake, if we fail to do so, we do not simply invite the \nabuses of the last few elections, we may create a political system \nwhere we return to the type of campaigns before Watergate, where no one \nknew where the money was coming from, who was providing it, and what \nwas being spent.\n  What little remains of this campaign finance system will collapse \nbefore our eyes, not in future years, but in future weeks. This Senate \nhas failed to agree upon comprehensive campaign finance reform. While I \nregret that failure, I at least understand it. There are legitimate \nconstitutional arguments, differences in philosophy and politics.\n  There can be no legitimate differences on outlawing these \nundisclosed, unregulated 527 organizations. This should be bipartisan \nand it should be a deep commitment upon which we act immediately.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Lieberman in his amendment as a \nsponsor. I urge the Senate to act before it is too late. The \nconsequences of inaction are enormous, and reconstructing this system, \nif indeed these organizations proliferate in the ensuing months, will \nbe extremely difficult to impossible. I urge the Senate to act.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for the time and for \nhis support for our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I regret we are doing this today. I can \nonly speak for myself and not others, but if you wanted to do away with \n527s for everybody and not leave anybody out, I would do it and do it \nin a heartbeat. But not on this bill. Everybody knows the consequences \nof putting something such as this on this bill. I hope in this very \nbrief period of time --I was hoping to have more time--to at least \naddress how significant this thing really is and what we are talking \nabout.\n  Mr. President, I have said this since 1995. Our country is facing the \ngreatest threat it has faced in its entire history. But it is not just \nme saying this. Now we have George Tenet, who is the Director of \nCentral Intelligence and an appointee of President Clinton, agreeing, \nin my committee, that we as a Nation are in the most threatened \nposition we have been in in the history of America. So we need to turn \nthis thing around. This is the first year in 14 years we are able to \nstart turning the corner and rebuilding a deteriorated system.\n  At the National Training Center-Ft Irwin, units coming to the NTC \ntoday have not had enough time to train at their home stations to allow \nthem to maximize the training opportunities. This means that the units \nare leaving the NTC less proficient than those who went thru the \nrotations in previous years.\n  At Ft. Bragg, according to the base commander, O funds have never \nbeen so tight. Commanders are being forced to make choices and trade-\noffs that their predecessors never faced. Insufficient Base-Ops funding \nhas forced commanders to rob from training accounts. Insufficient RPM \nfunding has resulted in the degradation of facilities in which the \nmilitary personnel work and live.\n  Maintenance on barracks is so bad that every time it rains, one \nbuilding leaks into the rooms where the troops sleep, and even into the \narmory where their weapons are stored which damages those weapons.\n  At the Norfolk Naval Base, the Navy is experiencing an increase in \nthe cross decking of equipment and munitions as less modern systems are \navailable to outfit all the hulls. In addition, supplies and spare \nparts are insufficient to support the surging of the Navy to meet its 2 \nMTW requirements.\n  Insufficient steaming days and flying hours are amongst the biggest \nreadiness concerns within some Navy units.\n  At the San Diego Naval Base, on average, 20 percent of the deployed \nplanes on the carriers are grounded awaiting parts or other maintenance \nrequirements. Furthermore, the cannibalization of aircraft has gone up \nby 15% over the last three carrier deployments.\n  There have been notable reductions in the mission capability and the \nfull mission capability rates of Naval aircraft over the past 4 years. \nThis is true for the deployed and the non-deployed squadrons.\n  At the Nellis Air Force Base, reduction in Red Flag exercises from 6 \nto 4 means that fewer pilots can participate each year. The new goal is \nto move pilots thru Nellis once every 18 months vs. once every year. \nThe high OPTEMPO of the forces--deployments are up fourfold while the \nforce is down by a third--has been the principle reason for the \nreduction in exercises.\n  Regarding Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center-29 Palms, conditions \nat 29 Palms and the Marine Corps in general: money is low; ammo is \nshort; and spare parts are scarce. ``The level of training and \nreadiness has diminished, it is not what it was in Desert Storm.''\n  At Camp Lejuene, modernization delays have a serious readiness \nimpact.\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nEquipment is more costly to maintain, less capable, and spare parts \ncannot always be obtained. In particular, the CH-46 is wearing thin. \nSome replacement parts are no longer available. One Marine officer \nestimated that if a Gulf War size operation erupted today, only about \n50 percent of Marine units would be qualified to deploy.\n  I can tell you, the problems are in all these areas. We have \nretention problems because we do not have adequate accounts being \nfunded. The various military installations are taking money out of one \naccount and putting it in another account. So at Fort Bragg, for \nexample, they have not been able to maintain their barracks. When it \nrains, the troops have to lie down on the equipment to keep it from \nrusting. We have a crisis in terms of cross-decking at Norfolk as well \nas on the west coast.\n  So we have very serious problems, and these problems can only be met \nwith this bill. I will just quote one thing out of the DOD Quarterly \nReadiness Report:\n\n       Readiness deficiencies are most readily visible in the \n     later deploying and non-deploying forces, some forward \n     deployed and first-fight-forces are also experiencing these \n     difficulties.\n\n  What they are saying is, for several years we are able to take all \nour assets and concentrate them in areas that are behind the lines in \nfavor of the forward deployed. Now even the forward deployed are having \na problem.\n  I can remember in our committee, the committee I chair, the Readiness \nSubcommittee, we had the four chiefs in there. I asked them the \nquestion: If you were going to have to take a reduction someplace to \nincrease your modernization or some other accounts, would it be in \nforce strength, modernization, quality of life, and so forth?\n  Up until a couple years ago, the Marines would always say ``quality \nof life, because the Marines don't need quality of life.'' Now we are \nnot even hearing that from them. We are facing a crisis at a time when \nthis country is in the most vulnerable position in which it has ever \nbeen.\n  I think we should really be looking at the overall picture and the \nfact we have something very serious going on right now. We need to \naddress it with this bill. This defense authorization bill turns the \ncorner for the first time in 14 years. It is being held hostage right \nnow on a matter that has nothing to do with defending America.\n  Mr. President, I think we need to get on with the bill and away from \nextraneous, nongermane amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we normally rotate and I was prepared so \nto do. Does the Senator wish to speak? If not, I will ask my colleague \nfrom Kentucky some technical questions on my time. I yield myself such \ntime as I need.\n  There are several technical issues relating to this amendment.\n  I say to colleagues, 527 has been on the books since 1975 and here we \nare dealing with it today:\n\n       Organizations presently exempt from tax on exempt function \n     income, which includes contributions for political purposes.\n\n  The McCain amendment would lift this exemption for 527 organizations \nwhich do not provide certain information to the Secretary of the \nTreasury. Thus, a 527 organization which elects not to disclose would \nbe taxed.\n  So it is a revenue measure. There is no doubt about it. It would be \ntaxed on previously exempt income, thus raising revenue. I do not know \nwhat more clear example can be made, how this thing will be blue-\nslipped by the House. The Senate is invading.\n  I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, he is \nentirely correct. This is the wrong place for this amendment. But for \nthose Senators who are not persuaded that the fact that this is the \nwrong place for this amendment is enough to vote against it, I think it \nis important to understand that this is a rather limited disclosure \namendment. Among the groups that are not covered in the 527 amendment \nthe Senator from Virginia and others have been discussing are groups \nsuch as the Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let's clarify this. The Senator is talking \nabout the McCain amendment now?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am, indeed. I am talking about the McCain amendment. \nThe Senator from Virginia was making the point that even if it were \notherwise a desirable thing to do, this is the wrong place to do it and \nruns the risk of having this bill blue-slipped in the House.\n  On the substance of the McCain issue, virtually everybody in the \nSenate is in favor of enhanced disclosure, greater disclosure. That is \nhardly a controversial subject. But to single out 527s only, I would \nsay to my colleagues--to single out 527s only leaves out such groups as \nthe Sierra Club and the AFL-CIO, which do not operate under section \n527.\n  I have long believed we ought to have broad, comprehensive \ndisclosure. I would be in favor of addressing this issue this year. But \nwe ought to do it in a comprehensive way, I say to my friend from \nVirginia, not leave out some of the major players on the American \npolitical scene, many of whom are on the airwaves right now, beating up \nRepublican candidates for the Senate.\n  From the more comprehensive approach, it is my understanding the \nSenator from Virginia may well have an alternative to offer that would \ngive all of us an opportunity to go on record in favor of a more \nevenhanded, comprehensive, across-the-board disclosure provision that \nwould not eliminate some of the principal players on the American \npolitical scene--ironically, most of whom are hostile to Republicans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to inform all Senators I have \nsubmitted an amendment to the desk. I cannot bring it up as a second-\ndegree amendment at this point in time, but I have submitted the \nfollowing amendment. I represent, as manager of this bill, at the first \nopportunity when this bill resumes, I will put this amendment on. I \nread it:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that all tax-exempt \norganizations engaging in campaign activities, including organizations \n   organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     should make meaningful public disclosure of their activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING DISCLOSURES BY TAX-\n                   EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) disclosure of political campaign activities is among \n     the most important political reforms;\n       (2) disclosure of political campaign activities enables \n     citizens to make informed decisions about the political \n     process; and\n       (3) certain tax-exempt organizations, including \n     organizations organized under section 527 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986, are not presently required to make \n     meaningful public disclosures.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that all tax-exempt organizations engaging in political \n     campaign activities, including organizations organized under \n     section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, should be \n     held to the same standard and required to make meaningful \n     public disclosure of their activities.\n\n  That will be before the Senate hopefully before the day is out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask what force of law that sense-of-the-Senate \namendment will have and what the prospects are that these organizations \nthat are currently engaged in these activities will be motivated by a \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment?\n  Also, will the Senator from Virginia be willing to add to that sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment that on the next appropriate vehicle, as deemed \nappropriate by the Parliamentarian, the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman \namendment be made in order for a vote with no second-degree amendments?\n  I ask that question because we clearly know that, without the force \nof law, there is no way these people are going to comply with a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment.\n  I hope the Senator, to give it any meaning whatsoever, will at least \nhave that same sense-of-the-Senate amendment state unequivocally that \nwe intend to enact this sense-of-the-Senate amendment into law, because \nthat is the only way we can force these people to comply. I am sure the \nSenator from Virginia understands and appreciates that.\n  My question is, Will the Senator be willing to modify his sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment to make it in order\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nthat on the next appropriate vehicle, as deemed by the Parliamentarian, \nthere will be an up-or-down vote on the McCain-Feingold-Lieberman \namendment without any intervening amendments or second-degree \namendments?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as my colleague knows full well, it will \nnot have the force of law, but it is an expression by this body. I have \nconsulted with the majority leader. He will address the issue. It is \nwithin his prerogative to determine at what time matters of this import \nare brought up. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 seconds. The majority \nleader is well known for his advocacy for campaign finance reform. I \ndoubt seriously if anyone believes that the Senator from Virginia, by \npropounding a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that is not binding legally \nin any way and will disappear in the mist of time as a myriad of other \nsense-of-the Senate amendments have--I think it is time the Senator \nfrom Virginia got candid with this body. The Senator from Virginia \nshould either come on board and stop this egregious violation of \neverything in which we believe or state his opposition to it. Please do \nnot think anyone--anyone--will believe that a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment will have any impact on the present practices which most \nobservers in America believe are corrupt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the section 527 loophole is driving \nelections and their financing deeper and deeper into the muck. We \ncannot stand by with the values we hold as Americans and watch \nelections driven deeper and deeper into the muck. That is what is \nhappening with this 527 loophole. It is tearing this system to shreds. \nThe soft money loophole has already cut a huge hole in the campaign \nfinance system. This section 527 loophole just simply tears this system \nto shreds. It allows unlimited contributions and, even worse than the \nsoft money loophole, it allows undisclosed unlimited contributions, \nstealth contributions, and the press reports already tens of millions \nof dollars of these contributions are totally off the campaign finance \nradar screen.\n  The only way people can use this is by trying to take inconsistent \npositions on two laws. The Internal Revenue Code defines an \norganization subject to tax exemption under section 527 as an \norganization which influences or attempts to influence the election of \nany individual to any Federal office.\n  That seems pretty clear. The Federal Election Campaign Act defines a \npolitical committee which is subject to regulation by the Federal \nElection Commission as an organization that spends or receives money \nfor the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\n  People are creating these 527 organizations because, and only \nbecause, they influence or attempt to influence an election. That is \nwhy they are exempt but then ignore the FEC's requirements that people \nwho organize for the purpose of influencing an election have to \ndisclose.\n  We cannot in good conscience stand by and permit this process, this \ncharade, which is doing so much damage to the public, to continue.\n  On this so-called blue-slip question, first, the Senate should not \nagree to a House interpretation that something like this is a revenue \nraiser when it is not a revenue raiser. We should not simply accede to \nthat, No. 1. That is a broad interpretation which the House uses to \nhave a larger prerogative than the Constitution provides.\n  Secondly, we do not know that there is going to be a blue slip. We do \nnot know that. The House, I believe, has to adopt a position. This is \nnot something which is done informally.\n  Thirdly, if the House does blue-slip this matter, there is plenty of \nprecedent for the matter then coming back to the Senate and the Senate \nremoving the language in question.\n  This is being used as an excuse not to adopt a critically essential \namendment if we are going to even begin to restore public confidence in \nthe elections in this country.\n  This last suggestion by our good friend, the chairman, that there \ncould be, instead of a law being passed, sense-of-the-Senate language \nwhich is not law, is not binding, does not have the force of law, but \neven in its own language simply suggests to organizations that they \nadopt some meaningful disclosure of activity, is meaningless, not \nmeaningful. We should not stand by and permit this charade to go on any \nlonger.\n  While we do not know the universe of these organizations, because \nthey do not even have to register with the Internal Revenue Service, we \ndo know that this is a bipartisan problem that requires and deserves a \nbipartisan solution.\n  Section 527 was created by Congress in the 1970s to provide a \ncategory of tax exempt organizations for political parties and \npolitical committees. While contributions to a political party or \npolitical committee are not tax deductible, Congress did provide for a \ntax exemption for money contributed and spent on political activities \nby an organization created for the purpose of influencing elections. At \nthe time Congress established the tax exemption, it assumed that such \norganizations would be filing with the FEC under the campaign finance \nlaws for the obvious reason that the language for both coverage by the \nIRS and coverage by the FEC were the same--``influencing an election.'' \nConsequently, it was assumed that section 527 did not need to require \ndisclosure with the IRS, since the FEC disclosure was considerably more \ncomplete.\n  The amendment before us would require section 527 organizations to \nfile a tax return, something they are not required to do now, and \ndisclose the basic information about their organization as well as \ntheir contributors over $200.\n  In late January of this year, the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation released a study of the Disclosure Provisions Relating to Tax-\nExempt Organizations. In that study, the bipartisan staff addressed \nsection 527 organizations, and the JCT staff recommended adoption of an \namendment to section 527 similar to the language we now have before us. \nThe JCT staff specifically recommended:\n  1. That 527 organizations be required to ``disclose information \nrelating to their activities to the public . . .''\n  2. And that 527 organizations ``be required to file an annual return \neven if the organizations do not have taxable income and that the \nannual return should be expanded to include more information regarding \nthe activities of the organization.\n  The JCT report said, ``This recommendation is consistent with the \nrecommendation that all tax returns relating to tax-exempt \norganizations should be disclosable.''\n  As the 2000 campaign evolves that we get closer to November, the \nAmerican public is going to be seeing the consequences--the real life \nconsequences of this loophole in our campaign finance laws. Candidates \nfrom both parties are going to be hit with ads by groups with names \nthat sound like civic organizations but which in reality are nothing \nmore than well-financed political opponents whose sole purpose is to \ninfluence an election. But the public will not be able to determine who \nthe people are behind the organizational name. It could be one person, \none union, one corporation, or an association of unions, interest \ngroups, or corporations. An organization with a name like Citizens for \nSafety could have as its sole contributor a leader of organized crime. \nWe would never know. The examples are endless.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Unfortunately, it \ndoes not stop the unlimited aspect of these secret contributions, but \nit does bring these contributions out in the open.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment for two \nreasons: No. 1, on its substance. If everyone is concerned about the \ndamage to the political system and the damage to the public and the \nviolation of things in which we believe, of organizations running \nindependent expenditures, then cover everybody who does it. If my \ncolleagues are only concerned about certain political groups and not \nconcerned about other political groups\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nthat may happen to favor their political position, then this is all \nabout politics and not about reform.\n  Let's be clear. This is a rifle shot on this bill. This does not \ncover labor unions, this does not cover the Sierra Club, this does not \ncover the trial lawyers, all of which are the major funders of the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I am one of those Senators up for reelection who is going to be at \nthe butt end of the expenditures of those very same groups, and no one \nover there will be outraged by the ``damage to the public,'' these \ngroups do. They are only concerned about the damage to the public that \ngroups that do not favor them do.\n\n  We heard so much: We need to talk honestly with the public. Let's \ntalk honestly with the public. We are rifle shooting here. We are \nkilling the American political process by picking winners and losers.\n  At the same time, the second reason I oppose this bill is because we \nare killing the Defense authorization.\n  So we have two losers here. We have the political process--the big \nloser--because here we are in Congress picking winners and losers. And \nthe second, we have the Defense authorization process, which I, as a \nsubcommittee chairman, and like my colleague from Arkansas, a \nsubcommittee chairman, we put a lot of time and effort into this bill \nbecause we understand, as the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, \nJim Inhofe, said, we put in a lot of effort trying to craft a \nbipartisan bill.\n  We don't have too many coming to the floor these days. It is a \nbipartisan bill. I have worked with my ranking member, Joe Lieberman. \nWe have worked together in concert to put together a bill we can all \nsupport--and we all did support in committee --that really meets the \nneeds of our military, that addresses some of the critical issues we \nhad in our subcommittee. We had to deal with the transformation of the \nArmy. I know everybody in this Chamber is concerned about how we \ntransform the Army.\n  There are some very critical decisions we made in this bill that \naffect the future of our armed services, and particularly the Army, \nthat I don't believe will be made correctly if we do not pass this \nbill.\n  There are some critical issues in the area of the Joint Strike \nFighter. We made tough decisions that will not be met if we do not pass \nthis bill.\n  A lot of people say we can wait. The House may not blue-slip this. \nThe House voted on this issue. They voted it down. We know what they \nwill do on this issue. The fact is, even if that is not the case, this \nis not the right amendment. This is not the right way to address this \nissue.\n  If you care about the ``corruption of the system'' that these \norganizations do, cover everybody. If you care about gaining political \nadvantage, vote for this amendment because you will gain political \nadvantage. You will put a chilling effect on some groups and ``Katie \nbar the door'' on the others. If that is what you want, if what you \nwant is political advantage, you got it. Vote for it and kill both \nfairness in public discourse and disclosure, which I am for.\n  I will vote for an amendment--but not on this bill because I think it \nwill hurt this bill--at some time. I hope the leader brings up this \nissue. But make sure we cover everybody. Make sure we do not pick our \nfriends: You don't have to say anything. You don't have to disclose \nanything. And by the way, you guys who we really don't like, we are \ngoing to get you. We are going to chill your contributions. We are \ngoing to make you report everything.\n  That is what this is about, folks. If we are talking about honesty \nhere, tell the truth. What does your amendment do? That is the truth. \nSo I am happy to debate the truth. The truth is, I will support an \namendment that is broad. I will support an amendment that provides \ndisclosure for everybody who engages in political campaigns but not \npick my friends over my enemies.\n  I would not vote for a bill that just picks my friends. Even you said \nwe are not going to cover those organizations, Senator, that help you; \nwe are just going to cover the guys who do not help you, I would vote \nagainst it. Do you know why? Because we should not be doing that. That \nis wrong. You want to talk about breeding cynicism? Bring up an \namendment that calls for disclosure which excludes the groups that \nfavor you and punishes the ones that don't, that brings cynicism to the \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can I engage the Senator for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, apparently the Senator from Pennsylvania \ndoes not agree with the Bush campaign, in which, according to an AP \nstory, Bush says:\n\n       Plenty of left-leaning groups led by the AFL-CIO help \n     Democrats.\n\n  The AP goes on to say:\n\n       So far for Gore, the Sierra Club, an environmental group \n     and one of the first to create a 527 spin-off, is in the \n     midst of an $8 million ad campaign aiding Democrats running \n     for Congress and attacking Bush on the environment.\n\n  I don't know where the Senator from Pennsylvania has been, but I will \nbe glad to show him ample testimony that this comes from both the left \nand right equally. So the evidence is obviously contrary to that.\n  I would also hope that the Senator from Pennsylvania would join the \nSenator from Wisconsin and me where the next amendment would be one \nthat included all organizations.\n  Would the Senator from Wisconsin be willing to do that as well? The \nfact is, this is most egregious, because there is no reporting \nwhatsoever in this newfound cornucopia, which would allow the Mafia, \ndrug money, Chinese money, any other kind of money, to come into \nAmerican political campaigns undisclosed. If that is what the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania believes is honesty, then I plead guilty.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. In response to the question of the Senator from \nArizona, the Senator from Pennsylvania, fortunately, is plain wrong \nabout the issue of whether this covers other groups. As the Senator \nfrom Arizona said, in my opening remarks, I say to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, I pointed out that this doesn't just cover the Sierra \nClub. The Sierra Club has said it has a 527 organization to use very \nlarge donations from wealthy individuals totaling $4.5 million.\n  How can the Senator from Pennsylvania even begin to say that we have \nnot included groups on both sides? The amendment is evenhanded.\n  As the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, there were reports of \ngroups from both the right and the left using this loophole. Any group \nclaiming this loophole would have to disclose. So it is simply false \nthat it would not include them.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. We have limited time.\n  I also point out that the AFL-CIO has also said it is willing to make \nfurther disclosure itself as long as business is willing to do the \nsame. I would invite the other side to actually offer a real \namendment--not a sense of the Senate, but a real amendment--to try to \naddress this.\n  It is simply untrue that we are not covering groups on both sides. I \nspecifically mentioned the Sierra Club and $4.5 million to cover that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, does the Sierra Club \nrun some of their campaign expenditures through their (c)(4), not \nthrough their 527 group?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, if this bill \npassed, 527s that do only issue advocacy would have to publicly \ndisclose their donors. But other tax-exempt groups that do exactly the \nsame kinds of issue ads, such as 501(c)(4)s, such as the Sierra Club, \nand 501(c)(5)s, such as the AFL-CIO, would not have to publicly \ndisclose their donors.\n  So the problem is, if the idea is to have comprehensive disclosure, \nwe have left out a huge percentage of those who are involved in \npolitical activity. The two that I mentioned happen to almost always be \nin support of candidates on the other side of the aisle. It would also \nnot include the American Trial Lawyers Association.\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\nIt would not include groups such as Public Citizen, and environmental \ngroups. As I mentioned, organized labor, all of whom would be exempt.\n  As I understand, the point of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment of \nthe distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee which would \nbe offered, as I understand it, after a motion to table the McCain \namendment is approved, would call for a comprehensive approach. The \nmajority leader is going to address the issue of when to do that. It is \nmy opinion--I know he will announce it is his opinion--we ought to do \nthat this year in this session because disclosure is, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona has pointed out, an area where we have been largely in \nagreement. It is a question of making sure that this is the right kind \nof disclosure and not a kind of selected partial disclosure which \nhappens to have the practical effect of leaving out, in my view, most \nof the major players who engage in issue advocacy in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield 2 or 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for this grant of time.\n  I rise today to make two announcements about the proposed amendment.\n  The first announcement is that the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill is not the proper vehicle for the issue raised by \nraised by this amendment.\n  The second announcement is that there will be a proper vehicle for \nthe issue.\n  Let's explore my first point, that is, whether this defense bill is \nan appropriate vehicle for this amendment.\n  This amendment increases the amount of disclosure that certain tax \nexempt organizations that are organized under section 527 of the \nInternal Revenue Code have to make if they are not subject to the \ndisclosure requirements under the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  To do this, the amendment will subject these tax exempt organizations \nto tax on the contributions they receive if they do not follow \ndisclosure requirements similar to the disclosure requirements set out \nin the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  While the objective of the amendment is increased campaign finance \ndisclosure, the amendment is framed in the context of a Tax Code \nchange, which is a revenue measure.\n  Under the Constitution, all revenue measures must originate in the \nHouse of Representatives. If the revenue measure did not originate in \nthe House, then any member could subject the bill to a ``blue slip,'' \nthereby voiding the entire bill, not just the part of the bill that is \na revenue measure.\n  Make no mistake, regardless of its merits, this amendment will kill \nthis bill. If adopted, this amendment would mean that the Senate would \nbe originating a piece of tax legislation. This is in direct violation \nof the Constitution. Rest assured, the House will not accept it and \nwill refuse the bill when we seek to send it to them. Hence, the \nadoption of this amendment will kill this Defense bill just as \nassuredly as if we voted it down.\n  We must not lose sight of the fact that there is no higher priority \nthan our nation's defense. This bill provides much-needed funds for it. \nIt gives a deserved pay raise to our armed forces--allowing them to \nenlist and retain the all-volunteer force that stands on perpetual \nwatch over our nation. It provides for spare parts that will keep our \nArmed Services in service.\n  Now, I'd like to move to my second point, provision of the proper \nvehicle.\n  The House has passed a tax bill that deals with taxpayer rights and \ndisclosure of information for tax-exempt organizations. That bill, \nknown as the ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2000,'' is in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The taxpayer rights legislation will be the vehicle for proposals to \ncurtail corporate tax shelters, which both the majority and the \nminority staffs of the Finance Committee have been working to draft. \nThe taxpayer rights legislation will be the appropriate vehicles for \nthis amendment. I support increased disclosure. Section 527 needs to be \namended. It is my intention to move such legislation later this year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may we have the time allocation remaining \nbetween the proponents of the amendment and the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment is not about politics. I \nassure my colleagues, this amendment covers all groups regardless of \ntheir politics. Not only do we not cover the AFL-CIO, we don't cover \nthe Chamber of Commerce. The National Right to Life, as with those \naspects of the Sierra Club that are 501(c)(4), has to publicly disclose \nthrough a tax return whether they are constituted in that manner. The \nargument and the attempt to somehow suggest that the rules will be one \nway for some groups rather than others is simply false, as were the \nother points made by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  This is an appropriate place to raise this issue.\n  Let me take a moment to respond to the trumped up charge that the \nSenate cannot consider this amendment because the House might blue-slip \nthe bill. I think some people are trying to use this charge as a fig \nleaf for voting against campaign finance disclosure. My first response \nto my opponent's attack is that this is not a bill for raising revenue. \nThe McCain-Feingold-Lieberman amendment is merely a reporting \nrequirement. It requires that those with a certain status report \nspecified actions.\n  Second, the House's decision to blue-slip a bill, to refuse to \nconsider a bill, is an act of discretion on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives. It does not happen automatically. It requires the \nHouse to pass a resolution to put this blue-slip into place, and the \nHouse can choose to consider this measure if it wants to.\n  Third, the Senate can and must be its own judge of what it considers \nto be ``bills for raising revenue'' within the meaning of the \nConstitution. The Senate does not have to adhere slavishly to the most \nwildly blown interpretation of what somehow constitutes bills for \nraising revenue, or else in the end the Senate would never be able to \nsend to the House of Representatives any bill the House didn't favor. \nSomeone in the House, anyone, could raise a charge, however baseless, \nthat the bill was a bill for raising revenue and then just somehow stop \nit dead in its tracks.\n  In this regard, I note it is deeply ironic that some in this majority \nare suddenly becoming so zealous about enforcing the House's \nprerogatives to originate bills for raising revenue. The House has a \nlongstanding tradition of considering all appropriation bills to be \nbills for raising revenue within the meaning of the Constitution. If \nthe Senate were to send the House an S-numbered appropriations bill, \nthe House could blue-slip that bill as well. Of late, the majority has \nshown a great enthusiasm for taking up S-numbered appropriation bills \nnotwithstanding this threat. The majority cannot have it both ways on \nthis point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a listing of instances when the Senate \nhas considered such bills that the House would have considered ``bills \nfor raising revenue'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Finally, Mr. President, the most powerful argument \nagainst the opponents' attempt to hide behind the fig leaf of this sham \nconstitutional objection is that their famed concern for the \nprerogatives of the House of Representatives will not fool anyone. This \nis a vote on campaign finance reform, pure and simple. In the end, when \ncolleagues go back home and when a constituent asks them why they \nopposed campaign finance reform, if they answer, Well, it might have \nhad a blue-slip problem, I don't think the explanation is going to work \nvery well. That is not cover. The fig leaf is transparent, and the \npeople will see right through it.\n  This is a vote about campaign finance reform, pure and simple. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this commonsense amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Instances When the Senate Has Considered Bills That the House of \n      Representatives Would Consider ``Bills for Raising Revenue''\n\n       S. 2603, Legislative Branch Appropriations Act 2001, \n     considered May 24-25, 2000.\n       S. 2522, Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Appropriations Act, 2001, motion to proceed \n     considered May 18, 2000.\n       S. 2521, Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2001, \n     considered May 11 and 15-18, 2000.\n       S. 625, Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999, with amendment \n     number 2547 proposed by Senator Domenici to increase the \n     Federal minimum wage and protect small business considered \n     November 8-10, 16-17, and 19, 1999, and January 26 and 31 and \n     February 1-2, 2000.\n       S. 1650, Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, \n     and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered September 29-30 and October 1 and 6-7, 1999.\n       S. 1283, District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered July 1, 1999.\n       S. 1282, Treasury and General Government Appropriations \n     Act, 2000, considered June 30 and July 1 and 13, 1999.\n       S. 1234, Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Appropriations Act, 2000, considered June 30, 1999.\n       S. 1233, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2000, considered June 21-22, 24, 28-29 and August 2-4, 1999.\n       S. 1217, Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \n     Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered July 21-22 and 26, 1999.\n       S. 1143, Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2000, motion to proceed considered June \n     24 and 28, 1999.\n       S. 1206, Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered June 16, 1999.\n       S. 1205, Military Construction Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered June 16, 1999.\n       S. 1186, Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of \n     1999, considered June 14-16, 1999.\n       S. 1122, Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2000, \n     considered June 7-8, 1999.\n       S. 544, Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1999, considered March 18-9, 22-23, 1999.\n       S. 2237, Department of the Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, considered September 8-10 and 14-\n     16, 1998.\n       S. 2334, Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related \n     Programs Appropriations Act, 1999, considered September 1-2, \n     1998.\n       S. 2159, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     1999, considered June 18 and July 13-16, 1998.\n       S. 1768, 1998 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \n     Recovery From Natural Disasters, and for Overseas \n     Peacekeeping Efforts, considered March 23-26, 1998.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pick up on my distinguished colleague's \nstatement. This is a bill about campaign finance reform. What relevance \nis that? What germaneness is that to the armed services? I read from \nthe Congressional Record of May 18 of this year when the Byrd-Warner \nbill was put on the MILCON bill. The Senator from Arizona said:\n\n       Its inclusion in the military construction appropriations \n     bill is highly inappropriate.\n\n  Rather interesting.\n  Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to each of my colleagues, the Senator \nfrom Arkansas and the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am for campaign finance reform. I \nvoted for cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill, and I would do it again.\n  I think this has merit, but it is the wrong time, the wrong vehicle, \nthe wrong scope. If this is the U.S.S. Warner, this is the torpedo that \ncould sink it. That is wrong.\n  There are too many important things in the bill to destroy it. There \nis health care for our military retirees forever. By a 96-1 vote \nyesterday, we put that in. There are retail and mail order pharmacy \nprescription benefits. I don't want to face those military retirees and \nsay: We thought this was a good vehicle for campaign finance reform. \nThere is the thrift savings plan, TRICARE remote, a 3.7-percent pay \nraise.\n  It is wrong to kill this bill for a nongermane campaign finance \nprovision. There will be an opportunity. We should do it, but we should \nnot put a nongermane provision such as this on an important DOD bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have worked with Chairman Warner for \nnearly a year on this bill. It is time to pass this bill. If we put \nthis nongermane Internal Revenue Code amendment on it, it will be blue-\nslipped by the House as a revenue bill. It will come back like a rubber \nball off the wall.\n  This is not what we are here for. This is not a campaign finance \nvote. It is a vote involving the defense of these United States of \nAmerica. That is what we need to do. I support the chairman. I believe \nthis is a good bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nMcCain amendment on Section 527 organizations. I would first like to \nthank Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain for their work in focusing \nthe attention of the nation on the problems Section 527 organizations \nare creating in our campaign finance system.\n  Most people don't know what a Section 527 organization is, and that \nis understandable, it is a highly complex issue. But what many people \ndo understand is that our campaign finance system is broken and that we \nmust do something to fix it.\n  A recent report by Common Cause reinforces the point that there are \nserious loopholes in our campaign finance system.\n  We must close the loophole allowing so-called ``Stealth PAC's'' \norganized under Section 527 of the tax code, to hide their donors, \nactivities, even their very existence from public view.\n  Many years ago, James Madison said, ``A popular government without \npopular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or \nperhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who \nmean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which \nknowledge gives.''\n  In clearer terms, Francis Bacon conveys the same principle in the \nsaying, ``Knowledge is Power.''\n  Mr. President, the passage of this amendment would help arm the \npeople with the knowledge they need in order to exercise their civic \nduty and sustain our popular government.\n  I have also long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, \n``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' People deserve to \nknow before they step into the voting booth which individuals or \norganizations are sponsoring the advertisements, mailings, and phone \nbanks they may see or hear from during an election. We need to shine \nsome sunlight on these secretive Section 527 organizations so that \npeople will know who or what is trying to influence their vote.\n  I have watched with growing dismay the increase in the number of \ntroubling examples of problems in our current campaign finance system. \nThese problems have led to a perception by the public that a disconnect \nexists between themselves and the people that they have elected. I \nbelieve that this perception is a pivotal factor behind the \ndisturbingly low voter turnouts that have plagued national elections in \nrecent years.\n  It is time to restore the public's confidence in our political \nsystem. It is time to increase disclosure requirements and ban soft \nmoney. It is time to work together to pass meaningful campaign finance \nreform.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 30 seconds \nremaining, and the Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will let the Senator from Arizona proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will quote from the Washington Post on \nJune 4, this Sunday:\n\n       Both parties use these section 527 committees. Failure to \n     disclose is the insidious, ultimate corruption of a political \n     system in which offices, if not the officeholders themselves, \n     are increasingly bought. At least they could vote for \n     sunshine, or is the truth too embarrassing for either donors \n     or recipients?\n\n  Mr. President, we have heard some very interesting arguments and \ndiscussions about whether it is appropriate, as to whether it favors \none side or another. There isn't an American who is well informed who \ndoes not know that this system has lurched completely out of control, \nwhen people are allowed to engage in the political system and give \nunlimited amounts of money and have it undisclosed.\n  The reason this is on this bill, I say to the chairman of the Armed \nServices\n\n[[Page S4786]]\n\nCommittee, is that we have been unable to propose an amendment on any \nbill so far.\n  This has been the first opportunity. I regret doing so. But I was \nwilling to enter into a time agreement to get this done. I must tell my \nfriend we will continue on this issue until we resolve the objections \nthat may exist concerning it. It is too important. If we are concerned \nabout these men and women in the military--and he and I share that \nconcern--then we should also be concerned about giving them the kind of \nGovernment and political system they can be proud of. Today, if they \nare informed about it, they are ashamed.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the courtesies he \nhas extended me. I said clearly, given the opportunity, I would vote \nwith him. But this time I say to my old sailor friend, man your battle \nstation, torpedoes are on the horizon headed for the port bow of the \narmed services annual authorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Virginia, may we enter \ninto a unanimous consent request that the time on the next amendment \nnot start running until the leader, who will be here, finishes his \nwork?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is in order. I ask that the time consumed by the \nquorum call not be borne by the next amendment coming up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know we are now prepared to go to the \ndebate on the next amendment. But I do have a unanimous consent request \nto make and some brief comments.\n  For the information of all Senators, the two managers have previously \nexchanged amendment lists on each side of the aisle. Senator Daschle \nand I have talked about the need to get some finite list identified so \nthat our whips and the managers can begin to work through the lists and \nsee which can be accepted and which ones are a problem, or maybe will \nnot be offered, and which ones will have to have debate or votes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list I now send to the desk be the \nonly remaining first-degree amendments in order for the DOD \nauthorization bill other than second-degree amendments which must be \nrelevant to the first degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The list of amendments is as follows:\n       Stevens: Environmental fines.\n       B. Smith: Security Clearances.\n       B.

Mr. President, there are almost 200 amendments, I think, on \nthis list. A large number of them are not related to the national \nsecurity of our country. They are not related to the Defense \nauthorization bill. There are two amendments now pending that are not \nrelated to national security.\n  I am very concerned about how long this could go on and what these \namendments are. They do run the usual range, from the HMO amendment, to \ncampaign finance amendments, to minimum wage, and a whole long list of \nunrelated or nongermane amendments.\n  I knew when we moved to this legislation this would be possible. I \nwanted to see how we could do, see if progress could be made, see if a \nlittle steam perhaps could be let off here. This is important \nlegislation, so we are going to have to work through these amendments \nand cut them down to a reasonable number. Senator Daschle and I have \ndiscussed the possibility, after we get these amendments and see how we \nare doing, that we set the bill aside and go to the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill, with the understanding that when that was \ncompleted, we would come back to the authorization bill, and then we \nwould have some idea of what amendments we would have to take time on.\n  This is not part of the unanimous consent request. We are not locking \nin on that--neither I nor Senator Daschle. But we have to find some way \nto try to work through this list and, hopefully, be able to conclude \nthis bill. I know Senator Warner would like to do that.\n  I wanted to make those observations. I ask Senators on both sides to, \nif you can, withhold your amendment if it is not essential. Please do \nthat, because there is no way we can do 200, or 100, or 50 amendments \nand complete this work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me second what the majority leader \nhas just said. I appreciate the fact that he has taken this bill to the \nfloor under the regular order. I have indicated a desire to work with \nhim to complete work on this bill under regular order. Again, as I \nalways do, I thank the assistant Democratic leader for his efforts in \ntrying to narrow the scope and the list.\n  We have to start here. Now we know what the universe is. \nUnfortunately, I think the universe includes the ``kitchen sink'' in \nthis case. I think it is important to try to eliminate the ``kitchen \nsink'' and other matters that may or may not be essential to take up. I \nthink there are nonrelevant matters that could be taken up under very \nshort time constraints, as we are about to do. We need to finish the \nbill as well. I certainly plan to work with the majority leader to see \nthat we accomplish that over the course of the next couple of days.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our two distinguished leaders. No \nmatter how diligent the managers are--there is this question, \nparticularly historically, on this bill that Senator Levin and I have \nworked on for some 22 years--only the leadership can come down and get \nthat list of amendments. I thank them very much for that.\n  We will now deal with that as expeditiously and as fairly as we can.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3 p.m. \nhaving arrived, the Democratic leader is recognized to offer an \namendment relevant to HMOs on which there will be 2 hours of debate \nequally divided.\n  The Democratic leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3273\n\n    (Purpose: To amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \n Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \n  of 1986 to protect consumers in managed care plans and other health \n                               coverage.)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, under the order, I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3273.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with some reluctance that I come to \nthe floor this afternoon--reluctance because we had hoped that this \nwould not be necessary. We had hoped that the action taken by the \nSenate--now almost a year ago--would have provided us with an \nopportunity to have finished by now the work begun more than a year \nago. The Senate acted in a way that we felt was not as acceptable as we \nwould have liked. The House acted in a way that met the expectations of \nmany of us. On a bipartisan basis the House passed a bill to protect \npatients' rights in ways that I think lives up to the expectations not \nonly of those of us who have advocated this legislation but of the \nAmerican people and many others who care deeply about these \ncircumstances.\n  It was our hope that the conferees, over the course of the last 12 \nmonths, could have resolved differences and we could have sent this \nlegislation to the President by now. That has not happened.\n  Under the circumstances, we are left with no choice but to come to \nthe floor and once again have the debate and press the issue--to try to \nsay with as much definition as we can that this legislation must pass; \nthat this legislation must be sent to the President; that this \nlegislation must be signed into law.\n  The urgency of our effort could not be better represented than by \nwhat we see on the charts immediately behind me. The first chart shows \nwhat is happening to patients day by day as this Congress fails to act. \nThe Patients' Bill of Rights affects thousands and thousands of people \non a daily basis--thousands of people who go into hospitals and clinics \nhoping that they might be able to get the care they so desperately \nneed.\n  This chart says it all when it comes to what happens to patients as a \nresult of our inaction.\n  Thirty-five thousand Americans on a daily basis fail to get the kind \nof care they absolutely have to have to restore their health.\n  Thirty-five thousand people are denied specialty care in instances \nwhen doctors have prescribed it.\n  Thirty-one thousand are forced on a daily basis to change doctors--we \nare not talking about what has happened over the course of the last 12 \nmonths. We are saying every single day in the United States of America \nthat 31,000 people are forced to change doctors, against their will in \nmany cases.\n  Eighteen-thousand are forced to change medication.\n  Fifty-nine thousand a day, as a result of the inaction in the \nCongress--a number exceeding the second largest city in\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\nthe State of South Dakota--are subjected to more pain and suffering and \na worsening of their condition.\n  Those aren't our figures. Those are figures from the California \nManaged Care Improvement Task Force and other reputable organizations \nthat have analyzed the cost of the inaction in the Congress over the \ncourse of the last year.\n  A second way to look at this issue is doctors' perceptions of our \ninaction.\n  The number of doctors each day who see patients with a serious \ndecline in health as a result of health plan abuse is striking.\n  Fourteen-thousand people are denied coverage of recommended \nprescription drugs as a result of our inaction.\n  Ten-thousand are denied coverage of needed diagnostic tests.\n  Seven-thousand are denied referral to needed specialty care.\n  Six-thousand are denied overnight hospital stay, and 6,000 are denied \nreferral to mental health and substance abuse treatment.\n  One could just sit down after that and say the Senate must act. Let's \nvote. I think those numbers are as compelling a reason as I have heard \nabout the importance of this body acting on this legislation, as we \nshould have acted now more than 12 months ago. We have not acted. And \ntens of thousands of people are paying a price that they shouldn't have \nto pay because we have not acted.\n  I have been encouraged by correspondence that we have been sent just \nin the last few hours: One from the sponsors of the legislation on the \nHouse side, Congressman Charlie Norwood, and Congressman John Dingell.\n  I will simply read an excerpt, and ask unanimous consent the entire \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                        Committee on Commerce,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Daschle: We are pleased that you \n     are bringing the bipartisan compromise bill that we passed \n     overwhelmingly in the House last October to the Senate floor \n     today. We appreciate your willingness to fix a technical \n     drafting error in the point of service provision.\n       The change we have requested is a technical correction to \n     ensure that all individuals covered by employer-sponsored \n     health insurance plans, including self-insured plans, would \n     be able to choose a point of service option. This option \n     would allow patients to choose the doctor who best met their \n     medical needs. This change would not otherwise affect what we \n     believe is an important provision. As you know, the point of \n     service provision in the Norwood-Dingell bill clearly states \n     that the patient, not the employer or the health plan, would \n     bear any extra cost associated with this provision. \n     Additionally, point of service is not required to be offered \n     in instances where enrollees have a point of service option \n     through another health insurance issuer or group health plan.\n       We thank you for making this technical change. We hope that \n     this important legislation enjoys as much bipartisan success \n     on the Senate floor today as it did on the House floor last \n     year.\n       With every good wish.\n           Sincerely,\n     John D. Dingell.\n     Charlie Norwood.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the letter simply calls upon the Congress \nto act. It says:\n\n       We are pleased that you are bringing the bipartisan \n     compromise bill that we passed overwhelmingly in the House \n     last October to the Senate floor today.\n\n  They want us to act.\n  That is from the sponsors of the House-passed legislation.\n  The doctors so directly involved in our critical health care needs \nare also asking the Senate to act today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement released by the American \nMedical Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                     June 8, 2000.\n\n AMA Calls on Senate to Pass Norwood-Dingell Patients' Rights Bill as \n                    Amendment to DOD Reauthorization\n\n       ``The Senate must give Americans the patient protections \n     they want and need now.''--Thomas R. Reardon, MD, AMA \n     President.\n       ``The AMA strongly supports attaching the Norwood-Dingell \n     patients' rights bill to the DoD reauthorization bill. \n     Patients and physicians have worked for more than half a \n     decade on a bill to protect patients--and now is the time to \n     make that bill a law.\n       ``Patients and their physicians have waited too long. The \n     Senate must give Americans the patient protections they want \n     and need now--not just a bill, but a real law that protects \n     patients.\n       ``Patients and physicians are frustrated with the lack of \n     progress in the House-Senate Conference committee. We will \n     aggressively pursue all opportunities until meaningful \n     patients' rights legislation is signed into law.\n       ``A Republican staff counterproposal put forward June 4 is \n     unacceptable, making it little better than the HMO Protection \n     Act passed by the Senate last summer. That bill was a sham. \n     Now the Senate has a chance to make it right.\n       ``A May NBC/WSJ poll found that patients' bill of rights \n     was the most important health issue among registered voters. \n     A recent Kaiser/Harvard poll found that an overwhelming 80% \n     of Americans support patients' rights legislation, including \n     the right to sue health plans.\n       ``The AMA-endorsed Norwood-Dingell bill, overwhelmingly \n     approved by the House on a bipartisan basis last fall, \n     acknowledges the people's clear call for meaningful \n     protections. Patient protections should not be a partisan \n     issue. Republicans and Democrats must work together to \n     address well-documented problems.\n       ``Rhetoric is not enough. The Senate must do the right \n     thing and pass the Norwood-Dingell provisions.''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this is an excerpt from the statement:\n\n       Rhetoric is not enough. The Senate must do the right thing \n     and pass the Norwood-Dingell provisions.\n\n  You can't say it any more directly nor any more powerfully than \nthat--whether it is the sponsors of the House-passed bipartisan bill, \nor whether it is those in the trenches on a daily basis who recognize \nthe importance and the urgency of this issue and have asked us to \naddress it posthaste, or whether it is the thousands of people out \nthere being denied health care on a daily basis. The commitment we must \nmake to those who are left in the lurch must be restated and \nreemphasized. The only way to restate and reemphasize our commitment to \ntheir need is to pass this bipartisan bill this afternoon as part of \nthis vehicle.\n  I share the view expressed by some that we don't want to slow down \nthis bill. We just had that discussion on another amendment. I \nrecognize that. It is for that reason that we have expressed a \nwillingness to limit the debate on this amendment to no more than 2 \nhours, with an hour on each side.\n  We want to move this legislation. But we also want to move the \ndefense bill. We can do that by limiting the amount of time, and we \nhave voluntarily accommodated those who wish to move this legislation \nquickly by allowing the time limit on this amendment.\n  I think it is very clear why we are offering this amendment, when you \nlook at what it does and why it is so important and the pressing need \nfor it. Again, I emphasize it was passed on a strong bipartisan vote in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  When you look at this chart, it lays out in a very short and succinct \nmanner the differences between what--on a bipartisan basis the House \nhas supported and many of us now support in the Senate--versus what our \nRepublican colleagues in the Senate have advocated as their response to \nthe need for a Patients' Bill of Rights for the country today.\n  First and foremost, protecting all patients and making sure that \neverybody has access to protections is a fundamental difference between \nthe bipartisan plan and the Republican plan. We protect all patients; \nthey don't.\n  Holding plans accountable is the second criteria by which we judge \nwhether or not we are truly interested in solving this problem.\n  Accountability has to be the first or second priority if we are truly \ngoing to resolve these problems and address the concerns raised by \nmillions of Americans.\n  The bipartisan plan holds insurance companies accountable. \nUnfortunately, the Republican plan does not.\n  Definitions of medical necessity are a very complex and increasingly \ndisturbing way with which the insurance companies eliminate access to \ngood quality care.\n  We ensure unfair definitions of ``medical necessity'' used by \ninsurance companies don't prevent patients from getting needed care. \nOur bipartisan plan\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\naddresses that issue. The Republicans do not.\n  Guaranteed access to specialists is also an issue that so many people \nbelieve needs to be resolved. We address it. The Republicans barely \naddress it at all.\n  We can go down the list. Access to OB/GYN, access to clinical trials, \naccess to nonphysician providers, choice of providers, point-of-\nservice, emergency room access, prohibition of improper financial \nincentives. On all of these issues and many more, there is a clear \nchoice between what the Republicans have proposed and what the \nbipartisan plan adopted in the House requires.\n  Time is running out. We have about 21 legislative days between now \nand the August recess. We have about 15 legislative days when we come \nback from the August recess. We have fewer and fewer days with which to \nresolve these differences. The time has come now to simply take what \nhas been passed in theHouse, pass it in the Senate, add it to this \nbill, get it to the President, and send a clear message that our \ncommitment to resolving these issues could not be stronger.\n  Our commitment has not eroded. We are determined to deal with this \nissue this year on a bipartisan basis. We join with our House \ncolleagues in addressing the issue in a comprehensive way. That is what \nthis amendment does. That is why we hope on a bipartisan basis we can \nmake an unequivocal statement about our commitment for resolving this \nmatter first and foremost in this context today.\n  I am deeply appreciative of the extraordinary leadership provided, \nonce again, by the senior Senator from Massachusetts. No one has \ncommitted more time and effort and has demonstrated more leadership on \nan issue than he. On behalf of the entire Democratic caucus, I am \nextraordinarily grateful to him, appreciative of his leadership and his \ndetermination to resolve this matter in a successful way before the end \nof this session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would yield time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield such time as the Senator from Massachusetts \ndesires.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes.\n  At the outset of this debate, I express my sincere appreciation to \nthe leadership on both sides, particularly on our side, Senator \nDaschle, as well as to Senator Lott, to permit an opportunity to vote \non a matter which I think is of central concern and importance to \nfamilies all across this country. I think the timing of this is \nenormously significant for the reasons we will point out in the time \navailable this afternoon.\n  The American people have waited more than 3 years for Congress to \nsend the President a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects all \npatients and holds all HMOs and other health plans accountable for \ntheir actions. Every day that the conference on the Patients' Bill of \nRights fails to produce agreement on meaningful patient protections, \n60,000 more patients endure added pain and suffering, and more than \n40,000 patients report a worsening of their condition as a result of \nhealth plan abuses.\n  For more than 3 months, we have participated in a charade of a \nconference that refuses to make progress on these basic issues. We have \ntried to reach agreement with the Republican leadership on the specific \npatient protections that are critical to ending abuses by HMOs and \nother managed care plans. But the Congress has failed to guarantee \npatients even the most basic protections. This is not rocket science. \nIt is long past time for this Congress to stop protecting HMO profits \nand start protecting patients' health.\n  The House passed a strong bipartisan bill last year to give patients \nthe rights they need and deserve. It has the support of more than 300 \nleading organizations representing patients, doctors, nurses, working \nfamilies, small businesses, religious organizations, and many others.\n  The House bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. One in three \nHouse Republicans voted for this legislation. President Clinton would \nsign that bill today, this afternoon. Unfortunately, the Republican \nleadership in Congress and the Republican conferees appear to have no \nintention of reaching a conference agreement that can be signed into \nlaw.\n  We have repeatedly asked the Republican conferees to produce an offer \non the critical issues that need to be resolved such as whether all \npatients will be protected by the reforms and whether patients can sue \nfor injuries caused by HMO abuses. Republican staff submitted a \ndocument on Sunday night which they claim is a starting point, but it \nfalls far short of what is needed to start a serious discussion. That \nisn't only our opinion. That happens to be the opinion of the principal \nRepublican sponsors in the House of Representatives.\n  We continue to hope that the conference can be productive, but so far \nit has been an endless road to nowhere. The clock is ticking down on \nthe current session of Congress. It is time to take stronger action. \nMake no mistake, we want a bill that can be signed into law this year. \nThere is not much time left. We need to act and act now.\n  The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan \nlegislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. \nAnd the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing quality \nprogress. The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed \nby patients across the country, yet the Republican leadership is \nadopting the practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use \nthemselves; delay and deny patients the care they need.\n  It is just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed \nreforms as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care. It is wrong \nfor HMOs to say that a patient suffering a heart attack can't go to the \nnearest hospital emergency room. It is wrong for Congress not to take \nemergency action to end this abuse. It is medical malpractice for HMOs \nto say that children with rare cancers can't be treated by a qualified \nspecialist. And it is legislative malpractice for Congress not to end \nthis abuse. It is wrong for HMOs to deny access to patients to clinical \ntrials that could save their lives. And it is wrong for Congress not to \nguarantee that the routine costs of participating in these lifesaving \ntrials are covered.\n\n  The Clinton administration announced yesterday that Medicare will \ncover the medical costs for senior citizens participating in clinical \ntrials. Congress should demonstrate equal leadership and do the same \nfor all patients.\n  The House-Senate conference has made almost no progress on issues of \nvital importance to patients across America. The slow pace is \nunacceptable. After many weeks, despite the rhetoric from the \nRepublican conferees, only two issues have been settled. They were \nvirtually identical in both bills. While there seems to be conceptual \nagreement on a few more provisions, we have yet to reach agreement on \nthe actual legislative language. The critical issues of holding health \nplans responsible for their actions and assuring that every American \nwith private insurance is protected have not even been discussed \nseriously.\n  Staff of the Republican conferees have provided proposals that they \nportray as a step towards consensus. Those who support genuine patient \nprotections on both sides of the aisle are committed to making real \nprogress towards a successful resolution of the differences between the \nSenate bill and the bipartisan House bill. However, the GOP proposals \nfall far short of what is needed to give patients the protections they \nneed. With a minor exception, their proposal would essentially maintain \nthe current gaping loophole that allows so many health plans to escape \nresponsibility when they make decisions that cause injury or death of \nthe patient.\n  The Republican author pretends to indicate a sudden willingness to \nhold health plans accountable in some circumstances, but the American \npeople would be shocked to see the details of this proposal. It is a \nsham. It is little more than a slap on the wrist for HMOs that refuse \nto comply with the law. It does nothing to address the vast majority of \ncases in which patients are injured or killed because of the health \nplan abuses that arbitrarily deny or delay needed care.\n  It is riddled with restrictions and limitations. It would protect \nemployers\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nfrom liability when they were the ones who made the decisions that led \nto injury or death. In countless cases where persons were injured or \neven killed by the wrongful actions of their health plan, there would \nbe no remedy.\n  It would force patients to go through an external appeals process, \neven if the disputed benefit could no longer help the patient because \nthe injury was irreversible or because the patient has died.\n  Our amendment requires patients to exhaust the external appeals \nprocess before turning to the courts, but there is a key exception that \nallows patients who have already been harmed, or the family members of \nthose who are killed, to go directly to the court. Few, if any, \npatients would ever be helped by the Republican proposal. It gives the \nappearance of a remedy without the reality.\n  The Republican proposal on the scope of the patient protections is \nanother smokescreen. It does nothing to provide realistic guarantees \nfor any individual not covered by the original Senate Republican bill. \nIn fact, the proposal would reduce current protections for millions of \nAmericans in many HMOs by explicitly preempting State laws. The result \nis that teachers, farmers, firefighters, police officers, small \nbusiness employees, and many others would be turned into second-class \ncitizens with second-class rights.\n  Here is the list: 23 million to 25 million State and local employees. \nThese are the teachers, these are the firefighters, these are the \npolice officials, these are the nurses, these are the doctors. They are \neffectively excluded from the GOP coverage. Not so under the Norwood-\nDingell proposal. I don't know why they want to have second-class \ncitizens with second-class rights for those individuals. All Americans \ndeserve protection against HMO abuses. No patient should be denied \nadequate protection because of where they live or where they work.\n  The Republican claim that they have offered a serious compromise \nrings hollow for the millions of patients across this country who \ndeserve protection for their rights, their health, and their lives. We \nare committed to passing a bill that protects all patients. At this \npoint, the conference does not seem to be willing to produce a bill \nthat will do the job, so we intend to pursue other options to enact \nthese critical protections.\n  President Clinton has repeatedly urged the conference to complete \nwork on a strong bill he can sign into law. That bill should include \nthe key provisions of the Norwood-Dingell measure. It should not be \ndelayed by controversial and unrelated tax or other proposals.\n  Our amendment contained the House-passed bipartisan consensus reforms \nwritten by Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood and Michigan Democrat \nJohn Dingell. It says we are putting patients first, not HMO profits. \nIt says medical decisions will be made by doctors and patients, and not \ninsurance company accountants.\n  The amendment establishes important protections for all patients, \nincluding coverage for emergency care at the nearest hospital, access \nto needed specialty care, transitional care for certain patients, \ndirect access to obstetrical and gynecological care, coverage for \nroutine costs of life-saving clinical trials, prohibition of improper \nHMO financial incentives and HMO gag clauses on physicians, and many \nother protections.\n  It establishes a fair, prompt, independent appeal process for all \ndecisions involving medical judgments. It holds health plans \naccountable by holding them liable in cases where patients are injured \nor killed by HMO abuses. It protects employers from liability, with an \nexception only if they actually participate in the decision that \nresults in injury or death in the particular case. It prohibits \npunitive damages if the HMO follows the recommendation of the \nindependent reviewers.\n  The Senate stands, today, at a major crossroad for millions of \npatients across this Nation. We have an opportunity to provide long-\noverdue protections for all Americans in managed plans. We have an \nopportunity to hold HMOs accountable for their abuses. For the first \ntime, the Senate has the opportunity to vote on the bipartisan \ncompromise that passed the House overwhelmingly last year.\n  Last October, the House passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. Month \nafter month after month, the Senate has refused to give patients across \nthe Nation the protections they deserve. Today, at long last, the issue \nis out of the back rooms where it has been stalled for so long. The \nissue is in the open, and it is time for the Senate to vote.\n  I withhold the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The minority has used 24 minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I designate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts as my designee for purposes of managing the \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to respond to my colleague, first \nto say I very much regret our colleague from Massachusetts is bringing \nthis amendment to the DOD authorization bill. I heard the minority \nleader say we want to pass the DOD bill, but there is certainly no \nevidence of that when you introduce this bill, totally extraneous to \nDOD, campaign finance, and other unrelated matters. It appears as if \ndefense doesn't matter. We have an unaccomplished agenda.\n  Have we voted on these matters before? Yes, we have. Senator Kennedy \nis basically saying let's pass the House-passed bill. We are now in \nconference. I am somewhat resentful of some of the statements that were \nmade by our colleagues. They said the conference was a charade. Tell \nthat to the members of the conference who have worked, Members and \nstaff, over 400 hours this year--probably more time spent in this \nconference than any other conference, maybe, in years.\n  They said there is intransigence on the part of the Republicans. Not \nso. Republicans have made significant compromises and adjustments in \nwillingness to try to see if we cannot close the gap on two extremely \ndifferent bills. The House passed a bill called the Norwood-Dingell \nbill. Now we have Senator Kennedy saying, we don't care what is going \non in the conference, let's just pass the House bill. He tried to pass \nit before in the Senate. It was not successful. I doubt he will be \nsuccessful today. As a matter of fact, if he did not have this \namendment on the floor today, we would probably be in conference, \ntrying to work out some of the differences.\n  So we really have to ask ourselves, are the Democrats interested in \nan issue or political theater--and that is exactly what this is. This \ndoes not change a thing. Senator Kennedy a couple of weeks ago said, \n``I am just going to warn you, maybe I'll have to take it to the \nfloor.'' I said, fine, you are going to find out the House can probably \npass Norwood-Dingell again and it will not pass the Senate. Does that \nhelp resolve the differences? I don't think so.\n  We made an offer. I heard some comments made: Well, that offer was a \ncharade; or it wasn't any good, or didn't mean anything. We made some \ncompromises. The only thing we have heard back--we didn't get a written \nresponse. All we heard is verbally, it did not do very much.\n  Wait a minute, we have done a lot. If you are interested in patient \nprotection, we have done a lot. We have agreed that everybody who has \nan employer-sponsored plan would have an external appeal. If they are \ndenied health care by their HMO, they have an external appeal, an \nindependent appeal decided by physicians, that would be binding. If for \nsome reason the HMO would not agree to that binding decision, they \ncould be sued.\n  Let me read to you Senator Kennedy's comments in the beginning of the \ndiscussion. This is Senator Kennedy:\n\n       I think the overriding issue--and others have spoke about \n     it, is really whether we are ultimately going to have the \n     important medical decisions which affect families in this \n     country made by the doctors and by the families and the \n     medical professionals, or whether they will be made by a \n     bureaucrat. That is really the heart of it. There are other \n     provisions that are relevant to that and to making the basic \n     and fundamental right a reality, but that is really the heart \n     of the whole situation.\n\n  We have done that. Senator Kennedy said we haven't agreed upon \nanything.\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nBut we have agreed that doctors will have the ultimate decision.\n  An independent appeals process, independent of any plan? We have \nagreed upon that. He says that is the main thing. Now he is saying that \nis not good enough.\n  I am just very displeased, I guess, that language be used that there \nis intransigence, we had no choice but to bring this to the floor. If \nanybody wanted to pass a bill and have it become law, this is the last \nthing they should do. And have press conferences blasting the process. \nThis process has been open. This process has been bipartisan. This \nprocess has tried to reach across and bridge differences and \ncompromise. Yet they say, we don't care what you have done. As a matter \nof fact, did they offer the compromise, an appeals process that has \nbeen agreed to by Democrats and Republicans? No, they came back and \nsaid, we want the House bill, an inferior product compared to what we \nhave agreed to in the appeals process, far inferior.\n  It is the same with some of the patient protections. We have \nstrengthened patient protections upon which we have agreed. Did they \noffer that? No. They want to go back to the House. It is an insult to \nthe Senate to say: We have a conference, but we are not going to take \nanything from the conference; we will disregard the Senate; we are just \ngoing to take the House position.\n  Any chairman of any committee should think about that: Yes, you are \nworking on a conference; we will insist we adopt the other body's \nposition, as if it is superior. What about the other body's position? \nWhat about the Norwood-Dingell bill? That is bipartisan; people know it \nhas unbelievable unlimited liability.\n  We are criticized because we want to exempt employers.\n  I yield myself an additional 4 minutes.\n  In the Senate bill, we have liability against HMOs, but we protect \nemployers. Senator Kennedy says that is not good enough; we want to be \nable to sue employers.\n  As a former employer, if we make employers liable for unlimited \npunitive damages, class action suits, the whole works, we are going to \nhave a lot of employers saying: I don't have to provide health care; I \nwill drop it. Employees, here is some money; I hope you will buy health \ninsurance.\n  Some employees will and, unfortunately, a lot of employees will not. \nWe will have a dramatic, draconian increase in the uninsured.\n  The Norwood-Dingell bill, by CBO estimates--and I think it is grossly \nunderestimated--increases health care costs, one estimate, by 4.1 \npercent; another estimate of the Democrat bill is over 6 percent. \nHealth care costs are already going up 10, 12, 14 percent. Add another \n4 or 6 percent on top of that. We are talking about a 16-, 18-percent \nincrease in health care costs, and we will have millions more join the \nranks of the uninsured.\n  We absolutely, positively should draw the line and say: Let's not do \nanything that does damage to the good health care system we have. It is \nnot perfect, but we should not be passing legislation that is going to \nincrease the number of uninsured. We should not be passing legislation \nthat is going to dramatically increase the cost and make it \nunaffordable for a lot of Americans.\n  We passed legislation in this body and the House that makes health \ncare more affordable. We passed tax provisions giving every American, \nnot just those who work for a large corporation, tax benefits, tax \ndeductions. That is positive. That is the reason we called our bill \nPatients' Bill of Rights Plus.\n  We want to make health care more affordable for all Americans. We \nwant to increase the number of insured Americans. Unfortunately, the \nKennedy bill, the Norwood-Dingell bill will do the opposite; it will \nincrease the number of uninsured. We do not want to do that. We want to \ndo the opposite. We want to help people get insurance.\n  The legislation before us has no provision to help finance health \ncare costs for those people who do not have it. We did in our bill. We \nhad it in the House bill that passed the House.\n  I have one other comment. The President said he would veto the bill \nthat passed the House and he would veto the bill that passed the \nSenate. People say: The President will sign this bill. The President \nstated he would veto the bill that passed the House, and the President \nsaid he would veto the bill that passed the Senate. Unfortunately, a \nlot of people are more interested in politics and maybe political \ntheater and seeing if they can scare people. Maybe they think that will \nbe to their political advantage. I very much resent that.\n  I want to pass a good, constructive Patients' Bill of Rights bill \nthis session, this year. The sooner the better. Keep out the politics. \nLet's see if we can pass a bill that has a good external appeals \nprocess; a bill that does keep HMOs accountable. Let's protect \nemployers. Let's not do something that will increase the number of \nuninsured. Let's not do something that will damage the system. I am \nafraid the process our Democratic colleagues are pulling right now is \ngoing to be very disruptive to the conference.\n  I am going to pledge we will pass a bill out of conference this year, \nand I hope it is one both Houses will pass and the President will sign \nthat will increase patient protections for all Americans and also keeps \nhealth care affordable and attainable for millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the time \nSenator Daschle used--he used 12 minutes--10 of the 12 minutes be \nconsidered leader time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, under the very able leadership of Senator \nNickles we have worked on this conference report more than 400 hours \nwith more intense effort than any conference of which I have ever been \npart. From time to time many of our colleagues have said to Senator \nNickles: The Democrats do not want a bill; they want a political issue. \nWhy don't we write a bill and pass it with Republican votes?\n  Our dear colleague and leader, Senator Nickles, has said: No, I want \nto try to do this on a bipartisan basis.\n  I think what Senator Kennedy has proven today in a cynical political \nact is that no good deed ever goes unpunished. We are not here today \nbecause we are not making progress. We are here today because we are \nmaking too much progress. We are here today because we are on the verge \nof writing a bill, but it is a bill that Senator Kennedy is not for.\n  Senator Kennedy has said: If you will just let lawyers get into the \npatient treatment room and, if you will just let people file lawsuits, \nhe will be happy. We want to put the focus on getting health care, and \none gets that from doctors and not lawyers.\n  In an effort to accommodate and reach a bipartisan compromise, \nSenator Nickles proposed allowing HMOs to be sued. What does Senator \nKennedy say? It is not enough. Senator Kennedy does not just want to \nsue HMOs, he wants to sue employers. To that we say no, we are not \ngoing to sue employers. Health insurance is provided on a voluntary \nbasis, and we do not want employers to drop their health insurance for \ntheir workers. We are worried about millions of Americans losing their \nhealth insurance. Senator Kennedy is not worried about that; the \nDemocrats are not worried about that because they have their plan.\n  And here it is. Do my colleagues remember this, the Clinton health \ncare bill? Do my colleagues remember what they wanted to do? They \nwanted the Government to take over and run the health care system. \nToday, Senator Kennedy is very worried about HMOs, but let me read \nsomething about how their health care purchasing collectives would work \nin his bill with President Clinton.\n  If a patient went to a doctor and asked for treatment for your sick \nchild, and the doctor thought your child should have it, under the \nClinton plan if the Government health board ruled no, the doctor could \nbe fined $50,000 for providing that health care to your sick child.\n  If you said: My baby is sick, I want the health care but the \nGovernment will not pay for it, their health care bill said if the \ndoctor provided it and\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\nyou paid him, he went to prison for 15 years. That is their idea of \nHMOs they like, one HMO run by the Government.\n  That is not our idea. We reject it, and we will fight it until it is \ndead. They will never give up on it. They do not care if they destroy \nthe health care system of this country. They do not care if millions of \npeople are uninsured because they know how to insure them: Insure them \nby having the Government take over the health care system. We say no.\n  In our bill, we expand coverage. We gave tax deductibility to the \nself-employed. We want to give tax deductibility for buying health \ninsurance if a company does not provide it. Why should General Motors \nget a tax deduction for buying health care but your family does not? We \ntry to encourage people to buy long-term care insurance, so we make it \ntax deductible.\n  We want to give people choices, so we have medical savings accounts. \nYet in this legislation before us, there is not one mention of tax \ndeductibility for health insurance, not one mention of expanding \ncoverage, not one mention of expanding freedom by letting people use \ntax-free money to buy health insurance. Why not? What does Senator \nKennedy have against the self-employed getting the same treatment as \nGeneral Motors, or people who do not work for an employer that can \nprovide health insurance getting a tax deduction? We know why he has \nagainst it. He does not want people to spend their money on health \ncare. He wants the Government to spend the money for them. That is what \nthis issue is about.\n  As much as we have tried to write a bipartisan bill, unfortunately, \nthis is an election year. We are proving it right here on the floor of \nthe Senate. We are going to reject this amendment, and I hope we will \ncome to our senses. I hope that we will go back into conference and \nwrite a bill and bring it to the floor, a bill that does not allow \nemployers to be sued, a bill that holds HMOs accountable, a bill that \nlets people buy health insurance with tax-free dollars, and then let \nSenator Kennedy vote no. But I believe that America will vote yes. And \nthis is about choices.\n\n  Senator Kennedy protests that we are not making progress. We are not \nmaking progress in the wrong direction. That is what Senator Kennedy is \nunhappy about. We are not going to sue employers. We are going to \nprovide tax relief to people to buy health care. We are going to hold \nHMOs accountable. We are not going to let the Government take over and \nrun health care.\n  As for the principle of compromise, I am willing to compromise and go \npart way, as long as we are going in the right direction. But I do not \nhave any interest in compromising, in going part way in the wrong \ndirection because that means we have further to go in going in the \nright direction.\n  I congratulate the chairman of this conference. He has done a great \njob. He has provided the best leadership on any conference that I have \nseen since I have been in Congress. He deserves better treatment. I \nbelieve Republicans ought to be outraged about this. And I am outraged. \nI have worked hard on this conference.\n  We are going to produce a good product. I am happy to have people \njudge me at the polls on it. I believe when you ask people do they want \nemployers to be sued, I think they are going to say no. Senator Kennedy \nwants them to be sued. I say no. Let the American people decide in \nNovember.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself half a minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the minority \nleader's statement be charged against his leadership time, and I ask \nthat my statement be charged against our leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 30 seconds, and then 5 minutes to Senator \nMikulski.\n  Mr. President, we know a stall when we see one. This conference is a \nstall. And we know when we are on an endless road to nowhere. That is \nwhere we are. It isn't the Senator from Massachusetts saying it. It is \nhere. It is the Republican principal leader in the House of \nRepresentatives, Charlie Norwood, I say to the Senator. He is the one \nwho is saying it:\n\n       ``The Senate had eight months to develop a concise \n     alternative to the House liability proposal,'' says Norwood, \n     ``and if all they have to show is a three page staff-level \n     letter that could mean anything and everything, it's \n     impossible to take this conference process seriously.''\n\n  Dr. Norwood is trained in the right profession. He is a doctor and he \nis a dentist; and he knows how hard it is to pull teeth around here. \nThat is what we have been trying to do with our Republican conferees.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. For the information of my colleague, Dr. Norwood is not \non this conference. Dr. Norwood may or may not know that we worked very \nhard to come up with the appeals process to which we basically have \nagreed. Dr. Norwood may or may not know that we agreed basically on a \nlot of patient protections. He may not know we spent weeks on the \nappeals process. We negotiated in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I think to refer to somebody outside the conference trashing the \nconference is a little extraneous. The conferees know that we worked in \na bipartisan way to come up with the appeals process.\n  Ask Dr. Frist. Ask other people who participated in the conference. \nTo have an outsider say, ``Oh, we haven't done much, it is time to pass \nthe House bill,'' I think is disingenuous.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not on my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Chair could, just to remind the Members \nof the Senate, the time is controlled by the Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator Kennedy and my \ncolleagues in moving forward on this issue on a very strong Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  In the debate the question was, Do you remember the Clinton plan? I \nsure do. I remember it with fondness. I wish we had passed it because \nwe would not be in this mess that we are in today.\n  When the Clinton plan was before the Senate, they said: We can't pass \nit. It is going to create a big bureaucracy. It is going to shackle the \ndecisionmaking by physicians. And it is going to lead to rationing by \nproxy.\n  What do we have now with this mess that we are rendering in the \ndelivery of health care? This plan, the way health care is being given \nin this country now, was created by a group called the Jackson Hole \ngroup. It might have been created by the Jackson Hole group, but for \nmost patients they go through a black hole trying to get the medical \ntreatment they need.\n  Where do we find ourselves? Doctors unionizing, hospitals closing, \nand the American people up in arms. There is a reason for this. This is \nbecause our delivery system has turned into a bureaucratic-rationing-\nby-proxy nightmare.\n  This is why we are trying to move this legislation.\n  This legislation we are talking about--Norwood-Dingell--passed the \nHouse in October 1999 by a vote of 275-151. That is bipartisan. The \nSenate moved quickly to have conferees in October. The House did it in \nNovember. But we did not have our first bipartisan meeting until \nFebruary 23. The first Members' meeting wasn't until March. So I am \nvery frustrated by the slow and stodgy pace of these deliberations.\n  Our progress has been minimal and meager. The snail's pace of the \nconference leads me to conclude that unless we act quickly, we are not \ngoing to have time in this session.\n  It is high time we deal with this issue. No more delays. No more \nparliamentary derailment. It affects the\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\nhealth care of every American who is in a managed care plan. They want \nus to take action. They want us to take it now.\n  But while this is not about political posturing, this is about people \nin pain: the 57-year-old man with prostate cancer whose HMO denies him \naccess to a Government-approved clinical trial; the 35-year-old mom who \nhad a stroke and whose employer switched plans in the middle of her \nrehab so she cannot get back on her feet and back with her family and \nback on her job. Think about the woman who has to talk to three \ninsurance gatekeepers before she gets to see her OB/GYN.\n  When we embarked upon this, I said I wanted to fight for patients, \nnot profits. Health care decisions should be made in the consulting \nroom by a doctor, not in the boardroom by insurance executives. \nPatients need continuity of care. They should have the right to receive \ntreatment that is medically necessary and medically appropriate, using \nthe best practices and, yes, holding their health insurance plans \naccountable with the right to sue, if necessary.\n  The Norwood-Dingell plan essentially gives us an external appeals \nprocess before you get into court. This would resolve this.\n  It has been 8 months since the Norwood-Dingell bill passed the House \nof Representatives. I think it is high time we move on this. I say to \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we have worked so closely \ntogether in expanding the opportunity for medical breakthroughs. I \ncould name names as we go around in which I worked with each and every \none of you to really be able to enhance and improve NIH, and even \ndouble the funding in certain areas--certainly Dr. Frist in his work \nthere; Senator Sue Collins and her wonderful work on diabetes; and we \ncould go around; the leadership that Senator Jeffords has had even in \nconducting hearings.\n\n  Why can't we come together to push for the breakthroughs, where we \nhave had more scientific and medical breakthroughs in our country, so \npeople have the health care they need, to have access to the very \nbreakthroughs that the American people paid for and was invented in \ntheir own country?\n  If we are going to make the 21st century a real century of \nopportunity, then I think we need to start now with ensuring that every \nsingle American has access to the health care that is medically \nnecessary or medically appropriate as mandated by their physician.\n  This is really a life and death decision. The clock is ticking. This \nsession of Congress is closing. I hope when it is over that we can have \na bipartisan legacy where we have passed a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator and \ndoctor from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Daschle-Kennedy \namendment for a number of reasons, but basically it has been already \ndebated and defeated by this body after a week of discussion and \ndebate. And it will be defeated today.\n  I do wish to make three points over the next several minutes. No. 1, \nthe offering of this amendment today, I do believe, all of a sudden, \nputs it in political theater, almost in a stunt-like environment as an \nelection issue. No. 2, this amendment is underlying, I believe, a bad \nbill that could very negatively influence the quality of care in this \ncountry, and for sure it will drive people to the ranks of the \nuninsured. No. 3, the bill is inadequate, as has already been \nmentioned.\n  It doesn't address the basic rights of patients. The right of access \nto care is not addressed.\n  First, I hope this is not just political theater, but I tend to think \nit is. It makes me believe some people simply don't want a bill. They \nwant to politicize it by introducing today an amendment on a totally \nunrelated, underlying bill. We will see how it plays out over the next \ncouple of hours.\n  To me personally, as a physician, as a Senator, as one who believes \nwe must, can, and will, because the American people expect us to, \nproduce a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, what is most disappointing \nto me is I am afraid what is happening is the good faith efforts being \nmade by this Congress, where we are spending, as Senators, hours every \nday, not just over weeks but months on this bill, that this is going to \ndestroy, poison, the good-faith efforts and progress that are being \nmade in the conference where we take a Senate bill that has already \npassed through this body and a House bill that has passed that body \nand, in a bipartisan, bicameral way, develop a bill that can and will \nbe passed this year by the Congress.\n  We are making real progress in merging a 250-page bill on this side \nand a 250-page bill on the House side. I am afraid today's action, the \nintroduction of this bill, is playing politics with an issue that, to \nme, as a physician, translates down to affecting the care of \nindividuals, of children, of families. By doing so, we are gambling \nwith the lives and the health of those individuals, many of whom are \nbarely scraping by, barely able to afford the insurance they have, much \nless able to afford increased premiums which this bill, the amendment, \nwill clearly do. Our goal must be, ultimately, when someone needs care, \nto get the care they need and deserve in a timely way.\n  A second goal, a goal in the conference that we discuss in each of \nour meetings, is to get the HMOs out of the business of practicing \nmedicine; with a third goal being a corollary of that, to have the \ndecisionmaking back in the hands of physicians working with their \npatients. That can be achieved in the very near future if we forget \nthis stunt, this political theater of introducing amendments to be \ndebated over a couple of hours that we already debated with the bill \nalready defeated 6 months ago.\n  Why is this bill so bad? Why is the amendment before us so \ndisappointing to me? There are many reasons; I will address two.\n  No. 1, let's come back to the individual patient. It just may be that \nyou fall into that category where your chances of getting your \nhypertension treated are less under this bill or your diabetes managed \nor your cancer diagnosed or the leukemia of your child treated. Why? \nBecause under this amendment, under this bill which has been introduced \ntoday, probably somewhere around a million people are likely to lose \ntheir health insurance today by this single amendment. Will it be you, \nor will it be a constituent back home? We need to look them in the eye \nand say: Are you going to be one of those million people who, because \nof the amendment voted upon today, are going to lose their health \ninsurance?\n  How can I say that so definitively? Because we know this amendment \nwill cost four times what the Senate-passed bill will cost in terms of \nan increase in premiums. The estimated increase in premiums under the \nbill which passed this body is about 1 percent. Under the bill that was \ninitially proposed by Senator Kennedy, it would go up around 4 percent, \nfour times what is provided in the underlying bill. Ask your \nconstituent back home: How do you feel about possibly being one of \nthose people who no longer can afford their insurance and, therefore, \ngo without health care?\n\n  No. 2, if you think your child is getting the care he or she deserves \ntoday and if you decide that they are not, what do you really want? \nWhat you want is to be able to take that child to a doctor and have \nthem say, yes, we will treat the child now. If they say, no, you want \nto go to a quick appeals process, not in some courtroom 3 years later \nbut today, shortly. If you disagree, then you want to go to another \nphysician unaffiliated with the plan. That is what our underlying \nconference bill does.\n  Unfortunately, the bill being introduced today by Senators Daschle \nand Kennedy has these perverse incentives that, instead of going \nthrough that process of internal appeals and external appeals and an \nindependent physician making a final decision, you are encouraged, \nthrough incentives, to go directly to the courtroom and file a lawsuit. \nWe need to ask: Do you want the care you deserve when you need it or \nwhen your child needs it or would you rather spend your time in a \ncourtroom weeks, months or years later?\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n  In the conference bill, we have strong internal appeals, strong \nexternal appeals, an independent physician making a final decision. We \naddress quality of care for you and your family right now. We address \naccess to the care you need now. We address timely decisionmaking in \nthe underlying conference bill. We have those disputes settled by \nindependent physicians, doctors making the final decision. They are the \nones with the best science, the best medical evidence out there \ndeciding medical necessity, not what is in the original plan.\n  My third and final point is that this bill is inexcusably and \nembarrassingly inadequate. It does not cover the provision which will \nbe in the conference bill, and that is access. Right now, there are 44 \nmillion people without health insurance. Since President Clinton has \nbeen in office, 8 million people have lost their health insurance net. \nIt has gone from 36 million to 44 million while President Clinton has \nbeen in office. We must address that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. The underlying conference bill addresses many issues which \ngo well beyond the amendment being introduced today. By voting for the \nDaschle amendment today, we are basically saying these issues, which \nare in the original Senate bill and are being discussed in conference \ntoday, are not important: Access; provisions such as the above-the-line \ndeduction for health care insurance costs; accelerating the 100-percent \nself-employed health insurance deduction; expansion of medical savings \naccounts; a new above-the-line deduction for long-term care insurance; \na new additional personal exemption for caretakers, all of which make \nthose 44 million people more likely to have insurance in the future.\n  Genetic discrimination: The prohibition of having genetic testing be \nused against you when you apply for insurance, it is not in the \nDaschle-Kennedy bill today. It is in the conference bill, the \nunderlying bill passed by the Senate.\n  We have heard over the last several months that 80,000 people a year \ndie because of medical errors or lack of patient safety concerns. That \nis going to be in the conference bill because it was in the underlying \nSenate bill which did pass this body. A vote for the amendment today is \na vote that these issues should not be part of the basic Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n\n  Let us not play politics. Let us continue to do what we have been \ndoing over the last several weeks and months; that is, advance, taking \nthe 250-page bill passed here, the 250-page bill passed in the House of \nRepresentatives, bringing them together in a bipartisan, bicameral \napproach that comes back to looking that patient in the eyes and \nsaying: We are going to improve the quality of care you receive, not \ndecrease that quality of care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Tennessee, I \nam glad to hear him talk about increasing the number of people who are \nuninsured. With all due respect, I don't hear a lot from Senators on \nthe other side about the need to have health security for all \nAmericans. That, truly, is the unfinished agenda.\n  Secondly, on the playing politics of it, I don't want to turn around \nand say he is playing politics with it, but people in the country are \nwondering how long they are supposed to wait.\n  This is all about quality health care. All of our citizens want to be \ncovered, not just the small number in the Republican bill. All of the \ncitizens in our country want to make sure that the doctors are making \nthe decision and there is independent review of their decisions. That \nis not in the Republican bill. All of the people in our country want to \nmake sure that when they need to purchase prescription drugs or they \nneed to see a specialist, a doctor who can give them and their children \nthe best quality care possible, they will be able to do so. That is not \nin the Republican bill.\n  We have been waiting and waiting--3 months, 4 months, I don't know \nhow many months--for the conference committee to act. With all due \nrespect, people in Minnesota and people in the country want to bring \nsome balance back into this health care system. They don't want it run \nby the big insurance companies.\n  They don't want it just run by the big managed care companies. They \nwant us to be responsive to their concerns. This is a vote about who we \nrepresent. Do we represent these large insurance companies and large \nmanaged care companies, the vast majority owned by just a few large \ninsurance companies, and increasingly corporatize, industrialize, and \ninsensitive medicine or do we support a health care system that is \nresponsive to the people we represent--the people back home, the \nmothers, fathers, and children who want good quality health care, who \nwant to be able to go to the doctor that will help them, who want good \nquality treatment when they need it.\n  That is what this is all about--patient protection and protection for \nthe caregivers, the providers, the doctors. Demoralized caregivers are \nnot good caregivers. The reason the AMA and other professionals support \nthis is they want to be able to practice the kind of medicine they \nthought they would be able to practice when they went to nursing school \nor medical school.\n  Really, this is a real simple proposition: Are we on the side of the \nconsumers and people back in our homes? Or do we represent just a few \nlarge insurance companies who only control most of these big managed \ncare companies? I think we should be on the side of the consumers and \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield 6 minutes off of the manager's time. Mr. \nPresident, I will start by commending the conferees on this legislation \nfor their tremendous hard work. They have worked very hard to resolve \nmany of the issues involved in this very complex bill, and they have \nmade tremendous progress. I find it incredible that we are not allowing \nthe conference time to complete its work when they have, indeed, made \nsuch progress.\n  The Senate-passed bill accomplishes three major goals: First, it \nwould protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable for providing \nthe care they promise. As Senator Frist says, our legislation would get \npeople the care they need when they need it. You should not have to \nhire a lawyer and file a lawsuit and wait years in order to get the \nhealth care you need. Instead, our bill has a quick appeals process to \nhelp people get the care they need when they need it, without resorting \nto an expensive lawsuit.\n  Second, our legislation would improve health care quality and \noutcomes.\n  Third--and this is the critical difference between the two approaches \nbeing discussed today--our legislation would expand, not contract, \naccess to health care. The fact is that costs matter. We cannot respond \nto the concerns about managed care in a way that resorts to unduly \nburdensome Federal controls and excessive lawsuits that drive up the \ncost of insurance so that we cause people to lose access to health care \naltogether. That is the crux of this debate.\n  We have a growing number of uninsured Americans in this country. \nThere are 44 million uninsured Americans--the highest number in a \ndecade. In my home State of Maine, 200,000 Mainers are without \ninsurance. I have met with so many employers who have told me that if \nthe Kennedy legislation passes, they will drop their health care plans. \nThey simply cannot afford to be exposed to endless costly lawsuits in \nreturn for providing a health care benefit.\n\n  Just yesterday, I met with a manufacturer from Maine who has 130 \nemployees. He is a good employer. He provides an excellent health care \nplan. But he told me that if he is going to be exposed to endless \nliability and endless lawsuits, then he will no longer provide that \nhealth insurance to his employees. Many other employers will respond \nthe same way.\n  So the problem is, if we pass the Kennedy bill, we will drive up the \ncost of health insurance that will make it further out of reach for \nthose uninsured\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nAmericans who already can't afford health insurance, and we will add to \nthe number of uninsured Americans because of employers being forced to \ndrop coverage. I can't imagine that that is a result we want. We should \nbe seeking ways to expand access to health insurance, not imposing \nadditional costs and new burdens that make it even more difficult for \nemployers--particularly small businesses--to provide this important \nbenefit.\n  Mr. President, let me also comment on the scope of this bill. Time \nand time again, I have heard our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say, oh, this bill doesn't protect millions of Americans. The \nfact is that every single American who is under an employer plan, under \nour legislation, would have the right to an appeals process as set \nforth in this bill. And that applies whether or not the plan is under a \nState regulation or in a State self-funded plan. That appeals right--\nwhich is the heart of our legislation, the single most important reform \nto ensure that people get the care they need when they need it--applies \nacross the board.\n  Where the legislation differs is on the question of whether we should \npreempt--just wipe out--the good work that State governments have done \nin the area of patient protection. States have acted to provide \nspecific consumer protections without any prod or mandate from \nCongress. In fact, 47 States have already passed legislation \nprohibiting gag clauses from being included in health insurance plans.\n  Why do we need to preempt that good work? We should recognize that it \nisn't a one-size-fits-all approach, that, indeed, a health insurance \nmandate in one State may not be appropriate in another. For example, \nthe State of Florida, which has a high rate of skin cancer, provides \nfor direct access to a dermatologist. That isn't a big problem in my \nState. Yet we have other needs. Each State has been able to tailor its \nhealth insurance plan.\n  Indeed, it has been States that have been responsible for the \nregulation of insurance for over 50 years. I daresay they have done a \nfar better job in protecting the consumers of their States than we \nwould have if we turned over the regulation of insurance to the Health \nCare Finance Administration. Do we really want to have Washington \nregulating health insurance in each of the 50 States? That is what the \nKennedy bill would do.\n  There is a better way. We should enact a Patients' Protection Bill of \nRights this year. We should protect a bill that is like the Senate \nbill. I am confident that, given time, the conferees will accomplish \nthat goal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Mr. President, the significance of this debate, in my \nview, is this: The Norwood-Dingell bill--the Daschle amendment here--is \na good bill. It would provide coverage for 161 million Americans, as \nopposed to the 48 million Americans covered by the Republican Senate \nbill. The beauty of what is happening here today is that if the Senate \nwere to enact this bill, to pass this bill, we would have health care \nreform in the United States. The bill would go directly to the \nPresident, it would be signed, and the job would be done.\n  Instead, the concern of many of us is that this is simply not going \nto happen. And we have a chance to make it happen today. I contend that \nno one should go out there and say they are for health care reform and \nnot vote for a bill that has the opportunity to become a reality. That \nbill is the House-passed Norwood-Dingell bill, and we have that chance \ntoday.\n  After the consideration of the bill on the floor last year, I went to \nCalifornia. California has the largest penetration of managed care in \nthe Nation. I called together the CEOs of the big managed care \ncompanies and the California Medical Association. We proposed four \nthings to them--four very simple things. One of them was the definition \nof ``medical necessity.''\n  The Senator from Tennessee just said: It is important to get the HMOs \nout of the business of practicing medicine. That is what I tried to do \nin the debate on the floor when the Senate bill was up--to change the \nmedical necessity provisions to make sure doctors decide what is \nmedically necessary, not insurance companies.\n  So I thought I would go to them and ask them to voluntarily make \nchanges in how medical necessity is determined, in medically necessary \ndrugs and in two other areas. There was a lot of discussion and several \nmeetings. The bottom line is that they are unwilling to change. The \nbottom line is that they did not come forward with a plan.\n  The bottom line is I believe we are going to be in this situation \nwhere Americans are dissatisfied with the level of managed care \nprovided to them by their plans until we pass a basic law.\n  What law could be more basic essentially than Norwood-Dingell? Let's \nlook at what it does.\n  It assures nearby emergency room treatment for emergencies. That is \ncommon sense.\n  It provides access to specialists for patients needing specialty \ncare.\n  In my view, that is a no-brainer. If you need it, you should get it.\n  It provides access to drugs not on the plan's formulary, if medically \nnecessary.\n  It provides the ability to stay with your physician at least 90 days \nor until treatment is complete if a doctor terminates his/her contract \nwith your plan and you require specialized care.\n  It provides coverage of the routine costs of clinical trials.\n  It provides access to a clear internal and external review process \nfor denial of benefits.\n  It holds plans accountable in the event of death or injury.\n  A key issue in this debate and reflected in several parts of the \nDaschle amendment is who decides: Is it the doctor in consultation with \nthe patient or is it an HMO bureaucrat, a green eyeshade? Under this \namendment it is the medical expert who knows the patient and who \ndecides, not the plan. This means that doctors decide which drug works \nbest; doctors decide which treatment is appropriate; doctors decide \nwhen specialty care is needed; doctors decide how long someone will \nstay in the hospital.\n  For example, this amendment requires health plans that have \nformularies to cover drugs that are not on a plan's formulary, if the \ndoctor believes the non-formulary drugs are medically necessary. It \nalso requires plans to refer patients with a serious or complex illness \nto a specialist for care. If a patient's condition requires the use of \na specialist that is not available through the health plan, this \namendment requires that plans cover services, at no additional cost, \nthrough a non-participating specialist. Both provisions are essential \nfor persons living with a life-threatening or chronic illness.\n  Restoring medical decision-making to those trained to make medical \ndecisions is at the heart of this debate. Doctor after doctor in my \nstate talks about how their decisions are challenged, countermanded, \nsecond-guessed, and undermined by HMOs, to the point that they can \nhardly practice medicine.\n  Another important provision says that patients can continue treatment \nwith their doctors for at least 90 days if plans have terminated their \ncontract. A plan must continue to cover treatment for pregnancy, life-\nthreatening, degenerative or disabling diseases and diseases that \nrequire special medical care over a prolonged period of time with the \nterminated provider.\n  The amendment also requires plans to cover the routine costs of \nclinical trials, costs like blood work, physician charges and hospital \nfees. Clinical trials are research studies of new strategies for \nprevention, detection and treatment of diseases for which patients \nvolunteer. These trials often involve analyzing new treatments, like \npromising new drugs, for diseases such as cancer. This provision is \nneeded because a major deterrent to participation in trials is that \ninsurers refuse to cover the day-to-day costs. For example, in the case \nof cancer, only 3-4 percent of adult cancer patients (40,000 people out \nof 1.2 million diagnosed) are enrolled in cancer trials.\n  Another provision of the amendment would allow patients to go to the \nclosest emergency room during a medical emergency without having to get \na\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nhealth plan's permission first. Emergency room staff could stabilize, \nscreen and evaluate patients without fear that plans will refuse to pay \nthe costs.\n\n  According to the University of California, Los Angeles, Health \nInsurance Policy Program: ``Californians are confused about where they \nshould turn for help in resolving their problems and most are not \nsatisfied with the resolution of their problems. There is a need for a \nclear grievance procedure and independent review of health plan \ndecisions to try to prevent adverse health outcomes to the extent \npossible.''\n  The Daschle amendment requires plans to have both an internal and \nexternal review for benefit denials. The review must be conducted and \ncompleted by a medical professional within 14 days or 72 hours in the \ncase of an emergency. For external reviews, the reviewer must have \nmedial expertise and a determination must be made within 21 days after \nreceiving the request for a review. In the case of an emergency, that \ndecision must be made within 72 hours.\n  Senator Daschle's amendment would also allow patients to sue health \ninsurance plans in state courts for denials or delays in coverage if \nthe internal and external review process has been exhausted first, \nunless injury or death has occurred before the completion of the \nprocess. Plans complying with an external review decision would not be \nsubject to punitive damages. Additionally, employers who were not \ninvolved in a claim decision would be exempt from such legal action. \nThis provision helps patients keep their health plan accountable for \nthe decisions made about their health.\n  Another key issue before us is who is covered. Under this bill, all \n161 million insured Americans would be protected. This is a vast \nimprovement over the Senate bill which only covers 48 million \nAmericans. How can we say one group deserves protections and another \ndoes not?\n  The words of this Californian provide an accurate and poignant \nsummary of the problem. Kit Costello, president of the California \nNurses Association, said:\n\n       Most Americans see a confusing, expensive, unreliable and \n     often impersonal assembly of medical professionals and \n     institutions. If they see any system at all, it is one \n     devoted to maximizing profits by blocking access, reducing \n     quality and limiting spending . . . all at the expense of the \n     patient. . . . Who's in charge of my care? The average \n     American believes that health insurance companies have too \n     much influence and exert too much control over their own \n     personal care--more than their doctor, hospital, the \n     government or they themselves, sometimes more than all of \n     them combined.\n\n  Mr. President, people should not have to fight for their health care. \nThey pay for it out of their monthly paycheck. It should be there for \nthem when they need it.\n  Last fall, after the Senate completed consideration of the HMO bill, \nI convened a group of HMO officials and health care providers in an \neffort to address some of the complaints we were hearing from patients \nand doctors in California. They met several times early this year.\n  I asked them to try to reach agreement on at least four issues.\n  One, medical necessity: Include clear language in contracts between \nplans and providers on medical necessity. I suggested the language like \nthat that I proposed in the Senate which defined ``medically necessary \nor appropriate'' as ``a service or benefit which is consistent with \ngenerally accepted principles of professional medical practice.''\n  Two, payment of claims: Because at the time, 50 percent of physicians \nand 75 percent of California medical groups were reporting serious \ndelays in payments by plans, I asked them to agree on a system for \npromptly notifying doctors when patients' leave plans and an assurance \nof prompt payment of claims.\n  Three, low premium rates: According to a 1999 Price Waterhouse Study, \nCalifornia has one of the lowest average per member premium rates per \nmonth in the country ($120 monthly) in the commercial managed care \nmarketplace. Of this, doctors receive around $35 for actual patient \ncare. Payments in California are 40% less than those in the rest of the \ncountry. Over 75% of medical groups are in serious financial trouble in \nmy state.\n  I suggested that they develop payment rates to providers that are \nsufficient to cover the benefits provided in an enrollee's contract, \nrates that thus are actuarially sound.\n  Four, formularies: Finally, physicians were telling me that it is \ndifficult to find out which drugs are and are not on plans' formularies \nand that it was difficult to get exceptions from formularies for \npatients when drugs not on the formulary were medically necessary and \nmore effective than those on the formulary.\n  I had hoped they could work out better methods for letting doctors \nknow which drugs are on the plans' formularies and to agree on a \nuniform method for allowing exceptions to formularies when nonformulary \ndrugs are medically necessary.\n  There were several meetings in January and February. It is now June. \nEven though there were several constructive discussions, little \nresolution was reached.\n  And so, without voluntary action by the industry, legislation is all \nthe more necessary.\n  I hope the Senate passes this amendment today and sends it to the \nPresident for signature.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 37 minutes; the \nSenator from Massachusetts has 34.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont 7 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have been in Congress now for 25 \nyears. During that period of time, I have sat on dozens of conference \ncommittees. I am, as most people know, somewhat towards the middle of \nthe political spectrum. Thus, I am trying to make sure we don't do \nsomething which I think would be so counterproductive to the progress \nwe want to make in the health care area if we pass this amendment.\n  We have made substantial progress in this conference committee. We \nare near agreement on all of the critical issues: Access, liability, \nand scope. It has not been an easy process.\n  Under the guidance of Bill Frist and others, we have established for \nthe first time a principle that every American is entitled to the best \nmedicine. That is a new standard. It is a high standard. It is \nguaranteed when it is most needed through the process we have set up \nwhile the patient is ill. It is not as Norwood-Dingell would provide, \nand that is the best lawsuit after the patient is dead or suffering \nfrom ineffective care. Ironically, that standard which they would use \nfor that is a lower standard than certainly best medicine but one which \nis generally practiced in the area.\n  Those who are looking at it from a legal perspective should recognize \nthat a higher standard is going to be more protective than the standard \nthat is being advocated by the other side. Yet we reasonably establish \nin the present draft reasonable availability of liability through the \ncourts, including even, under certain circumstances, punitive damages \nwhen appropriate. That is a step we have somewhat reluctantly taken, \nbut we have done it in a way that I don't think in any way interferes \nwith what we want to do in the bill.\n  Finally, which is very important before I go into some other aspects, \nthe cost of the bill that we had will be very small relative to that \nwhich is proposed by the opponent. It would be probably less than 1 \npercent. For every 1 percent that we increase the cost over $300,000--\nthis came from the AFL-CIO--people lose their health insurance. We are \nlooking at alternatives that go up as high as 6 percent on the other \nside, meaning almost 2 million people would lose their health care.\n  I will strongly support Senator Nickles' motion to table the \namendment offered by Senator Daschle. Under the able leadership of our \nchairman, Senator Nickles, I am committed to working with the other \nconferees from the Senate and the House of Representatives to find \nagreement on responsible legislation to regulate managed care plans. \nBut any new protections cannot significantly increase the cost of \nhealth coverage and cause more Americans to become uninsured.\n  The House-passed legislation, which Senator Kennedy is attempting to \nadd to the Department of Defense reauthorization bill, mandates that \nthe Health\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nCare Financing Administration enforce the new insurance standards in \nthose States that decide not to adopt the Federal laws. To date, 23 \nStates have refused to enact one or more of the provisions contained in \nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and its \namendments. For almost half the country, HCFA is the agency that \nconsumers must turn to for help in enforcing these new Federal \ninsurance mandates. The House-passed bill would continue this pattern \nand accelerate the creation of a dual system of overlapping State and \nFederal health insurance regulation that will only cause confusion for \nconsumers and inefficiency for plans.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) agrees with me \non this important point. In NCSL's action policy on managed care, they \nstate:\n\n       [T]he Senate-passed version of the ``Patients' Bill of \n     Rights'' generally preserves the traditional role of States \n     as insurance regulators, and focuses most of its attention on \n     the federally regulated, self-funded ERISA plans.\n\n  In sharp contrast to their support for the Senate bill's \napplicability, they believe the Norwood/Dingell bill: ``[W]ill largely \npreempt these important State laws and replace them with Federal laws \nthat we submit the Federal Government is ill prepared to monitor and \nenforce.'' The National Conference of State Legislators goes on to say: \n``[T]he Federal Government will not be able to deliver on the promise \nand may very well prevent States from delivering on theirs regarding \npatient rights.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures policy statement be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Action Policy, Managed Care Reform\n\n       NCSL supports both the establishment of needed consumer \n     protections for individuals receiving care through managed \n     care entities. We also support the development of public and \n     private purchasing cooperatives and other innovative ventures \n     that permit individuals and groups to obtain affordable \n     health coverage. We strongly oppose preemption of state \n     insurance laws and efforts to expand the ERISA preemption. \n     The appropriate role of the federal government is to: (1) \n     ensure that individuals in federally-regulated plans enjoy \n     protections similar to those already available in most \n     states; (2) establish a floor of protections that all \n     individuals should enjoy; and (3) to provide adequate \n     resources for monitoring and enforcing federally-regulated \n     provisions. The Senate-passed version of the ``Patient Bill \n     of Rights,'' generally preserves the traditional role of \n     states as insurance regulators, and focuses most of its \n     attention on the federally regulated, self-funded ERISA \n     plans. Individuals who receive their health care through \n     these plans have not benefited from the state laws enacted to \n     provide needed protections for individuals who receive care \n     through managed care entities. It is appropriate and \n     necessary for the Congress to address the needs of these \n     individuals.\n       States have taken the lead in providing needed regulation \n     of managed care entities. The reforms at the state level have \n     enjoyed bi-partisan support and have been successful. If \n     states had the ability to provide these protections to people \n     who receive their health care benefits from self-funded ERISA \n     plans, we would surely have done so. We have asked for the \n     privilege on many occasions.\n       Today we see federal legislation that will largely preempt \n     these important state laws and replace them with federal laws \n     that we submit the federal government is ill-prepared to \n     monitor and enforce. None of them would provide additional \n     resources to the U.S. Department of Labor or to the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services to hire and train \n     staff to implement the many complex provisions of these \n     bills.\n\n\n preemption of state laws and state regulation of managed care entities\n\n       It is widely believed that the pending legislation creates \n     a federal floor and would not preempt state laws that are \n     more protective of consumers. We are not certain that is \n     true. Unless state legislatures adopt legislation that \n     mirrors the federal legislation, state insurance \n     commissioners would not be authorized to continue to regulate \n     managed care entities under any preempted state laws. In come \n     cases ironically, state insurance commissioners would be \n     unable to enforce existing state law that would have afforded \n     these same individuals needed protections. As a result, after \n     passage of the federal legislation, the regulation of managed \n     care entities could be largely a federal affair. Again, we \n     believe the current federal infrastructure for the oversight \n     and enforcement of health insurance regulations is \n     inadequate. The federal government will not be able to \n     deliver on the promise and may very well prevent states \n     from delivering on theirs regarding patients rights.\n\n\n                  access to health insurance proposals\n\n       NCSL strongly opposes proposals that exempt association \n     health plans (AHPs), Health Marts and certain multiple \n     employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) from critical state \n     insurance standards. These proposals would permit more small \n     employers to escape state regulation and oversight through an \n     expansion of the ERISA preemption. States have tailored their \n     health care reforms to fit local health insurance markets and \n     to address the concerns of local consumers.\n       The impact on federal insurance reforms. The federal \n     government, through the enactment of the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), made an \n     effort to stabilize and improve consumer protections (through \n     state regulation) of these markets. Enactment of AHP/MEWA \n     provisions in any form would undermine these efforts. We are \n     particularly concerned about: (1) the impact on state small \n     group and individual insurance markets; and (2) the \n     opportunity inadequate regulation provides for fraud and \n     abuse. These concerns are in addition to our larger concerns \n     about the ability of the federal government to adequately \n     regulate an expanded health insurance market.\n       The impact on state insurance markets. Recent state reforms \n     have guaranteed small employers access to health insurance \n     and have made coverage more affordable for many small \n     businesses by creating large insurance rating pools. These \n     large pools assure that all small firms can obtain coverage \n     at reasonable rates, regardless of the health of their \n     employees. The success of these state small group reforms, \n     however, depends on the creation of a broad base of coverage. \n     By expanding the exemption provided in ERISA, the House-\n     passed bill would shrink the state-regulated insurance market \n     and threaten the viability of the markets and any reforms \n     associated with these markets. These proposals undermine \n     HIPAA by creating incentives for healthy groups to leave the \n     state-regulated small group market, only to return when \n     someone becomes ill. This incentive for adverse selection \n     would be disastrous, compromising state reforms and raising \n     health care costs for many small firms and individuals.\n       Fraud and abuse. MEWAs have become notorious for their \n     history of fraudulent activities. The House-passed bill would \n     undermine federal legislation that specifically gave states \n     the authority to oversee MEWAs. A policy adopted because \n     federal regulation had proven ineffective in preventing \n     abuses. Under the proposed legislation, many MEWAs could \n     become exempt from state regulation by becoming federally \n     certified as Association Health Plans (AHPs). The proposal \n     does not provide sufficient protections for employees and \n     employers against victimization by unscrupulous plan \n     sponsors.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont has passed many of the consumer \nprotections contained in the two bills. However, it has not enacted \nall. As Vermont's employers struggle with 20-percent to 30-percent \npremium increases, and the State adjusts to the departure of a major \ncarrier, the Governor and the State legislature have agreed to a \nmoratorium on the passage of additional consumer protections. Under the \nHouse approach, the Vermont legislature's decision would be overridden, \nand they would be forced to pass additional congressional insurance \nmandates. We in Congress cannot be working at cross-purposes with \nrespect to our States, which are best positioned to understand the \nneeds of the local health care markets. This is not an issue of States' \nrights--it is an issue of who is best situated to determine what's \nright for our States.\n  On Sunday, House and Senate Republican staffers offered new proposals \non managed care legislation in the key areas of liability, scope, and \naccess. The offer would provide for a new Federal cause of action in \nERISA to allow for lawsuits for failure to comply with the decision of \nthe independent medical reviewer.\n  On the issue of scope, the Republican conferees offer the new \nprotections would be extended to ``all 193 million Americans covered by \nhealth insurance.'' We believe that this should be achieved through a \ncombination of Federal and qualified State protections that takes into \naccount a consideration of market composition and fee for services \nissues. We have yet to hear back from the Democrats on our offer.\n  I don't underestimate the difficulty of our task--especially in the \nthree critical areas of the external appeals process, the appropriate \nremedies when the external appeals process fails, and the scope of the \nlegislation.\n  Fortunately, we can, I believe, provide the key protections that \nconsumers want at a minimal cost and without disruption of coverage--if \nwe apply these protections responsibly and where they are needed--\nwithout adding significant new costs, increasing litigation, and micro-\nmanaging health plans.\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope \nwe will be successful in our efforts to develop a conference committee \nreport that provides a true Patients' Bill of Rights, which can be \npassed and signed into law by the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from West Virginia \n3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The American Medical Association says:\n\n       The AMA strongly supports attaching the Norwood-Dingell \n     patients' of rights bill to the DOD reauthorization bill. \n     Patients and physicians have worked for more than half a \n     decade on a bill that protects patients. Now is the time to \n     make it law.\n\n  They further say:\n\n       The Republican counterproposal put forward on June 4 was \n     unacceptable making it little better than the HMO protection \n     act passed by the Senate last summer. The bill was a sham.\n\n  That is the American Medical Association.\n  I listened to my colleagues, all of whom I have enormous affection \nfor, and they know I respect them. I work with them on many things. As \nthey describe the conference process, I can't really believe what I am \nhearing, because I have been in that conference. What I am hearing on \nthe floor and what I heard in the conference is two entirely different \nworlds.\n  I would like to expand on that, but I don't have the time. But we \nhave asked for proposals. We haven't gotten proposals. We should not be \nin the business of suing HMOs or corporations. We said we wouldn't do \nthat. Senator Kennedy said it many times. Congressman Dingell said it \nmany times. If you want to write the language which says that \ncorporations cannot be sued under this bill, we will accept the \nlanguage. We don't want to sue corporations unless they themselves \nintervene in the decision which produces death or injury. What could be \nclearer than that?\n\n  To listen to the argument from this side, one would think it was \nsomething entirely different. This is reduced to a political \ndiscussion. As Democrats, we feel passionately about the Patients' Bill \nof Rights and want 161 million Americans or more to be covered by this, \nrather than the 48 million which would be covered by the present Senate \nbill. We want them, first, to have coverage if the bill passes; and \nsecond, if the bill doesn't pass, to know so that there could be \ncreated a ground swell for future action over who is accountable. It is \naccountability not only for HMOs, but it is accountability for \nCongresspeople on both sides.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights--basically, the one that has been \nintroduced which I urge my colleague to support--is incredibly sound \nand sensible. It gives people the kind of protection they want.\n  Senator Frist understands well that a child needs a pediatric \ncardiologist; an adult needs an adult cardiologist. An adult's fist is \nnot the same as a child's fist. They require different kinds of \nsurgery. In the bill the other side proposes, that would not be \npossible. They could not go out of their plan to get that kind of help. \nIn our bill they could.\n  That is an example of the kind of attention we placed in this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill we have before the Senate. \nIt is much better for the American people.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming, a member \nof our conference who also has additionally been a small businessman \nand former mayor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am disturbed at this attempt to derail a \nconference committee that has been working months on end. If this bill \nwere easy, we would have done it in a few minutes. If this bill were \neasy, both versions would be the same.\n  We have a system of government that is based on both bodies \nconsidering, to their greatest capability, every problem. When \nlegislation is different on one side from legislation on the other \nside, there is a conference committee. This conference committee has \nprobably put more time into trying to resolve the issues, rather than \nto jam one side against the other, trying to get an understanding of \nwhat is trying to be achieved and reach a conclusion that incorporates \nboth bills. There has been a lot of progress.\n  The amendment before the Senate does not include the compromises that \nhave been made to date, some very important ones. This bill has a big \ncity approach to it. Wyoming doesn't have any big cities. Our biggest \ncity is 50,008 people. I have one city in Wyoming, the biggest city in \na county the size of Connecticut, and they don't have a hospital or \nemergency facilities. They drive themselves in an emergency an hour to \nget to a doctor.\n  What works in Massachusetts won't work in Wyoming. The bill has to \nserve both areas. It has to serve the cities and the rural areas. We \nhave to have compromises to do that. We can't force one method on \neverybody. That is what happens if we go to the bill that the House \npassed. We have been getting some things in that meet the needs of the \nsmall retailer, that meet the needs of the small communities that are \nisolated. We have some things in the bill that take care of the \npatients.\n  It isn't just going to effect the small businesses. My staff was \ntalking to Pitney Bowes. Their health care person is not just an \naverage guy. He was the personal physician to President Ford. Now he is \nadministering one of their numerous health plans. He has said if the \nNorwood-Dingell version passes, they will have to eliminate the kind of \nhealth care they have. That is a big employer with a lot more \ncapability than the small employers.\n  We cannot derail a process that is working, a process that worked for \nour country for years and years and years, one that solves difficult \nproblems such as this, one that brings into consideration all of the \nparts of this vast country--not just a solution that a few people in \nWashington came up with. We have to get the opinions of the people of \nthis country included in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I'm more than a little surprised that in response to a \nfirst-time-ever Republican offer on a Patients' Bill of Rights to \nexpand liability and scope, the Democrats have walked away from the \ntable. That's an incredible counter-productive reaction to a giant step \ntowards compromise. This conference has been long and time-consuming, \nbut it is working. There is not a single reason why we should abandon a \nprocess that is working. Yet, politics is being invited in, and I think \nthe majority of us are here to highlight why that's such a terrible \nmistake. Conference committees are an important part of process--for \nour country. It should be. For example, the biggest town in just one \nWyoming county--which is the size of Connecticut--doesn't have a \nhospital, doesn't have an emergency room.\n  Among the handful of principles that are fundamental to any true \nprotection for health care consumers, probably the most important is \nallowing states to continue in their role as the primary regulator of \nhealth insurance.\n  This is a principle which has been recognized--and respected--for \nmore than 50 years. In 1945, Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, \na clear acknowledgment by the Federal Government that States are indeed \nthe most appropriate regulators of health insurance. It was \nacknowledged that States are better able to understand their consumers' \nneeds and concerns. It was determined that States are more responsive, \nmore effective enforcers of consumer protections.\n  As recently as last year, this fact was re-affirmed by the General \nAccounting Office. GAO testified before the Health, Education Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, saying, ``In brief, we found that many states \nhave responded to managed care consumers' concerns about access to \nhealth care and information disclosure. However, they often differ in \ntheir specific approaches, in scope and in form.''\n  Wyoming has its own unique set of health care needs and concerns. \nEvery state does. For example, despite our elevation, we don't need the \nmandate regarding skin cancer that Florida has on the books. My \nfavorite illustration of just how crazy a nationalized system of health \ncare mandates would be comes from my own time in the Wyoming \nLegislature. It's about a mandate that I voted for and still support \ntoday. You see, unlike in Massachusetts or California, for example, in \nWyoming we\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nhave few health care providers; and their numbers virtually dry up as \nyou head out of town. So, we passed an any willing provider law that \nrequires health plans to contract with any provider in Wyoming who's \nwilling to do so. While that idea may sound strange to my ears in any \nother context, it was the right thing to do for Wyoming. But I know \nit's not the right thing to do for Massachusetts or California, so I \nwouldn't dream of asking them to shoulder that kind of mandate for our \nsake when we can simply, reasonably, apply it within our borders.\n  As consumers, we should be downright angry at how some of our elected \nofficials are responding to our concerns about the quality of our \nhealth care and the alarming problem of the uninsured in this country.\n  It is being suggested that all of our local needs will be magically \nmet by stomping on the good work of the states through the imposition \nof an expanded, unenforceable federal bureaucracy. It is being \nsuggested that the American consumer would prefer to dial a 1-800-\nnumber to nowhere versus calling their State Insurance Commissioner, a \nreal person whom they're likely to see in the grocery store after \nchurch on Sundays.\n  As for the uninsured population in this country, carelessly slapping \ndown a massive new bureaucracy on our states does nothing more than \nsquelch their efforts to create innovative and flexible ways to get \nmore people insured. We should be doing everything we can to encourage \nand support these efforts by states. We certainly shouldn't be throwing \nup roadblocks.\n  And how about enforcement of the minority's proposal?\n  Well, almost one year ago this body adopted an amendment that stated, \n``It would be inappropriate to set federal health insurance standards \nthat not only duplicate the responsibility of the 50 State insurance \ndepartments but that also would have to be enforced by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration if a State fails to enact the standard.''\n  Yet here we are one year later where, not only is it being suggested \nthat we trample the traditional, overwhelmingly appropriate authority \nof the states with a three-fold expansion of the federal reach into our \nnation's health care, they still insist on having HCFA be in charge. \nHCFA, the agency that leaves patients screaming, has doctors quitting \nMedicare, and, lest we not forget, the agency in charge as the Medicare \nprogram plunges towards bankruptcy.\n  And guess what, it looks even worse for consumers under HCFA's \n``protection,'' according to a new report released by GAO on March 31st \nof this year. The model the Democrats are supporting for implementing \nthe Patients Bill of Rights is the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act, affectionately known as HIPAA. I quote from the \nreport: ``Nearly four years after HIPAA's enactment, HCFA continues to \nbe in the early stages of fully identifying were federal enforcement \nwill be required.'' Regarding HCFA's role in also enforcing additional \nfederal benefits mandates that Congress has amended to HIPAA, the GAO \nstates, ``HCFA is responsible for directly enforcing HIPAA and related \nstandards for carriers in states that do not. In this role, HCFA must \nassume many of the responsibilities undertaken by state insurance \nregulators, such as responding to consumers' inquiries and complaints, \nreviewing carriers' policy forms and practices, and imposing civil \npenalties on noncomplying carriers.'' And then, the GAO report reveals \nthat HCFA has finally managed to take a baby step: ``HCFA has assumed \ndirect regulatory functions, such as policy reviews, in only the three \nstates that voluntarily notified HCFA of their failure to pass HIPAA-\nconforming legislation more than 2 years ago.''\n  Is this supposed to give consumers comfort? First we should usurp \ntheir local electoral rights or their ability to influence the \nappointment of their state insurance commissioner and then offer up \nthis agency as an alternative? I'm not sure I could find a single \nWyomingite to clap me on the back for this kind of public service.\n  I could go on at length about the very real dangers of empowering \nHCFA to swoop into the private market, with its embarrassing record of \npatient protection and enforcement of quality standards. Such as how it \ntook 10 years for HCFA to implement a 1987 law establishing new nursing \nhome standards intended to improve the quality of care for some of our \nmost vulnerable patients. But I think the case has already been \ncrystallized in the minds of many constituents: ``enable us to access \nquality health care, but don't cripple us in the process.''\n  The next, equally important issue is that of exposing employers to a \nnew cause of action under a Patients' Bill of Rights. Employers \nvoluntarily provide coverage for 133 million people in this country. \nThat will no longer be the case if we authorize lawsuits against them \nfor providing such coverage. This is basic math. If you add 133 million \nmore people to the 46 million people already uninsured, I'd say we have \na crisis on our hands. In my mind, a simpler decision doesn't exist. We \nshould not be suing employers.\n  Mr. President. Let me close by saying that the conference has worked \nin incredible good faith, logging more than 400 hours and counting. We \nhave come to conceptual agreement on a bipartisan, bicameral basis on \nmore than half of the common patient protections. We have come to \nbipartisan, bicameral conceptual agreement on the crown jewel of both \nbills--the independent, external medical review process. Most \ndramatically, the bicameral Republicans have offered a compromise on \nliability and scope, to which the Democrats have given no formal, \nsubstantive response, just rhetoric and political jabs in the press. It \nis absolutely bad faith to have done so. I think it would be \nregrettable if these continued public relations moves torpedo what, so \nfar, has produced almost everything we need for a far-reaching, \nsubstantive conference product. I encourage all of my colleagues to \ntake the high road and support the legislative process our forefathers \nhad in mind, versus a public relations circus.\n\n  Let me share an employer story. Here's another employer ``real life'' \nstory. Within the last hour, my staff was on a conference call with the \nMedical Director of Pitney Bowes, a large employer that self-insures \nand self administers a Cadillac-style health plan for more than 23,000 \nemployees and retirees. All of my colleagues should take note that this \nis not just any private citizen. Dr. Mahoney was the personal physician \nto President Ford. Now he's administering one of numerous health plans \nthat this amendment threatens to disolve.\n  Everything from on-site medical centers to on-site fitness centers to \nthe educational seminars on skin cancer and stress management that \nPitney Bowes currently offers would be jeopardized. They've said the \nworst case result would be terminate the employer plan altogether. That \nsentiment has been echoed from countless other employers, from IBM to \ncaterpillar to mom-and-pop shops.\n  I urge my colleagues not to crush plans like Pitney Bowes over \npolitics.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who are \ninvolved in this conference and thank them for their hard work and \ncertainly defer to all of them about the specifics of what has occurred \nin the conference and the work they have done there.\n  There are some specific issues about which I am concerned. First, it \nis important for the American people to understand that the Patients' \nBill of Rights means nothing unless those rights are enforceable. Under \nany of these bills that are being considered, there are only two \nenforcement mechanisms. Without those mechanisms working, without them \nbeing effective, the rights don't exist because the insurance companies \ncan do anything they want and can never be held responsible for what \nthey do.\n  There are two enforcement mechanisms. First, if we have a real and \nmeaningful independent appeals process, that is an enforcement \nmechanism. Second, we do for health insurance companies the same thing \nwe do for every single American listening to this debate--when they \nhurt somebody, we hold them responsible.\n  There has been a lot of argument about lawyers, lawsuits, and HMOs. \nWhy in the world are HMOs and health insurance companies entitled to be \ntreated any differently than the rest of\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\nus? When we walk out the door and with our automobile or some other way \ncause injury or death to somebody, we are responsible for that. \nEverybody listening to this debate can be held responsible. Why is the \nhealth insurance company entitled to be treated differently? Are they a \nspecial cut above the rest of us?\n  We need real and meaningful enforcement mechanisms. The appeals \nprovision that came out of the Senate was not truly independent because \nthe insurance company had control over the people who made the appeals \ndecision. Something has to be done about that; Otherwise, there is no \nindependent appeal. That issue, as I understand it, has not been \nresolved. If it is not resolved, the appeals process means nothing. It \nis not independent.\n  The other issue I want to talk about is holding HMOs accountable for \nwhat they do or do not do, treating them as every other American \ncitizen, every other American business. It is important to not pay too \nmuch attention to the rhetoric. There is lots of rhetoric in this \ndebate. We are creating a cause of action, a right to sue, and we just \nwant to exempt employers from that.\n  Unfortunately, the use of language makes a huge difference in whether \nthe patient really has a right or not. Let me give an example. This is \nlanguage that was proposed recently in the conference from the \nRepublicans about creating a cause of action:\n\n       A new Federal statutory cause of action would be created in \n     ERISA to allow for lawsuits for failure to comply with the \n     decision of the independent medical reviewer.\n\n  In other words, no matter what the insurance company does, as long as \nthey do what the independent reviewer says they have to do, they can \nnever be held responsible.\n  Here is the problem with that: A patient goes to the hospital. They \nneed emergency medical care. They call the HMO. The HMO says we will \nnot cover it; we will not pay for it. The patient dies as a result or \nis seriously injured for the rest of their life. Three days later, \nafter an appeal is filed, some independent reviewer says, of course \nthis was covered by the policy. So the insurer says: Now I will comply; \nI will do what the independent reviewer says.\n  As long as they do that, under this provision, they cannot be held \nresponsible.\n  The problem is they did the damage when they made the initial \ndecision. If they make an absolutely egregious decision, for whatever \nreason, no matter how bad their conduct, we are not going to cover this \ncare. Then, if 4 or 5 days later they are reversed by an independent \nreview, they cannot be held responsible for that original decision no \nmatter what the damage is, no matter how irreversible it is.\n\n  It also creates a natural incentive to deny coverage, because, No. 1, \nif they deny coverage, the chances are the patient won't appeal; No. 2, \nif they deny coverage and they are reversed 4 days later, there are no \nconsequences. There is absolutely no reason, no financial reason \nwhatsoever, for the insurance company to do anything other than, when \nin doubt, deny coverage because we can never be held responsible for \nthat decision.\n  Let me give a couple of very specific examples. A patient with adult \nonset diabetes has been on insulin, injectable insulin, his entire \nlife. The insurance company--this is a real example, real-life \nexample----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senators has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. The insurance company says: You can take oral \nmedication; you don't need insulin. He appeals. During the time the \nappeal is being considered, 3, 5, 7 days, he has a stroke and goes \nblind.\n  Then the independent review says: Of course, he was entitled to keep \nhis insulin. So the insurance company says: All right, we will provide \ninsulin now.\n  Now we have a 55-year-old man who has had a stroke; he is blind; he \ncannot work anymore; he cannot care for his family. Where does he go? \nWho is going to help his family? The insurance company cannot be held \nresponsible for what they did, not under this proposal. This language \nmatters. It is critically important, what the language says.\n  A young boy, Ethan Bedrick, with cerebral palsy, 5 years old, all his \ndoctors say he needs to have physical therapy, every one of them. The \ninsurance company says he doesn't need it. They appeal. The independent \nreviewer happens to be somebody who has absolutely no experience with \nchildren with cerebral palsy. This is a real-life example. So he says: \nThe insurance company is right; we are not going to give this 5-year \nold child with cerebral palsy physical therapy.\n  Where does he go? The independent reviewer, who knows nothing about \nchildren with cerebral palsy, has denied coverage. The insurance \ncompany has denied coverage, coverage for which his parents have been \npaying for 20 years. So where does he go? For the rest of his life he \nhas cerebral palsy. He is contracted, bound up, can't get the daily \nphysical therapy he needs, and he has nowhere to go. There is \nabsolutely no remedy for Ethan Bedrick.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, what happens to this little 5-\nyear-old boy when this happens? He cannot go to court, not under this \nproposal. He cannot go anywhere. The insurance company has cut him off, \nand he has been cut off from the care he needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 27 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma, 24 to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is \ncertainly one of the finer trial lawyers who has come to this body in a \nlong time. I simply note, on at least two of his examples, they were \ninaccurate. First, if it was an emergency-room situation, there could \nbe no denial because under our bill emergency rooms have to be covered; \nand second, in the instance he just described about the child, which \nwas a compelling incident, unfortunately he failed to mention in our \nbill we require that the reviewer be a medical person who has expertise \nin the discipline and in the area where the person is claiming to have \nreceived injury.\n  The point I do think has been made by the Senator from North \nCarolina, and has been made by a number of other Senators on the other \nside of the aisle, is that employers will be sued. Employers will be \nsued under the bill that is being brought forward by the Democratic \nmembership. That is a serious problem.\n  We put an offer out, an offer to the other side, which was fairly \nsubstantive. It may have been two pages, but the other side understood \nthere was a lot of documentation behind it, and in fact there were \nactually months of negotiation relative to the appeal process behind \nthat offer. In that offer, we said employers cannot be sued. Why? \nBecause when you start suing employers, employers drop out. They start \ncreating uninsured individuals. We have already heard from a number of \nmajor employers, and testimony has been given here today by Senators \nwho represent States where major employers have informed them that they \nare going to drop insurance if they start being sued. We know small \nemployers will do that in droves because they cannot afford the risk of \nputting their businesses through a lawsuit over medical insurance.\n  So this is not about suing HMOs, I say to those on the other side of \nthe aisle, this is about opening up lawsuits to everybody, not only \nagainst HMOs, which by the way we allow to occur in our bill which was \nadmitted to by the sign that was put up--we allow HMOs to be sued--but, \nmore important, it is about suing employers.\n  Look at this chart. This chart is a reflection of the various \nelements of what is essentially the bill the Democratic Party has \nbrought to the floor today. It is so convoluted and so complex that, \nliterally, you would have to spend probably a month just figuring it \nout, just to figure out what it all means.\n  That is one of the reasons this conference has taken so long, because \nwe have been trying to sort through all the different complications. I \npoint out, at almost every element in this chart, every one of these \nwhite lines, every one of these crossing lines, every\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\none of these agencies that is being created, every one of these \ndecision processes being placed upon the community, there is a lawsuit \nwaiting to happen under the Democratic bill.\n  This is the attorneys annuity act. The direction the trial bar is \ngoing to go is to go after the employers; they are the ones who will be \nat risk. As a result, you will drive many people into an uninsured \nstatus because employers will stop running their insurance programs in \ndroves. I mean literally millions of people.\n  Why would you want to do that? I hate to be cynical about this, but I \nhonestly think, if you look at the process this administration has \npursued over the last 8 years, they are trying to continually raise the \ncost of insurance, health insurance, in this country and make it less \nand less affordable, so more and more people become uninsured, so at \nsome point they can make an argument--which they have already made--\nthat they have to nationalize the health care system in order to pick \nup all the people they have created as uninsured.\n  It is the old orphan argument. You know, the person who killed his \nparents goes to court and claims he should receive clemency because he \nis an orphan.\n  The fact is, what the Democratic proposal does, and what the result \nof the administration proposal has been consistently, is to create more \nand more uninsured and then claim: Oh, my goodness, look at all these \nuninsured. We have to nationalize the system so we can cover them all. \nIn the context of this bill specifically, however, the game plan is to \ncreate a whole new activity for the bar association, suing employers \nleft and right.\n  There is a law firm up in New England which represents Car Talk. They \nare called Dewey, Cheatum and Howe. Today, they have about three people \nworking for them, according to Click and Clack, the Tappet brothers, \nwho work at Car Talk Plaza. But I will tell you something. If this bill \npasses, they are going to give up automobile insurance and they are \ngoing to go into suing companies, suing businesses, suing employers who \nhappen to supply health insurance to their people. They are going to \nadd probably 20 or 30 or 40 new attorneys.\n  So Dewey, Cheatum and Howe is going to just keep on going and going \nand expanding, because they will have received an annuity under this \nbill--not an annuity to sue HMOs, because that is not really in contest \nanymore; we have already put that on the table. It will be an annuity \nto sue employers. As a result, not only will there be a heck of a lot \nof lawyers working at Dewey, Cheatum and Howe; there will be a lot more \npeople in this country who don't have insurance, and then we will hear \nfrom this administration, from Vice President Gore: My goodness, look \nat all the uninsured--who were created by this bill we just passed--we \nwill have to nationalize the system. And then we will end up with a \nsystem that really doesn't work.\n\n  We put on the table some fairly substantive and very good proposals \nwhich have come from months of work. I hope the other side, rather than \ntry to politically posture during this period, will take a hard look at \nthem, in the area of scope, the area of access, the area of appeals, \nand in the area of lawsuits and liability, and that we can get back to \nthe business of negotiating this conference rather than to the politics \nof this debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield any time I have remaining back to the \nRepublican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I say to my colleague who just argued \nabout employers, that is another example it is so critical we look \nspecifically to the language and not the rhetoric.\n  Our bill at page 245 specifically exempts employers from any \nliability unless they intervene in the process of making decisions \nabout claims. Period. If all they do is buy health insurance, which is \nwhat 99 percent of certainly small employers do, they cannot be held \nresponsible. On the other hand, if they decide they are going to engage \nin the business of deciding what claims are going to be denied, like \nGeneral Motors or a big company that runs its own plan, then they ought \nto be held responsible. The majority of employers cannot be held \nresponsible at all unless they intervene.\n  Second, Ethan Bedrick, a 5-year-old boy, is a real-life example. His \nclaim was denied by the independent reviewer. If the language we have \nbeen talking about becomes law, we will not have a real Patients' Bill \nof Rights, and Ethan has nowhere to go. He cannot go to court. He does \nnot have any other appeal. The reality is people make mistakes. A 5-\nyear-old boy who has a lifetime of needed care needs a place to go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired. \nWho yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if this was a dance contest, I say to the \nmajority party: You win. I have never seen a shuffle like this. We are \nnot stalling, they say, and yet this conference committee has had more \nthan six months to reach an agreement and there has been no movement. \nDo not take it from me, take it from Dr. Norwood, a Republican \nCongressman from the State of Georgia. He says:\n\n       It is impossible to take this conference process seriously.\n\n  That is from a Republican.\n  While this Congress fiddles, people die. Yes, they die. Senator Reid \nand I had a hearing in Nevada. A mother named Susan Roe spoke up at \nthis hearing about her 16-year-old son, Christopher. Christopher is now \ndead. He died October 12, 1999. He had leukemia. Chris's pediatric \noncologist recommended that he receive a bone marrow transplant, his \nonly hope for long-term survival. But before Chris could receive a bone \nmarrow transplant, his cancer needed to go into remission. Chris's \noncologist felt that the only drug available that would help him \nachieve remission was a Phase III investigational drug known as B43-\nPAP. However, this treatment he needed for a chance at life was denied \nhim.\n  At the hearing, Susan held up Christopher's picture and told us, \nthrough tears, how, as her son lay gravely ill, he looked at her and \nsaid: Mom, I just don't understand how they could do this to a kid.\n  Yes, people die while this Congress fiddles. This debate is about \nwhether there should be a Patients' Bill of Rights. This amendment \nsays, among other things, that every patient has a right to know all of \ntheir medical options, not just the cheapest. If you need to go to an \nemergency room for care, you have a right to get it.\n  If you stand with patients, you will support this amendment. This \nlegislation ought to have been passed last year, but the fact is, it is \nlocked in conference. There is a giant stall going on. The only \ndifference between this conference and a glacier is that a glacier at \nleast moves an inch or two a year. The Senator from South Dakota and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and others have every right and \nresponsibility to bring this proposal to the floor of the Senate \nbecause we insist that this Congress take seriously the need to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I am deeply disappointed that this nongermane amendment is \nbeing offered on this very important bill. As a member of the \nconference committee, I am very disappointed it has been described and \ndepicted in the way it has by the Democrats today.\n  I have never seen a group of my colleagues work as hard as the \nmembers of this conference committee have for the last few months. Over \n400 hours have been logged by staff and members in meetings trying to \nnegotiate very tough and very difficult issues. These are tough issues, \nand there are big differences between the House and the Senate. There \nhas been enormous\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nmovement, and most of the movement has been on behalf of Republican \nSenators who have made compromises and concessions to move this bill \nforward. There has been no stall. One does not stall a bill by spending \nthe kind of time and energy we have seen expended on this bill.\n  In reference to the Kennedy amendment that has been offered today, we \nspent a week debating this issue. One of the biggest problems I see \nwith the Kennedy bill is that all of the access provisions have been \nremoved. Even the access provisions we saw in the Dingell-Norwood bill \nhave been removed. There are none of the means by which more people can \nget insurance.\n  The only access left in this bill is access to the lawyer, and there \nis plenty of access to the lawyer and plenty of access to lawsuits. \nThat is the real purpose of why we have seen this brought forward, to \nprovide a whole new realm of litigation for trial lawyers.\n  I want to give one particular example, a company in my State. I do \nnot mention it particularly because it is from my State, but it happens \nto be the largest employer in America, and that is the Wal-Mart \nCorporation. It sounds good: Let's sue Wal-Mart, big, bad Wal-Mart; \nlet's sue corporations.\n  Let's put it in practical terms. They have 900,000 employees in the \nUnited States. Forty percent of them chose voluntarily to go under the \nWal-Mart health plan. There are about 10 percent in HMOs and many are \ninsured by their spouses who are employed in other places.\n  Those 40 percent represent 700,000 Americans in this one company who \nreceive their health care through Wal-Mart. The 10 percent who are in \nHMOs pay three to four times more in premiums. It costs three to four \ntimes more than those who are under the Wal-Mart plan.\n  Recently, they surveyed all the employees in the Wal-Mart plan. \nNinety-five percent expressed satisfaction, but more significant, not \none of them mentioned they wished they had a right to sue their \nemployer. Not one of them.\n  I want to read what they said in a letter. We met with them off the \nfloor a few moments ago. This is what they said in a letter:\n\n       Our concern is that unavoidable litigation costs will \n     increase health care costs and in turn increase health care \n     premiums.\n\n  There is no doubt about that.\n\n       Depending upon cost, we will be forced to increase health \n     insurance premiums, reduce benefits, or shift associates in \n     health maintenance organizations.\n\n  They are going to take care of their associates. Frankly, they said \nmost are going to be forced into HMOs that cost three to four times \nmore than the Wal-Mart health plan. If it costs three to four times \nmore, literally hundreds of thousands of employees in this one company \nalone will be faced with making the decision they cannot pay the \npremiums or a portion of their premiums and will be pushed into the \nranks of the uninsured. That is going to be the intended or unintended \nconsequence of the Kennedy bill if it is adopted.\n  The plain truth is, Democrats want to get rid of employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance. Mr. President, 103 million Americans receive health \ncare through their employers, and it will take one lawsuit with an \negregious award to force employers to drop their health care and add \ntheir employees to the ranks of the unemployed.\n  Senate Republicans are dead serious about producing a bill out of \nthis conference and one that puts patients first, not trial lawyers \nfirst.\n  The Kennedy amendment is in bad faith. The question is, Do you want \nan issue or do you want a law? We can produce a bill that can become \nlaw and protect millions of Americans, but this is too important to do \nit quickly instead of doing it right. We want to do it right. I reserve \nthe remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I stand in \nsupport of this amendment. I am a member of the conference committee on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. When we began the conference, I had high \nand great hopes for this because my colleagues on the Republican side \ntold us how committed they were to meaningful HMO reform. Let us look \nat the history and the record.\n  This passed the Senate almost a year ago, in July of 1999. It passed \nthe House in October. The first meeting we had was on March 2 of this \nyear, and we conducted no business. Then there was another meeting on \nMarch 9 that lasted a little while. Not much was done. Then we had two \nmore reduced meetings, not of the entire conference but just a few \nmembers of the conference behind closed doors in Senator Nickles' \noffice off the floor. There were four meetings. We have heard about 400 \nhours and all this hard work. Four meetings? That is tough work.\n  Maybe they have been talking with each other for 400 hours. I do not \nknow. It reminds me of a story about a car stuck in a snowbank. The guy \nspends 10 hours in the car spinning the wheels going nowhere. Someone \nshows up and he says: I spent 10 hours trying to get my car out of the \nsnowbank. He is sitting there gunning the gas pedal, spinning the \nwheels, and going nowhere. If he had just gotten out of the car with a \nshovel, he would have been out of there.\n  That is what this conference committee is doing; it is spinning its \nwheels. Since we started meeting, we finalized agreement on two \nprovisions--out of 22 in disagreement, 2 provisions.\n  These were noncontroversial provisions to which both sides easily \nagreed. The first was on access to pediatric care. That took about 30 \nseconds to decide. The next issue was provider nondiscrimination. That \nwas identical in both the House and the Senate bills. That is what we \nhave agreed on. That is all we have to show for 400 hours? Four hundred \nhours, that is what we have to show for it?\n  As I said, we are spinning our wheels. Slowly, over time, I have come \nto the reluctant conclusion that our Republican Senate colleagues are \nnot serious. They do not truly want a Patients' Bill of Rights. But I \nbelieve it is critical that we pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation \nthis year. They did it in the House, and they showed it can be done in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, 160 million of our family members, friends, neighbors, \nand children are paying good money for health care with no guarantee of \nproper and appropriate treatment. We all know too many stories about \npatients who cannot see their doctor in a timely manner, who cannot get \naccess to the specialists they need, patients who could not get the \ncoverage for the type of care they thought was covered under their \nplan.\n  It is very simple: Insurance either fulfills its promises or it \ndoesn't. We are hearing enough to know in too many cases it does not. \nEmployers and patients pay good money for health care coverage, only to \nfind that the expected coverage evaporates at the time they need it.\n  So we have a choice to make here, a choice between real or illusory \nprotections, a choice between ensuring care for millions of Americans \nor ensuring the profit margins of the managed care industry.\n  The Norwood-Dingell bill, the amendment before us, passed on a \nbipartisan vote in the House. It is commonsense patient protections by \nwhich the managed care plans must abide. Over 300 organizations \nrepresenting patients, consumers, doctors, nurses, women, children, \npeople with disabilities, and small businesses support the Norwood-\nDingell bill.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot help but think that if Members of Congress--\nSenators sitting right here in this room today--were in the same health \ncare boat as the average American family, this bill not only would have \nbeen made law, it would have been made law years ago.\n  We have all the protections that are in the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nIt is good enough for us, but it is not good enough for the American \npeople, according to my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  The Senate majority pretends their bill offers real protections. But \nwhen you read everything below the title, the bill offered by the \nSenate Republicans sounds more like an ``Insurers' Bill of Rights'' \nthan a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  It is my hope that this amendment will spur our colleagues on the \nother\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nside of the aisle to renew their commitment to this conference \ncommittee and to do it in a bipartisan fashion. Spinning your wheels \nfor 400 hours is not getting the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleague, he \nis incorrect. He said, if we gave every other employee what the Federal \nemployees have. Federal employees cannot sue their employer. Federal \nemployees don't have a right to appeal. Federal employees, if they \nappeal, they appeal to the OMB, their employer. Federal employees, \nincluding Senators, do not have the right to sue. You cannot sue. To \nsay, if we just give everybody else what we have, is factually \nincorrect.\n  When my colleague said we have had all these meetings and we only \nagreed to two things, one of the reasons people say the conference did \nnot go anywhere is that our Democratic colleagues never say yes--even \nif we give them a yes. We have not quite got around to agreeing.\n  But, frankly, in conference, I might say, we agreed to access to \nemergency room care, direct access to pediatricians, provider \nnondiscrimination, direct access to specialists, continued care from a \nphysician. We have agreed almost entirely--maybe not to the last \ndotting of the ``i'' or crossing of the ``t''--to the appeals process, \nto an independent physician, which is really the whole crux of the \nbill, the most important thing.\n  Why did that take so long? Because we negotiated it. We negotiated \nwith the Senator from Massachusetts. We negotiated with Congressman \nDingell. We negotiated with their staffs. We went over every single \nletter, every single word, every single paragraph. And then people say: \nOh, we have not agreed to anything. Maybe that is the reason we don't \nhave a conference--because you won't agree to anything.\n  Who is not agreeable? Who is not moving? It is a little bit \nfrustrating, a little bit disingenuous to say: Oh, nothing is \nhappening. Where did those 400 hours go? I will tell you, there were \nhundreds of hours--and 400 is conservative--time spent by staff and by \nSenators trying to come up with a positive agreement.\n  Some people do not want one. I think the very fact that we are here \ntoday means people do not want one. They would rather have theater. \nThey would rather have an issue. I was planning on having a bipartisan, \nbicameral conference this afternoon--on Thursday, as we have done for \nthe last several Thursdays--to work on these very issues.\n  The people say, oh, some people want to have an issue on the floor, \nas if they think that is going to help the progress. It is not going to \nhelp the progress. That is unfortunate.\n  I am going to continue to try to see if we cannot pass a positive, \nbipartisan, bicameral bill. But, frankly, I do not think the efforts \nthat have been made today are helpful to the process. I think it \nundermines the process.\n  Again, I tell my colleagues, I cannot think of any other instance \nwhere you have had an ongoing conference where people said, oh, let's \njust adopt the House bill, even though we made significant concessions. \nWe worked and we have negotiated. They say, oh, let's just pull out and \nadopt the House bill. That is a real slap on the Senate, not just the \nRepublicans in the Senate, but that is a real slap on the entire \nSenate.\n  It is going to be interesting to see how committee chairmen vote. Two \npeople can play this game. Maybe there will be a conference in the \nfuture where it is said: Oh, let's just adopt the House bill. We like \nit better. I think that undermines the whole nature, frankly, of the \nlegislative process.\n  I again urge my colleagues to vote to table the Kennedy amendment.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in supporting \nthis important amendment. For months we have been bogged down in a \nconference without real progress, and without hope of concluding the \nconference and bringing this bill to the floor for a final vote in the \nlast days of this Congress.\n  I think we have to move forward. I think we have to move forward, \nparticularly when it comes to access to health care for children in \nthis country. I know there has been some discussion that progress has \nbeen made in terms of allowing access to a pediatrician. But there are \nother important aspects of health care for children included in the \ncontext of the Norwood-Dingell bill that have not been agreed to yet by \nthe conference committee.\n  For example, ensuring that an appeals process is sensitive to the \nparticular needs of children, the developmental needs of children that \ndo not exist for adults; and also ensuring that there are quality \nassurance provisions for outcomes that are tied to the particular \nconcerns of children.\n  If we do not do these things, then we are not only missing an \nopportunity, we are also disregarding our obligation to aid the \nchildren of this country.\n  We have all heard stories today about lawyers and stories about HMOs. \nLet me tell you a story about one child. It is a story I heard down in \nAtlanta with Senator Max Cleland. Lamona Adams, the mother of James \nAdams, was concerned about her child. He had a fever. He was ill. She \ndid what she was told to do by her HMO; that is, to call up and get \nadvice over the phone about what she should do. She desperately pleaded \nfor help for her child.\n  She was told to go 42 miles to a hospital because the HMO had a \ncontract with the hospital to receive their patients. While driving 42 \nmiles to a hospital on the other side of Atlanta, an area she didn't \nknow anything about, the child became so ill that the father just saw a \nsign that said ``hospital,'' went there, and they treated the child. \nThey saved the child's life. However, they could not save the child's \nhands or his feet. They had to be amputated. That is what HMOs have \ndone in too many cases in this country.\n  We have the power to stop the practices. We have the power to do it \ntoday. We should do it today, on behalf of not just James Adams but so \nmany children throughout this country.\n  The fact that we have delayed action on this issue, I think, is \ninexcusable. Now we have to act. In a way, this whole episode is like a \npopular film a few years ago called ``Ground Hog Day,'' where every day \nthe character woke up, and it was the same day over and over again. It \nis not only the same day this year but, as I look at some of the charts \non the Senate floor, it seems to be the same day 6 years ago. The same \narguments were trotted out about health care reform 6 years ago, as \nwere the same dire predictions about more and more Americans losing \ntheir coverage if we pass this legislation.\n\n  We didn't pass health care reform legislation years ago. Guess what. \nMore and more Americans have lost their insurance coverage. We can do \nsomething now--limited, purposeful, appropriate--make sure that HMOs \ntreat people as patients, not as objects of economic profit on their \nbalance sheet. We can do it. We should do it.\n  Today should not be Groundhog Day. It should be D-Day. We should \nseize the initiative and pass this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, first, I want to make it perfectly clear \nthat I strongly support reforming the managed care system. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 300, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act of \n1999 and voted in favor of S. 326, the Patients' Bill of Rights which \nwas approved by the Senate last July.\n  The House-Senate conference committee is currently working out the \ndifferences between the managed care bills passed by the House and the \nSenate. I believe this conference committee is making significant \nprogress. So, not only is it premature for us to vote today on the \nHouse-passed managed care bill in the midst of these negotiations. I \nalso do not feel that the DOD authorization debate is the appropriate \ntime for us to be considering such important health care legislation.\n  We are all aware of the public's frustration and the need for \neffective legislation to guarantee that those enrolled in managed care \nplans receive quality health care. Over the years, the Congress has \nheld numerous hearings exposing story after story regarding people \nreceiving insufficient medical treatment from their managed care\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\nplans. And let me assure you that these stories are deeply troubling to \nme--that's why Congress is addressing this important issue. We are \nlistening to our constituents and we are taking action.\n  There is one point where all of us agree--people deserve to receive \nthe best care possible when they are sick. I believe that when the \nconference committee has completed its work, this important goal \nwill become a reality. None of us think that someone should be turned \naway from medical treatment because his health plan won't cover it. Our \nlegislation provides patients the ability to appeal these types of \ndecisions, quickly, by offering both internal and external appeals \nprocesses. It is my hope that by providing these options, people will \nreceive quality health care, in a timely fashion, when they need it the \nmost.\n\n  All of us in this chamber know very well there are numerous competing \nbills that have been introduced over the years that provide a variety \nof legislative remedies to address this issue. In many respects, these \nbills have common components intertwined with similar, and, in some \ncases, identical provisions. Approximately 47 bills were introduced in \nthe Senate and the House last year to provide patient protections to \nmanaged care enrollees.\n  So it is obvious that we all are concerned about this issue--we all \nwant patients to receive the best care possible.\n  However, for Congress to pass responsible managed care legislation, \nwe must come together and put forth the best bill for the American \npeople. We have done this many times before on health care legislation, \nand there is no reason why we cannot do this again.\n\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is trying to preempt this process. He \nhas offered an amendment that flies in the face of every effort we have \nmade to achieve that consensus.\n  There can be nothing more to this amendment than its public relations \nvalue, since it surely will not pass in the Senate. We have spent hours \nand hours and hours on the Senate floor, in conference, and in the back \nrooms of the Capitol on this legislation.\n  The Senator knows well why the Dingell-Norwood approach will not \npass. He knows it is likely to cause health insurance premiums to rise \nand, as a direct result, cause employers to drop their health plans. He \nknows this will lead to higher numbers of uninsured Americans. And, he \nknows that this is an unacceptable outcome.\n  I remain hopeful that, in the end, we will reach consensus on this \nbill. I commend senator Nickles for his fine work and leadership as \nchairman of the House-Senate conference committee and urge my \ncolleagues to support the conferees and let them continue their work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in another 15 or 20 minutes we are going to \nbe voting on this amendment. We have some 30 working days, the way I \ncalculate, maybe 40 legislative days remaining in this session of \nCongress. Probably the only vote we're going to have on this issue this \nyear will occur in just a few minutes.\n  I don't like to count noses at this particular juncture, but I \nsuspect, based on what I have heard so far, that my good friends on the \nRepublican side will probably prevail politically. I say to them with \ngreat respect and affection that while they may win politically today, \nthere are an awful lot of people all across the country who will lose.\n  I have been in Congress 25 years. I have been in conferences, a lot \nof them. Every now and then, conferences just don't move. I am not \ngoing to engage in the debate back and forth about whether or not this \nconference has actually resolved some particular issue or not. Enough \nhas been said about it. The fact is that occasionally things just don't \nmove. There are just too many differences of opinion. That's all there \nis to it and that is what has happened here.\n  It doesn't make anyone comfortable to have to deal with this issue on \nthe Department of Defense authorization, but we find ourselves in a \nsituation in which it is probably the only chance we are going to have \nto do something about patient protections this year.\n  Despite the way our colleagues have portrayed this amendment, the \nkinds of protections that we want to provide to the American people are \nnot radical ideas. This is not about destroying the insurance industry \nand enriching trial lawyers. If it were, I wouldn't be a part of it. My \ncolleague knows that as a Senator from Connecticut I represent more \ninsurance companies than any other Member except my colleague, Joe \nLieberman. And, I think I would be recognized as someone who has taken \non the trial bar when it was warranted. I've worked with my friend, \nPhil Gramm, on securities litigation reform. We did uniform standards. \nWe did Y2K legislation. I am a cosponsor of tort reform. I don't take a \nback seat to anyone on these issues.\n  But, I also happen to believe, as strongly as I feel about the good \nwork of many of the insurance companies in my state, that when they \nmake a medical decision or when a business makes a medical decision, \njust as when a doctor makes a medical decision, they ought to be held \naccountable. I don't think that is a radical idea. Others may think so; \nI don't think so. The idea that we should provide basic protections to \nall Americans with private health insurance, that patients should have \naccess to emergency care, that women should have access to their Ob-\nGyn, these are not groundbreaking ideas. These ideas are pretty \nstraightforward. In fact, a third of the Republicans in the other \nChamber thought so too and voted for the Norwood-Dingell bill. The \nauthor of the bill, Dr. Norwood, is a Republican. This is not some \ngreat partisan battle except here in the US Senate. Across the country \nit is not a partisan issue. When people get sick and families are \nhurting, they don't talk about themselves as Democrats or Republicans \nor conservatives or liberals or independents, they talk about \nthemselves as individuals who need help.\n  I hope enough of our colleagues on the other side will join with the \nminority here in voting for this, voting for the very same bill that an \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans supported in the \nHouse almost a year ago.\n  Again, I respect my good friend and colleague from Oklahoma for his \nefforts. It has not been an easy job. It is a complicated bill and it \nis a complex issue. But, we have come to a point, with the few days \nleft in this session, that if we don't try to do something about this \nhere, I am convinced nothing will happen in this Congress on this \nissue. Every now and then you begin to read the tea leaves. It is like \nthe student who didn't get the homework done. First the dog ate it. \nThen somehow it ended up in the garbage. Then their computer crashed. \nAfter a while, you have to say maybe the student just isn't going to \nget the homework done. In a sense, that is what has happened here.\n  In the 3\\1/2\\ months since conferees began working on this bill, \nessentially almost nothing has happened. We simply have not moved \nforward. So, with 40 days left, we are put in the position of asking \ncolleagues to join us in supporting a bill that has already passed the \nHouse, that the President said he would sign, that would leave this \nCongress with a mark of achievement, even if we did nothing else in the \nnext 40 days.\n  Can you imagine in future years how this Congress would be recognized \nif we were to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that said all Americans \nought to have access to basic patient protections, that doctors ought \nto be able to make medical decisions for their patients, that \nbusinesses and insurance companies that make health care decisions \nought to be held responsible when they make a decision that affects the \nlives of others? There is not a single citizen in this country who, if \nthey make a decision that causes harm to another, can avoid the \nresponsibility of paying a price. Why should insurance companies be \nexempt?\n  That is what this bill of ours tries to do, along with ensuring \naccess to clinical trials, providing access to emergency care, and \nensuring that patients can receive needed prescription drugs. These \nideas are not radical or extreme. This is what an overwhelming majority\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nof people in this country would like to see us achieve.\n  In the next 15 minutes we will have a chance to do it. I hope some \nbrave souls on the other side will join us and make a record of this \nCongress, something all of us can be proud of for years to come.\n  I yield back to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts whatever \ntime remains.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 9 minutes. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Tennessee 3 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the last hour and a half, we have been \ntalking about the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It comes down \nto a question of should we allow the normal course of events in this \nbody and in the House of Representatives to proceed--the conference \nreport, which is our challenge. It is a challenge because we are taking \na 250-page bill passed in the Senate and merging it with a 250-page \nbill passed in the House of Representatives on issues that will affect \nthe quality of care of millions of people. Our challenge is to allow \nthat process to continue.\n  How much progress has been made? Clearly, from the other side of the \naisle, an attempt has been made over the last hour and a half to say \nthat progress is not being made, that there is a stalemate, that we \nwon't see a bill. In 1 minute, let me review what has happened.\n  On July 15, the Senate passed a bill. The amendment being proposed \ntoday is looking backward because that is the very bill we defeated \nlast year on this floor for very good reasons, and it will be defeated \nagain today. On October 6, the House of Representatives passed a \nPatients' Bill of Rights which included some very important access \nprovisions. Conferees were named and we have addressed it as conferees, \nand we essentially have agreement on many of the issues we have talked \nabout. That is progress.\n  Access to emergency care: If you are injured, you can go to the \nclosest emergency room.\n  Direct access to a pediatrician: If you have children, they have a \nright to have access to somebody who specializes in that care. That has \nbeen agreed to. That is progress.\n  Direct access to specialists: An example was given about a pediatric \ncardiologist, or a cardiac surgeon. You will have access to those \nspecialists. That has been agreed to.\n  Continued care from a physician: In the event there is a pregnancy \nand there is a loss of your insurance plan, you can continue with that \nphysician through your pregnancy, or with a terminal illness.\n  Direct access to obstetricians and gynecologists.\n  That is true progress. A Democratic offer was made to the Republican \nconferees on May 23. That is progress--the fact that the proposal has \nbeen made.\n  I should say that very few concessions were made from the original \nbill. That is progress, though. A Republican response was given and a \nRepublican proposal on June 4. That is progress. Again, as has been \npointed out, a number of concessions, trying to pull those two bills \ntogether, have been made. Again, that is progress.\n  The sponsors of the amendment today again are taking a bill that was \nintroduced 6 or 7 months ago, debated on the floor, and they are \nlooking backward. That bill has been debated and defeated in this body \nafter careful deliberation. We are looking forward with the progress \nthat we have put out.\n  I urge defeat of the proposed amendment so the conference can \ncontinue with the underlying business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have 7 or 8 \nminutes left. Usually, the proponents have the opportunity to do the \nfinal summation. I wonder if my friend and colleague from Oklahoma is \nwilling to do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this has been a long debate and, I think, a \ngood debate. It has proven once again that this is an election year. I \nam not going to insult everybody's intelligence by telling them that I \nam shocked that Senator Kennedy is engaged in partisan politics this \nafternoon. This is an election year. We are politicians. This is a \npolitical act to basically try to win, again, what Senator Kennedy lost \nwhen we had the debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Senator Nickles won. We are in conference trying to work out an \nagreement, and Senator Kennedy doesn't like the way the agreement is \ngoing; he is unhappy about it. But rather than get into all this ``who \nshot John,'' I have tried to come up with a simple example for somebody \nback home who is trying to figure out what this is all about, and let \nme try to give it to you as succinctly as I can.\n  Somebody goes into the treatment room and the doctor comes in there \nand they have their stethoscope and they tell him to take off his \nshirt. In comes somebody else. They say: Well, who is that in this \nroom? And that is the gatekeeper for the HMO. Now, what the patient \nwants is to get that gatekeeper out of the examining room so it is them \nand their doctor. Senator Kennedy says he has the answer. His answer \nis: Well, keep the gatekeeper but here is how we will fix it. We will \nbring in a lawyer to sue the HMO, the insurance company, and the \nemployer that bought the insurance. So we have the lawyer there and he \ngets part of the stethoscope. And then we bring in a bureaucrat to \nregulate it. So Senator Kennedy's answer is, rather than getting the \nHMO out of the examining room, bring in a lawyer and a bureaucrat; and \nhere is the poor patient with his heart at the end of the stethoscope \nand now four people are listening to the heart.\n  Now, what we are trying to do here is simple. We are trying to \nempower the American health care consumer to fire the HMO. We give them \nthe ability to have innovative ways of financing health care, such as \nmedical savings accounts, so if they don't like the way the HMO is \ntreating them, they don't go see a lawyer, or a bureaucrat, or they \ndon't see Senator Kennedy; they simply call up their HMO and say: You \nare fired. They go out through a medical savings account, and they have \ntheir credit card or their checking account through their medical \nsavings account, and they pick up the phone and they don't say: Are you \na member of our HMO? My baby is sick and needs care. Will you see him? \nThey simply say: Will you take a check? ``Do you take MasterCard or \nVisa?'' If they do, they are in.\n\n  In reality, that is what this debate is about. Do you believe in \nbureaucrats, or do you believe in freedom?\n  Senator Kennedy, in all his heart, believes--and he is sincere, and I \nadmire him for it--that having a lawyer there and having a bureaucrat \nin there improves the system.\n  He supported a health care bill where if a doctor provided you health \ncare that an advisory panel appointed by the Government didn't support, \nthey could be fined $50,000. He supported the Clinton bill where if \nyour baby is sick and the Government said this child doesn't need \ntreatment, and you said to the doctor, treat my child and I will pay \nfor it, if the doctor took the money he could be sent to prison for 15 \nyears.\n  That is what their alternative was.\n  What we want to do is give people freedom. One of the freedoms under \nour bill is to say to your HMO: You are fired.\n  If you think having a lawyer and a bureaucrat is good, then you are \nfor Senator Kennedy. But if you believe in freedom and what is right \nfor you and your family, what we are trying to do is the right way to \ngo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my good friend from Texas--he is my good \nfriend--talks about freedom. He has put his finger on an issue. He \nwants to\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\ngive freedom to the HMOs and not provide the important services to \npatients. That is his kind of freedom.\n  I always enjoy listening to the Senator from Texas. I remember \nlistening to him in 1993 when we had President Clinton's economic \nprogram. The Senator from Texas, I remember--someone can correct me--\nsaid: If we pass President Clinton's economic bill, we are going to \nhave unemployment all around the nation, all around the nation. If we \npass President Clinton's bill, we are going to have interest rates \nright up through the top of the roof.\n  We heard that speech. Phil Gramm was wrong then, and he is wrong \ntonight.\n  This issue is very basic and fundamental. It is an important one. \nThis bill should have passed and become law in the last Congress. The \nfirst HMO bill to make sure that patients' rights were going to be \nprotected was in 1997. It took us 2 years to get this legislation out \nof our committee. It took months of delay to get it before the Senate. \nIt was passed almost a year ago. We still have not been able to have an \nagreement that will protect patients.\n  That is what is at issue, when you come right down to it. As much as \nPhil Gramm might like to say it, it isn't just Senator Kennedy saying \nit. It is the fact that 300 organizations--representing the doctors and \nnurses in this country and every other health and medical group--\nsupport our position today. Two Republican leaders on this issue in the \nHouse of Representatives stood before their constituency earlier today \nand said that they believed we ought to take this action this \nafternoon.\n  I ask my friends from Oklahoma and Texas: What particular rights \ndon't you want to provide to the American people who are included in \nour Patients' Bill of Rights?\n  What about the ability to hold plans accountable? Is that \nunacceptable?\n  What about making sure that children get specialists? Is that \nunacceptable?\n  What about having clinical trials? Is that unacceptable?\n  What about guaranteeing women access to an OB/GYN? Is that \nunacceptable?\n  What about having the right to get prescription drugs? Is that \nunacceptable?\n  What about prohibiting gag rules? Is that unacceptable?\n  What about independent external appeals? Is that unacceptable?\n  When you cut through the rhetoric--and we welcome the opportunity to \ncut through the rhetoric--you tell us that you are going to vote \nagainst this this afternoon. You spell out for us those agreements made \nin conference. We challenge you to lay out on the floor of the Senate \nthis afternoon these various agreements that were made. The last \nagreement that was made was in March of this year. That was the last \none in open session. We want to know what kind of protections you are \nnot prepared to give the American people. We stand to protect the \nconsumers, protect the patients, protect the children, protect the \nwomen, and protect the disabled in this country. That is what this is \nabout.\n  In the movie ``As Good As It Gets'' last year, that wonderful picture \nfor which Helen Hunt won the Oscar, there was a wonderful scene that \neveryone remembers. Helen Hunt starred as a mother whose child was not \nbeing provided needed care by her HMO. And every parent across this \nNation laughed as they commiserated and said that is the way it is.\n  The consumers of America understand what is going on here. The \nquestion is whether the Senate of the United States is going to \nunderstand.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about it. I hope the Senate \nwill vote for the Daschle amendment.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose Senator Kennedy's amendment. \nIntroducing this amendment at this time is a clear statement that \nDemocratic leaders want an election issue, not a Patients' Bill of \nRights. It is a cynical ploy, made in bad faith, and they ought to be \nashamed of themselves.\n  The Senate voted on this bill last year, after full debate, and \nrejected it in favor of a better product. Since that time, the \nconferees have been working on a compromise. In the past week, \nRepublican negotiators made an offer with major new concessions. Was \nthis greeted with a Democrat counteroffer that moved toward the middle? \nNo, it's answered with this attempt to blow up those negotiations. If \nmy colleagues don't want to legislate, if they just want to create \nelection issues, they don't deserve to be here.\n  Let me be specific. Republican negotiators have made an offer to \ntheir Democrat counterparts that would allow lawsuits to be brought if \na health plan has rejected the decision of an independent reviewer and \nthe enrollee has fully utilized the plan's appeal mechanism. Full \neconomic damages could be sought, and punitive damages would be \navailable, subject to limits. Employers, however, would be expressly \nprotected from lawsuits, addressing a key concern of those who provide \ncoverage to workers. These are major, major concessions. That's \nobvious.\n  In my view, this offer reasonably balances the need for fairness to \nconsumers who are wronged with the need to keep health insurance costs \nlow so that employers continue to offer coverage. But it was dismissed \nwithout even a serious response by the other side. If no agreement is \nreached this year, let everyone understand who will be to blame. It is \nthe Democrats who have decided that they're better off with no bill \nthan with a bill.\n  After this stunt fails, I hope that the President and Congressional \nDemocrats will change their obstructionist strategy so that the \nPatients' Bill of Rights can become a reality, this year. In the \nmeantime, I am voting against Senator Kennedy's attempt to short-\ncircuit our legislative process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the nation has been patiently waiting for \nfar too long for Congress to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that will \ngrant American families enrolled in health maintenance organizations \n(HMOs) the health care protections they deserve, including the right to \nremedy insurance disputes through the courts if all other means are \nexhausted.\n  For far too long, achievement of this vital reform has been \nfrustrated by special interest gridlock, principally the trial lawyers \nwho insist on the ability to sue everyone for everything, and the \ninsurance companies who simply want to protect their bottom line, even \nat the expense of fairness. Both sides hope to continue affecting their \nagenda with the ``soft money'' contributions they hand over to the \npolitical parties, while neither represents the hopes, expectations and \nbest interests of the American people.\n  Today's debate is further evidence of how politicized this issue has \nbecome. Once again this debate is being governed by special interests \nand partisan politics. This is no longer a debate about how we can work \ntogether in the best interest of the American people. Nor is this a \ndebate about providing affordable access to quality health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Instead it is a contest--a contest between the political parties and \nspecial interests. This is a contest between the interests of trial \nlawyers versus the interests of insurance companies. This is a contest \nthat no one not Republicans, not Democrats, certainly not the American \npeople wins, except, of course, the special interests who are only \nconcerned about their financial well-being, rather than the physical or \nfinancial well-being of every American. It is a shame that this body is \nso controlled by special interests that we cannot even put the health \nof the American people ahead of politics.\n   Under today's medical system too many Americans feel powerless when \nfaced with a health care crisis in their personal life. Many feel as if \nimportant, life-altering decisions are being micro-managed by business \npeople rather than medical professionals, and too many Americans \nbelieve they have no access to quality care or cannot receive the \nnecessary medical treatment recommended by their personal physician.\n  Many Americans work hard and live on strict budgets so they can \nafford health insurance coverage for their family. Then, the moment \nthey need health care, they are confronted with obstacles limiting \nwhich services are available to them: confronted by frustrating \nbureaucratic hoops; and confronted by health plans that provide little, \nif any, opportunity for patients to redress grievances.\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\n  While I appreciate the important contributions of managed care, we \nmust protect the rights of patients in our nation's health care system. \nToo many Americans feel trapped in a system which does not put their \nhealth care needs first. They believe that HMOs value a paper dollar \nmore than they do a human life. It is time for us to finally help these \nfine Americans and begin working together to get safe, quality health \ncare for Americans.\n  As my colleagues know, last summer I reluctantly voted for the Senate \nversion of the Patients Bill of Rights. At that time I made it known \nthat my vote for passage was contingent on a strong conference \nagreement with a higher standard for protecting the needs of patients \nthan those contained in the Senate bill. I supported the Senate bill \nbecause it was important to move forward and send legislation for \nstrengthening in conference with the House. It was my strong hope that \nthe House would pass stronger, more reasonable health care reform \nsimilar to the Norwood/Dingell legislation that honestly puts the needs \nof patients first. Then we could work together for a practical and fair \ncompromise during conference.\n  Mr. President, I am voting today in support of the proposed Norwood/\nDingell amendment before the Senate because I share the frustration of \nmillions of Americans who are waiting for the conference to begin \nmaking substantial efforts towards reaching a viable agreement \nproviding patient protections. This conference has had more than four \nmonths to work on reaching an agreement and yet they are not even close \nto finding a solution. And I am concerned that once again, partisan \npolitics and special interests are blocking us from enacting meaningful \nhealth care reform for our constituents.\n  It is time for all of us to finally put aside partisanship and the \ninfluence of special interests to work together for what is needed and \nwanted by our constituents-safe, quality, affordable health care. This \nis too important an issue to allow the influence of special interests \nto prevent us from doing what is right for all Americans.\n  While I am supporting this amendment I would like to make clear that \nI believe that there is still work that must be done in conference \nbefore it is enacted into law. I support the intentions of the Norwood/\nDingell bill but there are areas that need to be strengthened and \nimproved before it becomes law, including the liability provisions. \nReal patient protection must permit individuals to resolve insurance \ndisputes through the courts but it must also place common sense limits \non excessive non-economic damage awards and ban punitive judgements \nthat make health care more costly. This must be structured in a manner \nthat does not encourage frivolous law suits, unnecessarily make health \ninsurance more costly or make employers vulnerable for health care \ndecisions they are not making.\n  In addition, I do not support extending U.S. Customs Service user \nfees to pay for this proposal. Before agreeing to this amendment I was \nassured that the extension of the user fees was merely a tactical move \nto help prevent this amendment from being defeated by partisan \nparliamentary procedures. I have been assured that if this amendment \nwere to pass that an alternate means of paying for it--one that does \nnot undermine Customs operations or constrain international commerce--\nwould be incorporated. It is important that US Customs continue having \nadequate funding for conducting their programs including implementing a \nnew automation system for reducing backlogs at ports of entry to help \nfacilitate the dramatic expansion of commerce that has helped fuel our \nstrong economy. Let me reiterate in no way does my vote for strong \npatient protections in any way provide an endorsement for extending \nuser fees and placing a further burden on businesses and our economy.\n  It is my strong hope that today's vote will provide the impetus for \nthe conference to finally work together on finding a viable and real \nsolution for providing Americans with the health care protections they \ndeserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in 1992 and 1993, when Senator Kennedy and \nthe Democrats were trying to raise taxes, which, unfortunately, they \nsucceeded in doing, and when they were trying to have the Government \ntake over the health care system, which, thank God, they failed to do, \nI said people would lose their jobs if they were successful. And they \ndid. Democrats lost their jobs. Not one Republican was defeated as an \nincumbent in 1994. We won nine seats in the Senate. And we are in the \nmajority.\n  Some people did lose their jobs, because Americans did not want the \nGovernment to take over and run the health care system. I say to \nSenator Kennedy that, as sad as I know it makes him, they still don't, \nand they never will.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator a question on my \ntime?\n  Does that stethoscope show any beating hearts over there on that side \nof the aisle?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if I might respond on Senator Kennedy's \ntime, talking slowly as I do, this stethoscope picks up a strong \nheartbeat that believes in freedom, and that believes in the right of \nconsumers--even health care consumers--to fire an HMO rather than call \nin a lawyer or a bureaucrat.\n  That is what we call freedom. That is what we are for.\n  We disagree, and that is what makes democracy work.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask the Senator: Did he conclude his remarks? I am \ngetting ready to move to table.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am prepared to yield whatever time is going to be \nyielded. I am prepared to yield. If Senators reserve some time to \nspeak, I will reserve time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has approximately 1 minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senators Frist, Gramm, \nHutchinson, Enzi, Gregg, and Jeffords for serving on this conference \ncommittee, and also Senator Collins who worked with us on the task \nforce. I also very much appreciate the work they have done today on the \nfloor.\n  If we don't table the Kennedy amendment, there will be millions of \npeople who will be without health insurance. That is because it will \ndramatically increase the price of health care. There are results from \nactions. If we act to open up all health care plans and all employers \nto unlimited liability with punitive damages and class action lawsuits, \nwe are going to have a lot of people dropping health care plans.\n  Those are just the facts.\n  The GAO says there is going to be a 4, 5, or 6-percent increase on \ntop of the 10 or 12 percent that is already occurring. A lot of people \ncan't afford it. They will drop their health care--plus the fact that \nthe Norwood-Dingell bill, and the Kennedy bill they are trying to pass \nright now, have unlimited punitive damages.\n  I have letters from Ford, Wal-Mart, from IBM, big companies with some \nof the best health care plans in America, saying they will cut benefits \nor reduce the benefits to individuals, maybe even drop coverage, if we \npass that bill. We shouldn't do it. We shouldn't do things that will \ncause harm. We should not pass legislation that will increase costs. We \nshould not pass legislation that will increase the number of uninsured \nby 2, 3, or 4 million. That will be a serious mistake.\n  We should give the legislative process a chance to work.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the second vote in the \nseries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3214\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call to my colleagues' attention the fact \nthat the McCain amendment will be a killer amendment to this Defense \nauthorization bill. It will be blue-slipped. I have discussed this with \nChairman Archer. He assured me, after reviewing the way the amendment \nis written, that he will have no choice but to blue-slip it. I also \ndiscussed it with Senator Moynihan from New York. He has concerns about \nthe constitutionality of this revenue amendment being added to the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I want to make that perfectly clear and add to that, this compounds \nour problem. We are dealing with a very important bill, the Defense \nauthorization bill. We are talking about national security. We need to \nfind a way to come to a conclusion. We have 11 appropriations bills \nremaining, and we have to find time to act on the China PNTR and other \nissues.\n  If we continue to work in good faith trying to find a way to get \nvotes on amendments and complete the Defense authorization bill and \nthen we face, on top of everything else, a blue-slip problem in the \nHouse, we have done ourselves damage.\n  I think full disclosure is the way to go. I have been quoted to that \neffect. I still think that is the way to go. There is a bill that has \nbeen drafted, I understand after talking with a number of Senators, \nincluding the chairman of the Finance Committee and others, that would \nachieve this goal and, in fact, would be a broader bill in its \napplication.\n  As this is drawn, I understand it would not apply to a number of \ngroups, including the trial lawyers, Sierra Club, and others. We ought \nto make sure it is broad and applies to everybody. We ought to have \nfull disclosure, and do it so it is not a technical problem on a bill \nsuch as the Defense authorization bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about this very carefully and support \nthe Warner point of order that will be made with regard to the blue-\nslip problem. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has 1 minute.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, very simply, this is a vote on campaign \nfinance reform. The question is whether this body will take the \nopportunity, offered by this amendment, to shine some sunlight on the \nsecret money that these 527 organizations are pouring into our \nelections.\n  Here it is on this chart, in black and white, from the web site of \none of these groups. The contributions can be given in unlimited \namounts. They can be from any source. And they are not political \ncontributions and are not a matter of public record.\n  All this amendment does is make it a matter of public record. The \nAmerican people have a right to demand this information from any \norganization that is given tax exemption.\n  The blue-slip argument is a figleaf. It is an excuse made up for \nthose who oppose reform but have said they support disclosure.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the point of order and for the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, just to repeat, this amendment would \nmandate disclosure of all contributors to, and expenditures by, 527 \norganizations--a new phenomenon in American politics, with unlimited \namounts of money from any source. China, the Mafia, and drug dealers \ncan be part of our political campaigns, and we will never know who they \nare.\n  It affects both parties and all ideologies. For the benefit of my \nfriends on this side of the aisle, it was the Sierra Club that first \nbegan the 527 new gimmick example of corruption in American politics.\n  It will not harm the defense bill. If the defense bill is blue-\nslipped, I will be the first to say that bill, when it comes back, \nshould have no amendments on it, and I would work as hard as I can to \nget it done.\n  Please, do not believe that the defense bill would be harmed or blue-\nslipped. The fact is, every Member on both sides of the aisle of this \nbody has said they are for full disclosure. Now we are going to find \nout whether we are for disclosure or we will continue to allow the \ncorruption of American politics.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to make a constitutional point of \norder.\n  I raise a point of order that the pending McCain amendment violates \nthe U.S. Constitution in that it is clearly a revenue-raising measure \nthat is initiating in the Senate, not the House of Representatives, as \nprovided for in our Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is, Is the \npoint of order well taken?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before I move to proceed to the DOD \nappropriations bill, let me say that we have a problem now with this \namendment, the way the language is written, in terms of a blue slip, if \nand when it gets to the House of Representatives.\n  I have discussed this with Senator Daschle and Senator McCain and \nothers who are concerned about the underlying Defense authorization \nbill and those who are concerned about the disclosure amendment.\n  During the period of time that we are going to be working on the DOD \nappropriations bill, we will work to see if we can come up with some \nsort of agreement or some sort of procedure that would get this \namendment off of the Defense authorization bill and onto some other \nbill--perhaps some revenue bill that we will have before us; perhaps \neven the repeal of the telephone tax that the House has acted on; and \nalso give us an opportunity to work with Senator McCain and others to \nsee if we can broaden the application.\n  But, for now, we need to go ahead and proceed with the DOD \nappropriations bill. We will work together to see if we can find a way \nto resolve this issue.\n  Does the Senator from Arizona have any comment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for pursuing \nthis issue. I would like to broaden it as well. I think it is a fair \nagreement. I would like to try to move forward, meanwhile, having \nadopted this amendment, and the President to sign the bill.\n  I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of this \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act. Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin, along with the entire committee, have my deepest thanks for \ntheir tremendous work with respect to this country's national defense. \nTheir hard work and dedication on behalf of our servicemen and women is \nevident throughout the entire Act. Senator Warner, in particular, has \nbeen instrumental in bringing to the floor a bill that provides our \ncountry with the national defense it desperately needs and deserves.\n  To the Committee's credit, this Act continues the trend, begun with \nlast year's Authorization Bill, of providing a real increase in the \nauthorized level of defense spending. The Committee has once again \nrecognized that people are the most important aspect of our military \nand our troops must be treated accordingly. This Act authorizes, among \nother things, a well-deserved 3.7 percent pay raise for military \npersonnel, important quality of life provisions, and addresses several \nimportant health care concerns to ensure our active-duty and retired \npersonnel have the medical care they justly deserve.\n  Mr. President, although people make our military the best in the \nworld, our troops must have the superior equipment to ensure continued \nsuccess in every conflict. We must not send our sons and daughters into \nwar without the right tools for victory. To this end, I would like to \nthank Senator Warner specifically for his support of a very important \nproject--the extended-range conventional air-launched cruise missile \nproject (CALCM-ER). In addition to Senator Warner, I would also like to \nthank Senator Bond, Senator Conrad, Senator Landrieu, and Senator \nBreaux for their work in support of this important project, in the \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  The Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missile, or CALCM, is a \nconverted nuclear cruise missile that is launched from a B-52. This \ninvaluable weapon is the Air Force's only conventional air-launched, \nlong-range, all-weather precision weapon. Fired more than 600 nautical \nmiles from its target, this missile can strike strategic targets deep \ninside enemy territory without significant risk to our pilots or \nplanes.\n  General Mike Ryan, the Air Force Chief of Staff, praised the CALCM's \ninvaluable capabilities when he said in a written statement dated \nFebruary 10, 2000 that ``CALCM continues to be the Commander in Chief's \nfirst strike weapon of choice during contingency operations, as \ndemonstrated by its superb performance during Operations Desert Fox and \nAllied Force.''\n  Due to the weapon's great performance and subsequent heavy demand, \nthe number of CALCMs in the Air Force inventory dwindled to below 70 \nlast year. Through continued conversion of the nuclear cruise missiles, \nthe current number is around 200, but the Air Force has concluded that \nthis is simply not enough to meet our military's need. And due to the \nlimited number of convertible nuclear cruise missiles, the Air Force \nneeded to search out additional avenues of creating an extended range \ncruise missile with similar capabilities of the CALCM.\n  Mr. President, the Air Force has identified a suitable solution. In a \nstudy commissioned in last year's Defense Authorization bill to deal \nwith this problem, a commission concluded that, and I quote, ``Of \nspecific interest to the Air Force is the need for an extended range \ncruise missile in the midterm that would be a modification to an \nexisting cruise missile in the inventory. This option meets the Air \nForce's two-fold requirement of increasing the inventory of cruise \nmissiles as quickly as possible and providing an extended range missile \ncapability to protect our aging bomber force from current and mid-term \nthreats while long range cruise missile requirements are studied.''\n  In order to see these conclusions become a reality, I, together with \nSenators Bond, Conrad, Landrieu, and Breaux, have worked to see the \naddition of $86.1 million in the Air Force's Research and Development \naccount for the extended range conventional air-launched cruise missile \nprogram. The Armed Services Committee has graciously agreed with us and \nauthorized this amount in the Defense Authorization Act--and I thank \nthe Committee, and particularly Senator Warner, for their assistance.\n  In the upcoming Defense Appropriations bill, Senator Stevens has been \nparticularly understanding of the Air Force's need of the Extended \nRange Cruise Missile and has worked with me to provide appropriations \nfor this program. I want to offer him a personal thanks for his support \nof this vital program. I truly appreciate his efforts.\n  However, I have been informed that in order to start the process and \nsee these important weapons are in the hands of our troops, additional \nfunds will be needed. In order to rectify this problem, I plan on \noffering an amendment to increase the available funds for the Extended \nRange Cruise Missile program by $23 million so that work can begin on \nthe new cruise missile. This will bring the total amount to $43 \nmillion, which is half of the authorized amount and enough to start \ndevelopment on this important missile.\n  Mr. President, again I want to thank Senator Warner and Senator \nStevens for their continued and tireless service to our nation's \ndefense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4809-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4809-S4810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4576) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, for the information of Members, we will \nhave opening statements, and then we will have an amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n  On behalf of the leader, I make this statement. We are now on the DOD \nappropriations bill. After our opening statements, Senator Grassley is \nprepared to talk about his accounting amendment. We expect to have a \nvote at 9:30 on that amendment tomorrow morning. There will no more \nvotes for the remainder of the day.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my great friend, Senator Inouye, \nin presenting the Defense appropriations bill to the Senate. This bill \nis for the fiscal year 2001. It represents the twelfth bill we have \njointly brought before the Senate: Six were presented by my friend from \nHawaii during the period of time when he was the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, and now this is the sixth bill presented by me during the \nsecond opportunity I have had to chair this subcommittee.\n  First and foremost, the bill reported by our committee, in our \nopinion, meets all personnel, readiness, training, and quality-of-life \npriorities for the armed services.\n  We have fully funded the pay raise and new authorized recruiting and \nretention benefits. All estimated costs of contingency operations for \n2001 in Kosovo, Bosnia, and southwest Asia are included in our \nrecommendation. There should not be an emergency supplemental for known \ncontingency operations in the year 2001 for the Department of Defense.\n  The bill before the Senate sustains and augments the efforts to \naccelerate modernization of our Armed Forces.\n  Significantly, the recommendation provides an additional $250 million \nfor the Army's transformation initiative.\n  I join my friend from Hawaii in commending General Shinseki for his \nforesight and leadership in moving the Army forward into a more \ndeployable global force. These funds should accelerate the fielding of \nthe initial transformation brigades in 2001.\n  Our committee, consistent with the Defense authorization bill as \npresented to the Senate, adds funds for several missile defense \nprograms. Mr. President, $139 million is added for the national missile \ndefense research and development, $92.4 million for the airborne laser, \nand $60 million for the Navy theaterwide missile defense efforts.\n\n  This is the crossroads year for missile defense. These funds are \nconsistent with the recommendations and priorities of General Kadish, \nwho manages this program, for the fiscal year 2001.\n  A new initiative recommended in this bill is to transfer funding for \nthe C-17 program to a new national defense airlift fund.\n  Several years ago, funding for sealift acquisition was transferred to \na central account. Airlift is a key strategic capability. The need for \nthat is shared by all military services. Funding for airlift should not \nbe borne solely by the Air Force, just as funding for sealift is not \nnow borne by the Navy.\n  Full funding is provided in this new account for 12 C-17 aircraft \nrequested for 2001, and the advance procurement and interim contract \nlogistics support submitted in the budget.\n  The bill presented by the subcommittee includes report language that \ndirects the Department to proceed with the current acquisition strategy \nto select a single design based upon the flight test program.\n  The Joint Strike Fighter might be the single most important defense \nprogram this committee will consider in the next 10 years. We must get \nthis one right. Industrial base concerns should only be addressed after \nwe are sure we have selected the best aircraft at the best cost for the \nmission and not before we even select the winner of the competition.\n  When the committee met to report the bill, several Members raised \nwith me the subcommittee's recommendation to defer full funding on the \ntwo LPD-17 class vessels requested in the budget.\n  The bill before us includes $200 million in advance appropriations \nfor the two ships originally planned for fiscal year 2001. Also, it \nincludes $285 million to pay for cost overruns incurred on the first \nfour ships.\n  I want to restate, as I have in both Maine and Louisiana in the past \nweek, my personal commitment to the LPD-17 program. The focus of the \nadjustment we recommend is to get the program back on track with a \nstable design and address prior year problems. The funds provided are \nintended to assure that there will be no interruption in the work at \nthe two shipyards and no additional delay in construction or delivery \nof the ships.\n  At the markup, language was added by Senator Cochran and Senator \nSnowe to permit the Navy to sign contracts for both ships using the \nfunds appropriated by this bill. We have approved that recommendation. \nSo there is no reason to say this bill in any way slows up the process \nof procuring these new ships.\n  Finally, the recommendation provides $137 million for the new medical \nbenefits included in the Senate-reported defense authorization bill. \nThese efforts provide a new pharmacy benefit for military retirees. \nThey are fully consistent with the objectives outlined by General \nShelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, in his testimony before our \ncommittee.\n  The new medical benefit package adopted during consideration of the \ndefense bill does not require additional discretionary appropriations \nfor the fiscal year 2001.\n  It is our intention to work closely with the authorizing committees \nand with the Department of Defense to ensure that any new benefits are \nfully funded in the years to come. If a commitment is made under our \nwatch, it is going to be kept.\n  These improvements will come at considerable cost and will be an \nimportant element of future defense budget planning. This is really \nwhat the Senator from Nebraska was talking about, the oncoming \nimportant costs we must face. The definition of those costs is the \nproblem so far.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to look at this bill as a whole. It is \npackaged together. It really is a bill we have worked on. I do commend \nour staffs, our joint staffs, under Steve Cortese, who is with me, and \nCharlie Houy is with Senator Inouye.\n  This bill once again is a bill that I think, as I said in the \nbeginning, will meet our needs with the funds that are available this \nyear. The allocation for defense is roughly $1 billion less than the \namount made available by the Senate version of the defense \nauthorization bill. It is about $1 billion below the allocation for the \nHouse-passed bill now before the Senate.\n  Some of these issues have to be sorted out in conference with the \nHouse. I ask the patience of the Senate as we work to get the best \npossible package to the conference.\n  I call the attention of the Senate to the fact that we have several \nissues in the bill that are also pending before the conference on the \nmilitary construction bill because of the supplemental that was already \npassed by the House.\n  The committee has closely followed the Senate's actions on the \ndefense authorization bill so far this week. We intend to offer a \nmanagers' package of conforming amendments during consideration of this \nbill to accommodate the Senate's action on the bill.\n  To that concern, I ask all Members of the Senate, if you have \namendments to offer, please notify Senator Inouye or me as soon as \npossible. We can probably work out most of them. We hope we will be \nable to do so because our bill closely tracks the defense authorization \nbill. It tracks the priorities outlined by the military chiefs in their\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\ntestimony before the committee, and it certainly tracks fully our \nunderstanding of the House version that was passed by the other body \njust recently.\n  Mr. President, I now recognize our distinguished ranking member, the \nSenator from Hawaii, and once again call to the attention of the Senate \nthe great honor that will come to him in just a few days; that is, the \nhonor of receiving his Medal of Honor which he should have received a \nlong time ago. It is a privilege to serve with my friend from Hawaii.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. May I first thank my chairman for his most generous \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, I begin by congratulating Chairman Stevens for the \nsuperb manner in which he has guided this bill through the committees \nto the floor.\n  I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my dear friend and \nchairman of the committee, Senator Stevens. I suggest to my colleagues \nthat this is a good measure, worthy of support by all of us. I join my \nchairman in requesting that our colleagues submit their amendments in a \ntimely fashion.\n  I note that this measure--a measure that includes $287.6 billion; the \nlargest ever considered by this Senate--was unanimously approved by the \nCommittee on Appropriations by a vote of 28-0.\n  It will do a great deal for both our readiness and moderniation \nrequirements to protect our nation's security.\n  Highlights include:\n  For our military personnel and their families: It provides full \nfunding for military pay including a 3.7 percent pay raise; an increase \nof $153 million for military bonuses to improve recruiting and \nretention; and increases for the GI bill for Reservists.\n  The subcommittee has fully funded readiness programs, including: $4.1 \nbillion to support our peacekeepers overseas; an increase of $183 \nmillion for our National guard; and a total increase of $4.5 billion \nfor readiness from the levels provided in FY 2000.\n  Full funding is also recommended for the new prescription drug \nbenefit as authorized; and $275 million is recommended for breast and \nprostate cancer research.\n  Critical investment highlights include the following: Full funding \nfor our F-22 and F/A-18 fighters; an increase of $250 million for the \nArmy's highest priority, ``transformation''; full funding for the \nNavy's carrier, submarines, and destroyers; and, an increase of $411 \nmillion for ballistic missile defense programs.\n  However, Senators should be advised that the bill does not provide a \nblank check to the Pentagon.\n  It includes some tough reductions to programs that are being \nschedule, over budget, or simply not ready to proceed at this time.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that the No. 1 priority in this bill \nis to protect near-term readiness.\n  The men and women willing to go into harm's way to protect the rest \nof us simply must be provided the tools they need to defeat any threat.\n  At the same time, the bill provides sufficient funding for \nmodernization programs so that future readiness will also be protected. \nWe must continue to invest for the future to ensure we are never caught \nunprepared.\n  I would also like to point out that the Chairman has been very \nresponsive to the wishes of the members. Many of the suggestions made \nby the Members of the Senate have been incorporated into bill.\n  This is a very good bill. I strongly encourage all my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3278\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent all after the enacting clause be \nstricken of the pending bill and the text of S. 2593, as reported by \nour committee, be inserted and that amendments then be considered as \noriginal text for the purpose of further amendments, being designated \namendment No. 3278.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator could withhold, we need to \ntake a look at the unanimous consent request which was just accepted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did not waive any points of order. It is my \nunderstanding that the original text of this bill is nevertheless \nsubject to points of order under rule XVI.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3279\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3279.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Section 8106 of the Department of Defense \n     Appropriations Act, 1997 (titles I through VIII of the matter \n     under subsection 101(b) of Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat. \n     3009-111, 10 U.S.C. 113 note) shall continue in effect to \n     apply to disbursements that are made by the Department of \n     Defense in fiscal year 2001.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment pertains to Department of \nDefense (DOD) disbursements.\n  It requires DOD to match certain disbursements with obligations prior \nto payment.\n  This policy has been incorporated in the last six appropriations \nacts: Fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.\n  Each year we have ratcheted down the threshold.\n  The threshold is the dollar amount of the disbursement that must be \nmatched with its corresponding obligation.\n  We started at the $5 million level.\n  Under current law, the threshold is now set at 500,000.00 dollars.\n  In 1999, the Senate voted to lower the threshold from $1 million to \nthe current level.\n  Both the DOD Inspector General and the General Accounting Office have \nrepeatedly stated that policy is a good idea.\n  It is helping the department to control the flow of money.\n  First, it is an important internal control procedure. It is a first-\nline of defense against fraudulent payments.\n  If a corresponding obligation cannot be identified, the payment \ncannot be made. It is as simple as that.\n  Second, it is helping the department avoid ``problem disbursements'' \nor unmatched disbursements.\n  A few years ago, the department had unmatched disbursements totaling \nabout 50 billion dollars. This situation created gaping holes in DOD's \nbooks of account.\n  And these gaping holes in the books of account are one big reason why \nDOD consistently fails to earn a ``clean'' opinion in the annual CFO \naudits.\n  Those are the audits required by the Chief Financial Officers Act.\n  And third, it is helping the department avoid overobligations, that \nis, making payments in excess of available funding.\n  This year I am recommending that the threshold be retained at the \ncurrent level of 500,000.00 dollars.\n  The General Accounting Office needs to do more audit follow-up work \nbefore the threshold is lowered any further.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking minority member for supporting \nthis policy and urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I should ask the chairman of the committee if he wants to order a \nrollcall at this point because it is my understanding he wanted a \nrollcall vote on it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, that is our \nintent. I want to take this time to congratulate the Senator from Iowa \nfor once again raising the issue of proper accounting procedures for \nthe Department of Defense. As we have in the past, I suggest it is a \nmatter for the Senate to express their opinion about and support the \nendeavors of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a minute, hopefully for the \npurpose of influencing the conferees on a vote that was taken \nyesterday--it passed overwhelmingly--having to do with military retiree \nbenefits.\n  There are two amendments, one offered by Senator Warner, one offered \nby Senator Johnson. I appreciate the intent of both amendments and I \nappreciate very much, as well, the concerns both Senators and everybody \nwho voted for both of those amendments have for military retirees, \nespecially as far as it might improve our capacity to recruit and \nretain people in the Armed Forces. I think it is a legitimate concern, \nand I appreciate very much that concern being expressed yesterday, \nespecially being expressed with affirmative votes, although, as I said, \nI voted against both of those amendments.\n  I did not, during the debate yesterday, offer the reasons I voted \nagainst it, and I want to do that now. Both amendments are essentially \ndealing with the same situation; that is, once you reach the age of 65, \nyou go off the TRICARE system and you go onto Medicare, as most \nindividuals do who work for other businesses as well who end up with \nhealth care. It is not unusual today for people to leave employment to \ngo onto Medicare after their retirement from employment.\n  But one amendment would allow people to buy into TRICARE; Senator \nJohnson's amendment would allow them to buy as well into the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program with a full taxpayer-paid subsidy; \none was $4.5 billion a year, the other was about $5.5 billion a year. \nSenator Warner's, in order to be able to get it in the budget, has it \nsunsetting after 2 years. It only goes for 2 years. I presume if it \nbecomes law, we will have to extend it every couple of years.\n\n  There is a budget issue here that causes me to vote no. The budget \nissue has to do, first of all, with I think an inadequate amount of \nstudy given to who needs this and who does not need this. It was \ndeveloped fairly quickly. It was offered fairly quickly. I think it \nshould have been examined much more carefully, what the impact was \ngoing to be, what the real need is, what the real demand is out there; \nespecially the second concern I have, which is that it adds to one of \nthe biggest problems we have with our current budget, and that is the \ngrowing share of our budget that is going over to mandatory spending.\n  The checkpoint for Senator Johnson's amendment was people who were \nenlisted prior to 1957. In 1957, over 70 percent of our budget was \nappropriated; 70 percent of our budget went to such things as the GI \nbill and other kinds of investments. I benefited enormously from those \ninvestments, not just as a veteran myself, but it was most important \nfor my own parents' generation. That is what they were doing. They were \nendowing their future. They were really investing in their future as a \nconsequence of those appropriations.\n  This year, 66 percent of the budget is mandatory. This amendment that \nwas put on the Defense authorization bill will make that problem worse. \nI could not in good faith vote for the amendment as a consequence of \nthose two concerns, even though I recognize for some veterans, some \nemployees, this is a problem.\n  Also, I want to comment on some of the things that were said during \nthe debate. I want to comment, especially from the point of view of \nmyself because I am military retired. I am one of the retirees who \nwould benefit from this change in the law. I am service-connected \ndisabled as a result of an injury in the war in Vietnam, and I have \nbeen receiving a military retirement check since I left the Navy in \n1969.\n  I understand the recruiting difficulties. I understand we have to be \ncompetitive with the private sector. I understand we have a volunteer \nservice today, and so forth. I think it has all been very well said. \nBut focusing on money in this debate, we underestimate and \nunderemphasize the importance of people joining our service because \nthey are patriotic, because they love their country, because they want \nto serve their country in some meaningful way, because they believe \nservice makes them better, they believe putting themselves on the line \nfor somebody else isn't something that is just good for the other \nperson, it is good for them as well. That was the benefit for me in my \nservice.\n  Though I appreciate very much people coming and saying my country \nowes me something, I reject that idea. My country owes me nothing. If \nthe Congress of this Nation wants to provide me with retirement, wants \nto provide me with medical assistance--they provided me with the GI \nbill and COLAs all these years--they have given me enormous benefits. \nThey gave me a hospital I could go to, to get my care. I appreciate all \nthat. I am grateful for all that. It makes me more patriotic than I was \nbefore.\n  But I do not believe as a consequence of my service that the people \nof the United States of America owe me anything. I want to make that \npoint because I entered the service because it was my duty. I entered \nthe service because I believed it was the right thing to do. I entered \nthe service because I thought I was going to get something intangible \nout of it--and I did. I learned how to lead, learned how to take \nresponsibility, learned how to do lots of things. And I learned as well \nwhat it is like to be injured, what it is like to be injured in a \nnation that takes care of its veterans, that provides care. I learned \nwhat it is to suffer a little bit and to feel compassion for other \npeople as they go through their lives and suffer as a consequence of \nthings that were unforeseen, unexpected, unanticipated, and \nunavoidable.\n\n  I have talked to a lot of colleagues on the floor during this debate. \nThey said: Oh, gosh, we can't say no to our veterans, can't say no to \nour military retirees.\n  There are times we can. I believe, especially when we think about the \nbudget impact that these amendments are going to have, there are times \nwhen we should. I do not believe we should fall into the trap of \nbelieving that men and women will not still join the Armed Forces of \nthe United States of America because they love this country and they \nwant to serve.\n  Yes, we need to have good pensions. Yes, we need to make certain they \nare not getting food stamps. Yes, we need to take care of them when \nthey are in. But let them serve as a consequence of feeling loyal, \nfeeling good about their country, and wanting to put themselves on the \nline. Let service, all by itself, be one of the motivating factors, be \none of the reasons that men and women do it. And be grateful for that \nand reward it, applaud it, pay attention to it.\n  I wish, in fact, people in Hollywood as they make decisions about \nwhat they are going to put on television, what they are going to put in \nmovie theaters, told more of the stories of the men and women who are \nserving today not because they are being paid well, not because there \nare health care benefits promised, not because of a retirement program \nwaiting for them, but because they love their country, because they \nfeel a patriotic desire to serve the United States of America, serve \nthe people of the United States of America and the cause of freedom for \nwhich we stand.\n  It is not a cliche; it is a real thing. I am concerned, concerned \nwith some of the debate I heard yesterday, that only the pecuniary \ninterests were involved; that all we had to do was get the pay high \nenough, retirement benefits high enough, health care benefits high \nenough, and we would solve all of our problems.\n  We will not solve all of our problems if that is what we do. If we do \nnot recognize that one of the reasons people serve is that they love \ntheir country, A, we will find ourselves falling short of recruitment \nand retention objectives, but, in addition to that, we will not know \nwhen the correct time is to say to that man or woman who served their \ncountry: We have to make certain we have enough money in our budget to \ninvest in our children and their future as well.\n  We cannot, as we are doing, simply put more and more money in people \nover the age of 65. I love them. They\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nhave served their country. They are the greatest generation ever. But \nthis action comes on top of eliminating the earnings test, which was a \n$22 billion proposal over 10. I voted for that. There were 100 of us on \nthis floor who voted for that. It was a reasonable thing to do. But if \nyou look at the diminishing amount of money we invest every single year \nthrough our appropriations accounts, and you look at that trend \ncontinuing to go further and further down, it gets harder and harder to \nsay we are endowing our future the way our parents endowed the future \nfor us.\n  Mr. President, I did not want anybody to suffer the illusion that I \ndo not care about our military retirees. I do. There were good fiscal \nreasons why not to support the amendment, but I hope as we go into \nconference we do not get lulled into thinking the only thing we have to \ndo to recruit and retain people in our Armed Forces is to provide some \npecuniary reimbursement that enables them to feel they are getting \nrewarded in some way that is competitive with what they can get in the \nmarketplace. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am glad to hear the Senator's \nstatement. I inform my friend, I spent a substantial portion of the day \ndiscussing how to meet the problems associated with the feelings of so \nmany people in the military that there were, in fact, substantial \ncommitments made that lead on into the future as enormous costs as \ncompared to the costs of the past.\n  We need to have a commission of some kind. I hope after the Senator \nsteps down from this body that he might see fit to be one who will help \ntake on the task of defining the commitments that were made and how we \nfulfill them. I say that because in the past, many of those benefits \nwere paid out of the Veterans Affairs Department from veterans \nbenefits. They are now coming from the Defense funds, and if they grow \nat the rate it appears they are going to grow, they are going to \nseriously hamper our ability to modernize our force and our systems and \ndefend our country as it must be in this century.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments. There is no \nquestion that should be a very big concern of the conferees because \nSenator Warner yesterday, when we were debating this issue, expressed \nhis understanding that this would increase the requirement to build \nadditional military hospitals and military health care facilities. This \nwill shift the burden of paying for health care from Medicare over to \nthe Defense budget.\n  There is no question that is the case. I say to the Senator, I \nremember talking to my recruiter very well. I remember the day I sat in \nfront of a Navy recruiter and he said to me: Join the Navy; see the \nworld. He made all kinds of promises to me. I have not sued my \nGovernment because they did not give me a chance to see the world.\n  I believe the Senator is right. There were some legitimate written \npromises made, and if there were legitimate written promises that were \nmade, then we ought to make certain we keep those commitments.\n  Sometimes it becomes much more a political rhetoric than it becomes \nreality. I do think, whether it is a veteran or whether it is some \nother American, one of the hardest things for us to do when somebody \nasks us for something is to say no. The Senator from Alaska has had to \ndo that many times in his career in the Senate. ``I want some of the \ntaxpayers' money to do something'' and the Senator has had to \nrepeatedly say no.\n  It is not easy to do that. It is too easy for us to get caught up, \nwhen we talk about making sure we take care of our retirees, in the \nfeeling that you just cannot say no.\n  I argue that the answer is you can say no, and there are times you \nneed to say no. If you do not say no, it is going to be difficult for \nus to keep our force modernized and weapons systems modernized and our \npeople who are in the services well paid.\n  Again, I say to my friend, the thing I fear--and I will say it \ndirectly--is we have a declining number of people who have been in the \nservices in the Congress. I am very much aware it is easy to say: Gee, \nI have to do this; I wasn't in the service, I have to do this.\n  I had to say I did not join the Navy because they promised me health \ncare benefits, retirement benefits, and promised me I could go to \nschool on the GI bill. That was not the contract. It was all there.\n  People say: We owe you. No. I have a bigger debt to my country than \nmy country has to me. It is a very important attitude for us to instill \nnot just in our young people but retirees as well. We have to be very \ncareful that in doing something we do not undercut the most important \nreason men and women come into the Armed Forces. We ought to praise \nthem. We ought to recognize that and not forget it is still a very big \nreason people serve.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again I thank the Senator. His statement \nreflects the comments I made in the meetings today. I do hope we can \naddress this subject. I find it odd that many of the people who are \nraising the issues and talking about the commitments that were made in \nthe war in which Senator Inouye and I served were not alive then, but \nthey are telling us what the commitments were. We ought to make certain \nwe fulfill all of those commitments, but we have to have a definition \nof what they really were.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last weekend, a new report was released by \nthe Justice Department about the successes of the Brady Law. The Brady \nLaw requires that a prospective gun purchaser undergo a criminal \nbackground check before obtaining any firearm from a federal firearms \nlicensee. The law is intended to prevent felons, fugitives, domestic \nabusers, and other prohibited persons from gaining access to guns. The \nnew information brought the number of purchase rejections up to more \nthan half a million since enactment of the Brady Law in 1994.\n  According to the report, the number one reason for rejection was \nbecause the applicant either had a felony conviction or was under \nfelony indictment. Of the approximately 200,000 purchase rejections in \n1999, almost three-quarters, or 150,000 were denied for this reason. \nThe second most common cause for rejection was a domestic violence \nmisdemeanor conviction or restraining order, accounting for \napproximately 13% of rejections or 27,000 applications. Other \napplicants were denied the ability to purchase guns because of fugitive \nstatus, mental illness or disability, drug addiction, or state or local \nprohibition. In total, in 1999 alone, the Brady Law kept more than \n200,000 guns off the streets and out of the hands of prohibited \npurchasers.\n  The Brady Act has been effective but its success has been undermined \nby a loophole in the law that allows criminals to purchase guns from \nnon-licensed sellers. That loophole allows felons, fugitives or other \nprohibited persons to purchase guns at gun shows without undergoing \nbackground checks. It is a loophole often exploited by those with \nobjectionable backgrounds, some of whose applications have already been \nrejected by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies.\n  Congress made significant strides to reduce the level of gun violence \nby enacting the Brady Act, but now it's time to finish the job. \nCongress must close the gunshow loophole, otherwise the successes of \nBrady are weakened. As a reporter in my home state of Michigan said \nyesterday, ``the same statistics that demonstrate the usefulness of the \nbackground checks that have been in place since passage of the Brady \nbill cry out for closure of the loopholes that allow criminals turned \naway by licensed dealers to purchase guns with impunity elsewhere.''\n  I urge Congress to close the gun show loophole and stop undermining \nlaw enforcement's ability to keep guns off the\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nstreets and out of the hands of dangerous criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4814-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I recently had the honor to serve \nas national co-chair, along with Senator Byron Dorgan, of the National \nSelection Committee for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. This \nwonderful program, sponsored in partnership by The Prudential Insurance \nCompany of America and the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, recognizes outstanding young volunteers at the state and \nnational level. Two state winners, one high school student and one \nmiddle school student, receive a $1,000 scholarship, a silver \nmedallion, and a 4-day all expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. for \nthemselves and their parents.\n  Chairing the National Selection Committee was both an eye-opening and \na heart-warming experience. Reading about these young people's \nvolunteer efforts, the remarkable sacrifices they made for the benefit \nof their communities, and the lessons they learned reaffirmed my faith \nin the generosity of the American spirit and in our future. I would \nlike to commend Maine's two Spirit of Community award winners, Desirae \nPlourde of Fort Kent and Zachary Growe of Hampden, for being real \nAmerican heroes.\n  Desirae, a senior at Fort Kent Community High School, has spent over \n1,500 hours serving as a sign language interpreter for a hearing-\nimpaired classmate who plays on her school's basketball, baseball, and \nsoccer teams. Desirae, the only other student who knows sign language, \nattended a game one day and noticed how her friend struggled to \nunderstand her coach and fellow players, and how frustrated the team \nbecame when trying to communicate. She offered to interpret for him so \nthat he could continue to play sports, and the school could benefit \nfrom his athletic talent. ``I was inspired to help because I saw my \nfriend was in need and how much he loved playing the game,'' Desirae \nsaid. ``I share in his joy when he makes a great play and when the team \nwins.''\n  Zachary, an eighth grader at Reeds Brook Middle School in Hampden, \nhelped coordinate a campaign that collected 800 used books for needy \nchildren. Zach says he enjoys reading so much that he can't imagine not \nowning a book. When his class decided to plan a service project, he \npushed for a book drive. Zach and his fellow students wrote a plan and \na time line, contacted school officials, designed promotional signs, \nand decorated book drop boxes. In the end, the drive yielded more than \nfour times its original goal of 200 books. Zach and the group delivered \nthe books to many area organizations including a local pediatric ward, \nand the local chapter of United Cerebral Palsy.\n  I am very proud of Maine's two honorees, Desirae and Zach, and \ncongratulate them for answering the call of service and making a real \ndifference in their communities.\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to tell \nyou about some wonderful kids. Recently, two youth volunteers from each \nstate, including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, came to \nWashington, D.C. with their parents. They were being recognized at the \nFifth Annual Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their \noutstanding acts of community service.\n  These kids are heroes. They set the example of selflessness and \ncaring for others to follow and it was truly inspiring to hear their \nstories of service to the public and their communities. I was honored \nto serve as co-chair of the National Selection Committee along with \nSenator Susan Collins.\n  Ten students were chosen as National Honorees--five high school and \nfive middle school students--and each received $5,000, a gold medallion \nand a crystal trophy for their school. The ten honorees will also have \na total of $250,000 in toys and clothing dedicated to needy children in \ntheir names.\n  I'd especially like to congratulate the two volunteers chosen as \nfinalists from my state of North Dakota: Jason Koth of Grand Forks and \nScot Miller of Fargo.\n  Jason, a senior at Grand Forks Red River High School, wrote, produced \nand directed a play to raise funds for the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It \nwas called ``The Sun in My Eyes'' and he wrote this play in memory of \nhis handicapped brother. Jason said, ``I wanted to tell people to stop \nfighting over unimportant things and start opening their eyes to the \nbeautiful people that surround them.'' His play raised over $1,300 for \nthe foundation and helped send a terminally ill child on his dream trip \nto Disney World.\n  Scot, a ninth grader at Discovery Junior High in Fargo, became \ninvolved in several volunteer projects to help his community. When he \nlearned that the public library needed donations to complete its \nexpansion plan, Scot led a recycling drive to raise money and created \nan ongoing recycling program in his neighborhood. He is also president \nof his school's Builder's Club, a student organization dedicated to \npromoting volunteer efforts within his community. During his summer \nmonths, Scot spends four hours a day volunteering as a junior \nrecreation leader for the local parks department.\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\n  I'm so proud of Jason and Scot. They should feel great pride for \ntheir hard work and the impact they have made in their communities and \nthe lives of others. Their efforts are truly inspiring.\n  Mr. President, Senator Collins and I would like to honor all 104 \nPrudential Spirit of Community Honorees by reading their names in the \nRecord.\n  The ten students selected as National Honorees are:\n  Linda Arnade, 17, of Palm Bay, Florida, who discovered that septic \ntanks in her community were causing groundwater contamination after \ntesting more than 400 residential wells. She then launched an education \nand monitoring program to alert the public of this important health and \nenvironment risk.\n  Brett Byrd, 13, of Camas, Washington, who helped raise more than \n$100,000 in his mother's memory for breast cancer prevention by \nperforming concerts along with his brother and their rock band.\n  Megan Doherty, 16, of Lemont, Illinois, who raised more than $56,000 \nto bring 29 young cancer victims of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster \nto her town for life-saving medical treatment.\n  Marcus Houston, 18 of Denver, Colorado, who developed an educational \nprogram called ``Just Say Know'' that teaches middle level students \nwhat it takes to achieve academic, social and athletic success in high \nschool.\n  Andrew Leary, 17, of Vernon, New Jersey, who led a two-and-a-half \nyear effort to establish the first permanent soup kitchen in the \nnorthern part of his rural county. He also helped raise $35,000 to \noperate the facility.\n  Joshua Marcus, 13, of Boca Raton, Florida, who created ``Sack It To \nYou,'' a non-profit corporation that has provided backpacks filled with \nschool supplies to more than 2,500 needy children.\n  Jarrett Mynear, 11, of Nicholasville, Kentucky, who raised more than \n$18,000 to distribute new toys each week to young patients at a \nchildren's hospital. Since the program started, Jarrett has been \nfeatured on many local television shows, as well as the nationally \nsyndicated ``Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' to promote his cause.\n  Shelarese Ruffin, 17, of Atlanta, Georgia, who developed an \nintervention program that enables middle and high school students to \nconfront and overcome drug abuse and other discipline problems instead \nof being expelled from school.\n  Danielle Shimotakahara, 13, of North Bend, Oregon, who waged a high-\nprofile campaign to remove violent coin-operated games from places \nwhere children congregate in her town. She also testified at a U.S. \nSenate hearing on the effects of violent games on children.\n  Sagen Woolery, 12, of Warner Robins, Georgia, who started a summer \nmeal service called ``The Kid's Kitchen'' for needy children and their \nfamilies. The service, operated completely by 8-to-12 year-olds, has \nserved more than 3,200 people in her community and also provides \ntoiletries and school supplies for needy children who come to the \nkitchen.\n\nThe state honorees are:\n  Jose Alvarez--Puerto Rico.\n  Sarah Anderson--South Dakota.\n  Meredith Arensman--Kentucky.\n  Linda Arnade--Florida.\n  Sarah Austin--Maryland.\n  Shannon Babb--Utah.\n  Beau Ballinger--Wyoming.\n  Jason Blau--Illinois.\n  Katie Bolenbaugh--Minnesota.\n  Milton Boyd--District of Columbia.\n  Alsion Brown--Colorado.\n  James Buck--Maryland.\n  Sara Bulaga--Vermont.\n  Brett Byrd--Washington.\n  Kevin Cable--Tennessee.\n  Jonathan Cheek--Virginia.\n  Reid Coggins--South Carolina.\n  John Coiner--West Virginia.\n  Kendyl Collins--New Mexico.\n  Dennis Cordova--New Mexico.\n  Maria Cruz--Puerto Rico.\n  Kalila Dalton--Kansas.\n  Dana Davis--Tennessee.\n  Danielle Devlin--New Jersey.\n  Kimberly Dickard--Mississippi.\n  Katherine Dillon--Kansas.\n  Megan Doherty--Ilinois.\n  Tanya Ewing--Alaska.\n  Caroline Faflak--South Dakota.\n  D.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe faculty, staff, and students at Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia, \nKentucky.\n  First, I extend sincere thanks for the graciousness and hospitality \nshown during my visit to Lindsey Wilson College for the May 13, 2000 \nCommencement. It was an honor to address the faculty and graduating \nstudents at such a fine Kentucky institution, and I sincerely \nappreciate the opportunity.\n  Located on a southcentral Kentucky hilltop, Lindsey Wilson College is \na four-year liberal arts college affiliated with the Kentucky \nConference of the United Methodist Church. It began in 1903, as a \ntraining school for Vanderbilt University, then became a two-year \ncollege in 1923, and started offering a four-year degree program in \n1986. Lindsey Wilson's diverse student body is comprised of individuals \nfrom 89 Kentucky counties, 23 states, and 26 foreign countries.\n  Since its four-year degree program began, enrollment has grown a \nwhopping 160 percent and they have expanded to offer 16 undergraduate \ndegree programs and two master's programs. Over the last 13 years, \nseveral new buildings have been constructed, the budget has more than \ndoubled, assets now total $49 million, and Lindsey Wilson College's \nendowment is valued at more than $28 million. Congratulations on these \ntremendous accomplishments.\n  I would like to recognize President William T. Luckey and Chancellor \nJohn B. Begley. Students, faculty, and staff at Lindsey Wilson are all \nfortunate to have such committed individuals serving the mission of the \nschool and facilitating its growth.\n  Another name that is important to Lindsey Wilson is Ruby McKinney \nRoach. Ms. Roach grew up in Adair County, Kentucky, and is a proud \nLindsey Wilson College Alumnus of 1954. From Lindsey Wilson, she went \nto Berea College and earned a Bachelor of Arts in home economics and a \nMaster of Education at Western Kentucky University. After a brief time \nteaching in Barren County, Ms. Roach went home to Adair County and \nserved as a teacher and guidance counselor for 30 years.\n  According to the many people touched by her kindness and generosity, \nRuby Roach became deeply involved in the lives of her students. As a \nhome economics teacher, she had the opportunity to share her skills and \nknowledge with thousands of students over the years. As a guidance \ncounselor, she had the unique experience of talking with students both \nabout their educational and personal goals, and helped them develop a \nplan to accomplish those goals.\n  Ms. Roach has been an active member of the educational community \noutside her school as well, having held positions in the Kentucky \nAssociation of School Administrators, the Kentucky Counselors \nAssociation, the National Education Association, and Iota chapter of \nThe Delta Kappa Gamma Society International, the honorary society of \nprofessional women educators.\n  Ruby Roach also served on numerous civic boards and organizations in \nthe Adair community. She is a former member of the Columbia Women's \nClub and is an active member of Beulah Chapel. Ruby Roach has made her \nalma mater proud, and I commend her for what she has contributed to the \nCollege, the surrounding community, and to Kentucky.\n  In the same way, Lindsey Wilson College is an institution of which \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky can be proud. On behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues in the Senate, congratulations Lindsey Wilson College, on \nyour many achievements, and best wishes for continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4816-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO WALTER AND RUTH McCANN ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to honor Mr. and Mrs. J. Walter McCann of Burlington, \nMassachusetts. On Saturday, June 10, they will celebrate their golden \nwedding anniversary of 50 years together. They have been proud \nresidents of Burlington since 1959, successfully raising 7 children, 16 \ngrandchildren and one great granddaughter.\n  These two distinguished Americans have seen extraordinary advances in \nour state and our country in their lifetime. They are part of the great \ngeneration that saw the nation through the Depression and World War II, \nand their strong values give us all a deep and enduring sense of what \nit means to be an American.\n  Ruth Gertrude McCann is the youngest of eight sisters and one \nbrother. She was born in her parents' home at 58 Warren Street in \nArlington, Massachusetts on June 29, 1921, the beautiful daughter of \nAnnie and Charles Dennen. Over the next three decades, ``Ma'' or \n``Mom'' became an accomplished athlete and opera singer. She made a \nrecording of her own, and gave a distinguished performance at Radio \nCity Music Hall in New York City. There, she met and fell in love with \nWalter McCann, and they've had a wonderful marriage ever since. As she \nlikes to say, ``Walter, why did you lead me to the altar?'' The answer \nis obvious to all.\n  In their neighborhood in Burlington, Ruth was every child's mom, \nespecially when making jelly from the grapes picked on the hill behind \nher home, or ringing the metal triangle on the porch to call the \nchildren home each night for dinner. She loved her children's \nactivities, and was often at Glee Club or Athletic Booster events, at \nbingo or bowling, or in the grandstand even on cold days at Pop Warner \ngames. Her husband often traveled, and she became the ``Little Birdie \nin the Window'' who guided her family as it grew.\n  Joseph Walter McCann was born on January 21, 1920 in Lowell, \nMassachusetts in his family home, the second son of four children \nraised by Alma and William Francis McCann. An energetic young man, \n``JW'' or ``Walter'' was an avid skier at Tuckerman's Ravine in New \nHampshire each winter. He loved to ``walk uphill in the snow'' for the \nlove of the sport with his cousin Jackie Stowell, his childhood best \nfriend.\n  His wife and children have warm and vivid memories of his enormous \ntrust and faith in the federal and state governments, whose actions \nwere often eloquently and vigorously debated at the dinner table. His \n``stand up and be counted'' philosophy of life was always challenging \nto those around him, and his quick wit entertained all who came to know \nhim.\n  As a father, he would often take the family camping and nourish them \nwith ``Campers Delight'' for dinner. Returning home from business \ntrips, he was always well informed by the ``Little Birdie in the \nWindow'' about his children's activities--and even about their \nmischievous behavior. His children were in awe that he knew so much. \nBut most of all, each of his children and grandchildren will always \nremember listening to him read stories, especially at Christmas, and \nthe loving phone calls made by Santa to each one of them every year.\n  Mr. President, on this special occasion, I congratulate Walter and \nRuth McCann as they enjoy and celebrate their golden anniversary \ntogether. Their commitment to the principles and values of their \nmarriage, their family, and their country deserve to be recognized and \nsaluted. I wish them a very happy 50th wedding anniversary, and \ncontinuing wonderful times together in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4816-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4816-S4817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COL.

The \nCitizen and the Constitution'' national finals in Washington, D.C. This \ncompetition, administered by the Center for Civic Education, tests \nelementary, middle and high school students in their knowledge of the \nAmerican constitutional government. In the finals, in which Trumbull \nHigh School matched wits against 50 other classes from across the \ncountry, students acted as constitutional experts and testified before \na panel of judges in a congressional hearing.\n  The Trumbull class was taught by Peter Sullivan and included Rachel \nBochinno, Alison Brand, Joanna Bruckman, Melissa Budahazy, Lindsey \nCahill, Kelly Chapple, Andrew Conway, Jessica Cotter, Shannon Cusello, \nJon Draskovic, Timothy Drummond, Michael Dusiewicz, Kim Ferguson, \nKathryn Graf, Juli Griek, Amy Hatzis, Lauren Hellthaler, Christine \nJelliffe, Dawn Liscinsky, James Lucia, John Manchisi, Saya Nagori, Ryan \nO'Neill, Julian Ross, Alison Schary, David Schub, Neerali Shah, Lauren \nSlade, Paul Strelka, Varun Vasudeva, and Robert Ward.\n  I am pleased to recognize the accomplishments of these outstanding \nstudents. The ``We the People . . .'' competition is the largest \nprogram testing knowledge of the Constitution in the United States, \nextending to over 26 million students across the country. Advancing to \nthe national finals represents a significant achievement, and \ndemonstrates an impressive interest in and understanding of the \nstructure and processes of our constitutional government. Trumbull High \nSchool and all of Connecticut can take great pride in these students' \nsuccess in a subject that is of fundamental importance to the vitality \nof our democracy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4817-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4817-S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOHN COOLIDGE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, my home town of Shrewsbury, \nVermont, can be a good way farther from Plymouth than it looks, at \nfirst glance, on a map. Though the towns' borders touch, Plymouth is on \nthe east side of the Green Mountains in Windsor Country, Shrewsbury's \nin Rutland County high on the mountains' west side. In the winter the \ndrive is about 25 miles, though it shortens to seven in the summer, \nwhen the old CCC Road is open. But the two old Vermont mountain towns \nare, in reality, close in spirit, due in considerable part to the \n``Coolidge connection''.\n  I thought about this last week on receiving the sad news of the death \nof John Coolidge, at 93, the son of President Calvin Coolidge. I had \nseldom been to The Notch without seeing John, and his greeting was \nalways warm and I usually heard another fascinating story about his \nfather, Calvin, or his mother, Grace. Though father and son shared \nreputations for being men of few words as Calvin's autobiography shows, \nhe was capable of true eloquence, as was John. Read his introduction to \nthe book ``Your Son Calvin Coolidge'', if you doubt it.\n  But as I was saying, the Coolidges helped make Plymouth and \nShrewsbury close. Calvin's sister Abbie taught school in Northam, \nbefore her early death. Aurora Pierce, the long-time housekeeper at the \nCoolidge homestead was a product of Shrewsbury. Her cousin Marjorie \nPierce, of Shrewsbury, recalls that John Coolidge often stopped by on \nhis annual summer visit to Aurora's grave in the Northam Cemetery. \nAurora lived at the homestead long after Calvin Coolidge's death and \njealously guarded its historic contents. We owe much to her for \npreserving, virtually intact, the contents of the house. She was, in \nher own unique way, a preservationist. So, too, was John.\n  John once told me that his grandfather, Col. John Coolidge said that \nto keep the Notch looking as it was would be the best memorial to \nPresident Coolidge. The Notch today remains virtually as it was when \nCalvin Coolidge was president. John Coolidge, working closely with the \nState of Vermont and through the wonderful Calvin Coolidge Memorial \nFoundation, which he and his wife Florence, were instrumental in \nfounding, saw to that. It is comforting to know that a Vermonter like \nmyself can always drop in on The Notch and see the Vermont of olden \ntimes, of open fields, farm homes, barns in good repair, all living on, \nand to know what a remarkable event in our nation's history happened in \nthat remote setting-the 1923 homestead inaugural.\n  I was happy three years ago to be able to deliver a federal \nappropriation to the Coolidge Foundation and I know it is being well \nused, continuing the legacy of Calvin Coolidge, a legacy so well \ncarried on by his son.\n  John Coolidge left many legacies. He nobly and eloquently bore the \nmantle of first son, which came so suddenly upon him with his father's \nearly death. He had a successful career in business, including the \nrestarting of the Cheese Factory at the Notch. Time and again through \ncountless interviews he showed the world what a true Vermonter was all \nabout. And he made sure that the world ``let Plymouth be'' as it was in \nhis father's time.\n  John Coolidge had always lived in Plymouth from spring until after \nthe\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nautumn leaves were gone. Then, two years ago, he came home to Plymouth \nNotch to live full time. One paper said he'd come home to die, but he \nreally came home to live. He was proud that he spent his first two \nwinters at The Notch and was added to the Plymouth checklist.\n  Now he will rest at the Notch Cemetery, besides his father and \nmother, his wife, his brother Calvin Jr., who died during the Coolidge \npresidency, and long generations of Coolidges. He will rest in a green \nand peaceful setting, in a valley he did so much to preserve. Vermont \nneeds to forge on preserving its wondrous landscape, for it is too \nprecious and rare to lose. John Coolidge knew that well and his beloved \nNotch will long serve as an example for coming generations of \nVermonters, indeed, for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4818-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH DAKOTA WIND THE INTERCOLLEGIATE FLYING \n                    ASSOCIATION NATIONAL CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I rise to recognize a recent \nachievement of the University of North Dakota's flying team. At the end \nof May, UND won the National Intercollegiate Flying Association \nnational championship. This is the eleventh such title for our \nUniversity.\n  This national championship team placed first in the flight and ground \nevents by scoring 162 points in the 10 different events--32 points more \nthan its closest competitor. Erich Hess won first place in Top Pilot \nhonors and secured the Craig Morrison award by receiving the top \ncombined scores in Computer Accuracy, Simulated Comprehensive Aircraft \nNavigation and Preflight. Brain Visocky received second place in Top \nPilot honors and took first place honors in the Short Field Landing \nevent. Ten other committed students at the John D. Odegard School of \nAerospace Sciences helped lead UND to its first place victory.\n  I commend Coach Al Skramstad and Assistant Coach Eric Brusven for \ntheir work in helping these students rigorously prepare for this annual \nevent. Winning the national championship is a significant achievement \nthat could not have been realized if it were not for an enormous \ncommitment on the part of both the students and their instructors.\n  The University of North Dakota is located in Grand Forks, ND, and I'm \nhonored to have graduated from this great university. The John D. \nOdegard School of Aerospace Sciences has always played a significant \nrole at the University as an international leader in collegiate and \ncontract aviation education and training services. With more than 1,500 \nstudents, the School of Aerospace Science is the second largest college \nat UND.\n  And so today I salute the University of North Dakota and its \nextraordinary championship flying team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4818-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO FRED CAPPS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late \nFred Capps and to offer condolences to his wife, Cathy, and their two \nyoung children, John and Lydia.\n  Commonwealth's Attorney Fred Capps lost his life fighting for the \npeople he represented each day in the courtroom. Kentucky Senate \nPresident David Williams, a longtime friend of Mr. Capps, said it best: \n``He died a hero, protecting his family. He was defending his home and \nhis children, and he didn't go down easy.'' As a prosecutor for Adair, \nCasey, Cumberland and Monroe counties, Mr. Capps was devoted to \nbringing criminals to justice. He gave his time and energy to protect \nthe victims who needed his help and, in the end, he gave his life for \ntheir sake as well. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the \nsacrifices Mr. Capps made, and I am deeply saddened that such a fine \nKentuckian has been lost.\n  Since this tragedy occurred, people across the State of Kentucky have \nspoken out in fond remembrance of Mr. Capps. Many have spoken about his \nreputation as a skilled prosecutor, and about his genuine concern for \nfinding justice for innocent victims. But Mr. Capps also is remembered \nfor the many hours he served as a volunteer and coach for the \nBurkesville Little League, and for his example as a committed family \nman. He was a devoted husband and father, loyal friend, community \nleader, and gifted attorney.\n  At times such as this, I am reminded of the fragility of life and the \nimportance of family. From all accounts, Mr. Capps understood and \nvalued these things while he was alive and has left a legacy of \nexcellence for his children to remember. Hopefully it will be a comfort \nto the family and friends Mr. Capps leaves behind to know that he was \nloved and admired by so many in his community and throughout the entire \nState. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest \ncondolences to his loved ones, and express our gratitude for all Mr. \nCapps contributed to the counties he served, the State of Kentucky, and \nto our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4818-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VALANOS' 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a more equitable Federal medical assistance percentage for \nAlaska; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the alaska medicaid equity act of 2000\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for more than 30 years, the \nState of Alaska was subjected to an economic inequity in the \nadministration of the national Medicaid program.\n\n  With a poverty level 25 percent above the national average, and over \none-sixth of the state's population Medicaid-eligible, Alaska delivers \nhealth care to many needy children, pregnant women, disabled and \nelderly poor Americans. These people deserve quality medical care, and \nAlaska delivers.\n  But three years ago, Congress recognized that the federal government \nwas not paying its fair share of Alaska's Medicaid program. The one-\nsize-fits-all formula that is used to calculate the federal Medicaid \nmatch is based upon the per capita income of individual states as it \nrelates to the national per capita income. Simply put, states with \nhigher per capita income pay a higher percentage of Medicaid costs. \nThis formula works well for states that are near national norms for \nmost economic indicators. But it certainly doesn't work in the State of \nAlaska, where most economic measurements are atypical compared with \nnational averages.\n  The reason is fairly simple. It just costs more to live and do \nbusiness in Alaska. Per capita income isn't a fair indicator unless it \ntakes into account the cost of delivering care in that area. Somehow, \nhowever, the Medicaid formula forgot this.\n  In 1997, when Congress recognized this issue, it adopted legislation \nthat reflected the state's higher costs and increased the federal \nMedicaid match. Instead of receiving a 50-50 match rate, as the formula \nwould dictate, a 59.8-40.2 percent match rate was established.\n  Unfortunately, this legislation was a short term fix. It only allowed \nthe formula change to remain in effect for\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\nthree years. As a result, unless we change the law, the formula will \nrevert to the same inequitable standard that was used previously. And \nunless we extend the formula change, vital health care services to \nAlaska's neediest patients will be compromised.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation that will extend the \nfederal government's commitment to the health and well-being of \nAlaska's Medicaid beneficiaries. The ``Alaska Medicaid Equity Act of \n2000,'' which is co-sponsored by Senator Stevens, simply continues the \nspirit and intent of Congress by adjusting federal medical assistance \npercentage calculations to account for Alaska's unusually high delivery \ncosts.\n  Three years after we first passed this legislation, the reasons and \njustifications for the adjustment still exist. The formula is still \nfundamentally unfair to Alaska.\n  Let me explain why. Alaska's per capita income is $28,523, the 17th \nhighest in the country. In fact, it's right near the national average, \nwhich is $28,518. Although Alaska's per capita income suggests it is \none of the richer states, it fails to take into account the high cost \nof living and the high cost of delivering health care.\n  Some studies show that it costs 71 percent more to deliver health \ncare in Alaska. But let's look at some real numbers. From coast to \ncoast, the U.S. dollar buys more goods and services than it does in \nAlaska.\n  In Portland, Oregon, it costs $66.00 to feed a family of four for one \nweek. In Anchorage it costs $84.15. In Kodiak, that number jumps to \n$105.88. And out in Dillingham, that number rises to $144.57! We're \ncomparing apples and oranges when we compare Alaska's per capita income \nto another state's average.\n  And how about electricity? In Portland, 1000 kilowatt hours costs \n$60.88. Anchorage residents are paying $92.83. Out in Bethel, Alaska, \nresidents are paying $202.68.\n  When focusing solely on the delivery of health care services, the \ndifferences stand out even more. In Florida, a hospital room for one \nday costs, on average, $361. This is in line with lower 48 costs, which \nrun between $350 and $450. In Alaska, that same room costs $748--more \nthan twice as much! A physician office visit is $53 in Florida. That \nvisit costs $80 in Alaska--an increase of 66%!\n  You can look at virtually any good or service and see a comparable \ndifference. A dollar simply doesn't buy the same thing in Alaska that \nit does in the lower 48. The numbers prove this. The federal government \nhas admitted this. Federal government employees receive a salary \nadjustment in Alaska--a 25% cost of living adjustment. Military \npersonnel receive a similar increase. Medicare pays higher as well. \nEven the Federal Poverty Level is adjusted to reflect the unique costs \nin Alaska. So why doesn't Medicaid?\n  Our bill merely continues the commitment Congress made to Alaska's \nMedicaid population three years ago. It's fair, and it makes sense. I \nask my colleagues to assist me in rectifying this clear inequity for \nthe state of Alaska; I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2693\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prevent evasion of United States excise taxes on \ncigarettes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              gray market cigarette compliance act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my good friends \nfrom Maine and Virginia, Ms. Collins and Mr. Robb, in introducing the \nGray Market Cigarette Compliance Act of 2000. The growth in this gray \nmarket in cigarettes represents not only an economic threat, but a \nsignificant public health menace as well. This legislation will provide \nlaw enforcement with better and more effective tools to fight this \ndangerous intrusion into our marketplace.\n  This bill concerns itself with cigarettes manufactured for overseas \nmarkets that nevertheless find their way into our domestic stream of \ncommerce. Even if they have been manufactured in the United States, \nthey are not required to comply with U.S. content disclosure and health \nlabeling requirements. Thus, when they are brought back into the U.S. \nby gray market profiteers, they represent a serious public health \nconcern. And because they are often sold at prices below those of \nproducts manufactured to comply with our tough cigarette marketing \nlaws, they become more attractive and available to children.\n  The gray market is unfair competition, plain and simple. Consumers \noften purchase gray market products thinking they are the same as the \nlegitimate products manufactured for sale in the U.S. When gray \nmarketers bring in cigarettes that are not manufactured in full \ncompliance with U.S. law, they mislead unwitting consumers.\n  Consumers are not the only ones affected. Gray marketers also harm \nthe legitimate wholesalers and retailers who work hard and play by the \nrules by exploiting gray areas in the law in order to gain this unfair \ncompetitive advantage.\n  It is important to stress as well the implications of the gray market \nin cigarettes for states under the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement \n(MSA). One of the major components of the MSA provides that payments to \nstates are based on a formula that takes into account the annual volume \nof tobacco sold in each state. Gray market cigarettes are not counted \nunder that volume adjustment formula. Therefore, to the extent that \ngray market sales displace sales of cigarettes that are counted in the \nvolume adjustment, states could lose a portion of the amounts they \nwould otherwise receive under the MSA.\n  The Gray Market Cigarette Compliance Act will help consumers, \nretailers, wholesalers, and federal and state governments. It will \nstrengthen the hand of law enforcement to combat the sale of gray \nmarket cigarettes and close loopholes that gray markets have been able \nto exploit. But most importantly, it will help keep cheap cigarettes \nout of the hands of children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gray Market Cigarette \n     Compliance Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that additional legislation is necessary to \n     prevent evasion of United States taxes on cigarettes, to \n     ensure that the packages of all cigarettes sold or \n     distributed in the United States bear the health warnings \n     required by Federal law, to ensure compliance with applicable \n     Federal ingredient reporting requirements, and to improve the \n     enforcement of existing United States trademark laws so as to \n     prevent consumer confusion and deception. In support of this \n     finding, Congress has determined that:\n       (1) Prevention of federal tax evasion.--\n       (A) Cigarettes manufactured in the United States that are \n     labeled and shipped for export are not subject to the excise \n     taxes that otherwise would be payable with respect to such \n     products when removed from the premises of the manufacturer.\n       (B) Enforcement difficulties are created for the \n     authorities charged with ensuring that proper taxes are paid \n     whenever export-labeled cigarettes are sold or distributed in \n     the United States.\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\n       (C) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 imposed restrictions on \n     the domestic sale or distribution of export-labeled \n     cigarettes, but such provisions have not been adequate to \n     prevent continued evasion of United States taxes on \n     cigarettes.\n       (D) Enforcement of Federal cigarette tax laws will be \n     enhanced substantially if cigarettes manufactured in the \n     United States and labeled for export are not sold or \n     distributed in the United States.\n       (2) Ensuring compliance with federal health warnings and \n     ingredient reporting requirements.--\n       (A) Congress has required that specified warnings appear on \n     the packages of all cigarettes manufactured, packaged, or \n     imported for sale or distribution in the United States.\n       (B) Congress has required that each person who \n     manufactures, packages, or imports cigarettes for sale or \n     distribution in the United States annually provide the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services with a list of the \n     ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of such \n     cigarettes.\n       (C) The public health objectives of the foregoing \n     requirements will be advanced by adopting additional \n     mechanisms for ensuring that these requirements are met with \n     respect to all cigarettes for sale or distribution in the \n     United States.\n       (3) Enforcement of federal trademark laws.--\n       (A) Cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad have \n     characteristics that differentiate them in material respects \n     from cigarettes that bear the same trademarks but that are \n     manufactured for sale in the United States.\n       (B) Such material differences may include tar and nicotine \n     yields, incentive programs, and quality assurances with \n     respect to distribution and storage.\n       (C) When cigarettes bearing trademarks registered in the \n     United States are manufactured for sale or distribution \n     outside the United States but are diverted or reimported for \n     sale or distribution in the United States, there is a \n     substantial risk of consumer confusion and deception. \n     Stickers and other similar devices are inadequate to prevent \n     such confusion and deception.\n       (D) In order to effectuate the purposes of the United \n     States trademark laws, including the prevention of consumer \n     confusion and deception, additional legislation is necessary \n     to allow United States trademark holders to enforce fully \n     their rights against infringing cigarettes whether such \n     cigarettes were manufactured in the United States or abroad.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the Commodity Exchange Act \nto promote legal certainty, enhance competition, and reduce systemic \nrisk in markets for futures and over-the-counter derivatives, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n            the commodity futures modernization act of 2000\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Gramm, \ndistinguished Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator \nFitzgerald, distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Research, \nNutrition and General Legislation of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nto introduce\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\nlegislation to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), which \nlapses on September 30th of this year. The Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000 would reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act \n(CEA) for five additional years and would reform the Commodity Exchange \nAct in three primary ways. First, it would incorporate the unanimous \nrecommendations of the President's Working Group (PWG) on the proper \nlegal and regulatory treatment of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. \nSecond, it would codify the regulatory relief proposal of the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) to ensure that futures exchanges are \nappropriately regulated and remain competitive. Lastly, this \nlegislation would reform the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional accord, which \nbanned single stock futures 18 years ago.\n  Derivative instruments, both exchange-traded and over-the-counter \n(OTC), have played a significant role in our economy's current \nexpansion due to their innovative nature and their risk-transferring \nattributes. According to the International Swaps and Derivatives \nAssociation, the global derivatives market has a notional value that \nexceeds $58 trillion and it has grown at a rate exceeding 20 percent \nsince 1990. Identified by Alan Greenspan as the ``most significant \nevent in finance of the past decade,'' the development of the \nderivatives market has substantially added to the productivity and \nwealth of our nation.\n  Derivatives enable companies to unbundle and transfer risk to those \nentities who are willing and able to accept it. By doing so, efficiency \nis enhanced as firms are able to concentrate on their core business \nobjective. A farmer can purchase a futures contract, one type of \nderivative, in order to lock in a price for his crop at harvest. \nAutomobile manufacturers, whose profits earned overseas can fluctuate \nwith changes in currency values, can minimize this uncertainty through \nderivatives, allowing them to focus on the business of building cars. \nBanks significantly lessen their exposure to interest rate movements by \nentering into derivatives contracts known as swaps, which enable these \ninstitutions to hedge their risk by exchanging variable and fixed rates \nof interests.\n  Signed into law in 1974, the Commodity Exchange Act requires that \nfutures contracts be traded on a regulated exchange. As a result, a \nfutures contract that is traded off an exchange is illegal and \nunenforceable. When Congress enacted the CEA and the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission (CFTC) to enforce it, this was not a concern. The \nmeanings of `futures' and `exchange' were relatively apparent. \nFurthermore, the over-the-counter derivatives business was in its \ninfancy. However, in the 26 years since the statute's creation, the OTC \nswaps and derivatives market, sparked by innovation and technology, has \nsignificantly outpaced the exchange-traded futures markets. And along \nwith this expansion, the definitions of a swap and a future began to \nblur.\n  In 1998, the CFTC released a concept release on OTC derivatives, \nwhich was perceived by many as a precursor to regulating these \ninstruments as futures. Just the threat of reaching this conclusion \ncould have had considerable ramifications, given the size and \nimportance of the OTC market. The legal uncertainty interjected by this \ndispute jeopardized the entirety of the OTC market and threatened to \nmove significant portions of the business overseas. If we were to \nlose this market, most likely to London, it would take years to bring \nit back to U.S. soil. The resulting loss of business and jobs would be \nimmeasurable.\n\n  This threat led the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the \nSEC to oppose the concept release and request that Congress enact a \nmoratorium on the CFTC's ability to regulate these instruments until \nafter the President's Working Group (PWG) could complete a study on the \nissue. As a result, Congress passed a six-month moratorium on the \nCFTC's ability to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. Despite \nreservations, I supported this moratorium because it brought legal \nassurance to this skittish market and it allowed the President's \nWorking Group time to develop recommendations on the most appropriate \nlegal treatment of OTC derivatives. In November 1999, the President's \nWorking Group completed its unanimous recommendations on OTC \nderivatives and presented Congress with these findings.\n  This legislation adopts much of the recommendations of the PWG \nreport. Our bill contains three mechanisms for ensuring that legal \ncertainty is attained and that certain transactions remain outside the \nCommodity Exchange Act. The first, the electronic trading facility \nexclusion, would exclude transactions in financial and energy \ncommodities from the Act if conducted: (1) on a principal to principal \nbasis; (2) between institutions or sophisticated persons with high net \nworth; and (3) on an electronic trading facility. The second would \nexclude these transactions if (1) they are conducted between \ninstitutions or sophisticated persons with high net worth; and (2) they \nare not on a trading facility. The third exclusion clarifies the \nTreasury Amendment language already contained in the CEA. It would \nexclude all transactions in foreign currency and government securities \nfrom the Act unless those transactions are futures contracts and traded \non an organized exchange. As recommended by the PWG, the bill would \ngive the CFTC jurisdiction over non-regulated off-exchange retail \nfutures transactions in foreign currency. Another important \nrecommendation of the PWG was to authorize futures clearing facilities \nto clear OTC derivatives in an effort to lessen systemic risk and this \nbill incorporates this finding.\n  As part of this legal certainty section, our legislation also \naddresses the concern that excluding OTC derivatives from the futures \nlaws will invite the SEC to regulate these products as securities. With \nSenator Gramm's leadership, this legislation would adopt language that \nwould ensure that these products maintain their current regulatory \nstatus and remain healthy and competitive.\n  The second major section of this legislation addresses regulatory \nrelief. In February of this year, the CFTC issued a regulatory relief \nproposal that would provide relief to futures exchanges and their \ncustomers. Instead of listing specific requirements for complying with \nthe CEA, the proposal would require exchanges to meet internationally \nagreed-upon core principals. The CFTC proposal creates tiers of \nregulation for exchanges based on whether the underlying commodities \nbeing traded are susceptible to manipulation or whether the users of \nthe exchange are limited to institutional customers.\n  The legislation incorporates this framework. A board of trade that is \ndesignated as a contract market would receive the highest level of \nregulation due to the fact that these products are susceptible to \nmanipulation or are offered to retail customers. Futures on \nagricultural commodities would fall into this category. This bill also \nsets out that in lieu of contract market designation, a board of trade \nmay register as a Derivatives Transaction Execution Facility (DTEF) if \nthe products being offered are not susceptible to manipulation and are \ntraded among institutional customers or retail customers who use large \nFutures Commission Merchants (FCMs) who are members of a clearing \nfacility. Lastly, a board of trade may choose to be an Exempt Board of \nTrade (XBOT) and not be subject to the Act (except for the CFTC's anti-\nmanipulation authority) if the products being offered are traded among \ninstitutional customers only (absolutely no retail) and the instruments \nare not susceptible to manipulation. Our bill would allow a board of \ntrade that is a DTEF or an XBOT to opt to trade derivatives that are \notherwise excluded from the Act on these facilities and to the extent \nthat these products are traded on these facilities, the CFTC would have \nexclusive jurisdiction over them. With this provision, the intent is to \nprovide these facilities that trade derivatives with a choice--if \nregulation is beneficial, the facility may choose to be regulated. If \nnot, the facility may choose to be excluded or exempted from the Act.\n\n  The bill's last section addresses the Shad-Johnson jurisdictional \naccord. In 1982, SEC Chairman John Shad and CFTC Chairman Phil Johnson \nreached an agreement on dividing jurisdiction between the agencies for \nthose products that had characteristics of both securities and futures. \nKnown as the Shad-Johnson Accord, this agreement prohibited single \nstock futures and delineated jurisdiction between the SEC\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nand the CFTC on stock index futures and other options.\n  Meant as a temporary agreement, many have suggested that the Shad-\nJohnson accord should be repealed. The President's Working Group \nunanimously agreed that the Accord can be repealed if regulatory \ndisparities are resolved between the regulation of futures and \nsecurities. Recently, the General Accounting Office (GAO) released a \nreport that found that there is no legitimate policy reasons for \nmaintaining the ban on single stock futures since they are being traded \nin foreign markets, in the OTC market, and synthetically in the options \nmarkets. Senator Gramm, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and I \nsent a letter in December requesting the CFTC and the SEC to make \nrecommendations on reforming the Shad-Johnson. On March 2, the SEC and \nCFTC responded that, although progress had been made, the agencies \ncould not resolve these issues before October. Disappointment with this \nanswer led Senator Gramm and I to once again ask SEC Chairman Arthur \nLevitt and CFTC Chairman Bill Rainer to attempt to resolve the problems \nsurrounding lifting the ban. Unfortunately, the agencies were not able \nto reach an agreement within our time-frame.\n  This legislation would repeal the prohibition on single stock futures \nand narrow-based stock index futures. It would allow these products, \ntermed designated futures on securities, to trade on either a CFTC-\nregulated contract market or a SEC-regulated national securities \nexchange or association. The SEC would maintain its insider trading and \nantifraud enforcement authority over these products traded on a \ncontract market and the CFTC would maintain its anti-manipulation \nauthority, including large trader reporting, over these products traded \non a national securities exchange or association. Margin levels on \nthese products would be harmonized with the options markets. The bill \nwould provide the regulators with one year after enactment to resolve \nany remaining issues.\n  The goal of this legislation is to ensure that the United States \nremains a global leader in the derivatives marketplace and that these \nmarkets are appropriately and effectively regulated. Due to the \nshortened legislative calendar in this election year, it will be \ndifficult to pass this bill without momentum and a strong base of \nsupport. If Congress fails to enact a bill, we will begin the debate \nagain next year. However, in this technology-driven economy, a one year \ndelay is an eternity. Legal uncertainty for OTC derivatives will remain \nand our futures markets will continue to lose market share due in part \nto an outdated regulatory structure. For this reason, it is imperative \nthat Congress enact thoughtful legislation this year when it has a \ngolden opportunity to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section by section analysis of this \nbill be included in the Record immediately after my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis--Commodity Futures Modernization Act of \n                                  2000\n\n       Sec. 1. Short Title and Table of Contents. The Act is \n     entitled the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000\n       Sec. 2. Purposes. The section lists 8 purposes for the bill \n     including reauthorizing and streamlining the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (CEA); eliminating unnecessary regulation for \n     the futures exchanges; clarifying the jurisdiction of the \n     CFTC over certain retail foreign currency transactions; \n     transforming the role of the Commodities Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC); providing a legislative and regulatory \n     framework for the trading of futures on securities; promoting \n     innovation and reducing systemic risk for futures and over-\n     the-counter (OTC) derivatives; allowing clearing of OTC \n     derivatives and enhancing the competitive position of the \n     U.S. financial institutions and markets.\n       Sec. 3. Definitions. Adds definitions to section 1(a) of \n     the CEA for the following terms: derivatives clearing \n     organizations; designated future on a security; electronic \n     trading facility; eligible contract participant; energy \n     commodity; exclusion-eligible commodity; exempted security; \n     financial commodity; financial institution, hybrid \n     instrument; national securities exchange; option organized \n     exchange; registered entity; security and trading facility.\n       Sec. 4. Agreements, Contracts, and Transactions in Foreign \n     Currency, Government Securities and Certain Other \n     Commodities. Strikes 2(a)(1)(A)(ii) (the current law Treasury \n     Amendment) and replaces it with a new subsection 2(c), which \n     states that nothing in the CEA applies to transactions in \n     foreign currency, government securities and other similar \n     instruments unless these instruments are futures traded on an \n     organized exchange. The bill defines ``organized exchange'' \n     as a trading facility that either allows retail customers, \n     permits agency trades, or has a self regulatory role. \n     Subparagraph (2)(B) provides the CFTC with jurisdiction over \n     retail foreign currency transactions that are not traded on \n     an organized exchange and that are not regulated by another \n     federal regulator.\n       Sec. 5. Legal Certainty for Over-the-Counter Transactions. \n     Amends section 2 of the CEA to create a new subsection 2(d), \n     which provides two exclusions from the CEA for over-the-\n     counter derivatives. Section 2(d)(1) provides that nothing in \n     the CEA applies to transactions in an exclusive-eligible \n     commodity if the transaction: (1) is between eligible \n     contract participants (large, institutional entities) and (2) \n     is not executed on a trading facility. The second exclusion \n     in paragraph (d)(2) provides that nothing in the CEA shall \n     apply to a transaction in exclusion-eligible commodity if the \n     transaction: (1) is entered into on a principal to principal \n     basis between parties trading for their own accounts; (2) is \n     between eligible contract participants (large, institutional \n     entities) and (3) is executed on an electronic trading \n     facility. Paragraph (d)(3) provides that derivatives on \n     energy commodities (i.e., energy swaps) that have been \n     excluded from the CEA would be subject to anti-manipulation \n     provisions of the CEA.\n       Sec. 6. Excluded Electronic Trading Facilities. Amends \n     section 2 of the CEA to create a new subsection 2(e) that \n     provides that trading instruments that are otherwise excluded \n     from the CEA on an electronic trading facility does not \n     subject the transactions to the CEA. Paragraph (c)(2) \n     states that nothing in the DEA shall prohibit a contract \n     market or derivatives transaction execution facility from \n     establishing and operating an excluded electronic trading \n     facility.\n       Sec. 7. Hybrid Instruments. Amends section 2 of the CEA to \n     create a new subsection 2(f) that provides that nothing in \n     the CEA applies to a hybrid instrument that is predominantly \n     a security to mean any hybrid instrument in which (1) the \n     issuer of the instrument receives payment in full of the \n     purchase price at the time the instrument is delivered; (2) \n     the purchaser is not required to make additional payments; \n     (3) the issuer of the instrument is not subject to mark-to-\n     market margining requirements; and (4) the instrument is not \n     marketed as a futures contract. Paragraph (f)(3) clarifies \n     that mark-to-market requirements do not include the \n     obligation of an issuer of a secured debt instrument to \n     increase the amount of collateral for the instrument.\n       Sec. 8. Futures on Securities. Amends section 2 of the CEA \n     by adding a new subsection 2(g) that repeals the Shad Johnson \n     jurisdictional accord. The new section 2(g)(1) is a savings \n     clause to ensure that excluded OTC equity derivatives remain \n     outside the CEA and the jurisdiction of the CFTC. This \n     paragraph also prohibits the CFTC from designating a board of \n     trade as a contract market in options on securities (as in \n     current law).\n       Paragraph (2) allows the trading of futures on security \n     indexes on contract markets. Gives the CETC exclusive \n     jurisdiction in regulating these futures. In order for these \n     products to be designated as a contract market, the contracts \n     must be cash settled and must not be susceptible to \n     manipulation (applies to both the price of the contract or \n     the underlying securities (or an option on such securities)).\n       Paragraph (3) allows the trading of designated futures on \n     securities (defined in the bill as a contract for future \n     delivery on a single non-exempted security, an index based on \n     fewer than 5 non-exempted securities or an index in which a \n     single stock predominates by its value accounting for more \n     than 30 percent of the index's total value). The Act \n     authorizes these products to be traded on designated contract \n     markets and national securities exchanges or associations.\n       Paragraph (4) provides criteria for contract market \n     designation of these products including: cash settlement; \n     real-time audit trails; insusceptibility to price \n     manipulation (both of the contract and the underlying stock \n     or an option on that stock); eligibility for listing on a \n     national securities exchange; margin requirements; conflict \n     of interest rules; and making information available to the \n     regulators.\n       Paragraph (5) authorizes the SEC to enforce the securities \n     laws related to insider trading and fraud with respect to \n     designated futures on securities listed on a contract market. \n     This paragraph also requires the SEC and the CFTC, beginning \n     three years from the date of enactment, to jointly compile a \n     report on the implementation of this new authority and, \n     four years after the date of enactment, to submit the \n     report to Congress.\n       Paragraph (6) authorizes the CFTC to enforce its large \n     trader reporting and other antifraud and antimanipulation \n     authorities for designated futures on securities listed on a \n     national securities exchange. It requires national securities \n     exchanges to provide the CFTC information to enforce these \n     provisions.\n       Paragraph (7) provides the process for listing a designated \n     future on security on either a futures exchange or national \n     securities exchange.\n       As in current law, paragraph (8) provides the Federal \n     Reserve with the authority to\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\n     set margin and delegate this authority. The paragraph would \n     allow the Federal Reserve to create a three member board \n     consisting of members of the CFTC, SEC and the Federal \n     Reserve to set and maintain margin levels on designated \n     futures on securities.\n       Sec. 9. Protection of the Public Interest. Replaces section \n     3 of the CEA with a new section listing the responsibilities \n     of the CFTC in protecting the public interest. These include: \n     ensuring the financial integrity of all transactions subject \n     to the Act; protecting market participants from fraud and \n     manipulation; preventing market manipulation and minimizing \n     the risk of systemic failure; and promoting financial \n     innovation and fair competition.\n       Sec. 10. Prohibited Transactions. Re-writes the current \n     section 4c for clarity and adds a new provision (sec. \n     4c(a)(3)(B)) to allow futures commission merchants to trade \n     futures off the floor of a futures exchange as long as the \n     board of trade allows such transactions and the FCMs report, \n     record and clear the transactions in accordance with the \n     rules of the contract market or derivatives trading execution \n     facility.\n       Sec. 11. Designation of Boards of Trade as Contract \n     Markets. Strikes current law sections 5 and 5a and adds a new \n     section 5 providing for the designation of boards of trade as \n     contract markets. Subsection (b) contains criteria that \n     boards of trade must meet in order to be designated as a \n     contract market. These include establishing and enforcing \n     rules preventing market manipulation; ensuring fair and \n     equitable trading; specifying how the trade execution \n     facility operates--including any electronic matching systems; \n     ensuring the financial integrity of transactions; \n     disciplining members or market participants who violate the \n     rules; allowing for public access to the board of trade rules \n     and enabling the board of trade to obtain information in \n     order to enforce its rules. Existing contract markets are \n     grand fathered in.\n       The 17 core principles that must be met to maintain \n     designation as a contract market are contained in (d) and \n     provide that the board of trade must: monitor and enforce \n     compliance with the contract market rules; list only \n     contracts that are not susceptible to manipulation; monitor \n     trading to prevent manipulation, price distortion and \n     delivery or settlement disruptions; adopt position limits for \n     speculators; adopt rules to provide for the exercise of \n     emergency authority, including the authority to liquidate \n     or transfer open positions, suspend trading and make \n     margin calls; make available the terms and conditions of \n     the contracts and the mechanisms for executing \n     transactions; publish daily information on prices, bids, \n     offers, volume, open interest, and opening and closing \n     ranges; provide a competitive, open and efficient market \n     and mechanism for executing transactions; provide for the \n     safe storage of all trade information in a readily usable \n     manner to assist in fraud prevention; provide for the \n     financial integrity of the contracts, the futures \n     commission merchants and customer funds; protect market \n     participants from abusive practices; provide for \n     alternative dispute resolutions for market participants \n     and intermediaries; establish and enforce rules regarding \n     fitness standards for those involved in market governance; \n     ensure that the governing board reflects the composition \n     of the market participants (in the case of mutually owned \n     exchanges); maintain records and make them available at \n     any time for inspection by the Attorney General; and avoid \n     taking any action that restrains trade or imposes \n     anticompetitive burdens on the markets.\n       Sec. 12. Derivatives Transaction Execution Facilities. \n     Amends the CEA by adding a new section 5a authorizing a new \n     trading designation, derivatives transaction execution \n     facility (DTEF). Under (b), a board of trade may elect to \n     operate as a DTEF rather than a contract market if they meet \n     the DTEF designation requirements. A registered DTEF may \n     trade any non-designated futures contract if the commodity \n     underlying the contract has a nearly inexhaustible supply, is \n     not susceptible to manipulation and does not have a cash \n     market in commercial practice. Eligible DTEF traders include \n     authorized contract market participants and persons trading \n     through registered futures commission merchants with capital \n     of at least $20,000,000 that are members of a futures self-\n     regulatory organization (SRO) and a clearing organization. \n     Boards of trade that have been designated as contract markets \n     may operate as DTEFs if they provide a separate location for \n     DTEF trading or, in the case of an electronic system, \n     identify whether the trading is on a DTEF or contract market.\n       Subsection (c) provides requirements for boards of trade \n     that wish to register as DTEFs, including: establishing and \n     enforcing trading rules that will deter abuses and provide \n     market participants impartial access to the markets and \n     capture information that may be used in rule enforcement; \n     define trading procedures to be used; and provide for the \n     financial integrity of DTEF transactions.\n       To maintain registration as a DTEF, the board of trade must \n     comply with 8 core principles listed in (d): maintain and \n     enforce rules; ensure orderly trading and provide trading \n     information to the CFTC; publicly disclose information \n     regarding contract terms, trading practices, and financial \n     integrity protections; provide information on prices, bids \n     and offers to market participants as well as daily \n     information in volume and open interest for the actively \n     traded contracts; establish and enforce rules regarding \n     fitness standards for those involved in DTEF governance; \n     maintain records and make them available at any time for \n     inspection by the Attorney General; and avoid taking any \n     action that restrains trade or imposes anticompetitive \n     burdens on the markets.\n       Subsection (e) allows a broker-dealer or a bank in good \n     standing to act as an intermediary on behalf of its customers \n     and to receive customer funds serving as margin or security \n     for the customer's transactions. If the broker-dealer holds \n     the DTEF customer funds or accounts for more than 1 business \n     day, the broker-dealer must be a registered FCM and a member \n     of a registered futures association. The CFTC and SEC are to \n     coordinate in adopting rules to implement this subsection.\n       Under (f), the CFTC may adopt regulations to allow FCMs to \n     give their customers the right to not segregate customer \n     funds for purposes of trading on the DTEF.\n       Subsection (g) clarifies that a DTEF may trade derivatives \n     that otherwise would be excluded from the CEA and the CFTC \n     has exclusive jurisdiction only when these instruments are \n     traded on a DTEF.\n       Sec. 13. Derivatives Clearing Organizations. Amends the CEA \n     to create a new section 5b regarding derivatives clearing \n     organizations. Under subsection (a), these clearing entities, \n     which are allowed to clear derivatives (that are not a \n     security), must register with the CFTC and meet a set of 14 \n     core principals set out in subsection (d), including \n     principals on financial resources of the clearing facility, \n     participant eligibility, risk management systems, settlement \n     procedures, treatment of client funds, default rules, rule \n     enforcement, system safeguards, reporting, record keeping, \n     public information disclosure, information sharing, and \n     minimizing competitive restraints.\n       Under subsection (b), a derivatives clearing organization \n     will not have to register with the CFTC if it is registered \n     with another federal financial regulator and it does not \n     clear futures. Under subsection (c), a derivatives clearing \n     organization that is exempt from registration may opt to \n     register with the CFTC. Subsection (e) provides that existing \n     clearing entities that clear futures contracts on a \n     designated contract market will be grand fathered in as a \n     derivatives clearing organization.\n       Sec. 14. Common Provisions Applicable to Registered \n     Entities. Amends the CEA to create a new section 5c that \n     contains provisions affecting all registered entities \n     (contract markets, derivatives transaction execution \n     facilities and derivatives clearing organizations).\n       Subsection (a) would allow the CFTC to issue or approve \n     interpretations to describe what would constitute an \n     acceptable business practice under the core principals for \n     registered entities.\n       Subsection (b) would allow a registered entity to delegate \n     its self regulatory functions to a registered futures \n     association, while specifying that responsibility for \n     carrying out these functions remain with the registered \n     entity.\n       Subsection (c) would enable the registered entity to trade \n     new products or adopt or amend rules by providing the CFTC a \n     written certification that the new contract or new rule or \n     amendment complies with the CEA. This subsection would allow \n     a registered entity to request that the CFTC grant prior \n     approval of a new contract, new rule or rule amendment. This \n     subsection would require the CFTC to pre-approve rule changes \n     to open agricultural contracts.\n       Subsection (d) grants the CFTC the authority to informally \n     resolve potential violations of the core principals for \n     registered entities.\n       Sec. 15. Exempt Boards of Trade. Amends the CEA to create a \n     new section 5d regarding exempt boards of trade. Under \n     subsections (a) and (b), futures contracts traded on an \n     exempt board of trade would be exempt from the CEA (except \n     section 2(g) regarding equity futures) if (1) participants \n     are eligible contract participants (large institutional \n     investors) and (2) the commodity underlying the futures \n     contract has an inexhaustible deliverable supply, is not \n     subject to manipulation, or has no cash market. Subsection \n     (c) subjects futures contracts traded on an exempt board of \n     trade to the anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of \n     the CEA. Under subsection (d), if the CFTC finds that an \n     exempt board of trade is a significant source of price \n     discovery for the underlying commodity, the board of trade \n     shall disseminate publicly on a daily basis trading volume, \n     opening and closing price ranges, open interest, and other \n     trading data as appropriate to the market.\n       Sec. 16. Suspension or Revocation of Designation as \n     Contract Market. Designates current section 5b as 5d and \n     amends it to authorize the CFTC to suspend the registration \n     of a registered entity for 180 days for any violation of the \n     CEA.\n       Sec. 17. Authorization of Appropriations. Amends section \n     12(d) of the CEA by striking 2000 and reauthorizing \n     appropriations through fiscal year 2005.\n       Sec. 18. Preemption. Rewrites paragraph 12(e)(2) of the CEA \n     for clarity and to conform with changes made in the bill. Re-\n     states the current provisions that the CEA supercedes and \n     preempts other laws in the case of transactions conducted on \n     a registered entity or subject to regulation by the CFTC \n     (even if outside the United States), and adds that in the \n     case of excluded electronic trading facilities, and any \n     agreements, contracts or transactions that are excluded or \n     covered by a 4(c)\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\n     exemption, the CEA supercedes and preempts state gaming and \n     bucket shop laws (except for the anti-fraud provisions of \n     those laws that are generally applicable).\n       Sec. 19. Predispute Resolution Agreements for Institutional \n     Customers. Amends section 14 of the CEA to clarify that \n     futures commission merchants, as a condition of doing \n     business, may require customers, that are eligible contract \n     participants, to waive their right to file a reparations \n     claim with the CFTC.\n       Sec. 20. Consideration of Costs and Benefits and Antitrust \n     Laws. Amends section 15 of the CEA to add a new subsection \n     (a) requiring the CFTC, before promulgating regulations and \n     issuing orders, to consider the costs and benefits of their \n     action. This does not apply to orders associated with an \n     adjudicatory or investigative process, emergency actions or \n     findings of fact regarding compliance with CFTC rules.\n       Sec. 21. Contract Enforcement Between Eligible \n     Counterparties. Amends section 22 of the CEA to provide a \n     safe harbor so that transactions will not be voidable based \n     solely on the failure of the transaction to comply with the \n     terms or conditions of an exclusion or exemption from the Act \n     or CFTC regulations.\n       Sec. 22. Legal Certainty for Swaps. Provides that the SEC \n     does not have jurisdiction over swap agreements. Places a one \n     year moratorium on banks being able to market swaps to the \n     retail public. Requests the President's Working Group to \n     conduct a study on the regulatory treatment of swaps offered \n     to retail customers.\n       Sec. 23. Technical and Conforming Amendments. Makes \n     technical and conforming amendments throughout the CEA to \n     reflect changes made by the bill.\n       Sec. 24. Effective Date. The Act takes effect on the date \n     of enactment, except section 8 (dealing with futures on \n     securities), which takes effect one year after \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Lugar, chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee, to introduce the Commodity Futures \nModernization Act of 2000. The formal purpose of this legislation is to \nreauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act, the legal authority for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. As important as that is, this \nlegislation does far more.\n  This is a landmark bill, that addresses four chief goals that Senator \nLugar and I set out to achieve when we first began discussing this \nlegislation. First of all, this bill would repeal the so-called Shad-\nJohnson Accord, the 18-year-old temporary prohibition on the trading of \nfutures based on individual stocks. Second, the bill eliminates the \nlegal uncertainly that today hangs as an ominous cloud over the $7 \ntrillion financial swaps markets. Third, the bill addresses the need to \nharmonize the treatment of margins among the futures, stock, and \noptions markets. Fourth, the bill provides important and necessary \nregulatory relief to the futures and securities markets.\n  One of the most notable aspects of this bill is that it brings \ntogether the chairmen of the two committees with jurisdiction over \nthese issues, the Agriculture Committee and the Banking Committee. To \nstart out with such cooperation speaks well, I believe, for the \nprospects for this legislation. While the Commodity Exchange Act is \nclearly within the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, stocks, \noptions, and swaps are within the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  The next step for this bill will be joint hearings of our two \ncommittees to consider it. Few bills are in a perfected form when first \nintroduced, and I fully expect that additional changes will be made to \nthis one before it becomes law. For example, I hope to see additional \nmeasures of regulatory relief for the securities markets included.\n  But this bill is a fine beginning, introduced in the best way. We \nbring together two committees that could choose to argue over turf but \ninstead are choosing to cooperate to make changes in law that are \nneeded to ensure that our financial market places continue to lead the \nworld. At the same time, we will be providing the widest choice of \ninvestment opportunities for American businesses and families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Bryan, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Hollings, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Robb, Mr. Roberts, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Enzi, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        DeWine):\n  S. 2698. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan incentive to ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable \naccess to the Internet over current and future generations of broadband \ncapability; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 broadband internet access act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, joined by my colleagues Senators \nKerry, Rockefeller, Snowe, Allard, Baucus, Breaux, Brownback, Bryan, \nBunning, Burns, Daschle, Durbin, Enzi, Hollings, Hutchinson, Johnson, \nKennedy, Kerrey, Landrieu, Lincoln, Mikulski, Reid, Robb, Roberts, \nSchumer, and Thurmond, I am introducing the Broadband Internet Access \nAct of 2000. This legislation provides a tax incentive to stimulate \nrapid deployment of high-speed communication services to residential, \nrural, and low-income areas.\n  A term of art often used for high-speed communication service is \n``broadband.'' The term is a remnant from the era of analog systems. It \nrefers to the size of spectral bandwidth over which signals can be \ntransmitted. Even though it is not essential to have wide spectra in \nthe digital world to transmit vast amounts of data, ``broadband'' \nremains in our digital society's lexicon for high-speed communication \nor throughput.\n  In common use, broadband connotes fast Internet access, and that is \ncertainly part of the goal of this legislation. The grander goal, \nhowever, extends beyond simply expediting traditional Internet use. It \nis to deliver, in the near future, a wide array of voice, video, and \ndata communication services, at extremely fast speeds, to all \nAmericans.\n  The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 provides graduated tax \ncredits for deployment of high-speed communications to residential and \nrural communities. It gives a 10-percent credit for the deployment of \nat least 1.5 million bits per second downstream and 200,000 bits per \nsecond upstream to all subscribers--residential, business, and \ninstitutions--in rural and low income areas. This is essentially \n``current generation'' broadband. The bill gives a 20-percent credit \nfor the deployment of at least 22 million bits per second downstream \nand 10 million bits per second upstream to all subscribers in rural and \nlow income areas, and to all residential customers in other areas. This \nis what we are calling ``next generation'' broadband.\n  The bill does not dictate the technological means by which these \nbroadband services are to be delivered. Today, the possibilities \ninclude telephone lines, cable modems, fiber optics, terrestrial \nwireless, and satellite wireless. In the future there may be others. \nWhether high-speed communications are delivered by electrons or by \nphotons, with wires or without wires, by copper or by glass, by \nterrestrial or by extraterrestrial means, is immaterial. With a \ntemporary tax credit, it is economically feasible to push national \ncommunication capabilities forward by ten or perhaps twenty years. The \nbill permits a variety of technological approaches to make under-served \nareas more economically attractive to broadband providers. Yesterday we \nhad electronics. Today we have photonics. Tomorrow we will have some \n``future-onics.''\n  Mr. President, as I stand before you today, the streets of \nWashington, D.C. and of many other major cities in this country are \nbeing torn-up to lay cables for high-speed communication. Line-of-sight \ncommunication ``dishes'' are being installed on office buildings \npermitting business-to-business voice, video, and data transmissions. \nThe problem is, market forces are driving deployment of high-speed \ncommunication capabilities almost exclusively to urban businesses and \nwealthy households. Low-income families, exurban communities, rural \nbusinesses, and rural families are relegated to the back of the queue. \nThe bill gives private industry economic incentives to accelerate high-\nspeed communication capabilities to Americans who are at the end-of-\nthe-line.\n  Why is this important? Let me offer examples of this technology's \npower and importance. I start with two historical cases.\n  During the 1950's the National Institute of Mental Health funded a \n1,278-\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\nmile closed-circuit telephone system between seven state hospitals in \nNebraska, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Health care providers \nat the hospitals held weekly teleconferencing lectures via this system. \nBy 1961, the system included both audio and video, and psychiatrists \nsuccessfully used it to care for patients under a program called \n``telepsychiatry.''\n  At about the same time, radiologists in Montreal had a coaxial cable \nlaid between two hospitals three miles apart, thus connecting them for \naudio and video communications. Doctors were regularly transmitting \nradiographic images to each other to consult on difficult cases and to \nconduct educational conferences.\n  As a result of these two projects, patients were treated by \nphysicians who were, in some cases, hundreds of miles away. The medical \nprofession was able to share information and ideas, which improved \nhealthcare in this country and Canada.\n  Unfortunately, such ``telemedicine'' links are very few, even though \nour ability to transmit data has increased. Why? Because there is no \nnationwide high-speed data-transfer infrastructure. Instead, the \nstandard business Internet speed in rural areas is 56,000 bits per \nsecond. What can be done at that speed? Printed matter can be sent and \nreceived reasonably quickly. But photographs or graphics, require long \nwaits, and then often with poor image quality. More advanced uses, such \nas video conferencing, are out of the question. At faster Internet \nspeeds of, say, 200,000 to 300,000 bits per second, information can be \nsent much faster. Photographs and graphics leap to the screen, instead \nof crawling. Video conferencing also is possible, although jittery \nimages and low image resolution make it impractical. Music and movies \ncan be downloaded slowly to a compact disk.\n  At higher data transfer speeds--about 1.5 million bits per second--\nthe amount and quality of information that can be transmitted becomes \nquite good. Very good video conferencing is possible. Two or more \npeople in different places can see and talk to each other as if in the \nsame room, at a crisp image resolution and without image jitter.\n  And at even higher speeds, extraordinarily rich images of movement, \ncolor, and detail can be transmitted as if one were looking at them in \nperson. Complex medical images can be sent and received. At twenty \nmillion bits per second, a digitized mammography image can be \ntransmitted in about fifteen seconds, and a standard chest x-ray in \nabout four seconds.\n  Twenty million bits per second is about 360 times faster than the \nfastest speeds available on a conventional modem attached to a Plain \nOld Telephone Service, or, as I am told, POTS. Is it really possible to \ndo this? Indeed, it is. The technology exists now. Over ordinary copper \nwire, some of our communication companies are now offering data speeds \nof 26 million bits per second.\n  Imagine the tremendous personal and economic benefits our nation will \nreap with universal high-speed communication access, including \ntelemedicine; telecommuting; distance learning at all education levels; \nelectronic commerce in low-income and rural communities; digital \nphotography; and entertainment video. As a result, we will enjoy \ngreater educational opportunities, greater geographic freedom, \nincreased wealth in low-income areas, and even decreased urban \ncongestion.\n  So if the benefits are so great and the capability exists, why are \nthese technologies not widely available? Simple economics. It is much \nmore lucrative to provide services to business customers. Although a \nfew affluent individuals in urban areas have high speed Internet \naccess, the great majority of Americans are limited to extremely slow \ncommunication or to none at all.\n  That is why it is appropriate for government to step in at this time \nand provide an incentive to stimulate deployment of high-speed \ncommunication service to residential areas and small businesses, \nespecially in rural and low-income areas of the country. Our country \nhas a proud history of supporting critical services in rural and under-\nserved communities.\n  Three major examples are utilities, interstate highways, and the \nairline industries.\n  The Rural Utilities Service is a federal credit agency within the \nDepartment of Agriculture that helps rural areas finance electric, \ntelecommunications, water, and waste water projects. Its lending \ncreates public-private partnerships to finance the construction of \ninfrastructure in rural areas. Working in partnership with rural \ntelephone cooperatives and companies, the Department of Agriculture \nhelped boost the number of rural Americans with telephone service from \n38 percent in 1950 to more than 95 percent in 1999.\n  The federal government funded 90 to 100 percent of the cost of \nbuilding the interstate highway system. The Federal Aid Highway Act of \n1956 initiated a nationwide program that aimed to be completed within \n20 years. The bulk of the program was completed within this time \nperiod, although full implementation was not achieved until the early \n1990s.\n  In the 1930s, the airline industry--much like today's Internet start-\nups--was operating at a loss. Believing airline service to be both \nunique and necessary, the federal government stepped-in with an airmail \nsubsidy in 1938, and this federal funding made the industry instantly \nprofitable. The airline industry then flourished, and the subsidy was \nremoved in the mid 1950s.\n  In a 1979 speech titled, ``Technology and Human Freedom,'' I stated, \n``I believe that government can and should seek to advance technology--\nas a condition of social progress.'' I still believe that. In 1979, I \nwent on to say, ``In my view, only a person of what St. Augustine would \nhave termed `indomitable ignorance' could deny that technology has \ngreatly enhanced human freedom. . . . Freedom is choice, and technology \nvastly enhances choice. . . . The relation between technology and \ndemocracy is intimate. . . . Experimentation, variety, optimism: these \nare the ingredients of both technology and democracy.''\n  In 1978, the late Mancur Olson, an esteemed economist, cautioned that \nthe very liberty of societies such as ours may be the source of \ndevelopments that make innovation considerably more difficult. We \nshould guard against the prospect of our government retarding \ntechnology as Professor Olson hypothesized. The bill I introduce today \nencourages technology, and extends its range to those residential and \nbusiness areas it otherwise would not reach until much later.\n  We need this legislation now to maintain our technological \nleadership. As the press has recently reported, Sweden, Japan, \nSingapore, and Canada are deploying broadband at levels higher than \nthose called for in this bill. We cannot afford to fall behind in this \ncritical area. History indicates that, if we do not act aggressively, \nit will take a very long time to deploy broadband services on a \nwidespread basis. The first regular, sustained commercial telephone \nservices were offered in 1876, but it took more than 90 years to make \nthe service available to 90 percent of residences in the United States. \nIt would be deplorable if it takes even half as long to bring existing \nbroadband technology to the same number of Americans.\n  If the Internet is the information superhighway, broadband \ncommunication is the information super sonic transport. I want to \nencourage the communications industry to accelerate deployment of the \nthis super sonic transport to every community in the country.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their support and collaboration on \nthis bill. Senator John Kerry and his staff have been involved in every \naspect of this legislation, and we could not have formulated the bill \nwithout their detailed knowledge of the communications industry. And \nSenators Rockefeller and Snowe recently introduced a similar bill \nfocusing on the deployment of broadband in rural areas, and the \nlegislation we introduce today incorporates and expands upon their \nwork.\n  This bill is meant to be a proposal. As we consider this measure, \nCongress may decide to modify it. Moreover, we have not yet received a \nrevenue estimate on the bill, and if it proves to be too expensive, we \nwill have to scale it back. It is time, however, to focus on this \nissue. Let us begin the discussion of how we can provide the stimulus \nnecessary to ensure the availability of high-speed communication to \nevery\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nAmerican. I urge the Senate to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and \nletters of support from a number of organizations appear in the Record. \n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Broadband Internet Access \n     Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Internet has been the single greatest contributor \n     to the unprecedented economic expansion experienced by the \n     United States over the last 8 years.\n       (2) Increasing the speed that Americans can access the \n     Internet is necessary to ensure the continued expansion.\n       (3) Today, most residential Internet users, especially \n     those located in low income and rural areas, are extremely \n     limited in the type of information they can send and receive \n     over the Internet because their means of access is limited to \n     ``narrowband'' communications media, typically conventional \n     phone lines at a maximum speed of 56,000 bits per second.\n       (4) Similarly, small businesses in low income and rural \n     areas are also deprived of full information access because of \n     their dependence on narrowband facilities.\n       (5) By contrast, many residential users located in higher \n     income urban and suburban areas and urban business users can \n     access the Internet from a variety of carriers at current \n     generation broadband speeds in excess of 1,500,000 bits per \n     second, giving them a choice among carriers and high-speed \n     access to a wide array of audio and data applications.\n       (6) The result is a growing disparity in the speed of \n     access to the Internet and the opportunities it creates \n     between subscribers located in low income and rural areas and \n     subscribers located in higher income urban and suburban \n     areas.\n       (7) At the same time, experts project that, under current \n     financial and regulatory conditions, the facilities needed to \n     transmit next generation broadband services over the Internet \n     to residential users at speeds in excess of 10,000,000 bits \n     per second will not be as ubiquitously available as is \n     telephone service until sometime between the years 2030 and \n     2040.\n       (8) Experts also believe that, under current financial and \n     regulatory conditions, the disparity in access will be \n     exacerbated with the deployment of next generation broadband \n     capability.\n       (9) The disparity in current broadband access to the \n     Internet, the slow pace of deployment of next generation \n     broadband capability, and the projected disparity in access \n     to such capability will likely prove detrimental to the on-\n     going economic expansion.\n       (10) It is, therefore, appropriate for Congress to take \n     action to narrow the current and future disparity in the \n     level of broadband access to the Internet, and to accelerate \n     deployment of next generation broadband capability.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to accelerate \n     deployment of current generation broadband access to the \n     Internet for users located in certain low income and rural \n     areas and to accelerate deployment of next generation \n     broadband access for all Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

WorldCom, a leading \n     Internet backbone provider, believes broadband technology \n     will improve the quality of life for millions of Americans \n     and assist in maintaining this country's leadership in the \n     worldwide information technology marketplace. Your support of \n     our efforts to modernize communications infrastructure dates \n     at least to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, when you supported \n     legislation designed to enhance advanced telecommunications \n     investment.\n       Electronic commerce and its Internet medium is a thriving \n     environment. More jobs, more gross domestic product, and more \n     wealth have been created by the Internet than any other \n     single innovation in recent memory. Electronic commerce \n     continues to grow apace, creating increased need for \n     continuing development and deployment of communications \n     technology.\n       Your proposal, Senator Moynihan, is designed to support \n     that deployment and development at an advanced level. It is \n     designed not only to accelerate deployment of existing \n     technology, but also to encourage development and deployment \n     of next generation broadband technologies as well. \n     Acceleration is important. Persons needing distance education \n     cannot wait while job opportunities pass them by; businesses \n     facing competitive pressure cannot wait to engage in the \n     latest Internet based inventory planning; rural residents \n     with a great idea for a new dot.com need high speed \n     connectivity now; and persons suffering from serious disease \n     far from the right medical experts cannot wait for a \n     telemedicine connection.\n       WorldCom appreciates your effort to support this critical \n     technology and supports your efforts through the Broadband \n     Internet Access Act of 2000. While we would like to see a \n     proposal broader than the ``last mile'', your bill initiates \n     this all-important process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Catherine R.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: Congratulations on your leadership \n     in developing and introducing the ``Broadband Internet Access \n     Act of 2000.'' I am writing to provide you with Bell \n     Atlantic's support and views regarding this important tax \n     legislation.\n       As you know, Bell Atlantic is a leader in the deployment of \n     broadband capability, particularly in the state of New York. \n     As such, we are extremely familiar with the regulatory and \n     financial hurdles associated with deploying broadband to all \n     our business and residential customers. We believe that rapid \n     deployment of this capability will provide the basis for \n     sustained long-run economic growth in the economy. Our \n     experience with the Internet has taught us that the \n     convergence of communications and computing yields tremendous \n     benefits for the economy in terms of productivity growth.\n       Unfortunately, other carriers and we face tremendous \n     government hurdles as we roll out this capability. These \n     hurdles arise from the unintended adverse effects of \n     regulation on investment that, in turn, increase the degree \n     of financial uncertainty associated with such investments. In \n     other words, we face a regulatory problem and a financial \n     problem in deploying broadband capability to our customers. \n     The Broadband Internet Access Act helps to overcome these \n     problems by encouraging Bell Atlantic and other carriers \n     through financial incentives to proceed with these \n     investments. More importantly, the targeted nature of the \n     incentives will help us reach customers in rural areas and \n     low-income areas that are otherwise difficult to serve \n     because of the high cost of deployment and other factors.\n       The bill does not address the overwhelming regulatory \n     issues, which Bell Atlantic continues to face. We encourage \n     you to support legislation to address these problems as well \n     as the financial issues that are addressed in the Broadband \n     Act.\n       We encourage you to enact the Broadband Internet Access Act \n     this year. We appreciate your leadership on this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas J.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Finance, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: During the course of the past year, \n     the term ``digital divide'' has quickly become the buzzword \n     of choice among policymakers. Coined ostensibly to describe \n     the absence of communications availability to certain \n     segments of the nation's population, the term has been \n     twisted to imply the issue of communications ``haves'' and \n     ``have-nots'' is merely a rural vs. urban matter.\n       NTCA has vigorously moved to redirect the discussion to \n     fully recognize the achievements of small rural incumbent \n     local exchange carriers (ILECs) in deploying advanced \n     communications infrastructure and services. The facts bear \n     witness to the success of small rural ILECs in stepping up to \n     what we feel is better described as the ``Digital \n     Challenge.'' Recent surveys show that in many cases, markets \n     served by such entities are more technologically advanced \n     than their larger, urban counterparts. Likewise, they are \n     significantly more advanced than the rural markets served by \n     the nation's large ILECs. Other reports show that urban areas \n     in general are not the ``digital Mecca'' many would have us \n     believe. The reality is that the markets of the nation's \n     small rural ILECs are anything but communications technology \n     wastelands as many are portraying them to be.\n       Nevertheless, there remains a substantial amount of costly \n     work to be done for all markets to be fully advanced service-\n     capable. For this reason, we commend your effort, vis-a-vis \n     the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000, to further \n     stimulate deployment of broadband services by granting tax \n     credits to telecommunications providers deploying advanced \n     technologies. Furthermore, we sincerely appreciate your \n     effort to recognize the special circumstances, with regard to \n     tax credits, of the nation's rural telecommunications \n     cooperatives by the inclusion of the Special Rule for Mutual \n     or Cooperative Telephone Companies.\n       In addition, there are several existing tools such as the \n     universal service support program that, if allowed to \n     function appropriately, could help offset the tremendous \n     costs associated with the deployment of advanced services. We \n     continue to work with several of your colleagues to advance \n     legislation that will ensure the universal service program is \n     allowed to function as the Congress envisioned in helping \n     lead the deployment of new communications technologies and \n     services.\n       It must be reiterated that small rural ILECs have long led \n     the way in meeting the Digitial Challenge by deploying new \n     technologies--not just to their most profitable customers, \n     but to every individual within their market that wishes to \n     receive service. With your assistance, the rural ILEC \n     industry will continue to maintain its unparalleled record of \n     service.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Shirley Bloomfield,\n\n                                        Vice President, Government\n     Affairs & Association Services.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Bristol Bay Area\n\n\n                                           Health Corporation,\n\n                                     Dillingham, AK, May 31, 2000.\n\n     Re Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Daniel Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We are writing to indicate our \n     support for your continued effort to pass the Broadband \n     Internet Access Act of 2000. If passed, this legislation \n     could significantly improve access of millions of Americans \n     to the Internet and its valuable resources, including \n     residents of rural Alaska communities.\n       We provide health care services to 34 remote Alaska \n     communities, most of which can only be reached by small \n     airplane. The availability of affordable advanced \n     telecommunications including telemedicine and improved \n     Internet access would be beneficial in providing health \n     education to villagers; would help reduce feelings of \n     isolation of health care providers, teachers and other \n     professionals; and provide access to health care resources \n     for everyone. It would also provide faster and less expensive \n     access to all communication mediums.\n       We believe that remote, rural areas such as those that make \n     up a large part of Alaska need and deserve the availability \n     of affordable high-speed Internet services like urban \n     communities currently enjoy. Without this availability, rural \n     communities will continue to be left behind and \n     technologically outdated as the rest of the U.S. moves \n     forward.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important \n     legislation. Please contact me at (907) 842-5201 if I can be \n     of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert J.

Patrick Daniel Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: We are writing to encourage you in \n     your effort to pass the Broadband Internet Access Act of \n     2000. If passed, this important legislation could \n     significantly improve the way millions of Americans gain \n     access to health information and receive health care.\n       For many years the Imaging Sciences and Information Systems \n     (ISIS) Center at Georgetown University has been a successful \n     innovator of technologies that are used to improve the \n     quality and lower the cost of health care. This contribution, \n     however, accounts for only two-thirds of the receipt for \n     successful health care reform in America. The third element, \n     improved access to health services, has been one of the most \n     challenging, especially to health care providers and \n     consumers in rural America.\n       Access to quality health care cannot be improved through \n     development of more efficient technologies, alone. We, and \n     with us many of our colleagues throughout America, believe \n     financial incentives are necessary to correct current \n     regulatory and market insufficiencies that inhibit assess to \n     emerging health services that increasingly rely on \n     telecommunications and Internet connectivity to reach \n     consumers. The creation of these incentives is outside the \n     purview of the health sector and that is why we look to you \n     and your Senate colleagues. You can help remedy the economic \n     conditions that contribute to the growing ``digital divide'', \n     that made second class citizens out of underserved people \n     throughout the country.\n       Specifically, we look to you for a remedy that will improve \n     access and availability of telephone, cable, fiber optic, \n     terrestrial, wireless, and satellite telecommunications \n     services at bandwidth capacities sufficient to carry high \n     resolution images, video and voice over the Internet, \n     increasingly the preferred mode of delivery. We believe your \n     proposed legislation addressed these problems through its 10% \n     tax credit for deployment of ``last-mile'' current generation \n     broadband capability to rural and underserved areas, and its \n     20% credit for ``next generation'' service.\n       Therefore we applaud your sponsorship of the Broadband \n     Internet Access Act of 2000. We appreciate your vision and \n     look to you and your colleagues in the Senate to rapidly pass \n     this important legislation so that we can move on to a next \n     generation of health care with improved quality, cost and \n     access.\n       Thank you for an opportunity to express our support for \n     your initiative.

The \n     Congress of the United States has the opportunity to help \n     deliver long needed Telecommunication Services to all \n     Americans.

Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am writing to endorse with \n     enthusiasm the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 and to \n     congratulate you for your leadership for introducing this \n     important legislation.\n       As you may know, Corning is a leader in optical \n     communications systems. As such, we have great confidence in \n     the benefits that deployment of broadband to all Americans \n     can confer on the economy and society as a whole. As Alan \n     Greenspan has said many times, the Internet has contributed \n     significantly to the on-going economic expansion. The rapid \n     deployment of broadband access can extend the benefits of the \n     Internet well into the future.\n       Unfortunately, broadband is being deployed very slowly in \n     this country. Two specific problems have arisen. First, \n     subscribers in rural and underserved low-income areas are \n     unlikely to gain access to the current generation broadband \n     capability any time soon, giving rise to a ``digital divide'' \n     between information haves and have-nots. Secondly, the \n     deployment of next generation broadband capability will take \n     30 to 40 years in the current regulatory and financial \n     environment. We think America can do better for its citizens \n     by immediate enactment of the Broadband Internet Access Act \n     of 2000.\n       We believe your legislation addresses these problems \n     through its 10% tax credit for deployment of last-mile \n     current generation broadband capability to rural and \n     underserved areas, and its 20% credit of next generation \n     technology more generally. These incentives will correct \n     current regulatory and market failures that are inhibiting \n     the investment. Moreover, the credits are temporary, lasting \n     only five years, a sufficient time to kick-start the \n     deployment of the technology and to reduce costs in this very \n     dynamic sector.\n       It is important to note that broadband infrastructure is a \n     common good. As such, we believe that a well-designed \n     initiative such as the Broadband Internet Access Act can cost \n     effectively enhance the national welfare.\n       Again, I congratulate you for taking the leadership and for \n     developing a creative initiative that will benefit the \n     country for decades to come.\n           All the best,\n     Roger Ackerman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Association for Local\n\n\n                                  Telecommunications Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2000.\n     Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: The Association for Local \n     Telecommunications Services (ALTS) thanks you for your \n     leadership in drafting legislation to create financial \n     incentives for telecommunications companies to offer high-\n     speed Internet broadband services. The legislation that you \n     introduce today will help companies expand their businesses \n     into rural and urban communities and will also provide them \n     with incentives to offer broadband service at even higher \n     speeds.\n       We are especially grateful of your continuing efforts to \n     support competitive telecommunications companies in local \n     markets. While competitors have made enormous progress in \n     rolling out advanced telecommunications services to consumers \n     across the country, many markets remain uneconomic to serve. \n     Your legislation will help to accelerate the deployment of \n     these broadband services in rural, inner city and other \n     underserved areas. We have seen that the best way to \n     encourage deployment of advanced broadband technologies is to \n     encourage competition for local telecommunications services. \n     ALTS believes your legislation will provide significant \n     financial incentives to competitive companies to roll out \n     high speed broadband services for every consumer who wants to \n     receive the service.\n       Your legislation is a realistic effort to close the \n     ``digital divide'' between rural and urban communities and to \n     ensure that all Americans have the fastest and best \n     telecommunications service in the world. We look forward to \n     continuing to work with you on this legislation in the coming \n     weeks.\n       Thank you again for your support of competition and the \n     rapid deployment of advanced, broadband services to all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             John Windhausen, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   Queens College,\n\n\n                                      Department of Economics,\n\n                                       New York, NY, June 1, 2000.\n\n     Re The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000.\n\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Minority Leader, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: I am aware that you and other \n     Senators are co-sponsors of ``The Broadband Internet Access \n     Act of 2000,'' a bill that is intended to alleviate the \n     disparity in high-speed access to the Internet. Preliminary \n     research undertaken by Florence Kwan and myself shows that \n     discrepancies in high-speed access do exist at this time. \n     Further, the study demonstrates the need for policy-makers to \n     examine the degree to which all members of society have high-\n     speed access to the Internet.\n       The study was based upon a sampling of residential lines in \n     the United States. The results suggest that income and \n     population density are significant predictors of access to \n     cable-modem or DSL service. High-speed access is less likely \n     to be available to Americans in rural and low-income \n     neighborhoods. As preliminary research, the study underscores \n     the need for further research that is comprehensive in scope \n     and that can serve as the basis for regulatory policy.\n       I commend your efforts to address an issue that is critical \n     to the ability of all Americans to be part of the Information \n     Society and to participate in our system of democracy.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                      David Gabel,\n                                                        Professor.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator Moynihan \nin introducing the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. I commend the \nSenator from New York for his leadership on this issue, and I look \nforward to working with Senator Moynihan, Senator Rockefeller and \nothers in this critical effort to ensure the rapid deployment of high-\nspeed telecommunications services to all Americans.\n  Mr. President, throughout the course of history, prosperity has \nflowed to those economies that had ready access to avenues of commerce. \nThroughout the middle ages and up until the mid-19th century, that \nmeant ready proximity to a waterway. The great cities of Italy, England \nand France all lay on oceans or rivers. In North America, the early \ntrading points on or near the Atlantic thrived and became New York, \nBoston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Throughout this time, the primary \nway to ship goods was over water, and economies prospered along oceans \nor major inland waterways because of the paramount importance of access \nto commerce. With the industrial revolution came the advent of the \nrailroad and this new way of getting goods to market. If your town was \nfortunate to be along one of many rail lines, then good economic times \noften lay ahead. If your town was not along the railroad, then you were \nat a serious economic disadvantage. We read today about the ``ghost \ntowns'' of the old West--these were the towns left behind because the \nrailroad passed them by. And even then, one hundred seventy years ago, \nwe know that Americans did all they could to connect themselves to the \nnetworks--waterways, railroads--that delivered goods to market: along \nthe Panhandle, the entire town of Ivanhoe, Oklahoma literally uprooted \nitself--picked up the church, the school, the buildings--and moved \nacross the Texas border to be closer to the railroad lines.\n  In many ways, that is precisely the challenge facing thousands of \ncommunities across the nation today: communities are rushing and \nhurrying--and too many are struggling and finding it enormously \ndifficult--to get connected to the networks on which we conduct \nbusiness in the New Economy. And, Mr. President, unless we are willing \nto countenance thousands of ghost towns across the landscape of the \n21st century--ghost towns of inner city and rural America--we must work \ntogether to empower every community to meet that challenge.\n  Mr. President, today, the major product in the United States is \ninformation. The ability to send and receive vast amounts of \ninformation, quickly and efficiently, often determines the success or \nfailure of a company in our new information age. For this reason, \ncompanies are locating where they have high-speed access to this new \navenue of commerce, and they are shying away from areas where such \nexcess is either prohibitively expensive or unavailable. High-speed \naccess is also\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\nproviding new opportunities in terms of educating our children and \ncaring for the sick. However, those opportunities are available only to \nthose communities with efficient and affordable access to high-speed \nlines.\n  Herein lies the problem. As would be expected, telecommunications \ncompanies are deploying advanced networks initially in areas where \nthere are lots of attractive consumers, but are often taking their time \nto build-out elsewhere, such as in low-income urban and rural areas. \nThat's why a downtown business consumer has a myriad of choices for \nhigh-speed access. And most residential consumers living in reasonable \nwell-off urban and suburban areas also have a choice. However, many, \nmany regions of our country still have little or no ability to obtain \nhigh-speed access to the Internet.\n\n  According to the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, of the 351 \ntowns in Massachusetts, only 164 are wired to receive high-speed DSL \nInternet service, and only 145 are wired to receive high-speed cable \nmodem service. Significantly, 151 towns have no DSL or cable modem \noption, only 56 kilobit dial-up Internet service. Moreover, this \nsituation is not expected to change anytime soon. The Legg Mason \nPrecursor groups estimates that even three or fours years down the \nroad, half of America will have either one or zero broadband providers \nto choose from.\n  We need to address this problem in order to ensure that no area is \nleft behind--to ensure that all Americans are able to benefit from our \nnew high-tech economy. Many telecommunications companies legitimately \nargue that deploying in certain areas makes little sense because the \nopportunity to recoup the investment is so small. It's time we listened \nand offered an economic incentive to change the equation. To this end, \nour bill establishes a generous 10 percent tax credit to all companies \nwilling to deploy and offer 1.5 megabit high-speed Internet service in \nrural and low-income urban areas. We are advocating such an approach \nbecause we have heard from industry that this will provide a needed \nincentive to deploy in areas that are presently neglected. \nSignificantly, this credit is open to all companies be they telephone \nor cable, wireline or wireless, MMDS or satellite. The bill is \nconcerned only with encouraging widespread deployment, and is \nabsolutely technology neutral.\n  Mr. President, our legislation addresses not only the digital divide \nthat exists today, but also looks to the future and to the next \ngeneration of high-speed services. The next generation of advanced \nservices will require substantially higher transmission speeds like 4 \nmegabits for one channel of standard television, 20 megabits for one \nchannel of HDTV, and 10 to 100 megabits for Ethernet data. These \ntransmission speeds can only be achieved with more advanced technology \nsuch as fiber optics, very high speed digital subscriber line, 50-home-\nnode cable modems, and next-generation wireless.\n  The services available at such speeds will truly revolutionize and \nimprove our daily lives. However, according to economists from the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute, at the current rate of deployment, such \nadvanced technology will not achieve universal penetration until \nsomewhere between 2030 and 2040. Furthermore, such delay may seriously \nundermine our global leadership in technology. Indeed, according to a \nrecent report in the Wall Street Journal, the Japanese company NTT will \nstart bringing optical fiber lines directly to homes in Tokyo and Osaka \nby the end of this year. Such networks will have capabilities of up to \n10 megabits downstream--several times faster than most of the high-\nspeed services offered today in America.\n  Such Internet capability will transform American life in ways we can \nonly imagine today. Children can download educational video in real \ntime on nearly any subject. Adults can train for new jobs from their \nhomes. Complex medical images such as MRIs and x-rays that today take \nseveral minutes to download can be transmitted in a matter of seconds. \nTelecommuting, business teleconferencing and personal communication \nwill all rise to new levels.\n  To accelerate the roll-out of such next-generation systems in the US, \nwe propose to establish a 20 percent tax credit for companies that \ndeploy systems capable of providing 22 megabit downstream/10 megabit \nupstream service to residential consumers everywhere and business \nconsumers in low-income urban and rural areas. Such bits speeds will \nallow for different users in a home to simultaneously watch 3 different \nchannels of digital television and utilize high-speed Ethernet-\ncomparable Internet access.\n  Mr. President, this measure is intended to begin the debate in the \nSenate on how best to address the growing digital divide and to \naccelerate the deployment of next-generation technologies across our \nnation. I want to thank Senator Moynihan for his extraordinary \nleadership on this issue and his staff for their continued hard work in \ncrafting this bill. I also wish to commend Senators Rockefeller and \nSnowe for their work on tax credit legislation which we incorporate and \nexpand on in this bill. Finally, I wish to extend my gratitude to all \nthe members of industry who worked with us over these past few months \nin crafting this bill. Clearly, this is a very complex topic and we are \ncontinuing to work to find the right solution. I look forward to \ncontinuing our partnership and to passing meaningful legislation this \nyear.\n  The challenge today is extraordinary--its implications absolutely \nunmistakable for our country. Too often we talk about a digital divide \nin the United States as if it were unchangeable, as if it were a simple \nfact of life in this nation that some communities will be empowered by \ntechnology while others will be left behind. But this is a false \nchoice--and we ought to be doing everything in our power as policy \nmakers, working harmoniously with industry, to offer a new choice: \nevery community connected to the new technology, every citizen provided \nwith the tools to make the most of their own talents in the New \nEconomy.\n  Mr. President, The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 is not a \npanacea for every challenge before us in the New Economy; significant \nquestions of education reform workforce development, and technology \ntraining must be resolved and reinvented before mere access to \ntechnology will allow full participation for every citizen in the \nInformation Age. But Mr. President, I ask that--as we work in a \nbipartisan way to address those other vital areas of public policy-- we \nremember the lessons of our nation's economic history and take this \nabsolutely critical first step towards meeting the most basic needs of \nany community--a connection to the New Economy.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join with \nSenator Moynihan in introducing the Broadband Internet Access Act of \n2000. This legislation provides a tax incentive to stimulate rapid \ndeployment of high-speed communication services to residential, rural, \nand low-income areas.\n  Although our nation continues to experience a period of unprecedented \neconomic growth, it is important to remember that this growth is not \nshared evenly throughout the country. My State, Montana, is \nunfortunately an example of areas in which the economy continues to lag \nbehind the rest of the nation. Montana is ranked last in per-capita \nearned income and first in the number of people holding multiple jobs. \nOur children and grandchildren are constantly faced with a difficult \ndilemma--will they be able to find jobs in Montana, where they can \ncontinue to enjoy living in ``the last great place'', or will they be \nforced to move elsewhere just to be able to earn a decent wage. More \nand more of them are choosing to leave, costing Montana some of her \nbest and brightest young people, and along with them much of our hope \nfor the future.\n  One of the keys to turning our State's economy around is to make sure \nthe appropriate infrastructure is in place so that we can attract the \nkinds of businesses that will provide jobs for ourselves and our \nchildren. I have worked for years as ranking Member of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee to ensure that Montana and other rural \nstates receive our fair share of highway construction funds, so that \nthe transportation infrastructure of our great State can support \neconomic growth.\n  But today's economy is not just about bricks and mortar. Technology \nis\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\ntransforming traditional ways of doing business, as it is creating \nentirely new forms of business that never existed before. And high-\nspeed Internet access is the key to advancing technological growth.\n  The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 provides graduated tax \ncredits for deployment of high-speed communications to residential and \nrural communities. It gives a 10 percent credit for the deployment of \nat least 1.5 million bits per second downstream and 200,000 bits per \nsecond upstream to all subscribers--residential, business, and \ninstitutions--in rural and low income areas. This is what we call the \n``current generation'' broadband. The bill also gives a 20 percent \ncredit for the deployment of at least 22 million bits per second \ndownstream and 10 million bits per second upstream to all subscribers \nin rural and low income areas, and to all residential customers in \nother areas. This is what we are calling ``next generation'' broadband.\n  Mr. President, as we look around us today and see the many streets \nthat are being torn-up to lay cables for high-speed communication, and \nthe communication dishes that are constantly ``sprouting'' from our \nbuildings, we may wonder why we need a tax credit to advance an \nindustry that is already growing by leaps and bounds. The reason, \nagain, is that this growth is most extensive in selected areas. Market \nforces are driving deployment of high-speed communication capabilities \nalmost exclusively to urban businesses and wealthy households. Rural \nbusinesses and rural families like those in Montana again find \nthemselves at the back of the line. And by the time our turn comes for \nthis technology, the rest of the country will already be well into the \nnext technological generation. The Digital Divide, which is already a \nwedge between our citizens, will be perpetuated and grow into a chasm.\n  This bill is designed to even the playing field. By giving private \nindustry economic incentives to accelerate high-speed communication \ncapabilities to Americans who are at the end of the line, we will help \npeople like my constituents in Montana share in our nation's economic \ngrowth.\n  As a member of the Senate Broadband Caucus, which was established to \ndevelop solutions to the problem of bringing high-speed Internet access \nto rural and underserved areas, I have worked hard on initiatives which \nwould help rural areas bridge the Digital Divide. These initiatives \ninclude: the Rural Broadband Enhancement Act, which provides $5 billion \nin low interest loans for broadband development; the Rural Telework Act \nof 2000, to provide grants to develop National Centers for Distance \nWorking which would provide access to technology and training for rural \nresidents; the Universal Service Support Act, which lifts the cap on \nthe universal service support fund for rural telecommunications \nproviders; and the amendment I offered to the Rural Television Bill, to \ngive consideration to projects which offer high speed Internet access \nin addition to television programming.\n  I believe these initiatives, along with the Broadband Internet Access \nAct we are introducing today, will go a long way toward finally \nbridging the growing Digital Divide and help rural areas grow and \nflourish. With this legislation, I hope to create an economic \nenvironment that will make sure Montana's children and grandchildren \nwill no longer have to sacrifice enjoying the beauty of the ``last \ngreat place'' in order to earn a living wage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2699. A bill to strengthen the authority of the Federal Government \nto protect individuals from certain acts and practices in the sale and \npurchase of social security numbers and social security account \nnumbers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/08/senate-section/article/S4834-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4834-S4854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n             SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join the \nadministration and, particularly the Vice President, in introducing the \nSocial Security Number Protection Act of 2000.\n  This legislation is designed to curb the unregulated sale and \npurchase of Social Security numbers, which have contributed \nsignificantly to a growing range of illegal activities, including \nfraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking and other violent \ncrimes.\n  Mr. President, in 1997, I introduced S. 600, the Personal Privacy \nInformation Act, with Senator Grassley after watching in dismay as one \nof my staff downloaded my own Social Security number off of the \nInternet in less than three minutes.\n  Nothing much has changed. For a mere $45, one can go online and \npurchase a person's Social Security number from a whole host of web \nbusinesses--no questions asked.\n  Why is it so important to stop the commercial sale of individuals' \npersonal Social Security numbers? Once a criminal has a potential \nvictim's Social Security number, that person becomes extremely \nvulnerable to having his or her whereabouts tracked and his or her \nidentity stolen.\n  The Social Security number is the Nation's de facto national \nidentifier. It is a key to one's public identity. The Federal \nGovernment uses it as a taxpayer identification number, the Medicare \nnumber, and as a soldier's serial number. States use the Social \nSecurity number as the identification number on drivers' licenses, \nfishing licenses, and other official records. Banks use it to establish \npersonal identification for credit. The number is requested by \ntelephone companies, gas companies, and even by brokerages when \nconsumers set-up personal accounts.\n  Thus, a criminal who purchases a Social Security number is well on \nhis way to fraudulently obtaining numerous services in the name of an \nunsuspecting American.\n  Partly due to this unrestricted traffic in Social Security numbers, \nour country is facing an explosion in identity theft crimes. The Social \nSecurity Administration recently reported that it had received more \nthan 30,000 complaints about the misuse of Social Security numbers, \nlast year, most of which had to do with identity theft. This is an \nincrease of 350% from 1997, when there were 7,868 complaints. In total, \nTreasury Department officials estimate that identity theft causes \nbetween $2 and $3 billion in losses each year--just from credit cards.\n  According to a recent survey of identity theft victims published \njointly by the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and CALPIRG, the average \nidentity theft victim has fraudulent charges of $18,000 made in his \nname. Typically, an identity theft victim spends approximately 175 \nhours of personal time over a two-year period to clean-up his credit \nrecord.\n  Sometimes, this unrestricted sale of personal information can have \ntragic results. Amy Boyer, a twenty-year old dental assistant in New \nHampshire, was killed last year by a stalker who bought her Social \nSecurity number off an Internet web site for $45. Armed with this \ncritical information, he tracked her down to her work address.\n  Here are some other examples of Social Security number misuse. Kim \nBrady, a constituent from Castro Valley, California, wrote to me that \nan identity thief obtained a credit card in her name on the Internet. \nThe application ``was approved in 10 seconds even though the \napplication only had [her] name, Social Security number, and birth date \ncorrect.'' When Ms. Bradbury contacted credit card companies and asked \nhow a credit card was issued in her name despite false information on \nthe application, the companies said they only look to ``see that the \nname and the Social Security number match.''\n  Another California constituent, Michelle Brown of Hermosa Beach, \ninformed me that a criminal used her Social Security number to \nfraudulently assume her identity. The perpetrator rang up a total of \n$50,000 in charges including a $32,000 truck and $5,000 worth of \nliposuction. In addition, the perpetrator used Michelle's identity to \nestablish wireless and residential telephone service, utilities \nservice, and to obtain a year-long residential lease.\n\n  Michelle notes that she has spent hundreds of hours trying to restore \nher good name and has endured ``weeks of sleepless nights, suffering \nfrom nearly no appetite, and nerve-shattering moments of my life \nspinning out of control.''\n  In another case, a retired air force officer was falsely billed for \n$113,000 on 33 different credit accounts after identity\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nthieves stole his Social Security number. He and his wife have dealt \nwith over a dozen third party collection agencies. They are also being \nsued by a furniture store in Texas and have had five automobiles \npurchased in their name.\n  I am pleased to work with the Administration on this bill because no \none should seek to profit from the sale of Social Security numbers in \ncircumstances that create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \nfinancial harm to the person to whom these numbers are assigned.\n  What would this bill do? The Social Security Number Protection Act \nwould impose criminal and civil penalties for the sale and purchase of \nSocial Security numbers. Specifically, it would direct the Federal \nTrade Commission to issue regulations prohibiting this sale.\n  The legislation would direct the FTC to permit exceptions to this ban \nin a very narrow range of circumstances, including where an individual \nhas consented to the sale, for law enforcement or national security \nreasons, in emergency situations to protect an individual's health and \nsafety, for research or public health purposes, and where the use of \nthe Social Security number is for a lawful purpose and is unlikely to \nresult in serious bodily, emotional, or financial harm of a Social \nSecurity number holder.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a very important step forward. The \nbill is carefully drawn. It simply prevents the sale of Social Security \nnumbers for profit, which can result in enormous wrongdoing to the \nindividual Social Security number holder.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. L. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2700. A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to promote the cleanup and \nreuse of brownfields, to provide financial assistance for brownfields \nrevitalization, to enhance State response programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  BROWNFIELDS REVITALIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. I rise today to introduce the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2000 together with \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Smith of New Hampshire, and Senator Baucus. \nWe are introducing this bill today because we support legislation that \nwill expedite cleanup of our nation's hazardous waste sites. We support \neconomic development in our neighborhoods and job creation in our \ncities. We also support invigorating our urban cores and bolstering \nlocal governments. Mr. President, we are introducing this legislation \ntoday because, if enacted, it has the potential to fulfill these \nobjectives, which are important to me and I believe to every Senator.\n  Brownfields are typically older commercial or industrial properties \nat which development is hindered by the presence--or even the potential \npresence--of hazardous substances. Countless numbers of brownfield \nsites blight our communities, pose health and environmental hazards, \nerode our cities' tax base, and contribute to urban sprawl. In fact, \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors has estimated that more than 450,000 \nbrownfield sites exist nationwide. But, we stand to reap enormous \neconomic, environmental, and social benefits with the successful \nredevelopment of brownfield sites. The redevelopment of brownfields \ncapitalizes on existing infrastructure, creates a robust tax base for \nlocal governments, attracts new businesses and jobs, reduces the \nenvironmental and health risks to communities, and preserves community \ncharacter. This can truly be a victory for everyone.\n  While everyone agrees that brownfield sites should be cleaned up, \npresently there are many problems that prevent us from cleaning up \nthese sites. Let me address the problems and how our legislation poses \nsolutions.\n  Problem: There is not enough funding to address the large number of \nbrownfield sites that exist.\n  Solution: The bill authorizes $150 million per year to state and \nlocal governments to perform assessments and cleanup at brownfield \nsites. It also authorizes $50 million per year to establish and enhance \nState brownfield programs.\n  Problem: Communities that strive to clean up sites, such as Riverside \nMills alongside the Woonasquatucket River in Providence, in order to \nturn them into greenspace, cannot since there will be no future income \nstream to repay a loan.\n  Solution: The bill will allow EPA to issue grants to state and local \ngovernments to clean up sites that will be converted into parks or open \nspace.\n  Problem: People who bought brownfield sites and did not cause the \ncontamination could be liable under Superfund.\n  Solution: The bill clarifies that innocent landowners, that act \nappropriately, are not responsible for paying cleanup costs.\n  Problem: Developers that want to purchase brownfield sites may be \nliable for future cleanup costs.\n  Solution: The bill encourages developers to purchase and develop \nbrownfield sites by exempting from liability prospective purchasers \nthat do not cause or worsen the contamination at a site.\n  Problem: Superfund liability issues prevent development of areas near \ncontaminated sites.\n  Solution: The bill includes an exemption from Superfund liability for \ncontiguous property owners.\n  Problem: Investors do not clean up brownfield sites because for fear \nthat EPA will ``second-guess'' their actions.\n  Solution: The bill offers finality by precluding EPA from taking an \naction at a site being addressed under a state cleanup program unless \nthere is an ``imminent and substantial endangerment'' to public health \nor the environment, and additional work needs to be done.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill with my esteemed colleagues from \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. The fact that this bill is \nsponsored by the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Superfund \nSubcommittee and the Environment and Public Works Committee speaks very \nhighly for the bipartisan efforts to achieve consensus on this issue.

Mr. President, I'm very pleased to announce that, \nafter months of very hard work, we have bipartisan legislation which \nwill clean up and redevelop the abandoned industrial sites known as \nBrownfields--S. 2700, the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 2000.\n  I first introduced Brownfields legislation in the Senate in 1993, in \nthe hopes of both protecting public health, and addressing the problems \nof blighted areas. Since that time, it has become clear that there are \neven more reasons to address Brownfields than we originally thought. In \nfact, there are few environmental issues which cut across so many \nproblems and offer so many solutions.\n  Mr. President, Brownfields threaten the health of our citizens--and \nthe economic health of communities across the country, by leading to \nabandoned inner cities, increased crime, loss of jobs and declining tax \nrevenues. Brownfields also lead to urban sprawl, loss of farmland, \nincreased traffic and air pollution and loss of historic districts in \nolder urban centers.\n  But once they're cleaned up and made useful again, they also \nrepresent tremendous potential in new jobs and a cleaner environment. \nNow, finally, we have a bipartisan plan to achieve those goals.\n  The legislation we're introducing today provides federal money to \ninvestigate and clean up Brownfields sites. State and local governments \nwould use this money to determine which sites pose environmental \nproblems, to decide which redevelopment options hold the greatest \npromise, and most important, to get these sites cleaned up.\n  Second, the legislation promises important private investments in the \ncleanup effort--by providing liability protection for people interested \nin buying and cleaning up these sites and for people who bought a \nBrownfields site without knowing it was contaminated. It also removes \npotential liability for parties who own property which becomes \ncontaminated through no fault of their own, from hazardous substances \nfrom an adjacent site. These liability limitations and clarifications \nwill help innocent parties and provide incentives to get these \nproperties cleaned up and back into use.\n  Third, this bill does several new and positive things for communities \nand for the environment. For the first time, it creates a public record \nof Brownfield sites handled under state programs, because the public \nhas a right to know what's happening at the sites near their homes. And \nit is the first Brownfields bill to provide funding not just to assist \nin redevelopment projects, but also to provide assistance to state and \nlocal governments to create and preserve open space, parklands and \nother recreational areas in former Brownfields sites.\n  Finally, the bill gives states incentives and funding to develop \nstate programs to clean up their Brownfield sites quickly and safely. \nIt has provisions to encourage cooperation and coordination between the \nfederal and state governments, both of whom play an active role in \ncleaning up these sites and protecting the citizens. The bill strikes a \ndelicate balance. It provides deference to state cleanup programs but \nstill ensures that the federal superfund program will be able to come \nin\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nand address problems when a site poses a serious problem.\n  The Brownfields cleanup and redevelopment strategy in this \nlegislation is comprehensive. It's fiscally responsible. And it will \nimprove the quality of life for people throughout the country. It \npromises thousands of new jobs and millions in new tax revenue. It \npromises increased momentum for smart growth, which means cleaner \nair and less congested roads.\n\n  It promises a new focus on revitalizing downtown areas, which will \nreduce urban sprawl, lower rates and protect parkland and open space. I \ncome from the most densely populated state in this country, and I \nunderstand the importance of protecting open space.\n  Mr. President, the nation's mayors estimate that Brownfields cost \nbetween $200 million and $500 million a year in lost tax revenues. \nReturning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new \njobs.\n  Just look at the progress we've made even over the last few years. \nGrants from the EPA to aid in cleaning up Brownfields sites have helped \ngenerate more than 5,800 jobs and about $1.8 billion in revenues. In \nNew Jersey alone, we've rescued more than 1,000 Brownfields sites, \nreplacing polluted lagoons with office centers and covering abandoned \nrail yards with condominium complexes.\n  These successes benefit everyone--both environmentally and \neconomically. Which is why this legislation has strong support from \nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n  Mr. President, in the 1960s, this country turned its attention away \nfrom downtown areas and started focusing on the suburbs. We see now \nwhat that got us: clogged highways, overcrowded airports, and increased \npollution.\n  It's time to turn that trend around. And that's exactly what this \nlegislation will do. I also want to thank my three colleagues for their \ndetermination and hard work in hammering out this compromise. Senator \nSmith, our new Chairman, has really reached out to all members of the \nCommittee to try to craft good environmental legislation.\n  Senator Baucus, the Democratic leader on our Committee, has been a \nstalwart advocate for a good Superfund program and a compromise \nBrownfields bill. We have fought many battles together over the years. \nFinally, Senator Chafee has shown great courage and energy, bringing us \ntogether to do what was once unthinkable, a Superfund related bill that \nhas bipartisan support. I look forward to working with all of them to \nensure that this bill is signed into law. Thank you. Following is a \nsummary of the bill.\n\n Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2000 \n                       (S. 2700)--Key Provisions\n\n       Provides critically needed funds to assess and clean up \n     abandoned and underutilized brownfield sites, which will \n     create jobs, increase tax revenues, preserve and create open \n     space and parks;\n       Provides legal protections for innocent parties, such as \n     contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and \n     innocent landowners;\n       Provides for funding and enhancement of state cleanup \n     programs, including limits where appropriate on enforcement \n     by the federal government at sites cleaned up under a State \n     response program. Provides a balance of certainty for \n     prospective purchasers, developers and others while ensuring \n     protection of the public health.\n       Creates a public record of brownfield sites and enhances \n     community involvement in site cleanup and reuse.\n       Provides for deferral of listing sites on the National \n     Priorities List if the state is taking action at the site.\n\n\n               TITLE I: BROWNFIELD REVITALIZATION FUNDING\n\n       Authorizes $150 million per year, for fiscal years 2001-\n     2005, for grants to local governments, States and Indian \n     tribes to inventory, assess and cleanup contaminated \n     brownfield sites, either through establishing a Revolving \n     Loan Fund or, in some circumstances, by giving a grant. \n     Provides criteria to be used in awarding these funds, \n     including the extent to which the money will protect human \n     health, spur redevelopment and create jobs, preserve open \n     space and parks, and represent a fair distribution of money \n     between urban and rural areas.\n\n\n             TITLE II: BROWNFIELD LIABILITY CLARIFICATIONS\n\n       Contiguous Property Owners--Generally provides Superfund \n     liability relief for innocent persons who own property that \n     is contaminated solely due to a release from another \n     property, so long as the person did not cause or contribute \n     to the release, and provide cooperation and access for the \n     cleanup.\n       Prospective Purchases--Generally provides Superfund \n     liability relief for innocent future buyers of brownfields \n     who are responsible for contamination and do not impede the \n     cleanup of the site, make all appropriate inquiry prior to \n     purchase, exercise appropriate care with respect to hazardous \n     substances, and provide cooperation and access to persons \n     cleaning up the site. The bill also provides for ``windfall \n     liens'' at sites where the government pays for the cleanup, \n     and the fair market value was enhanced by that effort.\n       Innocent Landowners--Clarifies relief from Superfund \n     liability for landowners who had no reason to know of \n     contamination at the time of purchase, despite having made \n     all appropriate inquiry into prior ownership and use of the \n     facility. Provides certainty to parties by clarifying what \n     needs to be done to satisfy the ``appropriate inquiry'' \n     requirement in the current statute.\n\n\n                   TITLE III: STATE RESPONSE PROGRAMS\n\n       Authorizes $50 million per year in fiscal years 2001-2005 \n     for grants to states and Indian tribes to establish and \n     enhance their cleanup programs, when the programs meet are \n     making progress toward meeting general criteria, such as \n     protection of human health and providing public involvement.\n       Provides deference to state programs and provides \n     additional ``certainty'' to persons who conduct cleanups \n     under state programs by placing restrictions on the authority \n     of the Administrator to take an enforcement action under the \n     federal Superfield law, while preserving the President's \n     ability to address serious problems.\n       Provides for states to keep a public record of sites, in \n     the state program to be eligible for the bar on federal \n     enforcement. This record will provide the public with \n     critical information about the sites in their neighborhoods.\n       Provides a deferral for listing sites on the federal \n     Superfund list if the site is being adequately handled by the \n     state program.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Today, the chairman of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, ranking minority member of the committee, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Superfund, and ranking minority member \nof the subcommittee, have come together to introduce a bill that \nprotects the environment, encourages community involvement, promotes \neconomic redevelopment, encourages the preservation of green spaces, \nand sets the stage for future efforts of comprehensive Superfund \nreform.\n  As a nation, our industrial heritage has left us with numerous \ncontaminated abandoned or underutilized ``brownfield'' sites. Although \nthe level of contamination at many of these sites is relatively low, \nand the potential value of the property may be quite high, developers \noften shy away from developing these sites. One reason for this is \nuncertainty regarding the extent of contamination, the extent of \npotential liability, or the potential costs of cleanup.\n  With the introduction of the Brownfield Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act of 2000, we focus on the uncertainty \nfacing developers, property owners, and communities as to the status of \nlow-risk contaminated sites.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, Administrator Browner and \nAssistant Administrator of Office of Solid Waste and Emergency \nResponse, Tim Fields, testified that EPA was interested in pursuing \nlegislative reform only in some narrow property owner areas and in \nbrownfields. We have worked to address their suggestions and hope that \nin the future they can work with us to address a broader comprehensive \nSuperfund effort.\n  Concerns exist for some Committee members that taking brownfields out \nof a comprehensive Superfund reform package will jeopardize future \nSuperfund reform. Although I agree with my colleagues that \ncomprehensive reform is needed, I feel that we can move forward with \nbrownfield legislation without compromising comprehensive reform. \n450,000 brownfield sites exist in the United States. These sites are \nlow risk sites and are not the traditional Superfund sites that would \nbe affected by comprehensive Superfund reform. If States and citizens \nare discouraged from cleaning up these sites, continuing the barriers \nto redevelopment, these sites may someday become Superfund sites.\n  As brownfield sites are outside of the scope of Superfund, I believe \nthat liability carve-outs are outside of the scope of any brownfields \nlegislation. As I have in the past, I continue to oppose narrow carve-\nouts. Carveouts weaken attempts at overhauling the remedy selection and \nliability allocation provisions in the current Superfund statute and, \nfrankly, make a bad system worse. This brownfield legislation does not \naffect the allocation of liability at Superfund sites, instead, it \nprovides\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nneeded resources to address sites, provides certainty to those who \nvoluntarily cleanup, and prevents brownfields from being included in \nthe Superfund web. Brownfield legislation presents a win-win for all \ninvolved and should jumpstart action on substantive Superfund reform in \nthe next Congress.\n  This is a new era of environmental and infrastructure legislation. \nSince we have been paying down the debt, we are now able to return \nmoney to local communities to help them solve environmental problems \nand are encouraging partnerships are between federal entities, States, \nand local communities. It is an exciting time to be working and \ninvesting in our environment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Chafee, \nLautenberg, and Smith in introducing the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act. This bill is a ``win-win.'' It is good \nfor the environment. It is good for communities. And it is good for the \neconomy. More hazardous waste sites will be cleaned up. We'll have more \nparks and open space, more economic redevelopment, and more jobs.\n  I'd like to emphasize that this is not just an east-coast, big city \nbill. Montana may not have as many brownfields as some of our more \nindustrialized and densely-populated states, but our economic history \nhas left us with our share. Wood treatment facilities. Railroad yards. \nSawmills. Getting these sites remediated and back in use makes good \nsense in Montana and throughout the country.\n  The Brewery Flats site outside Lewistown is a perfect example of a \nplace where this bill can really make a difference in Montana. This 57 \nacre site is located on the Big Spring Creek flood plain, two miles \nsouth of Lewistown. It is a railroad site, consisting of a former \nbranch line, railroad switching yard, and roundhouse locomotive service \nfacility. Chicago-Milwaukee railroad operated the site, then sold it to \nBurlington Northern. The city would like to acquire the site and \nconvert it to recreational and educational uses. The owner is willing \nto transfer the land to the city, but the city needs to have a more \ncomplete understanding of the extent of the contamination before moving \nacquiring the land and undertaking a cleanup.\n  The site has outstanding potential to enhance the community. It is \nadjacent to land on the Big Spring Creek that is owned by Montana Fish \nand Wildlife, so cleaning it up will allow the expansion of existing \nopen space. Big Spring Creek itself is a blue-ribbon trout stream, and \nthe Brewery Flats site boasts several wetland areas. Local students \nhave planted trees in the area, and the educational and recreational \npotential of these adjacent sites is excellent.\n  Lewistown has worked hard to utilize existing programs and resources. \nMontana DEQ performed some initial sampling on the site several years \nago. More recently, EPA conducted a targeted site assessment, which \nrevealed light contamination on half of the site, and more extensive \ncontamination near the roundhouse. Although EPA did not find anything \nalarming, the assessment is a first cut, and the city does not feel \ncomfortable taking ownership of the property before more extensive \nsampling is done. Lacking the resources to do this work, Lewistown has \napplied for an EPA brownfields ``showcase communities'' grant. This \nprocess is still pending. In addition, the city has applied to the \nMontana DNRC for a cleanup grant.\n  The brownfields bill could greatly help Lewistown acquire and clean \nup Brewery Flats. And it could do the same for hundreds of sites in \nMontana and thousands around the country, by providing funding for \nbrownfields revitalization programs, by giving liability protection in \ncertain cases, and by providing funding and increased authority to \nstate brownfields cleanup programs.\n  Let me explain each of these provisions.\n  Title I of the bill authorizes funding to states, tribes and local \ngovernment to inventory, assess, and remediate brownfield sites. \nFunding is particularly critical for sites that will be used for non-\nprofit purposes, such as parks. In some cases, it is also needed to \nfill gaps in private financing at sites that will be redeveloped for \ncommercial use. To make the funding as effective as possible, it is \nstructured to provide states, tribes and local governments the \nflexibility to utilize the brownfields money and EPA's capacity in the \nway that best suits their particular needs.\n  For site assessment, states, tribes and local governments can seek \ngrants from EPA. For remediation, governments that wish to establish a \nprogram can seek grants to capitalize revolving loan funds for \nremediation. Out of these revolving loan funds, they can then provide \nloans, and grants to public and nonprofit entities, for remediation. \nGovernments that do not wish to establish revolving loan funds, on the \nother hand, can seek grants from EPA for specific remediation projects. \nIn addition, Title I authorizes EPA to conduct brownfields-related \ntechnical assistance and job training and facilitate community \nparticipation.\n  This package of funding and EPA authority builds on the successes of \nEPA's existing brownfields program, and strengthens it by adding \nincreased flexibility. To serve all of these purposes, Title I \nauthorizes $150 million per year for five years. I note that, at my \nurging, the bill includes mine-scarred lands in the definition of \nbrownfields and contains a provision that will ensure that funds are \ndistributed fairly between urban and rural areas.\n  Turning to Title II of the bill, Superfund's critics have long argued \nthat the threat of Superfund liability has been a drag on the \nredevelopment of brownfields sites. Title II addresses this problem by \nprotecting several classes of persons from Superfund liability. It \nprotects contiguous property owners, whose property has been \ncontaminated solely by migration of contamination from contiguous \nproperty. It protects bona fide prospective purchasers, who exercise \nappropriate care when purchasing property and did not contribute to any \nexisting contamination. And it protects innocent landowners, who did \nnot have reason to know of and did not contribute to contamination of \nproperty they already own.\n  These provisions make Superfund more fair, and will promote \nbrownfields redevelopment by providing certainty to property owners and \ndevelopers about what they need to do to avoid Superfund liability.\n  Title III clarifies the relationship between state cleanup programs \nand EPA's Superfund program. Superfund critics have long argued that \nthe possibility that EPA could second-guess state-approved cleanups has \ndiscouraged brownfields remediation. At the same time, I and other have \nargued that we need to preserve the federal government's ability to use \nSuperfund authorities to deal with dangerous situations at sites \ncleaned up under state programs in the rare case in which the cleanup \nis inadequate and there is a threat to human health or the environment.\n  The tension between these two views has been one of the major \nobstacles to moving brownfields legislation in the past. This bill \nforges a new compromise on this issue, one that should appeal to both \nsides in the debate. On the one hand, it gives more certainty to those \nwho clean up brownfield sites under state programs. On the other hand, \nit preserves EPA's ability to use Superfund authorities to address \nserious problems.\n  Mr. President, putting these changes all together, the bill will \nexpedite cleanups at Brewery Flats and all across the country. That, \nagain, is good for the environment, good for communities, and good for \nthe country.\n  One final point. This bill reflects a moderate, bipartisan, \ncompromise. It shows that we can roll up our sleeves and resolve our \ndifferences.\n  For that, I complement the new chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Senator Smith, and the chairman of the Superfund \nSubcommittee, Senator Chafee. They've done a great job.\n  I'd also like to pay a special complement to the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee, Senator Lautenberg. He has accomplished many things \nduring his 18 years in the Senate. One of the most important has been \nhis leadership on environmental issues. More than anyone else, he has \nprotected, and improved, the Superfund program.\n  If we enact the Chafee-Lautenberg bill this year, and I believe we \ncan, it\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\nwill be a fitting capstone to his Senate career.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. DeWine and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2701. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for donations of computers to senior centers, to require a \npilot program to enhance the availability of Internet access for older \nAmericans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                INTERNET ACCESS FOR SENIORS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, the opportunity to live a healthy \nand productive life can be enriched by something new: access to the \nInternet. But according to a 1999 Forrester Research report, only 8 \npercent of seniors age 65 and above have Internet access compared to 40 \npercent of the population under age 65. According to an unpublished \nDepartment of Commerce study, the percentage of low-income seniors with \nInternet access is even less: only 1.5 percent. My bill, the Internet \nAccess for Seniors Act of 2000, will help narrow this digital divide \nbetween seniors and the rest of the population. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators DeWine and Rockefeller in introducing this bill.\n  A recent study by Stanford's Institute for the Quantitative Study of \nSociety shows the digital divide among different demographic groups. \nThe variables are age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, and income. \nIt shows that by far the most important factors facilitating or \ninhibiting Internet access are age and education--not income, not race, \nnot ethnicity, and not gender. According to the study's authors, these \nvariables account for less than 5 percent of the change in the rates of \nInternet access and are statistically insignificant. In contrast, and I \nquote, ``a college education boosts rates of Internet access by well \nover 40 percentage points compared to the less educated group, while \npeople over 65 show a more than 40 percentage point drop in their rates \nof Internet access compared to those under 25.''\n  Ironically, seniors, who have more limited access to the Internet, \ncan benefit more from Internet access than others because, in addition \nto a digital divide, they suffer from a transportation divide. The \nability to travel from one place to another is vital to our daily \nlives. In fact, good transportation access is vital for many of the \nsame reasons as good Internet access. But seniors are the least mobile \ndemographic segment of our adult population. One way that people cope \nwith poor access to telecommunications is to rely on transportation. \nBut seniors lack this coping mechanism. In other words, if any \ndemographic group in our society actually needs superior access to the \nInternet, it is seniors.\n  Our society has long recognized that access to certain kinds of \ninformation is a public good. That is why we have schools and \nlibraries, and it is why we have the E-rate, which provides Internet \naccess to schools and libraries. Until now, however, senior centers \nhave been left out of the mix. Some may say, ``Why don't seniors go to \nthe library to get Internet access?'' Many seniors prefer to go to \nsenior centers because they are specifically designed to serve their \nneeds. For example, senior centers routinely provide some type of \nspecial transportation for seniors to get to and from the senior \ncenters. Asking libraries to take on the added cost of providing such \ntransportation is clearly less desirable from a cost--not to mention \nlogistical--standpoint. When a senior makes the effort to get to a \nsenior center, he can take advantage of a half dozen services \nspecifically designed to serve his needs, and it seems wasteful to ask \nlibraries to take on those additional services.\n  There are many ways seniors can benefit from Internet access: taking \ncourses, finding a job, becoming better-informed citizens, and shopping \nfor essential goods and services. One application, access to health \ninformation, is obviously essential to seniors and is also an area of \ngreat interest to me.\n  Mr. President, there is an explosion of useful health information \nbeing made available over the Internet. According to a recent front \npage New York Times story, there are now more than 100,000 healthcare \nwebsites available on the Internet. Health information is being made \navailable on the Internet because consumers demand it.\n  There are many reasons seniors may prefer to get health information \nover the Internet rather than in person.\n  Some seniors may not want to wait until their next doctor appointment \nbefore finding out more about their ailment. For example, if a senior \ngets a diagnosis of cancer, she may not want to wait to find out more \nabout the seriousness of her condition and the options available.\n  Some seniors may find a trip to the clinician's office an onerous and \noften all-day activity. Clearly the ability to communicate with a \nclinician without making a special trip--and at odd hours--would be of \ngreat benefit. Recognizing these needs, some HMOs already allow seniors \nto communicate with their caregiver via the Internet to request \nrelatively routine services such as a dosage change. This also saves on \nMedicare costs.\n  Some seniors may want to talk to other people who share their \ncondition. For example, most medical websites now have chat rooms where \nfellow sufferers can get together to share information about new \ntreatment options and day-to-day tips for coping with specific \nconditions. These sites also provide advice and support to the spouses \nand other caregivers who must care for victims of Alzheimer's, heart \ndisease, cancer, and other afflictions of the elderly.\n  My legislation is designed to bring senior centers, particularly \nthose in low-income or rural areas, into the digital age. I chose \nsenior centers as a vehicle to alleviate the digital divide for seniors \nbecause these centers serve large numbers of seniors, especially the \ndisadvantaged seniors targeted by this bill. Unfortunately, there are \nno national statistics regarding how many senior centers have computers \nwith Internet access accessible to seniors. However, my office did a \nsurvey of Oregon senior centers. We found that 52 percent lacked access \nto computers and that 71 percent lacked access to the Internet. In many \ncases, the quality of computers and Internet access was low. Many \ncomputers were at least five years old. Some were ten or more years \nold. Internet connections were often made with older versions of \nbrowsers that could not access contemporary web sites.\n  My bill has two major components. The first provides a tax credit for \nindividuals and organizations that contribute computer equipment to \nsenior centers. The second creates a pilot program, called the S-rate, \nto provide subsidies for qualified low-income or rural senior centers \nto access the Internet.\n\n  The tax credit, essentially identical to the tax credit for computer \nequipment donated to schools passed March 1 of this year in the New \nMillennium Classrooms Act, is equal to 30 percent of the fair market \nvalue of the donated computer equipment. To receive the tax deduction, \nthe computer equipment must be three years old or less. For donations \nto senior centers located within empowerment zones, enterprise \ncommunities, and Indian reservations, the tax credit is increased to 50 \npercent. The tax deduction is terminated for taxable years beginning \nthree years after the date of enactment of this act, and we impose a \nlimit of 10 computers per senior center.\n  The S-rate covers up to 90 percent of the costs associated with \nInternet access to senior centers. Covered costs include computers, \nsoftware, training, and maintenance. Our bill seeks to narrow the \nincreasingly important divide between information haves and have-nots \nin our society. Our bill is only a pilot program that will invest $10 \nmillion a year in getting our seniors online. The program sunsets after \n3 years.\n  The Secretary of the Department of Commerce will administer the S-\nrate. In selecting among eligible senior centers, the Secretary will \nconsider the senior center's need and proposed applications. Need \nincludes the number of seniors served by the senior center, the extent \nto which the senior center already provides Internet access, and the \nextent to which the senior center serves an area with a high percentage \nof low-income or rural individuals. Applications include health \ninformation, job training, lifelong education, and any other \napplications that fulfill an important social need.\n  One of the Secretary's tasks is to develop enabling tools for the \nsenior centers. For example, the Secretary could offer an array of \nfill-in-the-blank web\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\ntemplates to make it easy for senior centers to post information on the \nweb and create their own home pages. The Secretary could provide \ninformation to senior centers about privacy concerns, especially \nregarding sensitive matters such as health information. The Secretary \ncould suggest minimum standards for web hosting services seeking to \nserve senior centers.\n  One of the wonderful things about the Internet is the ability of one \nsite to learn from another. The Secretary could create a web-based \nclearinghouse of all the senior centers funded under the pilot program. \nInnovative and outstanding web-based services could be specially marked \nso that other senior centers could quickly learn from the best \npractices of others. The Secretary could set up a technical chat room \nso that senior center administrators, in their role as webmasters, \ncould share concerns and ideas. The Secretary could set up an Internet \nhotline for oversight; that is, to be alerted if an administrator \ndoesn't use the S-rate for its stated purpose. And because the Internet \ncan be used for distance education and online help, the Secretary could \nfund some senior centers to train other senior citizens.\n  Let me close with one further thought. Closing the digital divide for \nseniors is not just about social justice; it's also about basic dollars \nand cents. Consider this: according to the National Institute of Aging, \nmore than two-thirds of every healthcare dollar--much of it government \nfunded--goes to seniors. If we can empower seniors to be wise health \nconsumers, we can use market mechanisms, rather than government red \ntape, to make sure that seniors get the healthcare they need. The \nInternet now offers that opportunity. Let's not squander it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require reports on the progress of the Federal \nGovernment in implementing Presidential Decision Directive No. 63 (PDD-\n63); to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\nreporting progress on implementing presidential decision directive no. \n                              63 (pdd-63)\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation with Senator Schumer. I wanted to thank my colleague and \nhis staff for their hard work and full partnership in arriving at what \nI believe is a critical first step to insuring this nation's security \nin a world of growing cyber threats. I have been concerned for some \ntime now that Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63) does not \nclearly define a role for the Department of Defense (DOD). In one \nsentence, PDD 63 states that the DOD is assigned the role of \n``defense'' but does not elaborate on how it will accomplish this vague \nassignment. Our legislation will require that the DOD begin the \nthinking process of how it is integrating its different capabilities \nand assets into an ``indications and warning architecture.'' Each of \nthe Services is developing its individual information warfare \ncapabilities at this moment, and it is not clear how they are being \nintegrated or coordinated. The DOD was supposed to report on the future \nof the National Communications System (NCS) in 1996 and 1997, but as \nfar as I know that report was never completed. NCS has been identified \nas a unique public-private partnership with major telephone carriers \nand information systems providers and could be a useful entity to \ndefend against a widespread attack.\n  This bill will require the DOD to describe how it is working with the \nintelligence community to identify, detect and counter the threat of \ninformation warfare programs of hostile states and potentially hostile \nsub-national organizations. One thing my Y2K experience has made very \nclear to me is that the coordination of intelligence and the proper \nidentification of threat and intention is increasingly difficult. We \noften lack the human intelligence, just plain people on the ground, to \nmeet the growing need for reconnaissance, and that makes coordinated \nand integrated technology all the more important.\n  We must begin to work from a position of having a consistent \nunderstanding of the terms we use. It is central to this idea that we \ndefine the terms: nationally ``significant cyber event'' and ``cyber \nreconstitution.'' PDD 63 and the National Plan do not define what these \nare and the lack of definition causes confusion and impedes program \ndevelopment.\n  Also, during Y2K we found that the DOD has a large dependency on \nforeign infrastructure and that we must develop a way to assure and \ndefend that infrastructure electronically. Any collapse of an \ninfrastructure would hurt our force projection capabilities.\n  Our offensive and defensive information operations need to evolve \ntogether in an integrated fashion.

A bill to amend the provisions of title 39, United States \nCode, relating to the manner in which pay policies and schedules and \nfringe benefit programs for postmasters are established; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                the postmasters fairness and rights act\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nPostmasters Fairness and Rights Act, which will allow our nation's \npostmasters to take an active and constructive role in managing their \npost offices and discussing compensation issues. I am joined by \nSenators Durbin, Sarbanes, Mikulski, Edwards, and Baucus in offering \nthis legislation.\n  Currently, Postmasters lack an equitable process for discussing pay \nand benefits and have seen an erosion of their role in improving the \nquality of mail services to postal patrons and managing their local \npost offices. These inequities have contributed to the decline in the \nnumber of Postmasters since the reorganization of the Postal Service 30 \nyears ago.\n  Our bill would create a positive and fair procedure to address the \ninequalities that have resulted from the present ``consultative \nprocess.'' This would foster better mail services by investing \nPostmasters with greater input in operational decision-making, \nimproving Postmasters' morale, and helping attract and retain qualified \nPostmasters. The measure would also define ``Postmaster'' for the first \ntime.\n  Mr. President, the Postal Service estimates that seven million \ncustomers a day transact business at post offices. We expect timely \ndelivery of the mail 6 days a week, and the Postal Service does not \ndisappoint us. Given the regularity of mail delivery and the number of \nAmericans visiting post offices daily, it is no wonder that we have \ncome to view our neighborhood post offices as cornerstones of our \ncommunities. In fact, many of our towns and cities have developed \naround a post office where the postmaster served as the town's only \nlink to the federal government.\n  Our nation's postmasters are on the front line to ensure that the \nmail gets delivered in a timely manner, and they have helped fuel the \ninfrastructure that boosted the performance ratings of the Postal \nService to an all-time high in 1999.\n  Despite these successes, there remains the question of pay and \ncompensation, which this bill addresses. I would also like to note that \na House companion bill, H.R. 3842, introduced on March 8, 2000, enjoys \nbipartisan support from 23 cosponsors. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation. Thank you Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be printed in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide additional authority to the Army Corps of \nEngineers to protect, enhance, and restore fish and wildlife habitat on \nthe Missouri River and to improve the environmental quality and public \nuse and appreciation of the Missouri River; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the missouri river valley improvement act\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, one year ago I came to the floor of \nthe United States Senate to introduce legislation designed to improve \nthe environmental quality and public use and appreciation of the \nMissouri River. The Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999, \nsought to also mark the upcoming bicentennial anniversary of the Lewis \nand Clark expeditions of this great river. At that time I asked my \ncolleagues who represent the states and communities along the Missouri \nRiver to look closely at the bill and join me as cosponsors in support \nof the legislation.\n\n  Through the hard work of state officials, river organizations and \ncitizens throughout the Missouri River basin, many important \nimprovements have been made to this bill. I believe these improvements \nstrengthens our commitment to protecting the Missouri River. I am \npleased, therefore, to introduce today, along with my Colleague's \nSenator Daschle, Senator Bond, Senator Johnson, Senator Brownback and \nSenator Roberts, the Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 2000.\n  This legislation maintains the commitment made in last year's bill to \naid native river fish and wildlife, reduce flood loss, and enhance \nrecreation and tourism throughout the basin. Additionally, this bill \nprovides authorities for the revitalization of historic riverfronts, \nsimilar to the ongoing `Back to the River' revitalization project \ncurrently underway in my home state of Nebraska. The new legislation \nalso recognizes the commitment Congress made last year to habitat \nrestoration efforts along the Missouri River by authorizing resources \nfor these projects.\n  I am proud of the bipartisan support garnered for this legislation. \nThis bill demonstrates that common ground exists when it comes to \nstrengthening the health of the Missouri River. Those who use the river \nwhether it be for recreational, commercial, or environmental purposes \nrecognize the benefits of preserving this National treasure. Protecting \nnative habitat along the Missouri River and enhancing environmental \nunderstanding through riverfront restoration and scientific monitoring \nis a legacy we should all want to leave our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this bill becomes part of the \ngrowing recognition that the environmental revitalization of the \nMissouri River is in all of our interests. The Missouri River Valley \nImprovement Act of 2000 will help to restore and improve our access and \nenjoyment of the river, and will provide vital economic, recreational \nand education opportunities for everyone who lives along and visits \nthis great river, the Crown Jewel of the Midwest.\n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 2705. A bill to provide for the training of individuals, during a \nPresidential transition, who the President intends to appoint to \ncertain key positions, to provide for a study and report on improving \nthe financial disclosure process for certain Presidential nominees, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                THE PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I are today \nintroducing the Presidential Transition Act of 2000 on behalf of \nourselves and Senators Akaka, Durbin, Levin, and Voinovich. The ability \nof a President-elect to effectively transition from campaigning to \ngoverning is obviously of critical importance and this legislation is \ndesigned to initiate much needed improvements in the process.\n  A President-elect must face the management challenge of transitioning \nfrom leading a successful campaign operation to leading the nation. \nThere are only 73 days from election day to inauguration day. \nTransition planning should begin prior to election day. The President-\nelect should have the ability to move immediately to put a new team in \nplace. That team should receive the critical information it needs to be \nprepared to take over the management of the federal government on \ninauguration day. Potential nominees should be able to move through the \nnomination and confirmation process without unnecessary barriers.\n  The magnitude of the need for an effective presidential transition \nand the recognized problems with past ones have led a number of private \nsector organizations to focus on the problem and solutions to it. \nSeveral, including the Presidential Appointee Initiative of the \nBrookings Institution, Transition to Governing of the American \nEnterprise Institute and Brookings, and the Heritage Foundation's \nMandate for Leadership 2000, have contributed to our consideration of \nthis problem. These groups and others are independently preparing a \nbody of knowledge which will assist the new administration to get an \neffective, timely start. I ask unanimous consent that an article by \nCarl Cannon in National Journal and one by David Broder in the \nWashington Post, which describe the significant work which is underway, \nbe printed at the conclusion of my remarks, followed by the text of our \nlegislation.\n  The legislation encompasses and expands on H.R. 3137, legislation \nsponsored by Representative Steve Horn, Chairman of the Committee on \nGovernment Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Information \nand Technology and passed by the House of Representatives. \nRepresentative Horn's bill provides for the payment of expenses during \nthe transition for briefings and other activities designed to transfer \nkey policy and administrative information to prospective presidential \nstaff in order to ensure a\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nsmooth transition from one administration to another. The current \nAdministration has recognized the importance of these activities by \nincluding additional funds for it in its FY 2001 budget request for the \nGeneral Services Administration.\n  Our bill supplements the framework established by H.R. 3137. Our bill \nincludes the authorization of federal funds to be spent to provide for \nthe training and orientation of officials a President intends to \nnominate to key positions. This important provision allows political \nappointees to hit the ground running by preparing for the job before \nthey are nominated.\n  Additionally, our bill requires the preparation of a ``transition \ndirectory.'' This valuable tool will be a compilation of materials that \nprovide information to prospective appointees about the organization of \nfederal departments and agencies, as well as the statutory and \nadministrative authorities, functions, duties, and responsibilities of \neach federal department and agency. With this tool, prospective \nappointees can better manage the new, important positions they are \npreparing to undertake.\n  Finally, the bill requires the Office of Government Ethics conduct a \nstudy and submit a report to Congress on potential improvements to the \ncurrent financial disclosure process Presidential nominees are \ncurrently required to undergo. Certainly, nothing the Office of \nGovernment Ethics recommends should in any way lessen the requirement \nthat potential nominees disclose possible conflicts of interest. But, \nthe Office of Government Ethics should recommend ways to improve the \nprocess of obtaining, reviewing, and disclosing such information in \norder to reduce the burden the current process places on potential \nappointees and the people who review the information.\n  Mr. President, we believe this legislation will help improve and \nsmooth the process by which elected Presidents and their political \nappointees transition to power and assume their responsibilities. We \nhope the incentives provided in this legislation will encourage and \nenable presidential candidates, presidents-elect and newly sworn \npresidents to be up and running on the day after the inauguration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From National Journal, May 13, 2000]\n\n                    Improving the White House Memory\n\n                          (By Carl M. Cannon)\n\n       White House Chief of Staff John Podesta recalls being \n     jazzed his first day in the Clinton Administration--until he \n     saw his workstation. There wasn't a single piece of paper on \n     his desk, and not so much as a diagram telling him where the \n     men's room was. There was a computer monitor and processor, \n     but the monitor was blank and the processor had wires poking \n     out of it--someone had removed the hard drive. This was no \n     crime of vandalism. It was the law, at work.\n       While the Constitution sets clear rules on how the country \n     goes about electing a President, there has always been a \n     haphazard quality to the transition. One reason is that both \n     long-standing custom and the Presidential Records Act of 1978 \n     dictate that almost all White House offices be swept clean of \n     all records, including basic information that would help a \n     new President get off to a good start.\n       ``By law, there's no institutional memory,'' says political \n     scientist Martha Joynt Kumar of Towson State University, the \n     author of two books on White House operations. ``A new \n     Administration, especially when there's a change of party, \n     begins without a written record compiled by the previous \n     occupants. Those who have worked there almost uniformly \n     describe this as a handicap.''\n       The absence of a record can be an issue even in what ought \n     to be the least partisan of transitions--the ascendancy of a \n     Vice President to the Oval Office in midterm. When President \n     Franklin D. Roosevelt died in April 1945, Harry S. Truman's \n     incoming staff lacked access to key information, including \n     the fact that the United States was close to developing the \n     atomic bomb. As Vice President, Truman had not known the \n     weapon existed, and it was not until 13 days after he became \n     President that Secretary of War Henry L. Stimpson informed \n     him of the project.\n       ``I felt,'' Truman explained of his sudden thrust into the \n     Oval Office. ``like the moon, the stars, and all the planets \n     had fallen on me.''\n       Even when the nation is at peace, the lack of a written \n     record in the White House National Security Council is a \n     continuing problem. ``The new NSC staff spends months re-\n     creating them or negotiating with the archivists to get \n     access to them,'' says John Fortier, a researcher at the \n     American Enterprise Institute. ``There has to be a better \n     way.''\n       In other words, Podesta was hardly the first appointee to \n     wonder about this process. Michael Jackson, who held a \n     powerful post as the White House's Cabinet secretary, recalls \n     a scramble for furniture on the first day of the Bush \n     Administration more appropriate for the movie Animal House \n     than the White House.\n       ``The first day what they did is, they pulled out a lot of \n     the furniture from the offices and into the halls, where \n     there were piles of credenzas, desks, wing chairs,'' Jackson \n     told Kumar. ``The people who were smart and knew the drill \n     got there early and went and just took stuff.\n       Commentator David Gergen, who has served in two Republican \n     Administrations and one Democratic (Clinton's), maintains \n     that this early confusion in a cleaned-out, clueless White \n     House comes at a price for the new President--and the \n     country. ``The early months are so important because that's \n     when you have the most authority,'' Gergen said. But that's \n     when you also have the least capacity for making the right \n     decisions.''\n       Other White House veterans assert that the lack of \n     institutional memory helps explain why incoming \n     Administrations seem to stubbornly repeat the mistakes of \n     their predecessors, especially in their first days. Jimmy \n     Carter, Ronald Regan, and Bill Clinton, for instance, all \n     vowed during their campaigns to cut the size of White \n     House staff, but their efforts to follow through on this \n     ill-considered promise produced results ranging from poor \n     to disastrous.\n       ``Cicero said that he who does not know history would \n     forever remain a child,'' says David M. Abshire, who heads \n     the Center for the Study of the Presidency and who assisted \n     in the Reagan transition. ``Believe it or not, some \n     Presidents have done childish things.''\n       But such scholars as Abshir and Kumar insist that this is \n     hardly all presidential fault: Imagine a $1.8 trillion \n     company--that's the approximate size of the federal budget--\n     in which the corporate headquarters is vacated every four or \n     eight years. Moreover, hardly any of the support staff stays \n     on, all the files vanish, and the shareholders are given only \n     two months' notice about the identity of the incoming CEO.\n       ``The White House is not simply a spoil of victory,'' says \n     former Carter White House aide Harrison Wellford, an attorney \n     who now handles corporate mergers. ``It's the nerve center of \n     the greatest government in the world, and we ought to at \n     least give it the same respect that you do when you take over \n     a second-rate corporation.''\n       A slew of presidential scholars and good-government \n     organizations are spending this year trying to do just that. \n     They have undertaken a series of projects designed to help \n     the new President hit the ground running when he takes office \n     on Jan. 22, 2001:\n       Abshire's Center for the Study of the Presidency is working \n     on a special report intended to reach the President-elect on \n     the day after the election. The package will include several \n     case studies illustrating past Presidents' successes and \n     failures in policy-making, and an analysis of ``the art of \n     presidential leadership.''\n       The Heritage Foundation is undertaking a project called \n     Mandate for Leadership 2000. Obviously, the conservative \n     Heritage folks are pulling for Republican Gov. George W. Bush \n     over Democratic Vice President Al Gore. Just as obviously, \n     some of the Heritage material, such as a proposed federal \n     spending blueprint, is geared for a GOP President. But \n     Heritage is also in the midst of a bipartisan effort \n     consisting of a series of seminars and publications designed \n     to guide the next Administration. Later this year, Heritage \n     plans to publish what it promises will be a nonpartisan \n     report drawing on the accumulated wisdom of a cast of former \n     White House aides, ranging from former Clinton Chief of Staff \n     Leon E. Panetta to Reagan confidant and Deputy White House \n     Chief of Staff Michael K. Deaver.\n       Paul C. Light of the Brookings Institution has launched his \n     Presidential Appointee Initiative with the goal of helping a \n     new President get the best and the brightest Americans into \n     his Administration. This project, funded to the tune of $3.6 \n     million for three years by the Pew Charitable Trusts, will \n     propose reforms that streamline and depoliticize \n     the appointment and confirmation process. ``The premise . \n     . . is that effective governance is impossible if the \n     nation's most talented citizens are reluctant to accept \n     the President's call to government service.'' Light says.\n       At the American Enterprise Institute, Norman J. Ornstein \n     has teamed with Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution \n     on a wide-ranging three-year mission called Transition to \n     Governing. Also funded by Pew, the $3.35 million project \n     targets the ``permanent campaign,'' which has made stars of \n     political consultants while reducing policy-makers to slaves \n     of the daily tracking polls.\n       In the works at AEI are two conferences; a published set of \n     benchmarks by which to judge successful transitions; \n     recommendations for improving the confirmation process; a \n     book on the danger of the permanent campaign; and the \n     publication of transition memos written by Harvard scholar \n     Richard Neustadt for Presidents Kennedy, Reagan, and Clinton. \n     In addition, AEI intends to supplement Light's work by \n     developing ideas for accelerating the appointment process, \n     which\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\n     took an average of two months in Kennedy's day but now \n     consumes more than nine months.\n       One tool being created is a CD-ROM modeled on TurboTax \n     software that consolidates all of the questions asked on the \n     various government disclosure forms and in FBI background \n     checks. ``The purpose of it is to make it easy for nominees \n     to complete the blizzard of paperwork they have to \n     negotiate,'' says Terry Sullivan, the University of North \n     Carolina political scientist overseeing the project. ``One of \n     the things we know from interviews Paul Light's organization \n     has been conducting with these people is that they find all \n     this paperwork to be odious and repetitious. It discourages \n     some nominees. . . .''\n       Finally, there is the White House interview program, the \n     brainchild of Martha Kumar and several of her fellow \n     presidential scholars. Also funded by Pew, but at only \n     $250,000 for three years, it may offer the biggest bang for \n     the buck. Kumar has conducted nearly 75 in-depth interviews \n     with former White House officials from seven key offices, \n     including chief of staff and communications, going back as \n     far as the Nixon Administration. ``The idea of these \n     interviews is to get into the workings of the White House'' \n     Kumar said, ``and to pass along their insights to those who \n     need it--when they need it most.''\n       Her interviews will be made available, along with a 15-page \n     analysis on the office in question, to those hired during the \n     transition for positions such as White House chief of staff \n     and press secretary. Next year, they will be turned over to \n     the National Archives.\n       The scholars themselves are aware that the reports they are \n     producing will compete with each other and with a thousand \n     other demands on the new appointees' time. For that reason, \n     there has been a good deal of cross-pollination of ideas and \n     cooperation among the scholars, many of whom are being tapped \n     for more than one of these projects. In the process, a loose \n     consensus has formed among them, one that David Abshire puts \n     succinctly: ``The most important decision a President makes \n     is whom he picks to make up that presidency.''\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2000]\n\n                       Start Thinking Transition\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       If you call the Bush or Gore campaigns, as I did last week \n     and ask if anyone is planning the transition to the \n     presidency, the answer is an astonished ``No!'' It's months \n     until the conventions and the focus is entirely on the fall \n     campaign, they say. First things first. It would be \n     presumptuous to think otherwise.\n       But the strongly held view of those who have been through \n     this sequence before is that George W. Bush and Al Gore ought \n     to be thinking about the takeover of government now, and \n     starting to plan the process very soon, well before they know \n     which of them will be successful on Election Day.\n       ``Remember you have only 73 days'' from election to \n     inauguration, Theodore C. Sorensen, the counsel in the \n     Kennedy White House, said last week at a conference sponsored \n     by the Heritage Foundation. ``You better begin planning \n     before Election Day.''\n       That advice was echoed by veterans of the Johnson, Carter, \n     Reagan and Bush White Houses--and by a trio of scholars who \n     have been plumbing the records of past transitions.\n       In fact, such advance planning has been done in many past \n     campaigns--but covertly, to avoid conveying a sense of smug \n     overconfidence to the voters. Jack Watson, who became Jimmy \n     Carter's chief of staff, told the Heritage audience that he \n     had retrieved a memo from the Carter archives he had written \n     the former Georgia governor on May 11, 1976, soon after \n     Carter won the Pennsylvania primary and established himself \n     as the favorite for the nomination. It suggested that as \n     outsiders to Washington, they needed to start organizing \n     themselves soon for the possibility of taking over the \n     executive branch. Carter gave him the go-ahead on May 27--\n     just about this point in the cycle--but ordered secrecy.\n       Why the need for such a long head start? Mainly because the \n     process of identifying the key officials and getting them in \n     place can be so agonizing. C. Boyden Gray, counsel in the \n     Bush White House, said the president-elect should be ready to \n     give the FBI the names of 100 to 150 people ``immediately \n     after the election,'' so the clearance procedures can begin. \n     ``Do it, even if you don't know what their jobs will be,'' \n     Gray said, ``because there will always be a glitch.''\n       Who are those key officials? Richard E. Neustadt, the \n     Harvard professor whose work on the presidency has been a \n     handbook for several administrations, was unequivocal in his \n     answer. ``Choose the White House staff before you pick the \n     Cabinet,'' he said, ``so they can begin to relate to each \n     other in the process of Cabinet selection. Don't do the \n     Cabinet first.''\n       President Clinton famously did the opposite and dallied so \n     long in Cabinet-making that he barely got his White House \n     aides named before he moved from Little Rock to Washington. \n     He paid a price; many of those last-minute White House \n     appointees turned out to be ill suited for their jobs and had \n     to be replaced.\n       The Reagan transition is considered by scholars the best of \n     recent times. Planning began well before Election Day and was \n     aided by the outgoing administration, said Edwin Meese III, \n     the transition director who later became attorney general. \n     Carter and Watson were so grateful for the help they had \n     received four years before from defeated President Ford, \n     through his top aides Richard Cheney and John O. Marsh, that \n     they went out of their way to help the Reagan people.\n       No one can predict how much help the retiring Clintonities \n     will give their successors, though it presumably would be \n     extended automatically to Gore's people. But plenty of \n     guidance will be available to the incoming president from \n     outside government.\n       Four think tanks--Heritage, the American Enterprise \n     Institute, the Brookings Institution and the Center for the \n     Study of the Presidency--all have major transition studies \n     underway and will be ready with briefing papers for the \n     winners.\n       In addition, the American Political Science Association \n     with a Few Charitable Trusts grant, has a White House 2001 \n     project. Martha Kumar, a professor at Towson University, and \n     her colleagues have interviewed 75 officials from the past \n     six White Houses and are building what Kumar calls ``the \n     first institutional memory'' of seven key White House \n     offices, which together make up the nerve center of the \n     presidency.\n       They will present the president-elect's team with seven \n     short essays, drawn from the interviews, on ``how the place \n     should work,'' plus something that never before existed--a \n     Rolodex of past officials in those offices and their phone \n     numbers.\n       This may sound elementary, but the reality is that when a \n     new president moves in, his top aides find bare desks, empty \n     filing cabinets and disconnected computers. They need help.\n       And it will be there, especially if Gore and Bush don't \n     procrastinate in starting their transition planning.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Thompson, Levin, Durbin, Voinovich, Collins and Akaka to \nintroduce this legislation, which will help improve the transition from \none Presidential Administration to the next by providing training and \nother assistance.\n  Each newly elected President has the power to bring into government, \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, his or her own selection of \npolitical appointees to manage key agencies and offices within the \nExecutive Branch. However, new administrations face a series of hurdles \nthey must overcome to accomplish this essential task before they can \nbegin to govern. For example, new administrations often lack critical \ninformation about the jobs they must fill. Individuals without prior \ngovernment experience who are selected for key positions may be \nunfamiliar with how to work with Congress and the media and may run the \nrisk of missteps early in their tenure. But perhaps most importantly, \nthe process by which these individuals are nominated and confirmed has \nfallen into increasing disarray in recent years. Knowledgeable \nobservers have warned that it could take until November 2001 before all \nthe senior members of the new Administration are vetted and confirmed, \ndue to factors such as lengthier background checks, burdensome and \nduplicative financial disclosure forms, and a more contentious Senate \nconfirmation process.\n  The bill we are introducing today is a first step in responding to \nthese problems. It provides for training and orientation of high-level \nPresidential appointees, to better prepare them for the challenges of \ntheir new positions. It provides for the preparation of a ``transition \ndirectory'' containing essential information about the agency structure \nand responsibilities these new appointees will face. Our bill directs \nthe Office of Government Ethics to study ways to streamline the current \nfinancial disclosure process, while still ensuring disclosure of \npossible conflicts of interest.\n  More may need to be done. Several studies are underway to look at how \nwe can further improve the transition process, including the \nPresidential Appointee Initiative and the Transition to Governing \nProject. I commend those undertaking these studies and their efforts to \nprovide assistance to the upcoming crop of nominees, and I look forward \nto recommendations for future action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2706. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nestablish a program to provide dairy farmers a price safety net for \nsmall- and medium-sized dairy producers; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n              national dairy farmers fairness act of 2000\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nwill assist our nation's dairy farmers at a time when the dairy \nindustry is facing tremendous difficulty. This legislation proposes a \nregionally equitable plan that will bring some predictability to a \nbusiness that is otherwise challenged by inherent variability that \naccompanies dairy farming.\n  I am pleased to have Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin join with me \ntoday in this effort. Given the importance of the dairy industry to our \nrespective states, Senator Kohl and I worked together over the past few \nmonths to forge a consensus plan that addresses the concerns of dairy \nfarmers nationwide. For far too long, regional politics has plagued \nefforts to achieve a fair and equitable national dairy policy. As a \nresult, milk pricing has become increasingly complex and overly \nprescriptive. Given that dairy farmers are receiving the lowest price \nfor their milk in more than twenty years, I feel strongly that Congress \nneeded to step to the plate and offer a fair and responsible solution--\nthe very reason for this action.\n  The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act has two major goals: 1. \ncreate a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all regions of \nthe country; 2. provide more certainty for farmers in the prices they \nreceive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this legislation \ncreates a safety net for farmers by providing supplemental assistance \nwhen milk prices are low. Specifically, a sliding scale payment is made \nbased upon the previous year's price for the national average of Class \nIII milk. In short, the payment rate to farmers is highest when the \nprices they received were the lowest. In order to be eligible, a farmer \nmust have produced milk for commercial sale in the previous year, and \nwould be compensated on the first 26,000 hundredweight of production. \nAll dairy producers would be eligible to participate under this \nscenario.\n  Without a doubt, our dairy pricing policy is flawed. Many solutions--\nmodest to sweeping--have been proposed, discussed, and debated on the \nSenate floor yet final agreement among interested parties has so far \neluded us. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee who \nrepresents the fourth largest dairy producing state in the nation, I am \ncommitted to preserving the viability of Pennsylvania's dairy farmers. \nThis legislative proposal represents the strong concern and interest of \nmine to find a middle ground in the often heated debate on dairy \npolicy. I am pleased to join with Senator Kohl in this effort, and I \nbelieve it sends a strong signal that compromise can be achieved even \non the most contentious of issues.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today and join my colleague Senator \nRick Santorum of Pennsylvania to introduce legislation to provide much \nneeded assistance to our nation's dairy producers who are facing the \nlowest milk prices in over two decades.\n  Due to the failure of the federal order reform process and the \nAdministration's failure to include a meaningful dairy price safety net \nin its Fiscal Year 2001 budget, this legislation is an appropriate and \nnecessary response to the ongoing regional milk pricing inequities and \nthe dairy income crisis affecting all producers. In the past, the \ndivisive and controversial dairy compact system has hindered Congress's \nefforts to achieve a fair and equitable national dairy policy. I am \npleased to join with Senator Santorum to introduce this legislation to \ncreate a regionally equitable plan will provide a price safety net for \nsmall and medium sized dairy producers throughout the country.\n  The National Dairy Farmers Fairness Act of 2000 has two major goals: \n(1) to create a dairy policy that is equitable for farmers in all \nregions of the country; (2) provide stability for dairy producers in \nthe prices they receive for their milk. To accomplish these goals, this \nlegislation creates a price safety net for farmers by providing \nsupplemental income payments when milk prices are low. A ``sliding-\nscale'' payment is made based upon the previous year's price for the \nnational average for Class III milk. In essence, the payment rate to \nfarmers is highest when the national Class III average is the lowest. \nTo participate in this program, a farmer must have produced milk for \ncommercial sale in the previous year. Payments under the program are \nalso capped for the first 26,000 hundredweight of production. Again, \nall dairy producers would be eligible to participate under this \nscenario.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill includes $443 \nmillion in emergency direct payments to dairy producers for losses \nincurred this year. While this action is absolutely necessary to \nrespond to the current crisis, it is time that an on-going program \nproviding supplemental income payments to farmers when milk prices \ndecline be established. This important legislation represents a \nbipartisan and national approach in providing predictability and price \nstability in this otherwise volatile industry. Again, I am pleased to \njoin with Senator Santorum in introducing this legislation and look \nforward to working with him in passing this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2707. A bill to help ensure general aviation aircraft access to \nFederal land and the airspace over that land; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                the backcountry landing strip access act\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nmy colleagues, Senator Craig and Senator Burns, to introduce the \nBackcountry Landing Strip Access Act. This bill will preserve our \nnation's backcountry airstrips and require a public review and comment \nperiod before airstrips are temporarily or permanently closed.\n  Idaho is home to more than fifty backcountry airstrips and the state \nis known nationwide for its air access to wilderness and primitive \nareas. In testimony before Congress on the importance of preserving \nbackcountry airstrips, Bart Welsh, Aeronautics Administrator for the \nIdaho Department of Transportation, stated that these airstrips are, \n``an irreplaceable state and national treasure.'' Unfortunately, the \nreality today is that many airstrips have been closed or rendered \nunserviceable through neglect by federal agencies responsible for land \nmanagement. Even more troubling is that these closures occur without \nproviding the public with a justification for such action or an \nopportunity to comment on them.\n  Our bill would address this situation by preventing the Secretary of \nInterior and the Secretary of Agriculture from permanently closing \nairstrips without first consulting with state aviation agencies and \nusers. The legislation would also require that proposed closures would \nbe published in the Federal Register with a ninety-day public comment \nperiod. The bill directs the Secretary of Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, after consultation with the FAA, to adopt a nationwide \npolicy governing backcountry aviation. Finally, I would be remiss if I \ndid not mention that this bill is a result of Congressman Jim Hansen's \ntireless efforts in promoting backcountry aviation access in the other \nbody.\n  Backcountry airstrips are disappearing and, because of existing \nstatutes, they are irreplaceable. When the Frank Church Wilderness Act \nwas established in Idaho, it incorporated a provision to provide for \nthe continued operation of all existing landing strips. The Act states \nthat existing landing strips cannot be closed permanently or rendered \nunserviceable without the written consent of the State of Idaho. This \nhas created an effective partnership between personnel from the U.S. \nForest Service and staff from the Idaho Division of Aeronautics along \nwith other interested parties. My bill extends the success of the Frank \nChurch Wilderness Act provision nationwide to preserve airstrips in \nIdaho as well as other states.\n  I have heard from general aviation users and state aviation officials \nthat pilots often discover that an airstrip is closed only when they \nattempt to use it. This represents a grave danger to those who have not \nbeen made aware of an airstrip's closure. The public process in this \nbill would rectify this problem by ensuring that everyone with an \ninterest in backcountry aviation remains informed of a proposed closure \nand is allowed to comment on it.\n  Backcountry airstrips are active and essential to citizens who depend \non wilderness access. These airstrips are utilized by pilots and \noutdoor enthusiasts. In addition, access to the strips ensures a \nfundamental American service--universal postal delivery. Without access \nto backcountry airstrips, citizens who live and work in remote areas \nwould not receive their mails.\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n  Among the other vital functions of backcountry airstrips is their use \nfor firefighting, search and rescue, and especially their availability \nto pilots in emergencies. Backcountry airstrips are analogous to fire \nengines in a firehouse. Although the airstrip may not used daily, it is \nalways available in an emergency. Likewise, backcountry airstrips are \navailable as a safe haven for public flying in remote mountainous \nareas. Without the airstrips, these pilots would have little chance of \nsurvival while attempting an emergency landing.\n  Let me be clear, the Backcountry Landing Strip Access Act does not \nharm our forests or our wilderness areas, as some might suggest. \nMoreover, backcountry airstrips are regularly used by forest officials \nto maintain forests and trails, conduct ecological management projects, \nand aerial mapping. This bill is simply about access. It does not \nreopen airstrips that have already been closed, nor does it burden \nfederal officials with maintenance requirements. In fact, pilots \nthemselves regularly maintain backcountry strips.\n  The Backcounty Landing Strip Access Act is commonsense legislation \nthat allows those who used and benefit from the airstrips to be \ninvolved in the decision-making process. I have always found that \ndecisions on the use of public land are best handled by those who are \nimpacted the most, rather than federal bureaucrats in Washington, DC. \nIn Idaho, we have evolved into a cooperative relationship with federal \nland managers. It makes sense that the rest of the country should \nbenefit from this philosophy of cooperation. One we lose an airstrip it \nis gone forever. I urge my colleagues to join with us in an effort to \npreserve the remaining backcountry airstrips.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2708. A bill to establish a Patients Before Paperwork Medicare Red \nTape Reduction Commission to study the proliferation of paperwork under \nthe medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n the patients before paperwork medicare red tape reduction act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, Medicare paperwork requirements burden \nAmerica's seniors, health care providers, and federal government staff \nthat manage Medicare.\n  In 1998, the average processing time for appeals of claims denied \nunder Medicare Part A was 310 days. For Medicare Part B, the average \nappeal time was 524 days. Waiting periods of a year or longer are too \nlong for America's seniors to wait. These lengthy waiting periods tell \nme that there must be room for us to improve the way we administer \nMedicare.\n  HCFA regulations governing Medicare consist of 110,000 pages--six \ntimes as long as the Tax Code, which is 17,000 pages. In addition, HCFA \nuses 23 different forms to administer the Medicare program.\n  According to Dr. Nancy Dickey, Immediate Past President of the \nAmerican Medical Association, for most doctors, ``the biggest challenge \nis getting through mountains of Medicare paperwork.''\n  Let me give you some examples of how paperwork burdens and related \nregulations are affecting the Medicare program. Recently Dr. Joseph \nMarshall, a Washington, DC., gynecologist, became so frustrated with \nHCFA regulations that he chose to give his Medicare patients free \nvisits, so that he would avoid sending a bill to Medicare. HCFA would \nnot allow it. HCFA told him that if he did not bill HCFA, he could be \nfined and imprisoned.\n  A nonprofit Minnesota organization, Allina, which serves 35,000 \nseniors, expects to spend $2 million annually in paperwork related \nburdens. And Medicare paperwork burdens have forced increasing numbers \nof seniors to resort to ``insurance claim service'' firms to help them \ncomplete Medicare paperwork. These firms charge $20 to $75 an hour.\n  This is not the tax code I am referring to. This is Medicare, the \nprogram that is supposed to bring health care to elderly Americans, not \nbury them and their doctors under mountains of paperwork.\n  During the Clinton Administration, more than a quarter of the 110,000 \npages of Medicare regulations and paperwork have been added. In April \nof last year, HCFA proposed 93 new regulations based on the Balanced \nBudget Act alone.\n  Mr. President, drowning doctors and patients alike in a morass of \npaperwork must end. The seniors who have been promised Medicare \ncoverage throughout their working lives deserve the best possible \ncoverage. The doctors who treat them deserve our gratitude, not \nbureaucratic burdens and indifference.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the ``Patients Before Paperwork \nMedicare Red Tape Reduction Act of 2000.'' This legislation would \nestablish a Commission to examine inefficient and superfluous Medicare \npaperwork requirements and related regulations. The Commission will \ninclude physicians, hospital administrators, senior citizens, nursing \nhome and long term care administrators, and health care plan \nrepresentatives, the very people best able to determine which forms are \nnecessary to ensure quality coverage, and which forms create unfair \nburdens and time-wasting mandates from Washington.\n  The Commission will be responsible for reviewing existing paperwork \nburdens, with the goal of reducing those burdens. It will streamline \nand simplify the coding method for Medicare services, facilitate \nelectronic filing and the elimination of paperwork, and demonstrate \nthat existing and proposed paperwork requirements and related \nregulations have proven benefits, including a positive health benefit \nfor consumers.\n  The Commission will also explore the important issue of how patient-\ndoctor relationships have been impacted by onerous paperwork \nrequirements that force doctors to spend more time examining forms than \nexamining patients.\n  This legislation would alleviate the burden that Medicare paperwork \nimposes on millions of Medicare beneficiaries, health care providers, \nand our own federal government. By establishing this Commission, we \nwould create the opportunity to decrease Medicare paperwork burdens on \nseniors and promote efficiency within the health care industry and \nwithin the federal government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Regulations promulgated by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to administer the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act are 3 times as long as the \n     regulations relating to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) During the Administration of President Clinton, more \n     than a quarter of the 110,000 pages of medicare regulations \n     and paperwork have been added.\n       (3) According to American Medical Association Immediate \n     Past President Dr. Nancy W. Dickey, for most doctors, ``the \n     biggest challenge is getting through mountains of medicare \n     paperwork''.\n       (4) According to the Wall Street Journal, Allina, a \n     nonprofit Minnesota organization serving 35,000 medicare \n     beneficiaries, expects to spend $2,000,000 annually in \n     paperwork-related burdens.\n       (5) Medicare paperwork burdens have forced increasing \n     numbers of medicare beneficiaries to resort to the use of \n     ``insurance claim service'' firms that charge from $20 to $75 \n     an hour.\n       (6) The Health Care Financing Administration uses 23 \n     different forms in the administration of the medicare \n     program.\n       (7) In 1998, the average processing time for appeals of \n     claims denied under part A of the medicare program was 310 \n     days and the average appeal time was 524 days under part B of \n     such program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

To establish a Beef Industry Compensation Trust Fund with \nthe duties imposed on products of countries that fail to comply with \ncertain WTO dispute resolution decisions; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                     trade injury compensation act\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Trade \nInjury Compensation Act of 2000. I am joined in this effort by Senator \nBond, my fellow co-chairman of the Senate Beef Caucus, and Senators \nBingaman, Dorgan, Daschle, and Kerrey.\n  The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a Beef Industry \nCompensation Trust Fund to help the United States cattle industry \nwithstand the European Union's illegal ban on beef treated with \nhormones.\n  Over a year ago, the World Trade Organization endorsed retaliation \nwhen the EU refused to open to American beef. Since that time, the EU \nhas continued to stall in its compliance which is frankly, outrageous. \nFor over a decade we've fought the beef battle. Now its time to try \nsomething new to help producers who continue to be injured by the ban.\n  The Trade Injury Compensation Act establishes a mechanism for using \nthe tariffs imposed on the EU to directly aid U.S. beef producers. \nNormally, the additional tariff revenues received from retaliation go \nto the Treasury.\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\n This bill establishes a trust fund so that the affected industry will \nreceive those revenues as compensation for its injury.\n  Our legislation authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \ngrants to a nationally recognized beef promotion and research board for \nthe education and market promotion of the United States beef industry. \nIn particular, the fund shall:\n  (1) Provide assistance to United States beef producers to improve the \nquality of beef produced in the United States; and\n  (2) Provide assistance to United States beef producers in market \ndevelopment, consumer education, and promotion of the beef industry in \noverseas markets.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury shall cease the transfer of funds \nequivalent to the duties on the beef retaliation list only when the \nEuropean Union complies with the World Trade Organization ruling \nallowing United States beef producers access to the European market.\n  In a perfect world we would not need this legislation because the \nEuropean Union would abide by its international trade commitments. And \nit is still my hope that the European Union simply comply with the WTO \nDispute Settlement rulings and allow our beef to enter its borders.\n  Mr. President, the WTO is a critically important institution that \nsets the foundation and framework to make world trade grow. We all \nrecognize that it needs improvement, and I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, are working on ways to fix it. We must bring credibility \nand compliance to the system. The Trade Injury Compensation Act will \ngive some relief to our producers as we strive toward this endeavor.\n  I thank my colleagues for their sponsorship of this measure and \nstrongly urge support for its expeditious passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Graham, Mr. Dodd, \n        and Mr. Feingold):\n  S.J. Res. 48. A joint resolution calling upon the President to issue \na proclamation recognizing the 25th anniversary of the Helsinki Final \nAct; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           the helsinki final act 25th anniversary resolution\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. Today in my capacity as Co-Chairman of \nthe Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I introduce a \nresolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Helsinki Final \nAct, one of the key international agreements of our time. I am pleased \nto be joined by all Senate Commissioners, Senators Hutchison, \nLautenberg, Abraham, Brownback, Hutchinson, Graham, Dodd, and Feingold, \nwho are original cosponsors. A companion resolution also is being \nintroduced today in the House by our colleague, Congressman Chris Smith \nof New Jersey, who chairs the Helsinki Commission.\n  Five years ago, during the 20th anniversary celebrations in Helsinki, \nPresident Gerald Ford said: ``The Helsinki Accords, the Final Act, was \nthe final nail in the coffin of Marxism and communism in many, many \ncountries, and helped to bring about the change to a more democratic \npolitical system and a change to a more market-oriented economic \nsystem.'' Indeed, the Helsinki Final Act, signed by President Ford in \n1975, marked the beginning of a process which has served U.S. interests \nin advancing democracy, human rights and the rule of law within a \ncomprehensive framework covering the security, economic and human \ndimensions.\n  The legacy of Helsinki is especially historic with respect to what is \nnow referred to as the ``human dimension.'' The Helsinki process--now \nnamed the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \nis rightly credited with playing a contributing role in bringing down \nthe Berlin Wall and Iron Curtain, and, in 1991, the Soviet Union. In \nshort, the Helsinki process helped make it possible for the people of \nCentral and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to regain their \nfreedom and independence.\n  Both Western governments and private individuals increasingly cited \nthe Final Act, adopted by consensus, as a yardstick for measuring human \nrights performance, citing commitments which the violating governments \nfreely undertook.\n  Human rights groups, including the Helsinki Monitoring Groups in \nRussia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, Armenia, as well as in \nCzechoslovakia and Poland grounded their activities in the Helsinki \nprinciples. During the communist era, members of these groups often \nsacrificed their personal freedom and in some instances their lives for \ntheir courageous and vocal support for the principles enshrined in the \nHelsinki Final Act. The pressure of governmental efforts and public \nopinion in both East and West contributed greatly to change in the \nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n  Responding to a dramatically changed, post-Cold War world, the OSCE \nhas evolved into a useful institutional tool for addressing many of the \nchallenges confronting Europe and the Euro-Atlantic community today. \nThe OSCE is the one political organization that unites all the \ncountries of Europe, including all of the former Soviet republics, the \nUnited States and Canada, to face today's challenges. One of the \nprimary strengths of the Helsinki process is its comprehensive nature \nand membership, where current human rights, military security, and \ntrade and economic issues can be pursued.\n  The OSCE, now expanded to 55 from the original 35 countries, has been \nworking hard to minimize conflict and bring all sides together, \nespecially in the last decade which has seen several horrible regional \nconflicts, including in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Chechnya.\n  The OSCE has played an increasingly active role in civilian police-\nrelated activities, including training, as an integral part of the \nOrganization's efforts in conflict prevention, crisis management and \npost-conflict rehabilitation. It has also played an important role in \npromoting greater transparency through the adoption and implementation \nof various confidence and security-building measures designed to reduce \nthe risk of conflict in Europe. Other challenges that the OSCE is \nincreasingly addressing include the promotion of economic reforms \nthrough enhanced transparency for market economic activity, \nenvironmental responsibility, the importance of the rule of law and \nfighting organized crime and corruption. And, of course, human rights \nremains very much on the OSCE's agenda, including but not limited to, \nthe eradication of torture, free media, respect for the rights of \nindividuals belonging to national minorities, and ending discrimination \nagainst Roma and Sinti. Unfortunately, serious human rights abuses \ncontinue in all too many OSCE countries. The main challenge facing the \nparticipating States of the OSCE remains the implementation of the \ncommitments contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE \ndocuments. The Helsinki Commission, which I co-chair, will continue to \nwork in accordance with our mandate to monitor and encourage compliance \nby all the signatory States with their Helsinki commitments.\n  Mr. President, this resolution commemorates the 25th anniversary of \nthe signing of the Helsinki Final Act and authorizes the President to \nissue a proclamation reasserting America's commitment to full \nimplementation of the Helsinki Final Act, and request that he convey to \nall signatories that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \nand democratic principles as well as economic liberty and the \nimplementation of related commitments continue to be vital elements in \npromoting a new era of democracy, peace and unity in the OSCE region.\n  Twenty-five years after the signing of the Helsinki Final Act, the \nprinciples enshrined in that historic document remain valid and \ncontinue to serve as an important tool in advancing U.S. interests in a \nregion stretching from Vancouver to Vladivostok. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 48\n\n       Whereas August 1, 2000, is the 25th anniversary of the \n     Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (CSCE),\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\n     renamed the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe (OSCE) in January 1995 (in this joint resolution \n     referred to as the ``Helsinki Final Act'');\n       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act, for the first time in the \n     history of international agreements, accorded human rights \n     the status of a fundamental principle in regulating \n     international relations;\n       Whereas during the Communist era, members of \n     nongovernmental organizations, such as the Helsinki \n     Monitoring Groups in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, and \n     Armenia and similar groups in Czechoslovakia and Poland, \n     sacrificed their personal freedom and even their lives in \n     their courageous and vocal support for the principles \n     enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act;\n       Whereas the United States Congress contributed to advancing \n     the aims of the Helsinki Final Act by creating the Commission \n     on Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor and \n     encourage compliance with provisions of the Helsinki Final \n     Act;\n       Whereas in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the \n     participating states declared, ``Human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms are the birthright of all human beings, are \n     inalienable and are guaranteed by law. Their protection and \n     promotion is the first responsibility of government'';\n       Whereas in the 1991 Document of the Moscow Meeting of the \n     Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE, the \n     participating states ``categorically and irrevocably \n     declare[d] that the commitments undertaken in the field of \n     the human dimension of the CSCE are matters of direct and \n     legitimate concern to all participating States and do not \n     belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State \n     concerned'';\n       Whereas in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the \n     participating states committed themselves ``to build, \n     consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of \n     government of our nations'';\n       Whereas the 1999 Istanbul Charter for European Security and \n     Istanbul Summit Declaration note the particular challenges of \n     ending violence against women and children as well as sexual \n     exploitation and all forms of trafficking in human beings, \n     strengthening efforts to combat corruption, eradicating \n     torture, reinforcing efforts to end discrimination against \n     Roma and Sinti, and promoting democracy and respect for human \n     rights in Serbia;\n       Whereas the main challenge facing the participating states \n     remains the implementation of the principles and commitments \n     contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents \n     adopted on the basis of consensus;\n       Whereas the participating states have recognized that \n     economic liberty, social justice, and environmental \n     responsibility are indispensable for prosperity;\n       Whereas the participating states have committed themselves \n     to promote economic reforms through enhanced transparency for \n     economic activity with the aim of advancing the principles of \n     market economies;\n       Whereas the participating states have stressed the \n     importance of respect for the rule of law and of vigorous \n     efforts to fight organized crime and corruption, which \n     constitute a great threat to economic reform and prosperity;\n       Whereas OSCE has expanded the scope and substance of its \n     efforts, undertaking a variety of preventive diplomacy \n     initiatives designed to prevent, manage, and resolve conflict \n     within and among the participating states;\n       Whereas the politico-military aspects of security remain \n     vital to the interests of the participating states and \n     constitute a core element of OSCE's concept of comprehensive \n     security;\n       Whereas the OSCE has played an increasingly active role in \n     civilian police-related activities, including training, as an \n     integral part of OSCE's efforts in conflict prevention, \n     crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation; and\n       Whereas the participating states bear primary \n     responsibility for raising violations of the Helsinki Final \n     Act and other OSCE documents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     calls upon the President to--\n       (1) issue a proclamation--\n       (A) recognizing the 25th anniversary of the signing of the \n     Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe;\n       (B) reasserting the commitment of the United States to full \n     implementation of the Helsinki Final Act;\n       (C) urging all signatory states to abide by their \n     obligations under the Helsinki Final Act; and\n       (D) encouraging the people of the United States to join the \n     President and the Congress in observance of this anniversary \n     with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities; and\n       (2) convey to all signatory states of the Helsinki Final \n     Act that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \n     democratic principles, economic liberty, and the \n     implementation of related commitments continue to be vital \n     elements in promoting a new era of democracy, peace, and \n     unity in the region covered by the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":

SENIOR OFFICERS IN COMMAND IN HAWAII ON DECEMBER 7, \n                   1941.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, formerly the Commander \n     in Chief of the United States Fleet and the Commander in \n     Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and \n     unassailable record throughout his career in the United \n     States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (2) Major General Walter C. Short, formerly the Commander \n     of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had an \n     excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941, attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were not provided necessary and critical \n     intelligence that was available, that foretold of war with \n     Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that would have \n     alerted them to prepare for the attack, including such \n     essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb Plot \n     message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from the \n     Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese Ambassador \n     in the United States from December 6 to 7, 1941, known as the \n     Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his military \n     decisions and the disposition of his forces at the time of \n     the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor were proper ``by \n     virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had at hand \n     which indicated neither the probability nor the imminence of \n     an air attack on Pearl Harbor''; criticized the higher \n     command for not sharing with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very \n     critical period of November 26 to December 7, 1941, important \n     information . . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and, \n     concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that Lieutenant General Short had \n     not been kept ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n     for war''; detailed information and intelligence about \n     Japanese intentions and war plans were available in \n     ``abundance'' but were not shared with the General Short's \n     Hawaii command; and General Short was not provided ``on the \n     evening of December 6th and the early morning of December \n     7th, the critical information indicating an almost immediate \n     break with Japan, though there was ample time to have \n     accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were denied \n     their requests to defend themselves through trial by court-\n     martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral J. L. \n     Holloway, Jr., on April 27, 1954, recommended that Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (12) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that Lieutenant General Short \n     ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl Harbor \n     disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' to \n     advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the retired \n     list.\n       (13) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and recommended \n     that the case of Admiral Kimmel be reopened.\n       (14) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear \n     Admiral Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set \n     forth as a conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for \n     the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the \n     shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it \n     should be broadly shared''.\n       (15) The Dorn Report found that ``Army and Navy officials \n     in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic \n     communications . . . which provided crucial confirmation of \n     the imminence of war''; that ``the evidence of the handling \n     of these messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some \n     unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, limited \n     coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification \n     and followup at higher levels''; and, that ``together, these \n     characteristics resulted in failure . . . to appreciate fully \n     and to convey to the commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus \n     and urgency that these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (16) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from Admiral \n     Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.\n       (17) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (18) Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the \n     only two eligible officers from World War II who were \n     excluded from the list of retired officers presented for \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement on the \n     retired list serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a \n     distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two \n     of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States.\n       (20) Major General Walter Short died on September 23, 1949, \n     and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, without \n     the honor of having been returned to their wartime ranks as \n     were their fellow veterans of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, \n     and other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through \n     their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their \n     highest wartime grades.\n       (b) Advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General \n     Short on Retired Lists.--(1) The President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to \n     the grade of admiral on the retired list of the Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General Walter C. Short to \n     the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list of the \n     Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or change the \n     compensation or benefits from the United States to which any \n     person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon the \n     military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding the Professional \n     Performance of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.--\n     It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel performed his \n     duties as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on the naval \n     base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other targets on the island \n     of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a result of \n     dereliction in the performance of those duties by the then \n     Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General Walter C. Short performed his \n     duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on Hickam Army \n     Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and other targets \n     on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not \n     a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by \n     the then Lieutenant General Short.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BIDEN (AND ROTH) AMENDMENT NO. 3234\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for Mr. Biden (for himself and Mr. Roth)) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 2549, supra; as follows:\n\n         On page 378, between lines 19 and 20, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1027. REPORT ON SPARE PARTS AND REPAIR PARTS PROGRAM OF \n                   THE AIR FORCE FOR THE C-5 AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There exists a significant shortfall in the Nation's \n     current strategic airlift requirement, even though strategic \n     airlift remains critical to the national security strategy of \n     the United States.\n       (2) This shortfall results from the slow phase-out C-141 \n     aircraft and their replacement with C-17 aircraft and from \n     lower than optimal reliability rates for the C-5 aircraft.\n       (3) One of the primary causes of these reliability rates \n     for C-5 aircraft, and especially for operational unit \n     aircraft, is the shortage of spare repair parts. Over the \n     past 5 years, this shortage has been particularly evident in \n     the C-5 fleet.\n       (4) NMCS (Not Mission Capable for Supply) rates for C-5 \n     aircraft have increased significantly in the period between \n     1997 and 1999. At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, an average \n     of 7 through 9 C-5 aircraft were not available during that \n     period because of a lack of parts.\n       (5) Average rates of cannibalization of C-5 aircraft per \n     100 sorties of such aircraft have also increased during that \n     period and are well above the Air Mobility Command standard. \n     In any given month, this means devoting additional manhours \n     to cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft. At Dover Air Force Base, \n     an average of 800 to 1,000 additional manhours were required \n     for cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft during that period. \n     Cannibalizations are often required for aircraft that transit \n     through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those \n     that are based there.\n       (6) High cannibalization rates indicate a significant \n     problem in delivering spare parts in a timely manner and \n     systemic problems within the repair and maintenance process, \n     and also demoralize overworked maintenance crews.\n       (7) The C-5 aircraft remains an absolutely critical asset \n     in air mobility and airlifting heavy equipment and personnel \n     to both military contingencies and humanitarian relief \n     efforts around the world.\n       (8) Despite increased funding for spare and repair parts \n     and other efforts by the Air Force to mitigate the parts \n     shortage problem, Congress continues to receive reports of \n     significant cannibalizations to airworthy C-5 aircraft and \n     parts backlogs.\n       (b) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2001, and September \n     30, 2001, the Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the overall \n     status of the spare and repair parts program of the Air Force \n     for the C-5 aircraft.

AEROSPACE INDUSTRY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States aerospace industry, composed of \n     manufacturers of commercial, military, and business aircraft, \n     helicopters, aircraft engines, missiles, spacecraft, \n     materials, and related components and equipment, has a unique \n     role in the economic and national security of our Nation.\n       (2) In 1999, the aerospace industry continued to produce, \n     at $37,000,000,000, the largest trade surplus of any industry \n     in the United States economy.\n       (3) The United States aerospace industry employs 800,000 \n     Americans in highly skilled positions associated with \n     manufacturing aerospace products.\n       (4) United States aerospace technology is preeminent in the \n     global marketplace for both defense and commercial products.\n       (5) History since World War I has demonstrated that a \n     superior aerospace capability usually determines victory in \n     military operations and that a robust, technically innovative \n     aerospace capability will be essential for maintaining United \n     States military superiority in the 21st century.\n       (6) Federal Government policies concerning investment in \n     aerospace research and development and procurement, controls \n     on the export of services and goods containing advanced \n     technologies, and other aspects of the Government-industry \n     relationship will have a critical impact on the ability of \n     the United States aerospace industry to retain its position \n     of global leadership.\n       (7) Recent trends in investment in aerospace research and \n     development, in changes in global aerospace market share, and \n     in the development of competitive, non-United States \n     aerospace industries could undermine the future role of the \n     United States aerospace industry in the national economy and \n     in the security of the Nation.\n       (8) Because the United States aerospace industry stands at \n     an historical crossroads, it is advisable for the President \n     and Congress to appoint a blue ribbon commission to assess \n     the future of the industry and to make recommendations for \n     Federal Government actions to ensure United States \n     preeminence in aerospace in the 21st century.\n       (b) Establishment.--There is established a Blue Ribbon \n     Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace \n     Industry.\n       (c) Membership.--(1) The Commission shall be composed of 12 \n     members appointed, not later than March 1, 2001, as follows:\n       (A) Up to 6 members appointed by the President.\n       (B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (C) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House.\n       (D) One member appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (E) One member appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (2) The members of the Commission shall be appointed from \n     among--\n       (A) persons with extensive experience and national \n     reputations in aerospace manufacturing, economics, finance, \n     national security, international trade or foreign policy; and\n       (B) persons who are representative of labor organizations \n     associated with the aerospace industry.\n       (3) Members shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Commission. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect \n     its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner as the \n     original appointment.\n       (4) The President shall designate one member of the \n     Commission to serve as the Chairman.\n       (5) The Commission shall meet at the call of the Chairman. \n     A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum, but a \n     lesser number may hold hearings for the Commission.\n       (d) Duties.--(1) The Commission shall--\n       (A) study the issues associated with the future of the \n     United States aerospace industry\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\n     in the global economy, particularly in relationship to United \n     States national security; and\n       (B) assess the future importance of the domestic aerospace \n     industry for the economic and national security of the United \n     States.\n       (2) In order to fulfill its responsibilities, the \n     Commission shall study the following:\n       (A) The budget process of the Federal Government, \n     particularly with a view to assessing the adequacy of \n     projected budgets of the Federal Government agencies for \n     aerospace research and development and procurement.\n       (B) The acquisition process of the Federal Government, \n     particularly with a view to assessing--\n       (i) the adequacy of the current acquisition process of \n     Federal agencies; and\n       (ii) the procedures for developing and fielding aerospace \n     systems incorporating new technologies in a timely fashion.\n       (C) The policies, procedures, and methods for the financing \n     and payment of government contracts.\n       (D) Statutes and regulations governing international trade \n     and the export of technology, particularly with a view to \n     assessing--\n       (i) the extent to which the current system for controlling \n     the export of aerospace goods, services, and technologies \n     reflects an adequate balance between the need to protect \n     national security and the need to ensure unhindered access to \n     the global marketplace; and\n       (ii) the adequacy of United States and multilateral trade \n     laws and policies for maintaining the international \n     competitiveness of the United States aerospace industry.\n       (E) Policies governing taxation, particularly with a view \n     to assessing the impact of current tax laws and practices on \n     the international competitiveness of the aerospace industry.\n       (F) Programs for the maintenance of the national space \n     launch infrastructure, particularly with a view to assessing \n     the adequacy of current and projected programs for \n     maintaining the national space launch infrastructure.\n       (G) Programs for the support of science and engineering \n     education, including current programs for supporting \n     aerospace science and engineering efforts at institutions of \n     higher learning, with a view to determining the adequacy of \n     those programs.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than March 1, 2002, the \n     Commission shall submit a report on its activities to the \n     President and Congress.\n       (2) The report shall include the following:\n       (A) The Commission's findings and conclusions.\n       (B) Recommendations for actions by Federal Government \n     agencies to support the maintenance of a robust aerospace \n     industry in the United States in the 21st century.\n       (C) A discussion of the appropriate means for implementing \n     the recommendations.\n       (f) Implementation of Recommendations.--The heads of the \n     executive agencies of the Federal Government having \n     responsibility for matters covered by recommendations of the \n     Commission shall consider the implementation of those \n     recommendations in accordance with regular administrative \n     procedures. The Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall coordinate the consideration of the \n     recommendations among the heads of those agencies.\n       (g) Administrative Requirements and Authorities.--(1) The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall ensure \n     that the Commission is provided such administrative services, \n     facilities, staff, and other support services as may be \n     necessary.

Upon the request of the Chairman of the Commission, \n     the head of such department or agency shall furnish such \n     information to the Commission.\n       (4) The Commission may use the United States mails in the \n     same manner and under the same conditions as other \n     departments and agencies of the Federal Government.\n       (5) The Commission is an advisory committee for the \n     purposes of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. \n     2).\n       (h) Commission Personnel Matters.--(1) Members of the \n     Commission shall serve without additional compensation for \n     their service on the Commission, except that members \n     appointed from among private citizens may be allowed travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as \n     authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in \n     government service under subchapter I of chapter 57 of title \n     5, United States Code, while away from their homes and places \n     of business in the performance of services for the \n     Commission.\n       (2) The Chairman of the Commission may, without regard to \n     the civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate \n     any staff that may be necessary to enable the Commission to \n     perform its duties.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Nuclear Weapons \n     Complex Conversion Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 3192. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian nuclear weapons complex has begun closure \n     and complete reconfiguration of certain weapons complex \n     plants and productions lines. However, this work is at an \n     early stage. The major impediments to downsizing have been \n     economic and social conditions in Russia. Little information \n     about this complex is shared, and 10 of its most sensitive \n     cities remain closed. These cities house 750,000 people and \n     employ approximately 150,000 people in nuclear military \n     facilities. Although the Russian Federation Ministry of \n     Atomic Energy has announced the need to significantly \n     downsize its workforce, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, it \n     has been very slow in accomplishing this goal. Information on \n     the extent of any progress is very closely held.\n       (2) The United States, on the other hand, has significantly \n     downsized its nuclear weapons complex in an open and \n     transparent manner. As a result, an enormous asymmetry now \n     exists between the United States and Russia in nuclear weapon \n     production capacities and in transparency of such capacities. \n     It is in the national security interest of the United States \n     to assist the Russian Federation in accomplishing significant \n     reductions in its nuclear military complex and in helping it \n     to protect its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and \n     nuclear secrets during such reductions. Such assistance will \n     accomplish critical nonproliferation objectives and provide \n     essential support towards future arms reduction agreements. \n     The Russian Federation's program to close and reconfigure \n     weapons complex plants and production lines will address, if \n     it is implemented in a significant and transparent manner, \n     concerns about the Russian Federation's ability to quickly \n     reconstitute its arsenal.\n       (3) Several current programs address portions of the \n     downsizing and nuclear security concerns. The Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job \n     opportunities for employees who are not required to support \n     realistic Russian nuclear security requirements. Its focus \n     has been on creating commercial ventures that can provide \n     self-sustaining jobs in three of the closed cities. The \n     current scope and funding of the program are not commensurate \n     with the scale of the threats to the United States sought to \n     be addressed by the program.\n       (4) To effectively address threats to United States \n     national security interests, progress with respect to the \n     nuclear cities must be expanded and accelerated. The Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for an immediate \n     increase in investment which offers the potential for prompt \n     risk reduction in the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and \n     Zheleznogorsk, which house four key Russian nuclear \n     facilities. Furthermore, the Nuclear Cities Initiative has \n     made considerable progress with the limited funding \n     available. However, to gain sufficient advocacy for \n     additional support, the program must demonstrate--\n       (A) rapid progress in conversion and restructuring; and\n       (B) an ability for the United States to track progress \n     against verifiable milestones that support a Russian nuclear \n     complex consistent with their future national security \n     requirements.\n       (5) Reductions in the nuclear weapons-grade material stocks \n     in the United States and Russia enhance prospects for future \n     arms control agreements and reduce concerns that these \n     materials could lead to proliferation risks. Confidence in \n     both nations will be enhanced by knowledge of the extent of \n     each nation's stockpiles of weapons-grade materials. The \n     United States already makes this information public.\n       (6) Many current programs contribute to the goals stated \n     herein. However, the lack of programmatic coordination within \n     and among United States Government agencies impedes the \n     capability of the United States to make rapid progress. A \n     formal single point of coordination is essential to ensure \n     that all United States programs directed at cooperative \n     threat reduction, nuclear materials reduction and protection, \n     and the downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the \n     nuclear weapons complex effectively mitigate the risks \n     inherent in the Russian Federation's military complex.\n       (7) Specialists in the United States and the former Soviet \n     Union trained in nonproliferation studies can significantly \n     assist in the downsizing process while minimizing the threat \n     presented by potential proliferation of weapons materials or \n     expertise.\n\n     SEC. 3193.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) during September 1999, Hurricane Floyd ran a path of \n     destruction along the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to \n     Maine;\n       (2) Hurricane Floyd was the most destructive natural \n     disaster in the history of the State of North Carolina and \n     most costly natural disaster in the history of the State of \n     New Jersey;\n       (3) the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared \n     Hurricane Floyd the eighth worst natural disaster of the past \n     decade;\n       (4) although the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     coordinates the Federal response to natural disasters that \n     exceed the capabilities of State and local governments and \n     assists communities to recover from those disasters, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency is not equipped to \n     provide long-term economic recovery assistance;\n       (5) it has been 9 months since Hurricane Floyd and the \n     Nation has hundreds of communities that have yet to recover \n     from the devastation caused by that disaster;\n       (6) in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by providing additional economic community \n     development assistance to communities recovering from those \n     disasters, including $250,000,000 for Hurricane Georges in \n     1998, $552,000,000 for Red River Valley Floods in North \n     Dakota in 1997, $25,000,000 for Hurricanes Fran and Hortense \n     in 1996, and $725,000,000 for the Northridge Earthquake in \n     California in 1994;\n       (7) additional assistance provided by Congress to \n     communities recovering from natural disasters has been in the \n     form of community development block grants administered by \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development and grants \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration;\n       (8) communities affected by Hurricane Floyd are facing \n     similar recovery needs as have victims of other natural \n     disasters and will need long-term economic recovery plans to \n     make them strong again; and\n       (9) on April 7, 2000, the Senate passed amendment number \n     3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, which amendment would allocate \n     $250,000,000 in long-term economic development aid to assist \n     communities rebuilding from Hurricane Floyd, including \n     $150,000,000 in community development block grant funding and \n     $50,000,000 in rural facilities grant funding.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd should know \n     that, in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by demonstrating a commitment to helping affected \n     States and communities to recover;\n       (2) the Federal response to natural disasters has \n     traditionally been quick, supportive, and appropriate;\n       (3) recognizing that communities devastated by Hurricane \n     Floyd are facing tremendous challenges as they begin their \n     recovery, the Federal agencies that administer community and \n     regional development programs should expect an increase in \n     applications and other requests from these communities;\n       (4) community development block grants administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, grant programs \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration, and \n     the Community Facilities Grant Program administered by the \n     Department of Agriculture are resources that communities have \n     used to accomplish revitalization and economic development \n     following natural disasters; and\n       (5) additional community and regional development funding, \n     as provided for in amendment number 3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, \n     as passed by the Senate on April 7, 2000, should be \n     appropriated to assist communities in need of long-term \n     economic development aid as a result of damage suffered by \n     Hurricane Floyd.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       EDWARDS AMENDMENT NO. 3276\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. EDWARDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 2549; supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed the consideration of H.R. 3639, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3639) to designate the Federal building \n     located at 2201 C Street, Northwest, in the District of \n     Columbia, currently headquarters for the Department of State, \n     as the ``Harry S Truman Federal Building.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a farmer, \nArmy captain, Senator, and President of the United States who founded \nthe United Nations, launched the Marshall plan, and forged the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization [NATO]. As an original cosponsor of the \nbill to name the Federal building located at 2201 C Street, Northwest, \nin the District of Columbia, currently headquarters for the Department \nof State, as the ``Harry S Truman Federal Building.'' I am pleased that \nmy colleagues from both sides of the aisle and in both Houses have \nunanimously agreed to adopt this measure.\n  Fifty-five years ago, President Truman challenged Democrats and \nRepublicans in his Four Point Speech to join together and lend their \nfull support to international organizations; continue programs for \nworld economic recovery; join with other free peoples in the defense of \ndemocracy; and draw on our country's vast storehouse of technical \nexpertise to help people overseas help themselves in the fight against \nignorance, illness, and despair. President Truman envisioned ``that \nwhat happens beyond our shores determines how we live in our own \nlives,'' and the American people agreed. He exemplified the very best \nof what we need in our elected officials.\n  The United States is extremely fortunate to have had such a man be \nits Chief Executive in a time of two wars, where he presided over the \nfall of Germany, the ultimate surrender of Japan, and the preservation \nof South Korea. It is only appropriate for us to honor a man who made \nthe United States a major force in world affairs by working with all \nthe world for freedom and democracy. I look forward to seeing this \nlegislation adopted, and giving President Truman the recognition he \ndeserves for his tireless efforts to bring peace.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to endorse the measure to name \nthe State Department's headquarters after one of the great leaders of \nthe twentieth century--President Harry S Truman.\n  Harry Truman symbolized the path that this country took during the \n``American Century,'' moving from a small community in the American \nmidwest, to the center of the world stage, where he helped rebuild a \ndevastated Europe and contain Communism.\n  Harry Truman might have stayed on his farm in Independence, Missouri, \nbut World War I intervened and he found himself in Europe as a captain \nin the Field Artillery. The man whose poor eyesight had kept him out of \nWest Point, was a hero on the battlefields of France. When he returned \nto Independence--and the beautiful Bess Wallace--his reputation as a \nleader in battle led to his election as county judge in 1922. In 1935 \nhe was elected Senator from Missouri, and in 1945, he became President \nupon the death of Franklin Roosevelt.\n  Truman's mother once said of him: (i)t was on the farm that Harry got \nhis common sense. He didn't get it in town. It was this common sense--a \nhard-eyed pragmatism, really--that made him a great President. Having \nfought through the First World War in Europe, he was able to understand \nthe ruin that faced Europe after the Second World War. This led to his \nsupport of the brilliant plan of his Secretary of State, George \nMarshall, who rebuilt Europe. It is not an exaggeration to say that our \nEuropean allies own the peace and prosperity that they have enjoyed for \nthe last two generations to Truman and Marshall.\n  It was also this hard-eyed pragmatism that gave Truman a clear view \nof the Communist threat that come on the heels of World War II. He laid \nout--and acted upon--the Truman Doctrine--in 1947, when he provided \n$400 million to fight the spread of Communism in Greece and Turkey. In \n1949, he joined with Europe to form the alliance that contained the \nSoviet Union for nearly 50 years--NATO. And, although we were weary of \nwar in 1950, he sent American forces to defend South Korea from \nincursions by the Communists of North Korea.\n  Harry Truman's foreign policy decisions were never easy. Europe's \nreconstruction, fencing in Communism, creating NATO, required clear \nvision, and a decisiveness that had nothing to do with favorable poll \nnumbers or reelection prospects. Those are the attributes that made \nHarry Truman a great President--an ability to see what needed to be \ndone, and the willingness to do it.\n  Because President Truman's greatest legacy was in international \naffairs, it is fitting that his name be bestowed on the State \nDepartment's main building. I hope that it will provide an inspiration \nto our diplomats, as they seek to defend the interests of our country, \nand the world.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is my great privilege to speak on the \npassage of H.R. 3639 as I am the sponsor of the Senate's companion \nbill, S. 2416. This bill will name the State Department's headquarters \nat 2201 C Street in Washington, DC, the ``Harry S Truman Federal \nBuilding.'' First, I would like to provide my deepest thanks to my \nesteemed co-sponsor who have joined this effort. From the onset, this \nproposal has had strong bi-partisan support in both Houses. Senators \nBond, Warner, DeWine, and Moynihan and Representatives Roy Blunt and \nIke Skelton have been incredibly helpful in seeing this proposal become \na reality. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Honorable Secretary \nof State, Madeleine Albright, for her unqualified support and \ncooperation for honoring President Harry Truman befittingly honored in \nthis manner.\n  Today I enjoy the privilege, granted to me by the citizens of \nMissouri, of occupying the Senate seat formerly held by Harry S Truman. \nTruman left this seat in January 1945 to become Vice President, and by \nApril of that year assumed the office of President of the United States \nin the wake of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's death. The day \nafter becoming President, Truman told a group of reporters that ``boys, \nif you ever pray, pray for me now . . . I feel like the moon, the \nstars, and all the planets have fallen on me.''\n  As the new President, Harry Truman inherited a world on fire. The \nmost destructive war in human history still raged on in Europe and \nAsia; and Truman, the only chief executive in this century who did not \nenjoy a university education, faced a most crucial role bringing the \nwar to a close and constructing a viable international system in the \npostwar. Truman, whose strong personal integrity and vast common sense \nwas forged in the small towns of western Missouri, brilliantly \nsucceeded.\n  This bill will name the building that houses our Nation's Department \nof State--the agency responsible for international relations--in honor \nof Missouri's favorite son and one of our country's greatest statesmen. \nThis is benefitting, for it was the decisions made by President Truman \nin the realm of foreign policy that made his Presidency one of the most \nmonumental and influential in our country's history.\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n  President Harry Truman led during one of the most trying times in our \nnation's tumultuous history. During Truman's years in the White House, \ncrisis compounded crisis overseas and hard decisions continually \nconfronted a President who stoically dealt with the awesome \nresponsibilities he had to face.\n  After Truman assumed office he successfully led the United States to \nvictory against the Axis powers. However, the end of the Second World \nWar brought little respite for the new President from Missouri. The \ncooperation Truman, and most Americans, hoped to find with the Soviet \nUnion collapsed as an Iron Curtain descended across the heart of \nEurope. Behind it, the creation of totalitarian Communist regimes \nconfronted the United States with a new dark challenge--the cold war.\n  In response to this newest danger, President Truman led the free \nworld forward. He emphasized the need to support free people and assist \nthose who resisted attempted subjugation by armed minorities and \noutside pressures. To this end, Truman began the United States' single \nmost successful foreign aid initiative, the Marshall plan. Under \nTruman's leadership, this ambitious program saved the economies of \nWestern Europe and set vital United States allies on the path of full \nrecovery within a democratic political framework.\n  President Harry S Truman realized that economic recovery of war torn \nareas would not, in itself, secure the free world from Communist \naggression. Therefore, President Truman spearheaded the creation of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, one of the most successful military \nalliances of all time and the cornerstone of Western Europe's defense \nfor the past five decades.\n  Europe was not the only place where President Truman took a stand for \nfreedom and democracy in the face of aggression and hostility. When \nCommunist North Korea blatantly invaded South Korea in 1950, only \nTruman's quick action, and continued resolve, made possible South \nKorea's escape from the control of North Korea's totalitarian regime. \nThroughout the world, in Northern Iran, Berlin, China, and the Eastern \nMediterranean, Truman's strong and wise leadership, grounded in a small \ntown Missouri sense of right and wrong, heroically guided our country \nthrough some of its most dangerous years. In addition to his commitment \nto fight Communist aggression, the institutions created during the \nTruman years--such as the United States Air Force, the Department of \nDefense, the National Security Council, the Central Intelligence \nAgency--eventually ensured victory in the cold war, and enhanced the \nUnited States strength in the years after. Surely Winston Churchill \nexhibited his always impressive observational abilities when he told \nTruman in 1950 that ``. . . you, more than any other man, have saved \nWestern Civilization.''\n  I am proud to be a part of this effort today to see President Harry S \nTruman so honored. More than any other post-war President he shaped the \nworld we live in today. To name the headquarters of the United States \nState Department after this fellow Missourian is a fitting and just \nchoice.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, the citizens of eastern Washington will \nexperience a rare occurrence this week: Al Gore will visit there for \nthe first time since he was re-elected Vice President almost 4 years \nago. I welcome him to that beautiful part of Washington, and hope that \nhe takes the opportunity to listen to the concerns of as many people as \nhe can.\n  If he had come a week earlier, he could have joined me at any or all \nof the seven stops I made in eastern Washington, so that he could hear \nabout the primary concern of citizens--the proposed removal of dams by \nthe Clinton/Gore administration. On the other hand, knowing how eastern \nWashington citizens feel about hydroelectric dams, it is not a surprise \nthat he would choose to stay away.\n  But let me urge the citizens of eastern Washington to take a good \nlook around this week, because they will be getting a preview of what \nlife would be like under a Gore administration. Just as in the Clinton/\nGore administration, they would have a President and an administration \nwho believe that the Federal Government knows better than local \ncitizens do how to manage their eastern Washington way of life.\n  They would have an administration and a President who appears more \ninterested in politics and his own election than what is necessary to \nsave salmon or which energy source is the cleanest and most efficient \nfor Washington citizens.\n  Consider the following dubious challenge that eastern Washington \ncitizens face in this administration:\n  Next week, the Clinton/Gore administration will enact its 4(d) rules \nunder the Endangered Species Act. Under the rules, the National Marine \nFisheries Service will have the right to regulate the ``daily \nbehavior'' of Washington citizens, including how much energy they \nconsume, how far they travel, and how they maintain their gardens. \nEarlier this year, the administration ignored eastern Washington's \nrequest for more public hearings on the subject and more time to gain a \nbetter understanding of the vast impact the rules will have on their \nlives.\n  Later this summer, the administration will seek to implement the \nInterior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project over the strong \nopposition of many citizens of eastern Washington.\n  Tomorrow, Al Gore will announce that 200,000 acres on the Hanford \nsite will be set aside as a national monument by Presidential fiat. No \none disagrees that the Hanford Reach must be protected. It is a \nmagnificent part of the state that deserves preservation for \ngenerations to come. Of course, it is not now under threat and no \nemergency requires presidential action without consulting those who \nlive around the reach. So, as decisions are made on how to protect the \nHanford Reach, local consensus should be a vital component in reaching \nthose decisions.\n  I have always advocated collaboration with and listening to all of \nthe stakeholders to achieve a just solution. The Clinton/Gore approach \nis but one more example of Washington, D.C. deciding for Washington \ncommunities something I believe that they are fully capable of deciding \nfor themselves.\n  The fact that Gore will tell local people what the Federal Government \nintends to do on the Hanford site rather than listen is a preview of \nhow a Gore administration will deal with local citizens on a whole host \nof issues in the future.\n  The issue of the Snake River dams, however, is another matter. I \nexpect that while Al Gore is in eastern Washington, much as with his \nprevious visits to Seattle and Portland, he will refuse honestly to \nreveal his position about whether he believes tearing down the Snake \nRiver dams is necessary to save salmon.\n\n  Equivocating on an issue that will affect the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of people, cost billions of dollars, and have minimal if any \nimpact on salmon is flat out wrong. Last month, the only thing new that \nGore told reporters in Portland about his position on dams is that the \nissue requires more study and that ``he refuses to prejudge or play \npolitics'' with the issue. Well, if he's not playing politics with the \nissue, then I'm the inventor of the Internet.\n  After all, last fall the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, using science \nfrom the National Marine Fisheries Service, released a report stating \nthat more than 90 percent of adult salmon survive through all four of \nthe Snake River dams--the very dams that the administration has \nproposed to take out.\n  The Corps of Engineers was prepared to recommend, rightfully, that \nthe costs are too high, that the benefits are too few, and that the \ndams should be left in place. But high-ranking officials within the \nClinton-Gore administration directed the Corps' recommendation be \nsuppressed.\n  Al Gore owes the people of the Northwest an explanation. We deserve \nto know why the Clinton/Gore administration hid this important \nrecommendation from thousands of Northwest citizens who spent the \nbetter part of four out of the last five months writing comments, \nattending public meetings, and speaking out on the dams.\n  Al Gore apparently agrees with the National Marine Fisheries Service \nthat, despite the expenditure of $20 million and five years of study so \nfar by the Corps, any decision on the dams should be postponed for five \nyears, and that a ``trigger'' should be set, based upon the arbitrary \nperformance standards set by unelected bureaucrats, that will require \nthat the dams be breached if the standards are not met to their \nsatisfaction.\n  The fisheries service hasn't even published its biological opinion, \nwhich was due two months ago. How can we trust that delaying a decision \nfive years or the imposition of arbitrary performance standards won't \nalso be moved to meet the Gore agenda to take out the dams? We can't.\n  Another subject I'll bet the Vice President will ignore is the \namazing return of salmon to the Columbia and Snake river system last \nfall and this spring. It was reported last week that 189,000--a record \nnumber--of spring chinook salmon have passed through the Bonneville Dam \nalready. Will he be willing to declare victory and move on? Of course \nnot.\n  So, I hope that the Vice President enjoys his most recent trip to \nWashington.
