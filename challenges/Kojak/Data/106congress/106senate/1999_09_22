Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form prior to the vote \non the conference report.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate worked well into the evening \nlast night, and we had about an hour and a half of deliberations \nregarding this bill. We are prepared this morning, the distinguished \nranking member and myself, to conclude that debate.\n  Once again, I pay my heartfelt tribute to my distinguished ranking \nmember and the staff of the committee for a job well done. We have \nproduced a work product in which I believe this institution can take \ngreat pride.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is a constant learning experience, and \nalthough I have been privileged to have represented the Commonwealth of \nVirginia for some 21 years in the Senate, I experienced last night an \nevent which I shall always remember. We had concluded our debate, and I \nwas proceeding to do the wrapup on behalf of the majority leader, and \nwhen the Senate concluded its work, I was suddenly surrounded by the \npages, shaking hands, and expressing their great appreciation. It then \ntook me a minute to realize that we had concluded debate beyond the \nhour of 9 p.m., thereby foreclosing any requirement that they perform \ntheir homework. That was a tribute that I shall long remember.\n  The other experience last night was my distinguished good friend and \nranking member, the senior Senator from Michigan, announcing that he \nwould support this bill. I recognize it has been a serious struggle for \nhim and others occasioned by the amendment\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\non the bill regarding the reorganization of the Department of Energy.\n  I feel very strongly that the Senate did its duty on behalf of the \ncountry and put on that bill legislation in the course of the \nconference that is badly needed to reorganize that Department. I am \nconfident the current Secretary has the ability within this statute to \nlead that Department, restructuring it in a manner that it can continue \nto serve the United States and at the same time protect the vital \nsecurity matters that come before that Department.\n  The bill before us now marks a necessary turning point in reversing \nthe dangerous trends that we have witnessed in our military after 15 \nyears of declining defense spending. While the world has changed in \nmany ways since the end of the cold war, what has not changed is that \nAmerica's Armed Forces are bearing our commitments as they have always \ndone. There are, however, limits to that commitment by the men and \nwomen who proudly serve in uniform. Our forces are clearly overstressed \nin commitments throughout the world, the most recent being East Timor, \nwhere there was clear justification for U.S. participation.\n  Over the past decade, our military manpower has been reduced by one-\nthird, from 2.2 million to 1.4 million, and during this same period our \ntroops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. As the \nforce levels have been brought down, as the defense spending in that \nsame period was brought down, up went the number of times that \nPresident Clinton and, indeed, President Bush sent our troops beyond \nour shores--50 times. Compare that period of 10 years to the end of the \nVietnam war, in 1975, when we had a bipolar world--the Soviet Union and \nthe United States. In that period from 1975 until roughly 1990, a 15-\nyear period, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 deployments \nbeyond our shores. Therein is the reason why our committee, with the \nstrong support of the leadership--certainly Senator Lott initiated the \ncorrespondence that began to bring to the attention of the President, \nand indeed this body, the need for increased defense spending. \nEventually the President did recognize that need and indicated a \nwillingness to increase that spending.\n\n  Our committee, I am very proud to say, even went beyond the \nPresident's number for defense spending. We did so with the very able \nhelp and assistance of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On two \noccasions they came before our committee and clearly told us their own \npersonal views regarding the need for additional pay for the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, additional money for research and \ndevelopment and procurement, and, indeed, it was their testimony that \nlaid the solid foundation on which we come before the Senate today, \nproudly, with a bill, for the first time in 15 years, increasing \ndefense spending.\n  I yield the floor at this time to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank again the very able, \nvery distinguished chairman of our committee for the bipartisan \napproach with which he leads our committee. It has been a consistent \npattern for him since he has been in the Senate. We came here together, \nso we have a lot of knowledge and awareness of each other. He has \nreally made an extraordinary contribution to this body and to the well-\nbeing of the Nation. I commend him for it.\n  This bill is an important bill. It is really two bills. It is the \nDepartment of Defense bill, an authorization bill, but it is also a \nDepartment of Energy reorganization bill. It is the second bill that is \nthe troubling one. I have resolved to vote for this bill because I \nbelieve, on balance, it is at least possible that the reorganization \ncan be workable and that the Secretary of the Department of Energy will \nbe able to manage the Department and we will be able to hold him \naccountable. I am going to go into that a little more in a few moments, \nbut before I do, I want to talk a bit about the Department of Defense \npart of this bill because, as the chairman says, this is a very \nimportant contribution to the security of this Nation.\n  By increasing pay, by improving retirement, by enhancing retention, \nwe are making, we hope, a significant contribution to the security of \nthis Nation. The morale of our troops will be given a boost when they \nsee a bigger pay raise than they expected. The morale of our troops \nwill be boosted when they see a better retirement package than they \npreviously had. The morale of our troops, and indeed of all of our \ncitizens, should be boosted when they see that the readiness of our \nforces is given a boost from this bill. So the defense part of this \nbill, I believe, makes a significant contribution to the well-being of \nthe men and women in the military and to the security of this Nation.\n  The problem we had on this bill came from the DOE reorganization \nbecause the conference report is significantly different from what \npassed the Senate. What passed the Senate, after a great deal of \ndebate, was a reorganization of the Department of Energy which \nreflected the recommendation of the Rudman panel that there be a \nsemiautonomous Department of Energy. I think most of us favored that. I \nsurely do. But in a number of respects, this conference report goes \nbeyond what the Senate passed by an overwhelming vote. And when we \nreferred the language in the conference report to the Congressional \nResearch Service and asked them to do an analysis for us, to tell us \nwhat the differences were and whether or not they really were relevant, \nwhether or not they really were significant, whether or not they really \nlimited the ability of the Secretary of Energy to run his Department, \nthe CRS gave us their objective view of the conference report language. \nThere are some parts of that CRS review which should make us all pause, \nand which made me pause.\n  The Congressional Research Service concluded, for instance, that the \nSecretary's authority over this new nuclear security administration, \n``may be problematic, in view of the overall scheme of the proposed \nlegislation.''\n  The CRS said the language in the conference report raises questions \nabout ``whether it is possible, or desirable in practice, to split \npolicy and operations in organizational terms.'' And the CRS report \nasks whether the practice of insulating the staff offices of this new \nentity from the departmental staff offices ``effectively vitiate[s] the \nmeaning of the earlier provisions assigning the Secretary full \nauthority and control over any function of the Administration and its \npersonnel.''\n\n  Those are significant questions and potentially significant problems. \nOn the other hand, there is language in this conference report which \nsays that this new entity is established ``within the Department of \nEnergy,'' and therefore it is subject, obviously, to the direction and \ncontrol of the Secretary. The conference report says that the Secretary \nof Energy--not the new head of this entity, an Under Secretary, but the \nSecretary himself--is responsible for ``developing the security, \ncounterintelligence, and intelligence policies of the Department.''\n  The conference report says that the Secretary of Energy--not the new \nhead of the entity, who is an Under Secretary, but the Secretary--is \ngiven continuing responsibility for the security and \ncounterintelligence problems within the Department's nuclear energy \ndefense programs. And there are a number of other provisions similar to \nthat.\n  So it seems to me one can at least fairly argue that, given that \nauthority to establish policies, one will then have the authority to \nensure that policies are carried out. So we are going to have to \nmonitor very carefully this new entity as it is implemented, assuming \nthe President, of course, does not veto it. If the President does veto \nit, there is no certainty by any stretch of the imagination that the \nveto would be sustained. I am voting for this bill. I am always open to \nthe argument of a President, if he decided to veto it, as to why the \nveto, in fact, was dealt.\n  But based on what is before us, it seems to me there is at least a \nreasonable prospect that the Secretary of Energy will be able to manage \nthis Department. We intend to create a semiautonomous entity--not a \nsemiaccountable entity but a semiautonomous entity. We intend to create \nhere a semiautonomous entity, not a semiaccountable Secretary of \nEnergy. We want that Secretary to be fully accountable, which means he \nmust be able to manage, control, and\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\ndirect his Department, the policies in that Department, and the \nimplementation of those policies.\n  So I close by thanking our staff. I will not thank the pages since \nthey apparently owe us one, since we kept them here late enough last \nnight so they were relieved from some other duties. But I thank our \nstaff for their great work in making this bill a reality.\n  I shall vote for this bill. I, again, thank the chairman for his \nreaching out to all members of the committee for contributions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. This \nis a committee that works together as a team under our joint \nleadership.\n  The House of Representatives sent a strong signal which I hope, \nwithin the next 30 minutes, will likewise be sent by the Senate. That \nsignal went worldwide to the men and women of the Armed Forces, many of \nwhom are serving in harm's way to defend the very flag to which we \npledged our allegiance today. That vote was 375 to 45. I urge all \nSenators to give, likewise, support to this bill.\n  As I close my remarks and say that this bill is for those men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces, I take note of the presence on the floor of \nour distinguished former chairman, Senator Thurmond. There is no braver \nsoldier who ever served in the Senate than our distinguished chairman.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. He will, I assume, be casting one of the very first votes \nfor this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my views on this year's \nDefense authorization conference report. I plan to vote for the \nconference report. It is a bill that, like other defense bills of the \npast, contains a great many excellent provisions that enhance our \nmilitary capability and the quality of life for our service personnel \nand their families. My normal enthusiasm for the Defense bill this year \nis tempered, though, by a number of provisions that, in my view, do not \nserve the interest of national security well. I would like to review \nthe positive aspects of the conference report first, though, before \ndiscussing its troubling aspects.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have worked very hard \nto see that issues and programs that I care about were addressed in \nthis conference report. I am pleased to say that many of the concerns \nthat I raised in subcommittee, full committee, the floor, and finally, \nin conference have been met.\n  A few examples are worth emphasizing:\n  This conference report does a lot of very good things for the men and \nwomen in the military and their families. The services reported \ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining key personnel during the past \nyear--raising concerns that this might grow more serious in years to \ncome.\n  In response, the conference report includes a 4.8 percent pay raise \nfor military personnel, and raises the annual increase for service \npeople by a half a percentage point above increases in the cost of \nliving over the next five years. That's good news.\n  The conference report extends, and, in some important instances, \nincreases special pay and bonuses for key skill categories that were \ndue to expire at the end of this year.\n  Of particular interest to many New Mexico families at our Air Force \nbases at Holloman, Kirtland, and Cannon, junior and mid-career Air \nForce aviation officers could qualify for additional bonuses of $25,000 \nfor each year they promise to extend active duty service. That is good \nnews in our State and for the Nation.\n  The conference report also increases authority for re-enlistment \nbonuses from $45,000 to $60,000.\n  For retirees and folks in the military contemplating retirement, the \nconference report fixes the inequity that penalized those who came \nunder the Redux system after 1986. Those military personnel may now \nelect to transfer to the old system, or to accept a $30,000 bonus while \nremaining under the Redux program. Recent retirees and those soon to \nretire in New Mexico enthusiastically welcome this provision.\n  Veterans and their families will also benefit from a very important \nmeasure in this year's conference report--a change that have been \nadvocating for the last couple of years. Any veteran's family seeking \nan honor guard at the funeral of one of our veterans is now guaranteed \nto have one. Uniformed personnel, the presentation of an American flag, \nand the playing taps will be provided in recognition for service to the \nnation whenever requested. That is good news for our veterans \ncommunity.\n  There is another initiative for veterans that I strongly support in \nthis conference report. It could lead to authorization for veterans to \nuse National Guard armories to receive services and counseling \nregarding a wide spectrum of veterans' benefit programs. This measure \ncould go a long way toward making it easier for our veterans to receive \nthe benefits that they are due.\n  That is a bit about the ``people part'' of the conference report--an \narea where I think it has quite a bit to offer.\n  The conference report also makes some important contributions on key \npolicy matters--for example, programs that have to do with preventing \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, particularly through \ncooperative programs with Russia and other countries of the Newly \nIndependent States.\n  The conference report includes, for example, $475 million for the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program to accelerate the disarmament of \nRussian strategic weapons, assist in chemical weapons destruction, and \nsupport efforts to increase security for Russian nuclear materials in \norder to prevent them from being smuggled aboard. I urge the Congress \nto fully support this program through authorization and appropriation \nof the necessary funds. It remains fully in our own security interests \nto do so.\n  There is also funding for programs to prevent Russian weapons \nscientists from selling their skills to the higher bidder. The \nInitiatives for Proliferation Prevention and the Nuclear Cities \nInitiative will help us to keep that from happening, while at the same \ntime building important people to people relationships that we hope \nwill sustain improved relations between our nations during coming \ndecades.\n  Again, although I believe these programs are worthy of more funding \nthan they received, I am pleased that funding has been authorized and I \nurge the Congress to appropriate those funds as well.\n  This conference report also authorizes funds for another important \ncooperative program that will serve our security interest well--the \nRussian-American Observation Satellite program (RAMOS). RAMOS is being \ndesigned to take the uncertainty out of early warning of missile \nattacks. It is meant to ensure that in case a missile firing is \ndetected, a military order to respond with nuclear missiles is not made \nin error. Fully funding a robust RAMOS program will greatly serve our \nnation's nuclear security. I urge the defense appropriators to ensure \nthat those funds are available.\n\n  Looking toward the future of the Nation's military capability, this \nconference report includes funding for basic science and technology \nresearch in accordance with my hopes and intentions to increase that \nlevel of funding by 2 percent in real terms. That level of funding was \nnot won without a fight, however, and I remain concerned that future \ndefense budgets may fall short in this area. If that happens, the \ntechnological advantages that we have witnessed in the Persian Gulf and \nin the Balkans will erode quickly, and international military \nchallenges could result in significant casualties and losses of \nexpensive military equipment.\n  As you know, the conference report also authorizes funding for \ndefense programs within the Department of Energy (DOE). This bill \nauthorizes $4.5 billion for DOE weapons programs including the science-\nbased stockpile stewardship that enables the Department to certify the \nsafety and reliability of our nuclear weapons without having to test \nthem.\n  Stockpile Stewardship is providing challenging science to a new \ngeneration of scientists employed at the labs that will not only \ncertify the stockpile, but assure the nation that the best scientific \ntalent available continues to\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nsupport science programs at our national laboratories such as those in \nmy State, Sandia and Los Alamos.\n  These aspects of the Defense conference report are all very \nfavorable, and normally I would vote for such a report with the \ngreatest enthusiasm. My enthusiasm, though, is diminished by the \nprovisions of the conference report dealing with the management of the \nDepartment of Energy. These provisions cause me deep concern, as I \nbelieve they will be damaging to our national security in the long \nterm.\n  These troublesome provisions are largely found in Title 32 of the \nconference report. This is a wholly new Title that was inserted in \nconference. It was not part of the original Defense bill passed by the \nSenate or by the House. It differs substantially, in a few crucial \nrespects, from the DOE reorganization proposals considered and agreed \nto by the Senate in the intelligence authorization bill.\n  Title 32 contains the most sweeping revisions in DOE organization \nsince the founding of the agency in 1977. Yet, there was not a single \nMembers' meeting throughout the entire conference to discuss its \nprovisions. When you consider the importance of our nuclear arsenal, \nthe lack of a role for Members in fixing the terms of its \nreorganization is striking and very hard to justify.\n  The result is a statute that, in my view, will be exceptionally \ndifficult to implement. Coping with the ambiguities and internal \ncontradictions of Title 32 will needlessly distract the new \nadministration and the Department of Energy from the mission of \nmaintaining the safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile. This \nis not just my personal view. The ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee commissioned a study of title 32 from the experts in \nlaw and government organization at the Congressional Research Service \n(CRS), after the conference report was filed. The CRS produced a \nsobering assessment of this new title, highlights of which my colleague \nhas shared with us. I have also received an expression of deep concern \nfrom 43 State attorneys general about the impact of the changes that \nwere made in Title 32 on the applicability of the Federal Facilities \nCompliance Act to the new administration. Their concern merits our \nattention, and I hope that the Armed Services Committee arranges for \nhearings at which they can present their views directly for our \nconsideration.\n  In addition to these issues, the new title 32 creates what looks to \nme to be a complete muddle in the area of counterintelligence and \nresponsibilities and authorities. The problems that the conference \nreport create for DOE counterintelligence programs can best be \ndescribed by looking at before-and-after organizational charts of \ncounterintelligence responsibilities related to one of DOE's \nfacilities, the Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n  Chart 1 shows the current flow of responsibility and authority for \ncounterintelligence at DOE and Los Alamos. It is very simple, and \nSecretary Richardson is to be commended for putting it in place. The \nDOE Chief of Counterintelligence, Ed Curran, is in charge. He has hire-\nand-fire authority over the Chief of Counterintelligence at DOE \nfacilities like Los Alamos. If we discover a loss of classified \ninformation at Los Alamos tomorrow, we know where to look for answers.\n  Chart 2 depicts the lines of authority that will exist under title \n32. Secretary Richardson's reforms will be completely reversed. Under \ntitle 32, DOE will have two competing centers of control over \ncounterintelligence in the nuclear weapons complex. Which of these \nindividuals is in charge of counterintelligence? If you define ``being \nin charge'' as being able to issue direct commands to the labs, where \nthe counterintelligence threat exists, it would appear that neither \nperson is in charge.\n\n  The Director of DOE-wide Counterintelligence is statutorily forbidden \nfrom exercising any direct control over the laboratories. He can issue \npolicy pronouncements, and has to go up through the Secretary of Energy \nand then down through 4 layers of bureaucracy to get in touch with a \nlab like Los Alamos.\n  And the Chief of Defense Nuclear Counterintelligence is not in a much \nbetter position, either. He also has to go up through his boss and down \nthrough a lateral chain of command to impose his will on anyone at the \nlaboratories. He can talk to everyone, hence the dotted lines, but he \ncannot tell anyone anything definitive on his own authority.\n  The lack of clarity for counterintelligence responsibility in title \n32 is perhaps the most ironic and distressing aspect of the whole DOE \nreorganization scheme. Right now, these responsibilities in the \nDepartment are clear, thanks to Secretary Richardson's reforms. When we \nstarted debating changes to DOE organization, the one change that \neveryone seemed to agree on was the need to have clarity on matters of \ncounterintelligence. Yet, after this Defense bill is enacted, we will \nbe back to the days of diffuse responsibility for counterintelligence.\n  I have no illusions that we are going to vote down this conference \nreport because of the defects in title 32. There are too many other \nimportant things that got done right in this bill. But we have created \na real muddle at the Department of Energy in the area of nuclear \nweapons and their management. We will have to come back in next year's \nDefense bill to fix it.\n  There is one other issue that we will have to address next year. That \nis the issue of polygraphs. The section on counterintelligence \npolygraphs in the conference report is a slight improvement over the \ncorresponding provision in the Senate-passed Defense bill. But there \nare still fundamental problems with what we are asking DOE to do. We \nare asking DOE to use polygraphs as a screening tool--the one \napplication where the scientific validity of polygraphs is most \nsuspect. I don't have a big problem with using some forms of polygraphs \nin the context of an investigation, where there is already evidence of \nwrongdoing. There is scientific support for that sort of polygraph \ntest. But polygraphs as a screening tool have little or no track record \nin the scientific literature. We shouldn't be using them in the nuclear \nweapons complex. And the way that DOE has proposed to use polygraphs in \nits recent Federal Register notice goes beyond what we actually call \nfor in this bill. I have taken a public position in opposition to this \nproposed DOE rule on polygraphs, because it is not based on sound \nscience and does not represent reasoned decision making, in my view.\n  I hope that DOE will rethink its proposed rule. This conference \nreport, although it encourages the use of screening polygraphs, also \ngives DOE the flexibility to study the matter further. I hope that DOE \nwill seek review from the National Academy of Sciences on the \nreliability of the types of polygraph screening it plans to implement. \nI also recommend that the DOE reconstitute and reconvene the Chiles \nCommission to study the rule's likely impact on the critical human \nresources needed to ensure the safety and reliability of the nuclear \nweapons stockpile. The Senate could, in my view, profit from such \nstudies in revisiting this issue in next year's Defense bill.\n  In the end, then this year's conference report is more of a mixed bag \nthan in most years. What we have done through the normal committee and \nconference process, on a bipartisan basis, has been done well, and we \ncan be justly proud of it. What was done in a rushed and less \ncooperative fashion is much less satisfactory. I support the conference \nreport overall, and I expect that the problems that have been \nneedlessly created will manifest themselves for corrective action in \nfairly short order. I hope that when they do arise, we are able to \naddress them in a more bipartisan and thoughtful way.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the provisions \nin this bill reorganizing the Department of Energy. In particular, I \nfear we are returning to the days of DOE ``self regulation'', which has \nhistorically translated into ``no regulation'' for environment, health \nand safety laws.\n  Senator Warner and I will enter into a colloquy later that I hope \nwill clarify the intent of this legislation regarding provisions \ncritical to the safety of our workers and communities. We are \nparticularly concerned about the autonomy of the newly-created, largely \nindependent ``National Nuclear Security Administration.'' We fear the \ncreation of NNSA will recreate the institutional conditions that \nresulted in 50 years of\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nenvironmental, safety, and health mismanagement at DOE facilities--\nestimated to cost up to $200 billion to clean up. Hanford alone now \nreceives appropriations of about $1 billion/year to clean up the legacy \nleft from decades of the Atomic Energy Commission and/or Department of \nEnergy self-regulation.\n  I am heartened by Senator Domenici's statements in the press that we \nhave little to fear in this regard. He is quoted in USA Today (9/16/99) \nas saying: ``Nowhere does the legislation waive the application of \nenvironment or safety laws. What this legislation changes is not the \nstatutory requirements, just the management structure responsible for \ncomplying with them.'' I will take him at his word that that is the \nintent. I ask unanimous consent to have the USA Today article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Sept. 16, 1999]\n\nNuclear Security Scare Could Put Safety Second--Driven by Spy Scandal, \n  Legislation Would Take Weapons Sites Out of the Hands of Regulators\n\n                           [By Peter Eisler]\n\n       Washington.--U.S. nuclear weapons plants and labs, \n     notorious as toxic and radioactive polluters, could be left \n     outside the reach of environmental, health and safety \n     regulators under management changes Congress is pushing to \n     deal with security concerns.\n       Spurred by a spy scandal at the Los Alamos (N.M.) National \n     Laboratory that highlighted security problems at weapons \n     facilities nationwide, the House passed legislation Wednesday \n     to put eight of the Energy Department's plants and labs under \n     a new, semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security \n     Administration (NNSA). Senate approval is expected soon.\n       The plan aims to free the sites from a mammoth Energy \n     Department bureaucracy criticized for diluting protections \n     against spies, thieves and saboteurs.\n       But it also leaves the NNSA largely on its own to make sure \n     plants and labs meet environmental, health and worker safety \n     laws. Federal oversight programs set up in the late '80s to \n     address longtime contamination problems would lose virtually \n     all jurisdiction over the facilities. And the states, which \n     also have gained regulatory power over the weapons sites in \n     recent years, complain that they, too, could lose authority.\n       The plan is reviving debates that have burned since the \n     first atomic bombs rolled out of Los Alamos in 1945.\n       On one hand, recent reports that Chinese spies penetrated \n     key facilities to steal an array of U.S. nuclear secrets \n     highlight the program's need for secrecy and insularity. On \n     the other, the program has a record of poisoning workers and \n     communities with toxic and radioactive material when left on \n     its own.\n       ``For over four decades, (the nuclear weapons program) \n     operated with no external and little internal oversight of \n     environment, safety and health . . . (with) disastrous \n     consequences,'' says a recent letter to lawmakers from the \n     attorneys general of 45 states. ``We should not return to \n     (that) era.''\n       The National Governors' Association and former Energy \n     officials from the Clinton and Bush administrations also \n     oppose the reorganization plan. And Energy Secretary Bill \n     Richardson says he probably will urge a presidential veto.\n       But a veto would be politically and practically difficult, \n     in large part because the plan is folded into a bill \n     authorizing unrelated but popular defense programs, including \n     a military pay raise. President Clinton would have to reject \n     the entire bill, and aides concede that would be a tough \n     call.\n       ``The bottom line is we have a 20-year-old problem'' with \n     security at weapons plants and labs, says Rep. Mac \n     Thornberry, R-Texas, a chief backer of the reorganization \n     plan. Those problems, he says, lie in Energy Department \n     management that is ``cluttered up worrying about refrigerator \n     coolant standards'' and other missions--not about weapons \n     production and safeguarding secrets.\n       ``I don't think the Congress or the administration wants to \n     end this year without making some reforms,'' Thornberry says.\n\n\n                           changing missions\n\n       In the scramble to win the Cold War arms race, the U.S. \n     nuclear weapons program operated largely in secret, churning \n     out warheads with a doggedness that left little room for \n     environmental, health and safety concerns. With almost no \n     outside supervision, weapons facilities put workers in harm's \n     way without telling them and illegally dumped millions of \n     tons of toxic and radioactive waste on and around their \n     sites.\n       In communities from Richland, Wash., to Oak Ridge, Tenn., \n     soil and groundwater contamination is widespread. Several \n     communities have sued the Energy Department, claiming health \n     problems.\n       Since the United States halted nuclear arms production in \n     1989, the focus at many sites has shifted to environmental \n     restoration. Even those facilities still doing weapons work--\n     refining the current nuclear arsenal and disassembling \n     weapons eliminated by global treaties--spend up to half their \n     money on cleanup. The work is expected to take decades and \n     cost up to $200 billion.\n       Beginning in the late '80s, environmental, health and \n     safety officials who oversee that work gained far more sway \n     over the plants and the labs. States, in particular, picked \n     up vast new powers in 1992, when Congress stripped weapons \n     sites' immunity from local regulation.\n       Now, the spy scandal that erupted this spring at Los Alamos \n     raises questions about whether weapons sites lost track of \n     security concerns amid their changing missions.\n       A congressional report in May suggested that China stole \n     information throughout the 1980s and perhaps into the early \n     '90s on every U.S. warhead. Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee \n     was pegged as a suspect and fired for alleged security \n     violations, though no criminal charges have been filed and he \n     denies wrongdoing.\n       The episode drew attention to security problems at weapons \n     facilities nationwide, leading to a damning investigation by \n     a presidential board.\n       ``Never before has this panel found such a cavalier \n     attitude toward one of the most serious responsibilities in \n     the federal government--control of the design information \n     related to nuclear weapons,'' the President's Foreign \n     Intelligence Advisory Board reported.\n       Throughout the '90s, senior management at the Energy \n     Department failed repeatedly to act on security officials' \n     reports that budget cuts and institutional inattention were \n     weakening safeguards at weapons sites.\n       Supporters of Congress' restructuring plan say the problem \n     is a lack of clear responsibility for facilities' security \n     and argue that the weapons sites must be put on their own, \n     for everything from security to environmental restoration, so \n     they're clearly accountable for all aspects of their \n     operation.\n       The plan puts the new weapons agency on its own with the \n     Energy Department, giving it autonomy in key areas:\n       All policy matters, including personnel, legal affairs and \n     budget decisions; security, intelligence and \n     counterintelligence operations; and environmental, health and \n     safety programs.\n       ``Nowhere does the legislation waive the application of \n     environment or safety laws,'' says Sen. Pete Domenici, R-NM., \n     a chief sponsor. ``What this legislation changes is not the \n     statutory requirements, just the management structure \n     responsible for complying'' with them.\n\n\n                               bad omens\n\n       Opponents of the congressional plan note that weapons \n     plants and labs have been on their own before, and their \n     environmental, health and safety records were abysmal.\n       ``Production of nuclear weapons has always been their whole \n     role in life; everything else is secondary,'' says Leo Duffy, \n     assistant Energy secretary in the Bush administration.\n       ``All the environmental damage, the jeopardy to employees' \n     safety and health, almost none of this was identified until \n     1988,'' when outside regulators went in, says Duffy, who ran \n     those early oversight programs.\n       Duffy and other critics of Congress' plan suggest the \n     answer is to set up clearer responsibility for security \n     within the Energy Department. But they say oversight on \n     environmental, safety and health matters should remain \n     outside the purview of those running weapons programs. They \n     also want the legislation's language to more clearly retain \n     states' jurisdiction over the sites.\n       Proponents dismiss such concerns as unfounded. And they \n     note that many of the plants and labs with the worst records \n     on pollution and worker safety no longer do much weapons \n     work, so Congress' plans wouldn't necessarily change their \n     oversight.\n       Among them: the Hanford nuclear reservation in western \n     Washington, where poorly stored waste has fouled water \n     supplies; the Rocky Flats plant outside Denver, where large \n     tracts of land suffer from radioactive contamination; and \n     uranium processing plants in Cincinnati and Paducah, Ky., \n     where workers were unknowingly exposed to radioactivity.\n       But sites that would come under new management also have \n     their share of problems.\n       Just this month, for example, the Department of Energy's \n     office of environment, safety and health cited the Los Alamos \n     lab for two incidents in which workers were exposed to \n     radioactive material that wasn't stored or handled properly. \n     In 1998, the Lawrence Livermore lab was forced to shut down a \n     plutonium storage facility after repeated failures to follow \n     procedures meant to prevent an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.\n       Congress' plan to have those sites regulated by an agency \n     primarily devoted to weapons work ``would undermine over a \n     decade of progress to improve environment and safety \n     standards,'' Richardson says.\n       The reorganization would leave the Energy secretary with \n     power to fire the head of the weapons agency, but neither he \n     nor any other Energy officials would have direct control over \n     operations.\n       If the secretary suspected wrongdoing at a facility, he \n     could assign outside inspectors and order the agency director \n     to implement their recommendations. But if the director \n     refused, the secretary's only recourse would be to replace \n     him, a proposition that would require congressional consent \n     and could take months.\n       The Congressional Research Service, Congress' nonpartisan \n     research arm, reported\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n     last week that such an arrangement ``may be problematic'' \n     because it ``tends to make secretarial authority less \n     direct.''\n       Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who requested the study, wants \n     Congress to rework the plan.\n       Officials in the states also want changes, arguing that the \n     legislation's language could return weapons plants and labs \n     to the pre-1992 era when they were immune from state \n     environmental and safety laws.\n       The bill's proponents say it does no such thing, suggesting \n     that foes are nitpicking the plan simply because they don't \n     want to oppose it outright.\n       ``This is a chance to fix a serious (security) problem,'' \n     says Thornberry, ``and I don't think turf disputes or \n     jurisdictional disputes should get in the way.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Unfortunately, 46 State Attorneys General have written \nvoicing their ``serious concerns'' with many of this bill's provisions. \nThey fear title XXXII of the bill would ``weaken the existing internal \nand external oversight structure for DOE's environmental, safety and \nhealth operations.''\n  I am very concerned about the DOE restricting provisions of this bill \nand so am tempted to vote against it. However, there are many \nprovisions in the DOD authorization bill that will strengthen our \ncountry, our national defense, and our cleanup programs at DOE sites. I \nam particularly proud to support our belated efforts to increase the \npay of our military personnel.\n  In addition, I very much appreciate Chairman Warner's agreement to \nenter into the colloquy that follows. Therefore, I will support this \nbill in the hopes that this colloquy and the public comments made by \ndrafters of title XXXII will ensure continuing compliance with \nenvironment, safety, and health laws and orders by the NNSA.\n  I hope we can go back to the drawing board on the DOE restructuring \nprovisions either through a veto of the bill this year or a new attempt \nto craft a better solution next year.\n  Thank you, again, Chairman Warner for your work on the overall bill \nand your colloquy with me on the important subject of protecting our \ncommunities and environment at DOE facilities.\n\n\n                              Title XXXII\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nregarding Title XXXII of the bill regarding Department of Energy \nrestructuring. I understand the intent of this title was to improve \nsecurity at Department facilities. Unfortunately, I am concerned that \nsome of the language might cause confusion with regard to the \nobligation of the National Nuclear Security Administration to comply \nwith environmental laws. From remarks I have seen in the popular press, \nI understand this was not the author's intent and I would like to \nclarify several provisions.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator for her interest in helping clarify \nthese important provisions. I agree we must continue to protect the \nenvironment, safety and health at DOE facilities.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. First, Title XXXII of the Defense Authorization bill has \nnot been drafted to impair state regulatory authority or to eliminate \nDOE's internal oversight of environment, safety and health. Correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. Section 3261 provides: ``COMPLIANCE \nREQUIRED.--The Administrator [of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration] shall ensure that the Administration complies with all \napplicable environmental, safety, and health statutes and substantive \nrequirements. PROCEDURES REQUIRED.--The Administrator shall develop \nprocedures for meeting such requirements. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.--\nNothing in this title shall diminish the authority of the Secretary of \nEnergy to ascertain and ensure that such compliance occurs.'' Section \n3261 was included to make clear NNSA's obligation to continue to comply \nwith environmental laws and DOE environmental orders.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is clear then that this provision does not affect the \nobligation of the Administrator of the NNSA and the Secretary of \nEnergy, to comply with existing environmental laws and DOE \nenvironmental orders. Indeed, it makes explicit NNSA's legal obligation \nto comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and \nprovides that the Administrator of the NNSA has primary responsibility \nand accountability for environmental compliance programs at NNSA \nfacilities. Furthermore, Section 3261 does not affect or abrogate \nexisting waivers of sovereign immunity in environmental laws. Finally, \nSection 3261 retains the Secretary of Energy's existing authority over \nenvironmental compliance issues at the nine sites that will be \nincorporated into the NNSA. If compliance problems arise, the Secretary \nmay investigate them, which can include requesting the assistance of \nstaff from DOE's Environmental Management or Environmental, Health & \nSafety programs, and impose corrective actions when the Secretary \nidentifies deficiencies. Is this a correct interpretation?\n  Mr. WARNER. This is the correct interpretation of Section 3261. \nRetaining Secretarial authorities over environmental compliance is an \nessential element of Title XXXII.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 Conference Report before \nus today. Chairman Warner and his Committee have done an excellent job \nin prioritizing available funds to provide for our national defense.\n  Any deficiencies in this authorization bill are a result of overall \nbudget constraints and expanded commitments rather than inattention to \nour nation's vital security needs. I appreciate the Committees efforts \nto bring direct spending under control in this bill and conform to the \nBudget Act limitations.\n  As Chairman of the Budget Committee and a member of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee I know how difficult the exercise of \nprioritizing funds is. Every year all of the Congressional Defense \nCommittees face tough choices as to how to best allocate funding so as \nto meet our immediate defense needs without sacrificing our future. As \nbudgets shrink and global commitments swell, this task becomes \nincreasingly difficult.\n  Mr. President, I would like to underscore the problems Congress \ncurrently faces. Here my message is two-fold: first, we do not live in \na peaceful world; and, secondly, we cannot defend our national \ninterests if we are not committed to a strong military.\n  I, and many of my colleagues, believe that U.S. prosperity rests on a \nstrong, dedicated military. Everyone has heard the phrase ``peace \nthrough strength.'' Perhaps some believe that having been coined during \nthe Cold War, this adage is anachronistic. I strongly disagree.\n  Continued economic growth and the absence of a tangible, imminent \nthreat to our security breed complacency. Complacency characterizes the \ncurrent attitude toward our national security.\n  As victors of the Cold War we appear to have a false sense of \nsecurity about this new era. Thus far, the results of U.S. military \nintervention have not offered evidence that we should worry.\n  However, our current military superiority is a product of the massive \ninvestments made during the Cold War. This Administration has not \nsustained the necessary investments. At the same time, they've \nincreased U.S. military commitments overseas--often without clearly \ndefining the strategic objective of those deployments.\n  Complacency regarding our nation's strategic interests sends a \nmessage that ripples through every level of our national security \napparatus--from our current inability to recruit the requisite talent \nto the trained pilots, technicians, and mid-career military \nprofessionals leaving for private sector jobs.\n  Although diffuse and more difficult to discern, threats to our \nnational security do exist.\n  Instability in numerous regions throughout the world create security \nrisks with adverse economic, and potentially strategic, impact. \nProliferation of weapons of mass destruction also presents a grave \nthreat. NATO intervention in Kosovo further aggravated potential \nthreats to our national security--specifically, damage to our relations \nwith Russia and China. In addition, Kosovo deployments will stretch an \nalready overextended military to its limits--not to mention a limited, \nbut not insignificant, contribution to peacekeeping efforts in East \nTimor.\n  Peace through strength is still an appropriate theme. Complacency \nerodes our potential. If we demonstrate a strong commitment to the men \nand women in uniform, they will have a good reason to join and to stay.\n  Mr. President, with those thoughts in mind, I would like to briefly \ndiscuss\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\nthe work of Senator Warner's Committee on the Conference Report before \nus today.\n  First, a critical initial step in meeting our commitment to the men \nand women in uniform is found in the pay raises, incentive pay, and \npension reforms found in this bill. As of January 1 next year, all \nmembers of the uniformed services will receive a 4.8% increase in their \nmonthly pay. Furthermore, pay increases beyond that date will be one \nhalf a percent above inflation.\n  The Conference Report outlines special incentive pay and enlistment \nbonuses to a variety of needed specialists or highly-trained personnel \nin our armed forces.\n  Lastly, improvements to military retirement pay and eligibility in \nthe Thrift Savings Plan will provide additional reasons to join and \ncontinue serving in our military services.\n  According to a GAO study requested by myself and Senator Stevens \nmilitary pay and retirement packages are not the core reasons for our \nretention problems. However, these improvements offer an important \nfirst step toward addressing quality of life shortfalls in the lives of \nour military men and women.\n  The Committee also increased readiness funding beyond the \nAdministration's request. In addition to the $2.25 billion of emergency \nmoney, this conference report adds about $1.6 billion in readiness-\nrelated accounts.\n  The President's budget only included $5.4 billion in military \nconstruction to fund $8.5 billion worth of projects. This ``split \nfunding'' approach was to be a one-time accounting gimmick to create \nroom for other spending and still remain under the budget caps. I \napplaud the Authorization Committees' decision not to use this approach \nfor military construction.\n  The pay and pension reforms as well as additional funding for \nmilitary readiness and military construction will alleviate some of the \nproblems in the immediate term.\n  Necessary still is to address the foreign policy decisions that have \nled to the high operational tempo. More money cannot resolve questions \nregarding overseas operations or the organizational ability of any one \nmilitary branch to respond to post-Cold War deployments.\n  These are systemic problems borne of both domestic and foreign policy \ndecisions. Unless and until we clarify the U.S. position and \nresponsibilities in this new era, we will not know the rules for \nengagement or intervention. This dilemma has profound implications for \nthe size, structure, and capabilities of our military.\n  There are several items of significant impact on the state of New \nMexico included in this authorization bill. I would like to briefly \ndiscuss a few of them.\n  Although foremost a matter of national security, the provisions on \nthe Department of Energy restructuring also will have a substantial \nimpact on thousands of workers in New Mexico. These provisions ensure \nthat brilliant science and tight security are compatible within our \nnuclear weapons infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) Report demanded legislative \nchanges. It clearly stated, ``The Department of Energy is a \ndysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven incapable of reforming \nitself.'' The PFIAB Report's specific recommendations included:\n  Creation of a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  Streamline the Nuclear Stewardship management structure.\n  Ensure effective administration of safeguards, security, and \ncounterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by creating a \ncoherent security/CI structure within the new agency.\n  I and my colleagues, Senator Kyl and Senator Murkowski, followed \nthese recommendations closely in drafting the legislation for DOE \nrestructuring. The creation of a semi-autonomous agency for our nuclear \nweapons work will implement a true ``Chain of Command'' approach, with \nall the discipline this entails. I truly believe that this approach, if \nit had been used in the past, may have avoided some of these security \nproblems and will help us avoid them in the future.\n  These changes are desperately needed at the Department of Energy, and \nthey must be made now.\n  Another national defense issue that has substantial implications for \nNew Mexico is the McGregor Range withdrawal.\n  McGregor Range is one of six military parcels withdrawn from public \ndomain in 1986. These parcels comprise nearly 30 percent of the \nDepartment of Defense's 25 million acres. McGregor Range comprises \nnearly 700,000 of Fort Bliss's 1.12 million acres. The Fort Bliss \ngarrison is adjacent to El Paso, Texas, but McGregor Range is located \nentirely in New Mexico.\n  McGregor range is vital to military training and readiness. Fort \nBliss has a critical role as a national center for air defense, and \nMcGregor Range is essential for fulfilling that role. McGregor Range is \nthe only range in the United States capable of training America's air \nand missile defense forces. Because all CONUS Patriot forces are \nstationed at Fort Bliss they depend on McGregor for the training needed \nto ensure their full readiness prior to deployment.\n  There is strong regional support for this renewal. 176 public \ncomments expressed support for the Army's preferred alternative. An \nadditional 26 expressed support for one of the other alternatives. The \nprovisions in this bill will continue historic non-military uses of the \nrange which include livestock grazing and hunting for 25 years.\n  Military training and testing requirements for McGregor Range are \nforeseen for at least the next 50-years based on weapons systems that \nare either currently fielded or are planned for fielding in the near \nfuture. For this reason, the Army's Environmental Impact Statement \npreferred a 50-year withdrawal.\n  My amendment to the Senate Defense Appropriations bill includes a 50-\nyear withdrawal. I am pleased with the work of the Authorization \nCommittee, but I still firmly believe that 25 years is not an adequate \nperiod of time for withdrawal of the McGregor Range.\n  Many important programs for the Air Force Research Laboratory at \nKirtland were authorized by the conferees. Aerospace propulsion \nprograms at Phillips were increased by $6 million. An increase of $28.6 \nmillion above the $115.3 million budget request was authorized for \nPhillips' Exploratory Development programs. Advanced Spacecraft \nTechnology programs received an additional $19.5 million authorization, \nincluding $5 million for the Scorpius Low-Cost Launch program.\n  Directed energy programs comprise a substantial proportion of New \nMexico's defense related research, development, and testing \ninitiatives. Different services are working on a variety of laser \nweapons to achieve better and cheaper cost-per-kill defenses against \nmissiles. Chemical lasers development for the Airborne and Space Based \nLaser programs are authorized at almost $500 million annually. The \npioneering work and ongoing basic research for these systems is at \nPhillips in Albuquerque.\n  With a view toward the future of laser weapons, this conference \nreport requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a unified DoD laser \nmaster plan. The objective is to maximize the return on our investment \nin these important technologies by coordinating these efforts across \nthe services and provide a roadmap for future development. I strongly \nsupport this effort.\n  The conferees also provided an additional $20 million authorization \nfor solid state laser development and $10 million for the Tactical High \nEnergy Laser (THEL), programs which are tested at the High Energy Laser \nTest Facility (HELSTF) at White Sands Missile Range. HELSTF is also \ndesignated as the Army's Center of Excellence for all Army test and \nevaluation activities.\n  An additional $4 million is authorized for the Counterterror \nTechnical Support program. This funding will support the cutting-edge \nresearch in blast mitigation materials and structures at New Mexico \nTech.\n  Although the President's request included no funding for military \nconstruction at New Mexico's defense installations, the conferees added \n$9.8 million to renovate 76 units of housing at Holloman Air Force base \nand $14 million to replace cracked and deteriorating airfield ramps at \nKirtland. Another $8.1 million is authorized to repair one of the main \nrunways at Cannon Air Force base. In addition, the\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\nNew Mexico Air National Guard's Composite Support Complex at Kirtland \nis authorized at $9.7 million. All of these projects address quality of \nlife or operational needs of the utmost importance to personnel at \nthese installations.\n  Mr. President, again, I would like to thank Senator Warner and the \nmembers of his Committee for their diligent work in allocating tight \nresources in the best feasible manner.\n  At the same time, I would like to reiterate my view that many of the \nproblems we currently face in our Defense Committees result from \ninadequate definition of U.S. interests.\n  The systemic problems--retention, readiness, operational tempo--are a \nproduct of domestic and foreign policy decisions. We have neither \nclarified the U.S. position in the current international environment \nnor have we established relevant rules for U.S. engagement. Instead, we \nrely more and more on our military to compensate for failed diplomacy. \nOr we ask our soldiers to play referee in regions of the world teeming \nwith ethnic conflict and territorial disputes.\n  Without first defining our national interest in this new era, we \ncannot pretend to downsize, right-size, or structure our military to \nadequately defend U.S. interests throughout the world. More \nimportantly, without a clear picture of the appropriate military \nstructure and necessary force capabilities we cannot answer the $280 \nbillion question: How much is enough?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Department of Defense \nauthorization conference report for fiscal year 2000, and I \ncongratulate our new chairman, Senator John Warner, on completing this \nfirst conference report as chairman. While I am disappointed that some \nprovisions in the Senate version of the bill were dropped, on the whole \nit is an excellent piece of legislation and I am pleased to support it.\n  My most important concern is over the changes made in Title 32, which \nestablishes the National Nuclear Security Administration and \nreorganizes the Department of Energy's nuclear laboratories. When we \nfirst considered this issue on the intelligence authorization bill in \nJuly, the Senate passed the Kyl amendment, which reorganized these \nnuclear labs by a vote of 96-1. Unfortunately, during conference \ndeliberations, these provisions were substantially rewritten. Secretary \nRichrdson has expressed his strong objections to these provisions, and \nstates that they will make it more difficult for the Secretary of \nenergy to oversee the labs. I hope that the Armed Services Committee \nwill work with Secretary Richardson to address his concerns in the \nfiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill.\n  America has faced many global challenges this year that have re-\nemphasized the need for our Nation to maintain a well-trained and well-\nequipped military. This year's crisis in Kosovo was particularly \nchallenging and required the Nation's Armed Forces to perform a wide \nvariety of duties, including peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, \nin addition to sustained combat operations. Our service men and women \nperformed superbly in all that was asked of them, and I commend them on \ntheir dedication, professionalism, and unwavering devotion to duty. \nWithout their skill, we would not be as close to peace in the Balkans \nas we are today.\n  It is the duty of Congress to ensure that we provide our military \nwith what is needs to meet the international challenges common in the \npost-cold-war era. America must be ready, when necessary, to protect \nits vital interests and encourage global stability. The fiscal year \n2000 Defense conference report is a positive step toward ensuring that \nthe Nation's military is prepared to meet the challenges of the years \nahead.\n  The cornerstone of the military's preeminence rests on its most \ncritical component, its people. Without adequate number of men and \nwomen willing to serve in the military, the Nation would not be able to \nrespond to crises around the globe. We need cutting-edge weapon \nsystems, but we also need dedicated men and women to operate these \nsystems. The conference report contains many new initiatives and \nconstructive changes in personnel policies that will help to ensure \nthat we adequately provide for our servicemen and women and their \nfamilies.\n  Specifically, the conference report provides a fully-funded and well-\ndeserved 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel, as well as \nexpanded authority to offer additional pay and other incentives to \nretain service members in critical military specialties. The conference \nreport also improves retirement benefits by addressing service members' \nconcerns with the current system and approving their participation in \nthe Thrift Savings Plan.\n  I am very disappointed, however, that Senator Cleland's amendment to \nimprove and expand GI bill benefits for servicemen and women was not \nincluded in the conference report. The Montgomery GI bill has been a \nvery successful and important program for the military. But, in order \nfor the GI bill to continue to be a valuable program, it must evolve as \nour military forces evolve. Access to higher education is an \nincreasingly important issue for our servicemen and women in today's \nall-volunteer, professional military. Senator Cleland's GI bill \nprovisions, included in the Senate version of the bill, made needed \nimprovements in the GI bill that would have enhanced the program's \nvalue and benefit to our troops, and would have improved its \neffectiveness as a recruiting tool. I commend Senator Cleland on his \nleadership on these provisions and I urge my colleagues to reconsider \nthese innovative ideas next year.\n  The DOD authorization conference report also reauthorizes and \nenhances the very successful Troops-to-Teachers program. Over the next \nten years, the Nation's schools will need to hire two million new \nteachers to fill their classrooms. Troops-to-Teachers is helping to \nmeet that challenge by recruiting and training servicemen and women to \nbecome teachers in public schools. This program was established by \nCongress in 1993 and has already placed over 3,000 servicemen and women \nin elementary and secondary schools in 48 states. The conference report \nalso provides for the transfer of this program to the Department of \nEducation, so that it will be coordinated with other federal education \nprograms that are helping communities to improve their public schools.\n  Concern for our military personnel doesn't end with the active duty \nservicemember, but with the whole military family. Well over half of \nthe members of today's military are married, and in many cases both \nparents are employed. The military also contains many single mothers \nand fathers. All of these individuals have unique characteristics and \nneeds that must be recognized so that we can encourage their continued \nservice and careers in the armed forces.\n  The conference report contains a provision, which I strongly \nsupported, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide financial \nassistance for child care services and youth programs for members of \nthe Armed Forces and their families. These expanded child care \nprovisions will ensure that many more military families have access to \nquality childcare and after-school care for their children.\n  Also, military families are not immune to the epidemic of domestic \nviolence that confronts the rest of America. We have a responsibility \nto military families to help prevent domestic violence, and to protect \nthe victims when abuse occurs.\n  An important provision in this year's conference report requires the \nSecretary of Defense to appoint a military-civilian task force to \nreview military policies on domestic violence. This task force, \ncomprised of military, DOD, law enforcement personnel, and civilian \nadvocates for battered women and children, will work with the Secretary \nof Defense to establish Department-wide standards for combating \ndomestic violence.\n  These initiatives will include standard formats for memorandums of \nunderstanding between the armed services and local law enforcement \nauthorities for responding to domestic violence; a requirement that \ncommanding officers must provide a written copy of any no-contact or \nrestraining order to victims of abuse; standard guidance for commanding \nofficers on considering criminal charges in cases of domestic violence; \nand a standard training program for all commanding officers on domestic \nviolence.\n  This provision also requires the Department to establish a database, \nthe contents of which will be annually reported to Congress. The \ninformation\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\nwill include each domestic violence incident reported to military \nauthorities and how that incident was resolved. This provision also \nrequires the military-civilian task force to report to Congress \nannually about the progress made in combating domestic violence in the \nmilitary.\n  The conference report also takes a number of worthwhile steps to \naddress equipment modernization requirements that have been deferred \nfor too long. The chairwoman of the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator \nSnowe, took the lead this year in advocating a strong shipbuilding \nbudget, as well as a strong research and development budget, for the \nNavy and Marine Corps. It was a privilege to work with her this year, \nand, I am pleased that this conference report takes these important \nsteps to ensure that the Navy has the ships, submarines, and other \nequipment needed to sustain its operations throughout the world.\n  The conference report authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 \nDestroyer multi-year procurement into fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and \nincreases the number of ships to be built from 12 to 18 ships. The \nconference report also authorizes the Navy to enter into a five-year \nmulti-year procurement contract for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and \nincreases the number of Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft \nfrom 10 to 12. These are all strong steps in strengthening the \nreadiness of the Nation's Navy-Marine Corps team.\n  Procurement isn't the only area where we need to strengthen our \ninvestment. We also need to strengthen investment in science and \ntechnology. Last year, the Defense authorization bill called for a 2 \npercent annual increase, above inflation, in military spending on \nscience and technology from 2000 to 2008. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment's proposed fiscal year 2000 budget reduced spending on \nscience and technology programs. The Air Force alone was slated for $95 \nmillion in cuts in science and technology funding. Such a decline would \nhave been detrimental to national defense, particularly when the \nbattlefield environment is becoming more and more reliant on high \ntechnology.\n  Fortunately, thanks in great part to the chairman of the Emerging \nThreats and Technology Subcommittee, Senator Roberts, and his ranking \nmember, Senator Bingaman, Congress restored much of this Air Force \nscience and technology funding. This restoration will help to ensure \nthat high quality scientists and engineers are available to conduct \nresearch to address the Department's technology needs for the future. \nCongress has taken a clear position in support of maintaining sound \ninvestments in Defense science and technology programs. I urge the \nDepartment to request a strong science and technology budget next year, \none that will ensure the future of these important programs.\n  One of the most significant of these science and technology fields is \ncyber-security. The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on \nthe Department of Defense's computer systems are cause for concern, and \nthey highlight the need for improved protection of the nation's \ncritical defense networks. This conference report includes a \nsubstantial increase in research and development for defenses against \ncyber attacks, and this increase will greatly improve the Department's \nfocus on this emerging threat.\n  Existing threats from the cold war are also addressed in this \nlegislation. Financial assistance to the nations of the former Soviet \nUnion for nonproliferation activities such as the Nunn-Lugar \nComprehensive Threat Reduction programs is essential for our national \nsecurity. I commend the administration's plans to continue funding \nthese valuable initiatives, and I commend a Congress' support for them.\n  One of the most serious threats to our national security is the \ndanger of terrorism, particularly using biological, chemical or nuclear \nweapons of mass destruction. We must do all we can to prevent our \nenemies from acquiring these devastating weapons, and do all we can to \nkeep terrorists from being able to conduct an attack on our nation. \nSignificant progress has been made to strengthen the nation's response \nto such attacks, but more must be done. The conference report \nstrengthens counter-terrorism activities and increases support for the \nNational Guard teams that are part of this important effort.\n  Again, I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for \ntheir leadership on these important national security issues. This \nconference report is essential for our national security in the years \nahead, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \nissue concerning the Department of Energy and its ability to secure \nnuclear information. Nuclear security is imperative to this nation, and \nafter the scandals in the last year, Americans have questioned the \nability of the Department of Energy to keep nuclear information secure. \nAs a result, Senator Warner, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nand Ranking Member Levin included legislation in the Defense \nAuthorization Conference Report that creates a new division within the \nDepartment to restore nuclear security. I applaud their efforts.\n  However, Mr. President, I am concerned about the potential for \nunintended consequences as a result of the Department of Energy \nreorganization. Specifically, the attorneys general of 46 states, \nincluding the State of Ohio, wrote to Congress stating that the 1992 \nDepartment of Energy reforms which clarify that states have regulatory \nauthority of the Department of Energy's hazardous waste management and \ncleanup could be undermined by this legislation. The attorneys general \nbelieve that this legislation could allow the Federal Government to \nabandon its commitment to ``environmental, health and safety \nrequirements'' at Energy Department facilities nationwide. This is \ntroubling for the State of Ohio, which has three former Department of \nEnergy nuclear facilities--the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, \nFernald, and the Mound Nuclear Facility. Each facility is at a \ndifferent stage of cleanup, and recent revelations of plutonium \ncontamination at the Portsmouth facility only emphasize the need for \nstrong environmental, health, and safety requirements at these DOE \nfacilities.\n  While I have heard the concerns of the attorneys general, I am \nassured by the Armed Services Committee that the intent of this \nlegislation is not to exempt nuclear facilities from state \nenvironmental regulations and requirements or worker safety and health \nregulations. I am further assured that if there are any unintended \nconsequences, Congress will rectify these problems.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the Conference Report on the National \nDefense Authorization Act before us today makes a healthy increase of \nover 8 billion dollars to the President's request. This reflects \nconcerns by the Congress that readiness has eroded to a point where our \nmilitary is having to take significant risks in its day-to-day \noperations.\n  Many of our colleagues are aware that we have sized our armed forces \nto engage not only in two major theater wars that break out nearly \nsimultaneously, but also to handle the Bosnias, Kosovos and other \nsmaller-scale contingencies that challenge our interests overseas. For \nthe first time since we adopted our 2-war strategy not long after the \nend of the Cold War, the commanders in charge of our warfighting forces \nare warning the Congress--again for the first time in the post Cold War \nera--that the risks in our ability to fight in that second theater have \ngone from moderate to high.\n  This risk is not merely some esoteric metric that only some military \nstrategist can comprehend. Rather, the dangers are that we will lose an \nunacceptable number of men and women in battle, that we will lose \nexcessive territory in the initial phases of battle, and that battles \nwill last much longer than they would with a more capable force.\n  This is a serious warning--not one we should take lightly. The \nmilitary challenges to the U.S. in the decades ahead are ill-defined \nand very difficult to predict. While the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nhas signaled a significant drawdown in Bosnia in the near future, while \nour commitment of troops to Kosovo is relatively small compared to \nthose of our European allies, and while signs of progress on the Korean \npeninsula are making news this week, we also see the tragedy in East \nTimor, renewed Chinese threats against Taiwan, and rebel action in \nRussia, all of which\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\nremind us of the extraordinary instabilities that we will face in the \nnext century.\n  Whether we will see more or less conflict is unclear, but the growing \ncompetition for fixed resources in impoverished regions where \npopulations grow unabated suggests that civil and interstate strife \nwill only worsen. These strains will also spawn terrorists--including \nthose embittered by their harsh circumstances and in particular those \nwho feel they have nothing to lose.\n  Decisive action, as we saw by the U.S. and others in Bosnia and \nKosovo, will, we hope, deter future conflicts and gross human rights \nviolations. But the speed with which the tragedy in East Timor \ndeveloped on the heels of NATO's victory in Kosovo tempers such \noptimism. Ultimately, a combination of resolute determination to defeat \naggression, strong support for democracies, and effective means for \nimproving the quality of life for all is the best path to ensure we \ndon't have to send our young men and women into harm's way repeatedly \nin the twenty first century.\n  This conference report goes a long way toward ensuring we will be \nready in the years to come. It invests in new weapons to the tune of \nthree billion dollars over the FY 2000 Administration's request, and \nlooks to the distant future with an increase for research and \ndevelopment of almost two billion dollars over the request. Readiness \nis increased by about 1.5 billion dollars. More importantly, this bill \nfocusses on our greatest asset--our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines--that ultimately make the defining difference between victory \nand defeat. With a significant pay raise and retirement reforms, the \nbill meets head on a continuing crisis in recruiting and retention. I \nwas particularly pleased that the Senate and conferees agreed to \nprovisions I had included in an earlier bill, S. 4, to focus pay \nincreases on specialties--such as aviators--where retention and \nrecruiting problems are particularly severe.\n  At a time when we are watching every defense dollar so closely, I am \ndisappointed that we did not do much more in this bill to rid the \nDepartment of Defense of so many wasteful expenditures. Across the \nnation, we are now obligating in excess of 3 billion dollars a year to \npay for utilities, to maintain buildings and roadways, and to operate \nequipment on bases that are unneeded by our military. We are likewise \nspending billions on weapons and research programs that the Department \nof Defense did not request but was forced to pursue by the Congress. We \nwatch the Department waste hundreds of millions of dollars due to \nmisguided acquisition policies, poor oversight of inventories, and \nservice duplication of effort. These are difficult problems to fix--due \neither to political inertia or sheer organizational complexity, but \nnonetheless we should and can do much more.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on this bill's \nattempt to reorganize the entire Department of Energy. While PRC \nespionage has severely damaging consequences for long-term U.S. \nsecurity, rushing to restructure a department with such vital \nresponsibilities is not, in my view, prudent oversight on our part. In \nshort, had the changes included here been instituted two decades ago, \nit is unclear that these changes would have had any impact on the PRC's \nability to garner intelligence on our nuclear weapons. Indeed, one \nmight even make the case that the bill will worsen this situation. I \nintend to track this matter closely in the years ahead and to support \nnecessary modications of this language as the reorganization proceeds.\n  Mr. President, on balance, this is a very good bill that does much to \nfix military readiness and other problems. I support its passage and \nurge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \noffer some comments in support of the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2000. Since Operation Desert Storm in 1991, I have \nbeen extremely concerned with the drastic decline in funding for our \nArmed Services. We have all watched as the military lost more and more \nof its highly trained warriors, as the equipment aged year after year \nwith few spare parts and no replacements, and as the infrastructure at \nour military bases fell into disrepair. Today, I am cautiously \noptimistic that we have finally, if belatedly, recognized serious \nreadiness shortfalls and are taking steps to correct them. That this \nbill represents a 4.4 percent increase over the current fiscal year's \nlevel is a step in the right direction.\n  I am most heartened by the package of personnel benefits that are \nincorporated in this bill. Several identified shortcomings in pay and \nretirement benefits have been addressed. Pay table reform brings the \nfocus of the pay raises to the middle leadership in both the officer \nand enlisted ranks. Repealing REDUX brings equity across the military \nfor retirement benefits. Securing higher annual pay raises takes the \nfirst step to closing the pay gap between military personnel and their \ncivilian counterparts. Implementing a Thrift Savings Plan for military \npersonnel will help retain our dedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines.\n  Two critical areas of our military that begin to be addressed in this \nbill are the shortage of spare parts and the lack of replacement \nequipment. In every branch of the service, examples abound of equipment \nbeing utilized far in excess of its intended service life. In many \ncases the equipment is older than the operator and costs more and more \neach year to maintain. This bill funds spare parts programs to allow \nour equipment to be fully combat ready, and funds many follow-on \nsystems that will directly benefit the war fighter.\n  This trend must continue in the years to come. Maintaining a viable \nmilitary is a commitment, not a once-a-decade afterthought.\n  While I applaud the effort to bolster some of the areas of our \nmilitary that have been under funded for the last 10 years, I am \ndisheartened that, yet again, Congress has failed to take two of the \nmost meaningful steps to free more dollars for our defense budget. The \nfirst of these is the continued and reprehensible practice of spending \nbillions of dollars on programs that the armed services did not ask for \nand, in many cases, do not need. Allocating funding from an already \ntight budget for programs added primarily for parochial reasons \ncontinues to undermine honest efforts to adequately provide for the \nnational defense.\n  I applaud the Committee chairman's effort to minimize the number of \nmember adds not reflected on service Unfunded Priority Lists. Committee \nstaff should be commended for their great efforts in carefully drafting \nlegislation and checking amendments with the Service's Unfunded \nPriority Lists and the Future Years Defense Plan--ensuring that, in \nmost cases, the Services' priorities were funded. There is no question, \nhowever, that enormous sums continue to be earmarked as much for \npolitical as for operational reasons. In fact, my concern about the \ncontinued viability of the Unfunded Priority Lists has grown in the \nface of questionable inclusions on those lists, such as executive and \ntactical airlift aircraft that clearly expand on existing inventory \nsurpluses, and programs from the Future Years Defense Plans that are \nmoved ahead more to accommodate powerful members of Congress than to \naddress pressing funding shortfalls. That there is more than $3 billion \nin questionable spending added by members for parochial reasons \nillustrates that the scale of the problem remains unacceptably high.\n  I also continue to find incomprehensible Congress's unwillingness to \npermit the military to divest itself of excess infrastructure. \nLiterally billions of dollars can be saved over the course of a FYDP if \nthe services are authorized to close unneeded installations and \nfacilities. And let there be no mistake: Congressional opposition to \nanother round of base closures is not predicated upon specious \narguments about the supposed lack of cost savings and operational \nrequirements that defy simple economics and common sense; this \nopposition grows solely out of the desire on the part of members of \nthis body to avoid the politically painful process of defending \nhometown installations.\n  As one who saw a major installation in my state closed during the \n1991 BRAC round, I can sympathize with that reluctance to undertake an \nunpleasant task. As one who also saw the rejuvenation of a community \npreviously dependent upon that military installation after it was \nturned over to\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\nlocal authorities, and as one more than a little concerned about our \ninability to fully address vital readiness and modernization problems, \nI must respectfully disagree with those who oppose another round of \nbase closures.\n  The elimination of excess infrastructure is vital to allow the \nDepartment of Defense to focus resources on necessary support \nfacilities rather than base structure from the Cold War era. Savings \nfrom previous BRAC rounds have been validated in the billions of \ndollars by every conceivable research foundation. There is just no \nexcuse for continuing to require taxpayers to pay for infrastructure we \ndo not need.\n  I am also distressed that the bill does not address a personnel issue \nI find an embarrassment and a tragedy. With over 12,000 military \nfamilies on food stamps, and the potential of more than double that \nnumber eligible for the program, I cannot reconcile the lack of \nattention to this issue in this bill. I have been open to all \nsuggestions for solutions to this problem. I have hoped for and worked \ntoward a bipartisan response that would satisfy the Administration, \nCongress, and the Department of Defense. Although the Senate approved \nmy legislation, I was greatly disappointed when this measure was \nrejected by conferees from the House of Representatives despite the \nstrong support of Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, \nand General Jim Jones, the Marine Corps Commandant.\n  I find it an outrage that enlisted families line up for free food and \nfurniture while we pour hundreds of millions of dollars into C-130J, \nautomatic grenade launcher, anti-ship decoy, hyperspectral research, \nand free electron laser programs. The insertion into the budget of \nhundreds of millions of dollars for an amphibious assault ship that the \nNavy does not want and that the Secretary of Defense specified diverts \ndollars from higher priority programs is difficult to reconcile with \nour professed concern for the welfare of military families.\n  What we have here is a situation in which certain members of the \nHouse are apparently unconcerned about having tens of thousands of \nmilitary families eligible for food stamps. Yet, they raise no \nopposition to funding a gymnasium at the Naval Post-Graduate School or \na $15 million Reserve Center in Oregon that were not in the \ndepartment's budget request. In fact, a vast majority of unrequested \nitems costing many millions of dollars were added to the bill by the \nsame body that opposed the food stamp provision. Sadly, politics, not \nmilitary necessity, remains the rule, not the exception.\n  Although my legislative proposal would have been funded for the \nDepartment of Defense at approximately $6 million annually, the \nCongressional Budget Office found that it actually would have \nrepresented a savings to taxpayers, since it would save more in the \nAgriculture Department by removing service members from the food stamp \nrolls. I am at a loss to understand or explain how such a \nstraightforward measure could be so easily rejected by the House of \nRepresentatives, particularly in a year when Congress voted to increase \nits own pay and also included a 15% annual pay raise for generals and \nadmirals.\n  I will continue to press forward to resolve this tragic problem, and \nI believe that most Americans will support my effort. I will not stand \nby and watch as our military is permitted to erode to the breaking \npoint by the President's lack of foresight and the Congress' lack of \ncompassion. These military men and women--our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and Marines--are the very same Americans that the President and \nCongress have sent into harm's way in recent years in Somalia, Bosnia, \nHaiti, Kosovo, and currently East Timor. Our service members deserve \nbetter. They deserve our continuing respect, our unwavering support, \nand a living wage.\n  On another matter, I am very pleased that the bill contains \nprovisions for the renewal of the withdrawal of the Goldwater Range.\n  The Goldwater Range is one of the most important military training \nranges in the country, supporting activities of all services. It \ncurrently comprises approximately 2.7 million acres of desert land in \nsouthwest Arizona, with climate and weather conditions that allow \nflight and other training over 360 days a year. This range is vital to \nthe continued military readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  It is also located in the heart of the Sonoran desert and contains \none of the most undisturbed desert ecosystems in North America. The \nSonoran desert ecosystem on the Goldwater Range is one of the few \nplaces in the nation that contains virtually all of the plant and \nanimal species that were present before the continent was discovered by \nEuropeans. The dozen mountain ranges and arid bajadas of the range are \nhome to the desert bighorn sheep, the critically endangered Sonoran \npronghorn antelope, and dozens of plant species found almost nowhere \nelse in the U.S.\n  The challenge is to provide for necessary national defense training \nwhile protecting this natural treasure. In 1986, the Congress passed \nthe Military Lands Withdrawal Act which formally authorized the Barry \nM. Goldwater Range. Included within the range was more than 860,000 \nacres of the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge managed by the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service and more than 1.8 million acres of lands \nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management. The withdrawals \nestablished under the 1986 Act were for 15 years and were due to expire \nunless extended in 2001.\n\n  While the approach to the withdrawal of the Goldwater Range in this \nbill is different from what we did in 1986, the provisions will ensure \nthe continued availability of this range for vital military training, \nwhile protecting and preserving the unique cultural and natural \nresources of this part of Arizona.\n  The withdrawal provisions included in the conference report are based \non the Administration's proposal. Because of the environmental \nprotections included in the Administration's proposal and additional \nprovisions added in the conference agreement, I am comfortable with the \nplan to transfer management of the natural and cultural resources \nwithin the range to the Air Force and the Navy, a decision which is \nfully supported by both the Interior Department and the President's \nCouncil on Environmental Quality. In practical effect, the Air Force \nand Marine Corps have been performing the management functions at the \nGoldwater Range for many years, and doing a superb job of it, according \nto most observers, while the efforts of the Bureau of Land Management \nand Interior Department have been widely criticized. In fact, the \nDepartment of Defense already dedicates significant resources to land \nand resource management of the Range. The decision to formally transfer \nmanagement recognizes the superior fiscal and manpower resources \navailable to the military Services, who also have the most compelling \ninterest in maintaining future training access to the range, which can \nonly be accomplished by effectively addressing environmental concerns \nregarding its use.\n  The Cabeza Prieta will no longer be included in the military lands \nwithdrawal, and it will continue to be protected and managed by the \nInterior Department and the Fish and Wildlife Service as one of our \nNation's crown jewels of wilderness areas.\n  President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the Cabeza Prieta refuge \nin 1939 in recognition of the tremendous natural resources of the area. \nCongress--with my strong support--designated about 803,000 acres of the \n860,000-acre Refuge as wilderness in the Arizona Desert Wilderness Act \nof 1990, making it the largest and one of the most pristine wilderness \nareas managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in the lower 48 \nstates. I am very proud to have been a part of the effort to protect \nthis unique wilderness area. The management of Cabeza Prieta should set \nthe highest standard for the protection of wilderness and wildlife \nvalues.\n  This bill ensures that military aviation training can continue over \nthe refuge pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding in place between \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service and the Air Force but ensures that the \nwildlife and wilderness conservation purposes of the refuge remain \nunaltered. The bill does not seek to add new purposes to the Refuge's \nmanagement mandate.\n  Under the 1990 wilderness act, the Air Force was allowed to maintain \na small number of ground instruments on the refuge within the Cabeza \nPrieta Wilderness. Man-made structures are not generally allowed within \nwilderness\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\nareas. The bill before us allows the Air Force to upgrade, replace, or \nrelocate the structures but only if doing so will have a similar or \nless impact on the wilderness and the environment than the existing \nstructures.\n  The legislation also requires the Defense and Interior Departments to \njointly develop a comprehensive integrated natural and cultural \nresources management plan for the Range, and to conduct a full \nenvironmental review, with public comment, every five years, including \nsubmission of a report to Congress. The Secretary of the Interior is \ngiven unilateral authority to take back the responsibility to manage \nthe Range lands if the Secretary determines that the military is \nfailing to adequately protect them. If at any time this authority is \nexercised, or if any of the five-year reports indicate degradation of \nthe natural and cultural resources on the range, the Congress could and \nshould take prompt action to redress those problems. I would certainly \nsupport such action.\n  The conference agreement also directs the Department of the Interior \nto work with all affected parties, including state, local, and tribal \ngovernments, to determine how best to manage and protect the natural \nand cultural resources of the four parcels of land, totaling 112,179 \nacres, that will no longer be withdrawn from public use for military \nutilization. The study will examine whether such lands can be better \nmanaged by the Federal Government or through conveyance of such lands \nto another appropriate entity. The prompt completion of this study will \ngive the Department of the Interior an opportunity to plan for the most \nappropriate management strategies for these lands, which, because of \nthe withdrawal, have not been subject to mining, livestock grazing, or \nheavy recreation use for a half-century. These lands include the \nspectacular, 83,554-acre Sand Tank Mountains area. I expect that the \nDepartment of the Interior will explore a number of management options \nfor management of the Sand Tank Mountains (and the other parcels) \nincluding transfer to Native American peoples, as well as the potential \nto protect the important natural values of the area through the \ndesignation of qualifying lands as wilderness, or through the limiting \nof livestock grazing and mining. This area is home to the highly \nendangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope and I expect that the study will \ninclude provisions for this and other threatened and endangered \nspecies. The study is to be completed within one year from the date of \nenactment of this bill.\n  Finally, the bill establishes an Intergovernmental Executive \nCommittee of federal, state, and tribal representatives for the purpose \nof exchanging information, views, and advice relating to the management \nof the natural and cultural resources of the range. I fully expect that \nthis body will conduct its meetings in public, and will provide ample \nopportunity for the public to participate in meetings and to review and \ncomment on any proposals for the administration of the area that may be \ndiscussed by the committee.\n  I am very disappointed that the conferees did not include language \nfor a comprehensive study of alternative management plans for the \nGoldwater Range. A proposal was made earlier this year to designate the \nrange as a park or preserve, managed by the National Park Service, \nwhile permitting continued military training. In addition, several \nenvironmental groups registered concerns about the Administration's \nproposal for DOD management of the range and expressed concern that the \nmilitary would be an ineffective manager of the natural resources at \nissue.\n  In response, I worked with the concerned individuals and groups to \ndevelop language directing the Department of the Interior to make \nrecommendations on management of the range, including possible \ndesignation as a park, a preserve, a wilderness area, a nature \nconservation area, or other similar protected status. Simply studying \nalternative management schemes would not interfere with military \ntraining activities for which the range is essential. Rather, a \ncomprehensive study would provide information to guide the \nAdministration and the Congress in taking appropriate action to ensure \nthat the cultural and natural resources on the range are preserved and \nprotected.\n  It is incomprehensible that anyone could object to a study, but, \nunfortunately, significant opposition was raised by outside conferees \non the House side. I will continue to pursue other avenues in this \nmatter, because I am uncomfortable with the idea of locking in the \nAdministration's proposal without ensuring that we could revisit that \ndecision if the experts determined after studying alternative \nsuggestions that some other form of management would be more \nappropriate.\n  In July, I wrote to the Secretaries of Interior and Defense, \nrequesting that they independently undertake an assessment of \nalternative management plans for the Goldwater Range. They have the \nauthority to do so, and I have urged them to begin a study immediately. \nIn addition, I proposed an amendment to the FY 2000 Interior \nAppropriations bill to require such a study, and I am working to ensure \nsuch a study is included in legislation pending before the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to authorize new park areas. Once an \nalternative management study is completed, I will ensure that any \nrecommendations for improved management of the Goldwater Range are \nconsidered and acted on, as necessary, by the Congress.\n  Despite shortfalls in the conference report before us today, I urge \nmy colleagues to support its passage. On the whole, it is a step in the \nright direction toward resuscitating an armed force suffering from the \ndiverging pattern of expanding commitments and contracting resources. \nIt includes tangible incentives for the men and women who defend our \nnation day and night, 365 days a year, at home and overseas. It paves \nthe way for better equipment and higher equipment availability rates. \nIt is imperfect, as, I suppose, a bill of this magnitude is destined to \nbe, but our armed forces deserve the good that is included in it, even \nif they must also suffer the bad.\n  Mr. President, the full list of unquested adds will be available on \nmy website.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFY 2000 Defense authorization bill. This legislation demonstrates a \nstrong commitment to America's defense and to our ability to meet \nfuture military challenges.\n  I am particularly pleased by the committee's inclusion of $176.1 \nmillion to purchase 17 UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters. A coalition of \neight companies in my state manufacture critical components for the \nBlack Hawk, which is the Army's premier tactical transport helicopter. \nFirst produced in 1977, it is used for combat assault, combat re-\nsupply, battlefield command and control, electronic warfare and medical \nevacuation. This year, the Black hawk provided critical support \nfunctions for our armed services in the Kosovo. This funding will \nensure that our military has the ability to continue its current \noperations and sustain readiness for future dangers.\n  I am also pleased by the committee's support for high school ROTC \nprograms. The additional $32 million for high school ROTC program will \nmake a particular impact in my State where many programs have been \napproved for participation in ROTC but remain unfunded. Clark High \nSchool is an example of one such program which has remained on a \nwaiting list of approved ROTC program but has been unable to \nparticipate because funding has not been available. I am hopeful that \nthis funding will be appropriated, allowing the Department of Defense \nto immediately utilize this funding so that unfunded programs, like \nClark High School, can begin operating as soon as possible.\n  Additionally, the additional benefits for all members of the military \nincluded in this bill deals with serious concerns I have had regarding \nquality of life and morale of our soldiers. The pay raise of almost \nfive percent addresses serious inequities between military pay and \ncivilian wages. In addition, the legislation creates a civilian-style \n401(k) by allowing military personnel to contribute up to 5 percent of \ntheir pre-tax to a tax-shelter investment fund. These benefits will go \na long way toward reaching our goals of recruiting and retaining highly \ntrained personnel. Most importantly, it will give our soldiers and \ntheir families the quality of life they deserve.\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n  I am also pleased by the $10 million in procurement funding for \nsecure terminal equipment for the military services and defense \nagencies. This versatile equipments is the cornerstone of our multi-\nmedia secure digital communication. The new generation of secure \nterminal equipment, produced by a defense company in my State, is more \neffective technology and generates significant operations and \nmaintenance cost savings.\n  Finally, I am extremely pleased by the committee's inclusion of a \nprovision regarding the Economic development conveyance of base closure \nproperty. When an installation is recommended for closure, it is \nimperative that the transfer of property benefit the local community. \nThis provision will accomplish this goal by allowing a more efficient \ntransfer of property to the local re-development authority for job \ncreation and economic development.\n  I again thank Chairman Warner, Ranking Member Levin and Ranking \nMember Inouye for their commitment and attention to these important \nissues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is anticipating a unanimous consent \nagreement to move forward with the VA-HUD appropriations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11201-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11201-S11229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent H.R. 2684 be \ndischarged from the Appropriations Committee and the Senate proceed to \nits consideration. I further ask that all after page 2, line 9, over to \nand including line 3 on page 95 be stricken, and the text of S. 1596 be \ninserted in lieu thereof, that the amendment be considered as original \ntext for the purpose of further amendments, that no points of order be \nwaived, and that any legislative provision added thereby be subject to \na point of order under rule XVI.\n  Again, the Senate is now on the HUD-VA appropriations bill. No call \nfor the regular order with respect to the bankruptcy bill is in order. \nIt is my hope substantial progress can be made, that the leadership can \nagree to an arrangement where all first-degree amendments be submitted \nto the desk by a reasonable time. I will discuss this further with my \ncounterpart, the Senator from Maryland.\n  I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2648) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, \n     commissions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2000, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2000 \nVA-HUD-independent agencies appropriations bill to the Senate. This \nlegislation provides a total of $90.9 billion in budget authority, \nincluding $21.3 billion in mandatory budget authority and $82.3 billion \nin outlays, while covering a variety of Federal interests from \nveterans, housing, the environment, basic research, to advances in \nspace.\n  This has been a very tough year, as I believe all our colleagues \nknow. We have waited a long time to bring this bill to the \nconsideration of the full Senate. I express my sincerest thanks to my \nchairman, Senator Stevens, the ranking member of the full committee, \nSenator Byrd, and to my colleague, the ranking member from Maryland, \nfor their hard work and commitment to ensuring that the VA-HUD \nappropriations subcommittee has enough funding to meet the minimum \nneeds of our many important programs.\n  However, with 2 weeks before the end of the fiscal year, we are on a \nforced march to complete Senate action and provide a conference \nagreement to the Senate for consideration. I believe the bill before \nthe Senate is a good bill under the constraints imposed by budgetary \nlimitations and a fair bill with funds allocated to the most pressing \nneeds we face.\n  Let me emphasize we balanced our funding decisions away from new \nprograms and focused instead on the core primary programs in our bill \non which people depend. We listened very carefully to the priorities of \nour colleagues in this body. While not everyone is happy, nor could \nthey be, we believe the bill is equitable.\n  Clearly, we were not able to provide fully what each Member \nrequested. Let me note that we received some 1,400 requests from \nMembers of this body, but we attempted to meet the priority needs. \nBefore describing what is included in this legislation for each agency, \nI wish to extend my sincerest thanks to Senator Mikulski, the ranking \nmember of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, for all her hard work \nand cooperation in putting this bill together. It is not possible, \nwithout the good working relationship that we have, to deal with such a \ncomplicated bill.\n  Let me add at the beginning, and I will repeat it again, my sincere \nthanks also to Senator Mikulski's staff, Paul Carliner, Jeannine \nSchroeder, Sean Smith, as well as my staff, Jon Kamarck, Carrie \nApostolou, Cheh Kim, and Joe Norrell. The contributions of the staff to \nthis process have been invaluable. Anybody who has watched the staff \nwork on a major bill knows how much time, effort, energy, pain and \nsuffering is endured at the staff level to bring a bill to the floor.\n  The VA-HUD fiscal year 2000 appropriations bill is crafted to meet \nour\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\nmost critical needs for veterans, housing, the environment, basic \nscientific research, and advances in space. As I noted, total spending \nin this bill is $69.6 billion in budget authority and $82.3 billion in \noutlays. This is roughly the same as the President's overall request in \nthe VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee but distributed with some \nsignificant differences.\n  Unlike the President's budget, the highest priority in the \nrecommendations before the Senate is VA medical care. In the bill \nbefore the Senate, we have increased this amount by $1.1 billion above \nthe President's request. Many Members have heard from veterans for some \ntime about their concerns about the VA budget. They have been hearing \ntheir local VA hospital may terminate critical services, increase \nwaiting times for appointments, maybe even shut down altogether. \nMembers have expressed concerns about the need for additional medical \ncare funding.\n  The Vice President recently told our Nation's veterans they wished to \nprovide more money, but so-called Priority 7 veterans were not going to \nget care any more. We asked VA to do an indepth field survey to find \nout what the President's budget as originally submitted would mean. We \nfound there would be major cutbacks in services, denial of services for \nsome veterans, closing of facilities, reductions in force totaling as \nmany as 13,000 employees and, what is most important, denial of \ncritically needed care to thousands of veterans. We are absolutely not \ngoing to let that happen. It is wrong.\n  Overall, the VA budget totals $43.75 billion, an increase of $1.1 \nbillion more than the President's request. In addition to medical care, \nfunds were added to the veterans State home and State cemetery grant \nprograms to meet the tremendous backlog in these programs and ensure \nthat we meet the needs of our aging veterans, honoring those who are \ndeceased in a dignified and respectful manner.\n  VA's full request for additional funds for the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration includes ensuring much-needed improvements to the \nprocessing and delivery of veterans' benefits. We are, as we speak, \nworking to find additional funding for veterans' medical care, and we \nexpect to be able to present an amendment very shortly on that \nparticular matter that we think will further lighten the burdens and \nstresses placed on the Veterans' Administration and ensure it can \ncontinue to provide top quality medical care to those who have put \ntheir lives on the line for the peace and security of all and for the \nfreedom of the United States.\n  Moving on to the other major elements in this bill, we have funded \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development at $27.16 billion, \nwhich is some $2.35 billion over last year's level and which should \nallow HUD to be on very solid ground. Because of the priority needs of \nour veterans, we had to make tough choices. In HUD's case, that meant \nnot funding HUD's requested 19 new programs and initiatives. Instead, \nwe focused on funding HUD's core programs such as public housing, CDBG, \nhome and drug elimination grants, homeless assistance, and section 202 \nhousing for the elderly. These are the key housing and community \ndevelopment programs that make a critical difference in people's \nlives. They are programs with a proven track record.\n\n  Also, unlike last year when we funded 50,000 new incremental \nvouchers, we do not have the funds to provide incremental section 8 \nassistance this year. Frankly, against my better judgment, because we \ndo not have funds in our allocation to meet the funding needs of our \nkey programs, I have accepted the administration's budget proposal to \ndefer $4.2 billion of section 8 budget authority for fiscal year 2000 \nexpiring contracts until fiscal year 2001. In other words, the budget \nauthority will be appropriated for the amounts to be expended on \nsection 8 certificates in fiscal year 2001 to the fiscal year 2001 \nbudget. The good news is we were able to continue funding this year. \nBut the bad news means we will have to find $8 billion more in section \n8 budget authority in fiscal year 2001 for a total of some $14 billion \nin budget authority in order to renew all expiring section 8 contracts \nin fiscal year 2001.\n  Permit me to emphasize and call to your attention several issues of \nparticular importance in this bill.\n  First, I introduced the Save My Home Act of 1999 earlier this year to \nrequire HUD to renew expiring below market section 8 contracts at a \nmarket rate for elderly and disabled projects, and in circumstances \nwhere housing is located in a low-vacancy area such as rural areas or \nhigh-cost areas.\n  We have heard from too many States around this country where tenants \nin section 8 projects have been thrown out because the landlord in a \ntight market thought higher rents could be obtained at market rate. \nWhile this is certainly an understandable move, it deprives the \ncitizens who have depended upon section 8 of the vitally needed \nservices that they must have. So, despite our request, there has not \nbeen effective action to deal with those expiring section 8, or the so-\ncalled opt-out programs where landlords leave the section 8 program.\n  This bill provides new authority for section 8 enhanced, or sticky \nvouchers, to ensure that families and housing for which owners do not \nrenew their section 8 contracts will be able to continue to live in \ntheir homes with the Federal Government picking up the additional \nrental cost of the units.\n  We think it is essential to preserve this housing, and we have \ntherefore included $100 million in new section 8 assistance to ensure \nthat there is adequate funding for renewing these section 8 contracts. \nWe believe this strong direction to HUD will ensure that the \nappropriate steps--and there are other steps that are preferable to \nsticky vouchers, but we have given them a wide range of tools to use in \nensuring those who live in opt-out housing are not deprived of housing.\n  We are disappointed about some of the reactions we have heard to this \nbudget. We believe we are doing our job and doing it responsibly. We \nhave heard objections from HUD. But we are funding HUD's program in a \nresponsible, no-nonsense way.\n  Under this appropriations bill, unlike the course that the \nadministration is on, no one will lose their housing, and in many cases \nthe funding will ensure new low-income housing and home ownership \nopportunities.\n  We are concerned more and more about HUD's capacity to administer its \nprograms. As I said, HUD has raised a red flag on many issues. We \nfunded the primary programs mostly at the President's level--and a \nnumber above that level. I also do not believe that new programs at HUD \nshould be a priority in part because of funding pressures but also \nbecause HUD does not have the capacity to administer effectively its \nprograms. And we do not wish to bring in new programs without the \nbenefit of the authorizing committee's approval on it.\n  HUD remains a high-risk agency, as designated by the General \nAccounting Office--the only agency ever designated on a department-wide \nbasis. I do not believe it needs additional responsibility until it \ncorrects its significant problems.\n  I hope every single Member understands what I am saying because \npeople have reported to me concerns they have had with HUD. We have not \nbeen able to approve HUD's request. They need to understand that it is \nonly one of eight major agencies that depend on the VA-HUD subcommittee \nallocation for their funds, and we have attempted to do our best to \nassure adequate funding for the core programs that are vitally \nimportant.\n  Moving on to other agencies, for EPA, we included a total of $7.3 \nbillion, an increase of about $100 million over the request of the \nadministration. We thought we needed to restore the President's $550 \nmillion cut to the clean water State revolving fund. The Clean Water \nProgram and the Safe Drinking Water Program are critical to assure \nsuccess in restoring and protecting our Nation's water bodies. It is a \nmatter of the environment. It is also a vital matter of public health.\n  As we see problems in this country brought about by hurricanes and \nfloods, everybody realizes that contaminated water supplies is one of \nthe greatest health problems we face. This clean water State revolving \nfund allows States day in and day out to move forward in assisting \nlocal communities to clean up their wastewater to make sure we are not \npolluting the environment and endangering the health of our citizens. \nThere is still a great deal\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nto do in this area. We have provided as much assistance as we can.\n  EPA has been revising its estimate of the nationwide need for water \ninfrastructure financing upward. It is now about $200 billion. That is \nwhy I find it a little difficult to understand why the proposal was to \ncut this program by 40 percent. We think that is the wrong choice. We \nreverse the cut.\n  The highest priorities, in my view, in EPA must include State grant \nprograms and those activities geared to addressing the biggest \nenvironmental risk we face. We had to cut out some new programs--some \ncritical programs--to protect fully EPA's core programs. In addition, \nwe added funding for grants to States to enhance their environmental \ndata system. That is a critical need and should help improve the \nintegrity of EPA's data system.\n  Moving on to the other agencies, FEMA funding totals $85 million of \nwhich $300 million is for disaster relief. While we were unable to \naccommodate the full budget request, there are additional funds we \nbelieve are high priorities added for important initiatives such as \nantiterrorism training, enhancing the fire training program, and \nemergency food and shelter grants. Despite the damage caused by \nHurricane Floyd, FEMA has adequate reserves on hand--approximately $1 \nbillion at this time--to meet their anticipated obligations in the near \nfuture. We are going to be monitoring these needs closely, of course, \nand we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure adequate funds \nare on hand to respond as needed to this and other disasters that \ninevitably occur.\n  We commend FEMA's efforts in hurricane-ravaged areas. Our hearts and \nprayers go out to the victims of these natural disasters, and our \nthanks go to the very strong response that the people of FEMA, and all \nof the related emergency agencies--both government and private sector \nagencies--have been able to provide.\n  Next, moving on to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, \nthis bill fully funds NASA at the President's request of $13.6 billion, \nincluding full funding for the international space station and the \nshuttle. I know NASA was a huge concern for many members of the \ncommittee and the Congress as a whole because the House, due to its \nshortened allocation, was forced to reduce funding by some $900 \nmillion.\n  This bill makes a major structural change to the NASA accounts by \nproviding separate funding for the international space station and the \nspace shuttle. We believe this account change is necessary because of \nNASA's continuing problems in controlling spending on the space \nstation, especially enhanced by Russia's unreliability in meeting its \nobligations as an international partner to the space station. We have, \nhowever, provided transfer authority to allow space station funds to be \nused to meet any needed safety upgrades for the shuttle.\n  The only other major change in NASA funding is we have reduced the \nfunding for space by $120 million from the President's budget request \nin part to fund new launch and space transportation technologies \ndesigned to reduce the cost of space transportation and to open up \ncommercial opportunities in our universe.\n  Many Members have been interested in this program, and these funds \nare authorized in both the House and Senate NASA authorization bills. I \nknow the occupant of the Chair has been a very strong advocate for this \nkind of research and development.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the bill includes over $3.9 \nbillion, which matches the administration's request. The NSF allocation \nis over $250 million more than last year's enacted level, about a 7-\npercent increase. The increase in funding continues our commitment and \nsupport for our Nation's basic research and education needs.\n  On a personal note, I was very pleased we were able to meet the \nPresident's request for NSF because of the tremendous amount of \nexciting and potentially beneficial work that is being funded through \nthe National Science Foundation. Truly, this is a national priority. I \nonly wish more funds were available to add because this is our \nscientific future. This is the future for our economy, for the well-\nbeing of the people of the United States, and for our continued \nprogress.\n  Some of the major highlights of this allocation include $126 million \nin additional funds for computer and information science and \nengineering activities, some $60 million for the important Plant Genome \nProgram, and $50 million for the administration's ``Biocomplexity'' \ninitiative. The bill also includes $423 million for the incorporation \nfor national and community service. This is near last year's level.\n  Let me be clear, funds totaling $80 million were rescinded from the \nprior year's appropriations for the program which are currently sitting \nin reserve. The inspector general tells us they are not needed. It is \nour understanding this rescission will have no programmatic impact, but \nit is necessary for us to meet the other priorities in our budget. We \nintend to assure the Corporation continues at the level from last year, \nand we believe this budget allocation allows us to do so.\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to yield the floor to my colleague and \ngood friend, the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Good morning, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that Ms. Jeannine Schroeder, a \ndetailee from HUD working in my office on this bill, be able to come to \nthe floor and have floor privileges, limited only to the VA-HUD \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again we come to the floor of the \nSenate to discuss the appropriations for the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill. This is a very exciting time because this appropriation is really \nthe bridge between the old century and the new century. I think our \nbill does reflect, in its funding levels, that we intend for it to be a \nbridge between the old century and the new century.\n  First of all, a word about the old century. We know that our American \nveterans, because of their bravery, their gallantry, and their self-\nsacrifice, saved America and saved Western civilization. That is why \nthis subcommittee fought so hard to save their health care--a bridge \nfrom the old century, but a bridge to the new century.\n  We also, during this century, realized that in addition to the \nravages of war, there were terrible ravages to our environment. Once \nagain, in our legislation, we make a significant commitment to the \nprotection of not only the environment of the American people but also \nof the whole world--again, a bridge from the old century to the new \ncentury.\n  It was in this century that America moved forward economically, first \nin its industrial age, and now toward the information age. But in the \ncourse of this century, we not only made a commitment to the progress \nof a few, we made a commitment to the progress of many. Through \nprograms such as housing and urban development, we have continued to \nwork to create a real opportunity structure for our American citizens.\n  What is the hallmark of the American opportunity structure? One is \nhome ownership. Through the VA mortgage program, the FHA program, and \nother key programs, we create a wider opportunity for people to be able \nto own a home in the United States of America.\n  The other hallmark of the bridge from the old century to the new \ncentury is our passion for education. It was we, in the United States \nof America, whose continual social inventions created opportunities for \npeople to pursue higher education.\n  When my great grandmother came from Poland, she certainly could read, \nbut she wanted us to be able to do more than to be able to read the \nnewspaper or read our scriptures. She wanted us to have a real \neducation. It was out of the American people inventing night school, a \ncommunity college, a GI bill of rights, that we were able to make sure \nordinary people had access to higher education. This is why we continue \nto be so enthusiastic about AmeriCorps. Right this very minute, there \nare young people working in communities all over the United States of \nAmerica, in public education, public safety, and other areas, to ensure \nthat we help our communities. But they are earning a voucher that they \ncan use to pay for their higher education. Once again, a bridge from \nthe desires of the old century to the new century.\n\n[[Page S11204]]\n\n  What, too, is the hallmark of the genius of the American people? It \nis our resourcefulness, our ingenuity, and our innovation. America is \nthe nation of science and technology. It was in our great Federal \nlaboratories that some of the greatest advances were made in the old \ncentury. We want to be sure we position them for the new century. \nTherefore, this appropriation continues to stay the course in science \nand technology, particularly in the environment, in NASA--our national \nspace agency--and also in the National Science Foundation.\n  That is really what this bill is all about. When we rise on the floor \nand talk to our colleagues about numbers and data, we sometimes sound \nlike an annual report. But when we talk about what we want the Senators \nto vote on, we have to remember what our mission is. I believe the \nmission of the VA-HUD bill is to honor the old century, make sure we \ndeal with the ravages and problems of the old century, and continue to \nposition our country and our people for the new century.\n\n  This takes me, then, to some of the specifics of the bill. I really \nthank Senator Kit Bond, the chairman of the subcommittee, and his \nstaff, for all of the collegial consultation we had during the \npreparation of this bill.\n  I say to my colleague from Missouri and to all Senators listening, \nthat we know this is not a perfect bill, but it is a very good bill. We \nhad the will but we did not have the wallet to be able to do what we \nwanted to do for the various agencies and programs. Hopefully, as we \nmove through conference and as the issues around spending caps are \nresolved, new opportunities might occur that would allow us to meet \nfunding levels that we think are appropriate. This bill is a work in \nprogress, but the bill we bring here today is one that I feel satisfied \nto bring to the Senate.\n  A special thanks to Senators Stevens and Byrd, who really foraged to \nfind another $7.2 billion in budget authority and another $5 billion in \noutlays to be able to move this bill, with bipartisan support, to the \nSenate floor today.\n  The timing of this bill is noteworthy. Right now, a significant \napproach that we have with this bill is to make sure we fund the \nFederal Emergency Management Program. From Maine to Florida, and \nparticularly with key residents in North Carolina, New Jersey, and in \nmy own State of Maryland, we worry right now about the ravages of \nHurricane Floyd. But in this bill, we continue our commitment to FEMA, \nand we include an additional $300 million for disaster relief funding. \nThis means that FEMA is ready to help those communities recover from \nthis devastating storm. Should the administration request additional \nfunding for disaster relief, we will also be ready.\n  Let's go to VA. First of all, our obligation to our veterans is this: \npromises made need to be promises kept. What does the American veterans \ncommunity want? They want to make sure that for the older veteran and \nthe Vietnam and Korean war veteran, we continue to provide them with \nquality health care. But we need to make sure that VA, as it always \nhas, continues to be a door of opportunity, particularly through the GI \nbill, for home ownership and education. I would hope that one day the \nVA benefit would be a tool for lifetime learning and the subject of a \nnew century discussion.\n\n  We have increased funding for VA by over $1 billion to a total of $18 \nbillion for veterans' health care. This was really the recommended \nlevel that came from the Government Accounting Office. We know that the \nVA medical care could always be funded additionally, but right now that \nis what we bring, and we are now looking at an amendment with proper \nother resources to fund it.\n  Also, another significant part of the VA budget is that we maintain \nthe funding for VA medical research at $316 million. The Veterans' \nAdministration continues to play a very important role in medical \nresearch for the special needs of our veterans, including areas such as \ngeriatrics, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and orthopedic research. The \nbenefits of VA medical research are not limited to veterans. The entire \nNation benefits because of VA medical research.\n  We continue to provide funding to treat something called Hepatitis C, \na growing problem among the veteran population, particularly our \nVietnam vets. We want to be sure that we help them with their problem \nand also do all we can to ensure that it is not spread in the wider \npopulation.\n  In addition, we have increased the funding for State veterans homes \nby $50 million over the President's request to $90 million. This is the \nsame as last year. Why are the State homes so important? We know that \nlong-term care is a growing issue, particularly with our World War II \nvets and our Korean vets. We believe in Federal and State partnerships.\n  No one jurisdiction of Government can carry the burden of long-term \ncare by itself; and therefore, the additional funding for State \nveterans homes enables that wonderful partnership to occur between the \nFeds and the States and the veterans themselves.\n  We also come to a discussion on HUD.\n  The whole point of the Housing and Urban Development Agency is to be \nable to help communities in terms of being able to have economic \ndevelopment and for individuals to have economic empowerment. That is \nit. It is to fund primarily self-help initiatives or to reward self-\nhelp initiatives. Therefore, what we wanted to do in HUD was to stay \nthe course for the community development block grant money, which goes \ndirectly to local communities with local decisionmaking. With this \nfunding, mayors, county executives, or commissioners can decide for \nthemselves what the best way to revitalize their communities is, and \nnot have cookie-cutter solutions coming out of Washington.\n  At the same time, we wanted to be sure the poor have a way to a new \nlife, particularly with the significant success of our Welfare-to-Work \nProgram. This is why we have a program called HOPE VI where we took \ndown the high rises, which were ZIP Codes of poverty, to really create \na new opportunity. We want to do the same thing for section 8 so we do \nnot continue to have the concentrations of poverty that we have.\n  This year, working together with the authorizers, we were able to be \nsure that everyone who has a section 8 contract--meaning a Government \nsubsidy for housing--will continue to get their subsidy. This is no \nsmall matter. We have a lot of section 8's that are expiring. We wanted \nto be sure that if you had a section 8, and you were living in a \nneighborhood, moving from welfare to work, trying to get job training, \nyou would not lose your subsidy. This was indeed a significant \naccomplishment in this bill.\n  Last year, working with the authorizers, we also added 50,000 new \nvouchers. The administration would like to add 100,000 new vouchers. I \npersonally would like very much to do that. But right now, as I said, \nwe do not have the wallet. I am working with the administration to find \nan appropriate offset not only to pay for new vouchers now, but to \ninsist that anything new has to have a sustainable revenue stream in \nthe future. This is important because we are concerned that though we \nhave started, we want to be able to continue it. That is a big yellow \nflashing light for me, and we need to be aware of that.\n\n  Another area that is very special to me is housing for the elderly. \nOnce again, working on a bipartisan basis, we have been able to \nincrease the funding for the elderly and disabled by $50 million. This \nwill be very important as we also look at new ways to help the \npopulation as they age in place.\n  I am particularly appreciative of cooperation on developing some new \nconcepts on assisted living and service coordinators to help aging \nseniors with their unique housing needs.\n  We also help increase the funding for the homeless and do other \nimportant things, which I want to discuss later.\n  With regard to NASA, I was extremely troubled by the House version of \nthe bill. I was troubled because they cut NASA by $1 billion.\n  At the same time, I was also troubled that the House seemed to focus \na lot of those cuts in my own home State. I do not take it personally, \nbut it certainly was convenient for them, knowing I am the ranking \nmember, to know that I would also mount a rescue mission for the \nprograms in my State.\n  But it is in that State that we have mounted the rescue missions on \nHubbell and in other areas. I really appreciate the collegial support \nof Senator\n\n[[Page S11205]]\n\nBond to look at where we need to put our resources for a national \npurpose. This isn't about Maryland.\n  We have the great Federal laboratories in Maryland. I do not count \nNIH as only a Maryland Federal laboratory. It is a national Federal \nlaboratory, and so is Goddard. The Goddard Space Flight Center is the \nflagship NASA center for Earth and science research. We want to make \nsure it continues to be able to do that. With the help of this \nsubcommittee, we know we will continue to have those jobs. They will \ncontinue to fix Hubbell, have the next generation space telescope, and \nprovide us with new opportunities in terms of protecting the \nenvironment.\n  I would like to also go on to National Service, which is funded at \n$423 million--a reduction from last year. I hope this funding can be \nincreased as the bill moves forward. National Service has been a \nsuccess. It has enrolled over 100,000 volunteers in a wide array of \ncommunity programs.\n  I know the management and oversight is less than what is desired. I \nthank the Senator from Missouri for his limited patience; my patience \nis also limited. But we have to remember that the mission is working, \neven though the management and oversight could certainly be improved.\n  I also want to comment on the National Science Foundation. We are so \nproud of the National Science Foundation. We really do appreciate it, \nand it is funded at $3.9 billion in the bill, which is an addition of \n$250 million.\n  What is important about the National Science Foundation is that it \nwas created to respond to be sure that America did not fall behind \nRussia in science and technology. America continues to lead the world \nin science and technology, particularly in information technology that \nhas revolutionized the world. This is truly the information age. I \nappreciate the fact that, working together, we have increased the \nfunding, particularly in those areas that will enhance research and \ndevelopment in the field of information technology.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I will talk more about this bill as we \ngo on. That is the thumbnail sketch. But I do want to just say a couple \nmore things in closing about this bill.\n  First of all, I am very appreciative that we have had the bipartisan \nsupport to continue the funding for the Chesapeake Bay Research \nProgram. This was started by my very dear predecessor Senator Mac \nMathias, and we all worked together on it. In fact, I was in the House \nwhen he started it.\n  But we had the support of four Presidents: Jimmy Carter, Ronald \nReagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. That is exactly what we need--\nbipartisan support to come up with solutions.\n\n  But the other thing I am really proud of in this bill is how we help \nour country continue to cross the digital divide. Bill Gates says we \nare at the digital divide. We will either be on one side or the other--\nwhether you are a nation, whether you are a community, or whether you \nare a citizen.\n  I want to be one of the Senators who helps America and all of its \ncitizens, particularly paying attention to rural communities and \nconstituencies that have been left out and left behind, cross that \ndigital divide.\n  In this bill we are doing it. Our funding for NASA helps us do this. \nThe funding we have for the National Science Foundation puts the money \nin the Federal checkbook to make sure that we come up with the new \nideas for the new products that will be part of continuing to cross the \ndigital divide.\n  The Senate knows that one of my greatest passions in public life is \nto enable the poor to move out of poverty and into self-sufficiency. In \nthis bill, through HUD, we fund something called the Neighborhood \nNetworks Initiative--it has already been in operation; 500 residential \ncomputing centers have been established. These Neighborhoods Networks \nbring together local businesses, community organizations, and other \npartners. Right this minute in public housing, where we want to make \nsure people move from welfare to work and children have opportunities \nfor a different way of life, we are creating little e-villages. In \nthese communities, if you work hard, through either structured school \nactivities or daytime use for adults, you can learn to use the \ncomputers. This newfound computer knowledge will help residents find \ngood jobs at living wages well into the future.\n  Again, there are many things I could say about this bill and I will \nsay them as we move along. I think we have a very good bill. We are \nworking very closely with Senator Bond, with the leadership of our two \nparties in the Senate and with our administration. Hopefully, we will \npass this bill sometime today, move to conference, and then move \nforward with the bridge from the old century to the new century.\n  Mr. President, I believe the VA/HUD bill is about four things: \nmeeting our obligations to our veterans; serving our core \nconstituencies; creating real opportunities for people, and advancing \nscience and technology.\n  The VA/HUD bill takes care of national interests and national needs. \nThis has been a tough year for the VA-HUD Subcommittee. Due to the \nbudget caps, our original 602(b) allocation was billions of dollars \nbelow what we needed. Senator Bond and I agreed that we would not move \na bill until we had a sufficient allocation. But thanks to Senators \nStevens and Byrd, we now have an additional $7.2 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority and nearly $5 billion in outlays. This \nhas allowed us to move this bill with bipartisan support to the Senate \nfloor today.\n  Mr. President, the timing of this bill is noteworthy. Just last week, \nresidents along the Eastern U.S. experienced the wrath of Hurricane \nFloyd. Everyone from Maine to Florida was affected by this storm, \nincluding my own State of Maryland. Many people, including the \nresidents of North Carolina and New Jersey, are still without power and \nflooded from their homes.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has $1 billion \nin the disaster relief fund to help state and local governments recover \nfrom this storm. The bill we present to the Senate today includes an \nadditional $300 million for the disaster relief fund. That means FEMA \nis ready to help those communities recover from this devastating storm. \nShould the administration request additional funding for disaster \nrelief, we will provide whatever is necessary to help those in need.\n  Mr. President, our first obligation is to keep the promises we have \nmade to our Nation's veterans. I am proud to say that in this bill, we \nhave kept those promises to the veterans and the VA employees. I am \nproud of the men and women who serve our veterans. From the in-patient \nhospitals to the out-patient clinics, the employees of the VA work long \nhours and sometimes under difficult conditions. We have increased \nfunding for veterans healthcare by $1.1 billion over the President's \nrequest to a total of $18.4 billion for veterans healthcare. Some have \nargued that we should spend more on veterans healthcare. I consider the \n$18.4 billion we have provided in this bill to be a funding floor, \nrather than a funding ceiling. The General Accounting Office generally \nagreed with this approach as a starting point.\n  In a recent analysis of the VA healthcare budget for our \nsubcommittee, the GAO concluded that a $1.1 billion increase over the \nPresident's request should be sufficient--assuming the VA's cost \ncutting program is successful. Nonetheless, I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues to ensure VA has more than sufficient funding for \nour veterans healthcare needs. In addition, we have maintained funding \nfor VA medical research at $316 million, the same as fiscal year 1999.\n  The VA plays a very important role in medical research for the \nspecial needs of our veterans such as geriatrics, Alzheimers, \nParkinson's, and orthopedic research. The benefits of VA medical \nresearch are not limited to veterans. The entire nation benefits from \nVA medical research--particularly as our population continues to age. \nWe also provide full funding to treat Hepatitis C, a growing problem \namong the veterans population, particularly for our Vietnam veterans.\n  We have increased funding for the State veterans homes by $50 million \nover the President's request to $90 million, the same as last year. The \nState homes serve as our long term care and\n\n[[Page S11206]]\n\nrehabilitation facilities for our veterans. They represents a uniquely \nsuccessful partnership between the Federal and State governments. By \nincreasing funding in this area, we keeping our promises to our \nveterans and meeting a compelling human need.\n  We have also made sure that we take care of our working families--by \nfunding housing programs that millions depend upon. Our bill provides \n$10.8 billion to renew all existing section 8 housing vouchers. That \nmeans those who have vouchers, will continue to receive them. \nUnfortunately, we were unable to provide additional funding to add \n100,000 new vouchers at this time. We simply could not find an \nadditional $600 million in budget authority to cover the cost of \n100,000 new vouchers. Many of my colleagues will remember that we added \n50,000 new vouchers last year. But a tight allocation simply did not \ngive us enough room to add more vouchers at this time. We maintained \nlevel funding for other critical core HUD programs.\n  Funding for housing for the elderly has been increased over last \nyear. Funding for the elderly and disabled is $904 million, a $50 \nmillion increase over last year. We have including additional funding \nfor assisted living and service coordinators within the section 202 \nprogram. This has always been a top priority of mine and Senator Bond. \nWe will always make sure that the housing needs of our elderly are met. \nWe also must recognize that the housing needs of the elderly are \nchanging--the elderly are aging in place. That's why we included \nadditional funding for assisted living and service coordinators to help \nour aging seniors with their unique housing needs.\n\n  Homeless assistance grants are funded at the Presidents's request. In \na time of prosperity, we will not forget those who are truly in need. \nIn addition, we have funded drug elimination grants and Youthbuild at \nleast year's level.\n  The Community Development Block Grant Program is funded at $4.8 \nbillion. This is an increase of $50 million from last year and $25 \nmillion over the President's request. The CDBG program has been a very \nsuccessful program targeting federal funds for economic development--\nwith local control. In addition, I have included report language that \ndirects HUD to continue its efforts to bridge the information \ntechnology gap in communities through its ``Neighborhood Networks \nInitiative.'' The Neighborhood Networks Initiative brings computers and \ninternet access to HUD assisted housing projects in low income \ncommunities. This will help us to ensure that every American has the \nability to cross what Bill Gates has called the ``digital divide.''\n  With regard to NASA funding, I was extremely troubled by the House \nversion of the bill. The House bill included devastating funding cuts \nto America's space agency. The Goddard Space Flight Center in my home \nstate of Maryland, and the Wallops Flight Facility on Virginia's \nEastern Shore both took a significant hit in the House bill. The House \nfunding levels would mean the loss of over 2,000 jobs at Goddard and \nWallops. The bill before the Senate today will save 2000 jobs at \nGoddard and Wallops.\n  NASA if fully funding in this bill, at $13.5 billion, which is the \nPresident's request. Funding for shuttle, space station, and the \ncritical science programs are funded at the President's request. This \nwill allow us to maintain this country's or science and technology \nleadership and reflects the Senate's commitment to science and \ntechnology as we enter the next millennium.\n  National Service is funded at $423 million, a slight reduction from \nlast year. I hope this funding can be increased as the bill moves \nforward. National Service has been a success, enrolling over 100,000 \nvolunteers in a wide array of community services.\n  With regard to the EPA, the subcommittee has provided $7.3 billion in \ntotal funding, an increase of $115 million over the President's \nrequest. The subcommittee has increased funding for most of EPA's major \nenvironmental programs: the bill provides $825 million for the drinking \nwater state revolving fund; and $1.3 billion for the clean water \nrevolving fund. Taking care of local communities infrastructure needs \nhas always been a priority for this committee.\n  Superfund is funded at $1.4 billion, down slightly from last year, \nbut brownfields is funded at $90 million, the same as last year. I know \nthere is some concern over EPA's salary and expense account, and I hope \nwe can address these concerns as the bill moves forward.\n  The subcommittee has also provided funding at or above the \nPresident's budget request for important FEMA programs: Emergency \nManagement and Planning, Anti-Terrorism Programs, and the Disaster \nFund. We will await any further administration request for disaster \nassistance in light of Hurricane Floyd.\n  The National Science Foundation is funded at $3.9 billion, which is \n$250 million more than fiscal year 1999. This funding level will allow \nus to make critical investments in science and technology into the next \ncentury. The funding increases for NSF is an important step for \nmaintaining our science and technology base.\n  With regard to the Selective Service, we have restored funding for \nSelective Service at the President's request. The House eliminated \nfunding for the Selective Service.\n   Mr. President, I recognize that there may be certain provisions that \nmembers may disagree with or oppose. I acknowledge the validity of \ntheir concerns, but I hope we can move the bill forward and resolve \nthese differences along the way. I believe the VA/HUD bill that we \npresent to the Senate today, keeps the promises to our veterans, helps \nour core constituencies, creates real opportunities and makes \ninvestments in science and technology. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think we have seen the legislative \nequivalent of Newton's second law: For every action, there is a \nnecessary reaction. When our colleagues in the House cut the earth \nsciences program, it was predictable that with the leadership of \nSenator Mikulski, that money would be restored. The law works, and I \ncommend Senator Mikulski for being a very effective and persuasive \nadvocate for earth science.\n  I am prepared to offer a committee leadership amendment, but the \ndistinguished chairman of the authorizing committee for housing has \nother commitments, and I now defer to him to make a statement on the \nbill, after which I expect the leaders of the committee to join us in \noffering an important committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman for granting me time to make a few \ncomments on the bill. As the relatively new chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Housing and Transportation of the Banking Committee, I \nview my relationship with the authorizing committee as a very good \nrelationship, and I know the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nhas made sure there have been staff at our hearings. I really do \nappreciate that. I have made a very special effort to make sure I have \nstaff at his hearings, not only his hearings but hearings on the House \nside. I come to my new responsibilities as chairman of the Subcommittee \non HUD to look for change. I think change needs to occur in that \nagency. I think working together in a bipartisan manner, as well as \nworking between authorization and appropriations, is the way to bring \nabout that change.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for giving me the opportunity to \nmake a statement on the VA-HUD Appropriations bill.\n  I appreciate this chance to share my thoughts as chairman of the \nauthorizing subcommittee for the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Bond in \nour joint effort to closely monitor and improve the operations of HUD.\n  This is particularly important when we are dealing with a Federal \nagency that has repeatedly been designated ``high risk'' by the General \nAccounting Office. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is \nthe only cabinet level agency that is ``high risk.'' This means that \nthe management deficiencies of the Department pose a significant risk \nto both taxpayers and the individuals served by HUD programs.\n  The GAO is not alone in its assessment of HUD. The Department's own\n\n[[Page S11207]]\n\ninspector general has repeatedly reported on management deficiencies at \nHUD. There are two positive provisions in this bill concerning the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the inspector general and I want to \ncommend the chairman for including them. The first requires the GAO to \ncertify quarterly on the cost of time attributable to the failure of \nHUD to cooperate with any GAO investigation and to reimburse GAO for \nthese costs.\n  The General Accounting Office is the investigative arm of the \nCongress, and we expect HUD and other agencies to cooperate fully in \nthe investigations that the Congress requests. The second provision is \nan increase in funding for the Office of Inspector General. The IG is \nan independent voice within HUD. The present IG is a tremendous \nwatchdog over HUD programs and a valuable resource to the Congress and \nto the taxpayers. This is clearly an agency that needs a strong and \nwell funded inspector general's office.\n  Let me comment on several other important provisions in the bill. The \nfirst terminates a portion of the Community Builders program. In my \nview, the Community Builders program is a misallocation of the \nDepartment's resources. Nearly 10 percent of the Department's personnel \nare now Community Builders. As best we can tell these positions are \nlargely public relations positions. The Community Builders are among \nthe highest paid employees at HUD, with the program consuming a \ndisproportionate share of travel and training resources.\n  At a time when HUD is considered ``high risk'' the focus should not \nbe on public relations, it should be on ensuring adequate personnel to \npolice HUD programs. As a result of our concerns with the Community \nBuilders program, the Housing Subcommittee will hold an oversight \nhearing of this program in early October. The hearing will focus on the \nupcoming inspector general's audit of the program and the views of \ncareer HUD employees on the merits of the program.\n\n  I also want to comment on the section 8 ``opt-out'' issue. This \nlegislation once again grants HUD the authority to renegotiate section \n8 contracts and where necessary adjust the contracts up to market \nrents. This is essentially the same authority given to HUD 2 years ago. \nEarlier this year, the Housing Subcommittee held a hearing on this very \nissue. We found that HUD has moved very slowly in utilizing this \nauthority. Hopefully, the language in this bill will once again make \nclear that HUD has the authority to work with section 8 owners who want \nto remain in the program and adjust the contracts to the local market \nrents.\n  Finally, I want to reiterate a point made by the Appropriations \nCommittee in the committee report regarding unauthorized programs. This \nyear HUD requested funding for a number of new programs that have never \nbeen authorized by the Congress. The GAO identified 19 new programs \nwith total funding of over $700 million. The administration continues \nto propose funding for new programs that have little or no relationship \nto affordable housing. This diverts precious resources from those most \nin need. If the administration wants new programs, it should make its \ncase before the authorizing committee, not the Appropriations \nCommittee, and I appreciate Senator Bond's recognitiion of this fact.\n  In recent years the Congress has enacted a great deal of housing \nlegislation--including both a major restructuring of public housing and \nthe section 8 program. It has been my view that the Congress should \nrefrain from passing more housing laws until we can determine whether \nthe laws that we have already passed are being properly implemented and \nwhether the Department is being properly managed.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. In closing, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record an outline of some of the \nfindings from the oversight hearings conducted by the Senate Housing \nand Transportation Subcommittee this year.\n  There being no objection, the outline was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   1999 Oversight Findings of the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and \n                             Transportation\n\n       The Subcommittee's first hearing of the year explored the \n     fact that the General Accounting Office once again determined \n     in 1999 that HUD is a ``high risk'' agency. The ``high risk'' \n     designation means that HUD's programs and management systems \n     are failing to adequately carry out the Department's mission \n     and that there is significant risk to taxpayer dollars. The \n     GAO has placed HUD on the ``high risk'' list since 1994 and \n     it is presently the only full Cabinet level agency on the \n     ``high risk'' list. The Subcommittee found that the HUD \n     Inspector General shares the GAO view that HUD is ``high \n     risk.'' The IG has issued a number of reports that are highly \n     critical of HUD management. The IG has alleged that she has \n     been the victim of continued efforts by HUD management to \n     undermine her office and authority. The GAO is currently \n     investigating allegations of efforts to undermine the IG and \n     the Subcommittee will continue to explore this topic.\n       The Subcommittee conducted a hearing to explore in detail \n     HUD's grants management system. This is one example of HUD's \n     alleged mismanagement. This computerized system (IDIS) is \n     supposed to track the expenditure of $6 billion of HUD grants \n     each year. These are grants distributed to cities and states \n     through the Community Development Block Grant program and \n     similar programs. Unfortunately, the Subcommittee heard \n     testimony from GAO and several local government officials \n     that the IDIS computer system does not work. The system uses \n     outdated and cumbersome computer technology and at this point \n     cannot be used to effectively monitor the performance of \n     communities receiving HUD grants.\n       The Federal Housing Administration is an important part of \n     HUD, and the Subcommittee finds that it is critical that the \n     Congress keep a close eye on the solvency of the FHA fund. \n     The FHA provides a federal insurance guarantee on hundreds of \n     billions of dollars worth of housing. The Subcommittee \n     conducted a hearing to review the rise in the level of \n     delinquency on FHA insured loan payments. This is of \n     particular concern at a time when the economy is so healthy, \n     and at a time when the delinquency rate on non-FHA insured \n     loans is not rising. Recently, it was announced that the \n     delinquency rate on adjustable rate mortgages is now 10 \n     percent, an historic high.\n       The Subcommittee conducted a hearing on the Low Income \n     Housing Tax Credit and how it is utilized to develop \n     affordable housing in a number of states. This program \n     appears to be successful in developing affordable housing. \n     The program is strong because it leverages tax credits to \n     involve the private sector in the development of affordable \n     housing. The program is administered by the states (which \n     allocate the credits) and has little to do with HUD.\n       The Subcommittee conducted two hearings concerning the \n     Section 8 program. The Subcommittee found that HUD has been \n     particularly slow in dealing with the Section 8 opt-out \n     crisis. Section 8 property owners are developers who have \n     entered in to 20 year contracts with HUD to provide \n     affordable housing. At the end of the contract term, these \n     owners may opt-out of the system and take their properties to \n     the private market. Many property owners are exercising this \n     option and many more contracts will come up for renewal in \n     the next several years. In an attempt to keep owners in the \n     program, Congress granted HUD the authority to mark up \n     Section 8 rents in areas where the contracts were clearly \n     below market. HUD was given this authority in the Fall of \n     1998 and is just now issuing the notice to field staff that \n     will implement the program (nearly two years after the \n     authority is granted). HUD has responded slowly to the crisis \n     and as a result many properties may be lost to the Section 8 \n     program. The Subcommittee's second hearing addressed the \n     Section 8 mark-to-market program enacted by Congress nearly \n     two years ago. The legislation enacted made clear that HUD \n     was to give state housing finance authorities priority in the \n     restructuring of Section 8 contracts in their states. While \n     some progress has been made in signing up the states, much \n     more needs to be done. HUD must resist the temptation to \n     continue federal control of the restructuring where states \n     are willing and able to do the job.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, that concludes my comments. I thank the \nchairman, again, for working with my committee. I look forward to a \nvery positive relationship with him in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. His \nactive involvement, through his committee and with his staff in helping \nus deal with these problems, has been of significant benefit. We truly \nappreciate the close working relationship we have with members on both \nsides of the authorizing committee. As I indicated before, this is a \nvery difficult set of questions that deal with HUD. They do involve and \nrequire the participation and guidance of the authorizing committee. We \nare most grateful to the Senator from Colorado for all his assistance.\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 1744\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional $600,000,000 for the Veterans Health \n  Administration for medical care and to designate such amount as an \n                         emergency requirement)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Byrd, for \n     himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Stevens, Ms. Mikulski, \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Specter, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Smith \n     of New Hampshire, and Mr. Hollings, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1744.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 7, beginning on line 23, strike ``$18,406,000,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``Provided,'' and insert \n     ``$19,006,000,000, plus reimbursements: Provided, That of the \n     funds made available under this heading, $600,000,000 is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant \n     to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985 and shall be available only to \n     the extent that an official budget request that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement (as defined in the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985) is transmitted by the \n     President to Congress: Provided further,''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to offer this amendment \nwith the leadership of the committee on both sides. Senator Mikulski \nand I are very pleased to have the support of Senator Stevens, Senator \nByrd, and also chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, to \nadd $600 million for VA medical care. In addition to the committee-\nreported bill, there will be a total of $1.7 billion above the \nPresident's request for veterans' health care; in other words, $19 \nbillion for veterans' health.\n  These funds will enable VA to ensure full care to all 3.5 million \nveterans being currently cared for by the VA. They will also allow VA \nto provide care to thousands of additional veterans, significantly \nreduce waiting times for appointments, and initiate new activities to \nimprove veterans' health. They will also enable the VA, upon enactment \nof authorizing legislation, to fund emergency care treatment in non-VA \nfacilities for veterans. We do need authorizing assistance for that.\n  According to the GAO, there are still many opportunities to make VA \nhealth care more cost effective. These include improved procurement \npractices, consolidation of certain services, eliminating excess \nmanagement layers and administration, and shifting more care to \noutpatient settings. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo at the \nVA. The GAO recently testified that the VA is wasting $1 million a day \non operations and maintenance of buildings and monuments that could \nbetter be used on health care for veterans, and 25 percent of the \nmedical care budget is spent on maintaining VA infrastructure, \nincluding 4,700 buildings on 22,000 acres.\n  The VA has been moving to community-based care, outpatient-based \ncare. That has been dictated by the needs of the veterans. We are in a \nposition where we must provide the care the veterans need. We have to \nsupport the VA in restructuring the entire system, consistent with the \nhealth care needs of veterans, rather than devoting ourselves to \nmaintaining buildings in the old regime. Monuments are not what the \nveterans need in health care; they need good health care.\n  Not only is it the trend in general medicine outpatient-based care, \nbut the veterans population is declining. The VA projects a 36-percent \ndecline by 2020. By adding funds to the VA's budget, we in no way \nsuggest that the VA has done all it can to improve its use of health \ncare dollars.\n  I have been and continue to be a very strong supporter of VA \ntransformation. When the Veterans' Administration started the process, \none of the first surgical centers they shut down was in my State. It \nwas tough to explain, but it is, I believe, clear that the veterans get \nbetter care when we have appropriate facilities--not keeping open a \nsurgical center, for example, where they do not perform enough \nsurgeries to maintain the proficiency they need to provide top-quality \ncare. The funds we are adding today are for veterans' health, not \nmaintaining buildings, not maintaining excessive management layers.\n  Over the past 5 years, the VA has made dramatic and much-needed \nchanges. We congratulate them on these difficult processes. We want to \nwork with them and continue to assure sound oversight. The system has \nbegun a major transformation that has resulted in more of VA's \nappropriations going to health care. Today, VA is serving more veterans \nand the quality of care has improved. In the past 3 years, VA has \nserved an additional one-half million veterans, in part by opening \nalmost 200 new community-based clinics.\n  It is my strong hope that the transformation will continue to go \nforward and additional funds will improve the quality of VA health \ncare. I might note that Senator Grassley has asked to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman. I note that Senator Bingaman also \nwants to be added as a cosponsor of the pending veterans amendment.\n  I am pleased to join with several of my colleagues to cosponsor this \namendment to increase funding for VA medical care by $600 million. I \nappreciate especially Senator Byrd's continued, steadfast support for \nour veterans. We could not be offering this amendment without Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens. Earlier, I talked about how pleased I was \nwith the bill--promises made, promises kept. But we wanted to do more. \nWe had the will, but we didn't have the wallet. This is exactly an \nexample of what I was talking about. We had the will to be able to \nprovide a safety net for veterans' medical health care.\n  We know that the cost of health care continues to be rising. We know \nthat the discussion on how to reform Medicare is a work in progress \nwithin this institution and our colleagues in the House. It will have a \ntremendous impact on our veterans. We also know that the need for \nprescription medication among our veterans is escalating. Those \nwonderful breakthroughs we have are expensive. We want to make sure \nthat if you have arthritis or if you are facing prostate cancer, you \nhave the medical resources that are needed. So, yes, the amount we \ncurrently have in the bill meets minimum, spartan levels.\n  This $600 million will help us tremendously. It will benefit our \nveterans to assure that there will be no need to close VA clinics \naround the country. They will be sure that no inpatient facilities will \nclose and ensure that veterans continue to get access to the quality \nhealth care they deserve.\n  First of all, I know that all over America the Veterans' \nAdministration is analyzing what they should keep open, what they \nshould close, and what should go to part time. The fact is, we can't \nhave uncertainty. Why? We want continuity of care for the vets and the \nability to retain good and excellent staff. If you don't know today \nthat your VA medical center might be gone tomorrow, those nurses, \ntechnicians, lab people, facility managers, who now have great \nopportunities in the private sector, are being attracted and recruited \nto leave. We have to show certainty in terms of being able to provide \ncare and give assurance to the personnel that we value them and we want \nto be able to fund them at the appropriate level.\n  So I really thank Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens for identifying a \nway we could assure that inpatient and outpatient needs are met. I \nsupport this amendment. I am going to support it here and in \nconference. Once again, I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make a \nsimpler amendment. It is an amendment in the number of dollars, $600 \nmillion, bringing it up to $1.7 billion, as 51 Senators agreed to \nearlier in a letter. But I have not been given a copy of the amendment \nitself. I don't know what the offset is and I don't know, therefore, \nwhether the offsets affect other\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\nprograms within this appropriations matter that would be harmful. I ask \neither the ranking member or the leader if I could have a copy of the \namendment so I could simply see what it says. The numbers we agree on, \nbut where is the offset coming from, et cetera?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I may answer my colleague, that is a good \nquestion. The committee leadership and the Budget Committee have agreed \nwe should provide this as an emergency authorization now. The \nallocation will be handled in the conference committee. So we are \nasking to include this as an emergency. There is no offset in this \nbill. There will have to be funds provided in the conference. The House \nhad already provided the $1.7 billion additional. They took it out of \nNASA. We are not going to take it out of NASA. We have the assurance of \nthe bipartisan committee leadership that we will be able to handle this \nallocation in the conference.\n  So the simple answer at this point is there is no offset.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate what the Senator from Missouri said. \nBut I would further ask, I notice in the amendment it says it is an \nemergency requirement but it requires a transmittal by the President to \nthe Congress, which would clearly say if the President doesn't--at \nleast I would interpret it--ask for that, then it might not happen. Am \nI nit-picking at words or is that a fact which is of concern?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we do not believe that the emergency \ndesignation will have to be continued past the conference. We believe \nwe can deal with the allocation questions and provide additional moneys \nso we will be able to drop the emergency designation. It is our hope we \ncan do so should it be necessary. I believe there is sufficient \nbipartisan support in both bodies to prevail upon the President should \nwe be required to obtain an emergency designation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Let me assure the Senator from West Virginia that this is sort of a \ncurrent emergency in terms of the allocation process under 302(b). We \nare working this out. The House has the $1.7 billion. We believe \nbecause of the reaction from the veterans community we ought to assure \nthat this wasn't intentional all the time to meet the House level in \nthe conference. But by the time this got to conference we believed we \nwould have the 302(b) situation straightened out so we would know where \nthe emergency decision should be made and whether there would be \nadvance appropriations.\n  This is a temporary emergency concept. We are asking the Senate to \nhelp us get this bill to conference with the emergency designation on \nthe $600 million, and we assure the Senate that this will not be an \nemergency coming out for this item unless it is absolutely necessary, \nwhich I don't see right now. But we would like it in the bill in \nconference. When we made the 302(b) allocation to this bill by, in \neffect, borrowing money from the Health and Human Services bill, we \nthought it was best to try to have some negotiating stance with the \nHouse on some items in the bill. But we never intended to negotiate \nthis item. I conveyed that to the managers of the bill this morning and \nasked that we take this issue out of contingency in the conference.\n  But this is the best way to do it. I hope the Senate will agree with \nus. It is an emergency designation that is necessary under the \ncircumstances, but it is not a permanent emergency designation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate very much and have enormous respect for \nthe chairman of the full committee. Then it is my understanding it will \ncome back after the bidding point from the conference.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I may respond, Mr. President, I have to say the \nmanagers of the bill wanted the $1.7 billion to start with. Senator \nByrd wanted $1.7 billion. As chairman I found it impossible to make \nthat allocation at the time. But we are saying right now it was always \nour intention to accommodate the decision made by the managers of the \nbill that it should be $1.7 billion. This $600 million will meet that \nobjective, and I hope the Senate will adopt it as we suggested.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. And any new request by the President of the United \nStates would not be necessary? This simply would be the workings of the \nCongress.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. If we come back to conference with an \nemergency designation, it will be subject to the President's approval. \nWe would, in effect, be making a request to the President that it be \ndeclared an emergency. I do not think this has reached the emergency \nstage. The House has it without an emergency, and I think we can \naccommodate that position.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am very appreciative and grateful to the chairman \nof the full committee, and the ranking member and minority member of \nthe subcommittee, for this.\n  I am, therefore, very happy with the permission of the Chair, to add \nmyself as a cosponsor to the amendment, as well as Senators Conrad, \nAkaka, Kerrey, Biden, Bingaman, Leahy, Boxer, Hagel, and Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments, \nif I might, on this legislation. I cannot tell you how happy I am that \nSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski, under the leadership of Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd, made this adjustment, because I came down \nhere with a 17-page speech ready to raise all kinds of trouble. Now I \ndon't have to because the appropriators have understood very clearly \nwhat was wrong with the GAO reform which was asked for. The \nappropriators at one point asked for a GAO report, and we went and \nlooked at that report very carefully. We tried to find out what we \ncould about it. We discovered the GAO report, which was recommending \nthe $600 million cut, was based upon the question that had been asked: \nWhat would happen if the veterans budget was flatlined? So it wasn't. \nWhere are there efficiencies that can be achieved? It was the \npresumption that there would be the $600 million shortfall, and, \nassuming that, how would the VA make the cuts? That is different than \nasking where might there be efficiencies? This was saying, what are you \ngoing to do, assuming you get this cut?\n  They came back with this list based upon a flatlined budget. The VA \nmanagers, in fact, were told to hit a dollar target. The simple fact is \nthat most of the cuts they suggested would reduce access to care would \nreduce everything that is useful in the veterans budget.\n  The GAO really had no basis to reach the conclusion they reached. \nThey didn't review any of the items on the list to determine what \nimpact they would have on patient care--not one single item. It is \nextraordinary. You would assume the GAO is going to do that kind of \nthing. They simply didn't. They reacted as automatons--having been \ngiven the figure they have to cut to, they would go ahead and do it. \nThe cuts would have been absolutely extraordinary.\n  We knew Members wanted to have $1.7 billion added, and 51 Senators, \nas I indicated, have already gone ahead and proposed this. The GAO with \nsort of an ax went through what they were going to close: the dialysis \nunit in Salem, VA; they were going to close all in-patient beds at the \nBeckley, WV, hospital--something those people there have been living in \nfear of for years because there have always been rumbles and rumors, \nand all of that. That was going to happen up until a few moments ago, \nuntil the two Senators made this amendment. That was going to happen. \nAll in-patient care at Beckley was going to be closed. That would be \nsomething obviously this Senator and others could not go ahead with.\n  Salem, VA, was going to lose its PTSD, along with a lot of other \nthings.\n  There were going to be a lot of abolishments.\n  All psychiatric beds in the entire New Jersey VA health care system \nwere going to be closed. That is beyond my comprehension. If we have to \nget down to a certain number, we tend to do that kind of thing. This \nhas nothing to do with a national understanding of how to save money \nwhen we need $3 billion to make the health care system. The $1.7 \nbillion is what I was going to make my amendment for; it has been made \nalready, and I am happy to join as a cosponsor.\n\n  I am very grateful this amendment was made by the two people who can \ndo the most with the full committee\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\nchairman answering questions and asserting his insistence on this. I am \nhappy about that.\n  I point out, in closing, it may surprise some to learn that over the \nlast 20 years while VA health care costs have risen 269 percent--which \nis a lot--the comparable rise for non-VA health care is almost 800 \npercent. I think that is interesting for my colleagues to think about: \na 270-percent increase in the VA health system for health care; in the \nnon-VA health care, an 800-percent increase. That says a lot about \nefficiencies being practiced within the VA system.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland, both \nstalwarts in their efforts to protect our veterans. I am happy to add \nmy name as a cosponsor, along with a number of others who are going to \njoin in my amendment which I now do not need to make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the \nveterans authorizing committee for his support for this amendment. Most \nof all, I thank him for his advocacy. He has continued to speak up on \nwhat are the contemporary needs of the Veterans' Administration, \nparticularly in health care. The Senator has been very clear in the \nneed to recruit and retain new personnel, to move to new methods of \nservice delivery, how we can be both high tech and high touch. I thank \nthe Senator for his support for this amendment and also thank the \nSenator for his advocacy. I look forward to working with the Senator \nnot only in moving the bill but moving our agenda to help veterans and \ndoing it together.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nhis strong words in support of the VA. He has been a champion of the \nveterans affairs activities and his role in the authorizing committee \nis very important.\n  I have been asked by the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, Senator Specter, to be added as a cosponsor. I also ask \nunanimous consent Senator Murkowski be added as a cosponsor. I ask \nconsent that Senator Mikulski and I be permitted to add cosponsors to \nthis amendment after it is adopted. We sense there is a strong feeling \nof interest and support for this issue.\n  Before I conclude, let me say we have worked very closely with the \nGeneral Accounting Office in this area. The GAO has been to every one \nof the VA's 22 networks over the last few years. They have been closely \ninvolved in the VA's transformation. I strongly support continued \nimprovements in the use of VA health care funds. These funds need to be \nspent on veterans' care, not on monuments.\n  I believe we are ready to accept this amendment on voice vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Very quickly, I ask to have my name included as a \ncosponsor. I say to my colleagues, I appreciate this effort. I have \ndone a lot of work with this around the country. I believe we can do \nbetter. I will have an amendment I will introduce shortly to deal with \nthat question.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a summary of the initiatives that GAO said would \nmake for efficiencies. I think that ought to be in the Record. As my \ncolleagues see these efficiencies, they are going to be rather stunned.\n  Second, the head of the health part of the VA, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, \nhas written a letter in which he says many of the proposals are \ninconsistent with law and VA policies--that is, the GAO suggestions--\nand could not be implemented. He said he was personally concerned some \nwould result in a negative impact on quality of care and level of \nservices.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have both of these printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary for Health,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1999.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: As requested by your staff, we \n     have reviewed the list of efficiencies reported by GAO in \n     their September 14, 1999 report on Veterans Health Care: \n     Fiscal Year 2000. GAO obtained the information in their \n     report from preliminary network scenarios prepared in May \n     1999. Many of these proposals are inconsistent with law and \n     VA policies; therefore, could not be implemented. Further, I \n     am personally concerned that some would result in negative \n     impact on quality of care or level of service.\n       The list does not represent VA plans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     M.

Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor this \namendment to increase the appropriation for veterans medical care by \n$600 million over the amount reported by the committee.\n  This additional $600 million will bring the appropriations for \nveterans health care in both the House and the Senate to a total of \n$1.7 billion over the amount requested by the President. This increase \nshould help stabilize veterans health care services in Iowa.\n  Iowa is in Network 14, which includes most of Nebraska, part of \nIllinois, and parts of Kansas, Missouri and Minnesota. Network 14 is \none of those which has steadilly lost funding under the Veterans \nEquitable Resource Allocation System, the funding system which, several \nyears ago, changed the way VA monies are distributed around the \ncountry.\n  In addition, as my colleagues know, the VA health care system, \nfollowing developments in the rest of the nation's health care system, \nhas been emphasizing care in outpatient settings where appropriate. In \nkeeping with this policy, the network including Iowa has developed \noutpatient clinics in several communities around the State, as well as \nhealth screening activities around the State.\n  In many respects, this shift to an outpatient focus is good policy. \nCertainly care should be given at the most medically appropriate level. \nVeterans can receive that care closer to home than might otherwise be \nthe case if sufficient community clinics can be created. It is also \nprobably the case that more veterans can be served by such an approach \nto health care services. This has certainly been the case in Iowa. \nBetween 1996 and 1998 the total number of veterans served in Iowa has \nincreased from 43,856 to 47,225, an increase of 3,369. Veterans treated \non an inpatient\n\n[[Page S11212]]\n\nbasis declined from 7,615 to 5,204 over that period, but veterans \ntreated on an outpatient basis increased from 36,241 to 42,021.\n  Unfortunately, the combination of the shift of funding away from \nStates like mine to the south and southwest, and tight Federal budgets \nfor veterans health care has resulted in a squeeze on the budget for \nNetwork 14. Although the network has been able to continue to serve the \ncategory 7 veterans, I regularly hear complaints about very long waits \nfor service, and, occasionally, about episodes of poor quality service \nwhich seem linked to too few staff.\n  I hope that this increase of $1.7 billion beyond what the President \nrequested will help ease the budget squeeze of Iowa and Network 14, and \nwill help prevent any further deterioration in access to services for \nIowa's veterans. I am aware, of course, that the VA will be providing a \n4.8 percent increase for VA employees, and this will come from the \nappropriation for VA programs. And health care costs continue to \ninflate. Nevertheless, this increased appropriation should help us in \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1744) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1747\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount appropriated for the Veterans Health \nAdministration of the Department of Veterans Affairs by $1,300,000,000)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I will send an \namendment to the desk shortly.\n  Let me speak about this amendment. It is on the same subject matter. \nMy colleague from West Virginia did a good job of outlining problems \nwith the flatline budget. What we have had the last several years is a \nbudget that has led to a decline, unfortunately, in the quality of \nhealth care for veterans. The presiding Chair has been a real leader in \nthis area. I think he is very familiar with this.\n  Part of the problem is that the budget not only does not deal with \ngaps in veterans' health care, or the need to deal with a lot of \nveterans who are homeless--I think it is a shameful statistic when, \nsome believe, maybe up to one-third of the homeless population are \nveterans--or the need not to do better for drop-in centers for veterans \nas an alternative to institutionalized care.\n  I say to my colleague from Maryland, perhaps the biggest gap is an \never-aging veteran population and the fact this carries with it very \nreal challenges in delivering care to this part of the veteran \npopulation in a humane and dignified manner.\n  What this amendment which I will send to the desk does, it is \nconsistent with the veterans independent budget. It will call for an \nincrease of an additional $1.3 billion. I say this to my colleagues: \nThis amount of resources for veterans' health care does not come out of \nthin air. This is based upon an independent budget which was produced \nby major veterans organizations--VFW, Disabled American Veterans, \nParalyzed Veterans, and the Vietnam Vets.\n\n  What this budget does is something that I think is terribly \nimportant. It corroborates the findings of a report I was able to issue \non the floor of the Senate not that long ago called ``Flatline Veterans \nHealth Care and Fiscal Year 2000 Budget.'' I sent a copy out to all of \nmy colleagues. Let me summarize the conclusion of this report.\n\n       Without a doubt, the men and women of the VA health care \n     system will continue their effort to provide quality health \n     care regardless of what future budgets hold. However, the \n     majority of the 22 VA directors report without a significant \n     infusion of new funds, the future is one of fewer staff, \n     offering fewer services and treating fewer veterans.\n\n  Let me be clear about what is at stake. I appreciate the amendment we \njust passed, but the truth of the matter is it does not meet the needs. \nI want all of my colleagues to understand I came out with this \namendment with Senator Johnson and 99 Senators voted to increase the \namount of veterans' resources, to increase the budget, by exactly this \namount of money. We have squeezed about as much money out of this as we \ncan. The VA health care system is desperately short of resources. I \nthink we absolutely have to do better.\n  This amendment means the difference between an aging World War II \nveteran driving 6 hours to a hospital for care and the same veteran \nvisiting an outpatient clinic in his own community. The amendment could \nmean the difference between a week's wait and several months for an \nappointment at a mental health clinic for veterans suffering from PTSD. \nThe amendment could be the difference between cost-effective and humane \ncare instead of responding to a crisis.\n  Again, I want to make this clear. My colleagues are on record: 99 \nSenators voted to support an extra $3 billion above the President's \nrequest for the VA. That is exactly what this amendment calls for. This \nwas an amendment to the budget resolution offered by my friend from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson. It passed the Senate 99-0 and raised the \nSenate budget to the level recommended by the independent budget. I \nthink it is now time to make good on that vote.\n  Finally, let me be clear. I think there is a powerful claim that \nveterans can make. I say to my colleague from Missouri, I will read \nfrom this study and what I have heard from the regional directors. It \nis unbelievable. They are making it clear with an additional $500 \nmillion or $600 million there are still huge gaps. If we are really \nserious about dealing with these gaps, if we are really serious about \nadequately funding VA health care--and I think the veterans have a \nmoral claim--I think this is a commitment we made to our veterans, this \namendment for the additional $1.3 billion brings us to the level that \nreally will deal with these glaring gaps. As a matter of fact, again we \nhad a 99-0 vote to increase the funding to exactly the level called for \nin this amendment.\n\n  I want to be clear. I have been critical of our President, Democratic \nPresident. I felt the flatline budget in the original budget proposal \nthat came from the White House was no way to say thanks to the \nveterans. I have tried to work with colleagues on all sides of the \naisle on this question. But in many ways I am on fire on this question. \nI really believe we have to live up to a commitment we have made.\n  Let me read from a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that I think brings this \ninto sharp focus:\n\n       Dear Colleague: We invite you to join us in honoring a \n     commitment to our Nation's veterans, a commitment that we \n     feel is being neglected in their time of need. We are \n     concerned that funding for the fiscal year 2000 Department of \n     Veterans Affairs contained in the fiscal year 2000 VA-HUD \n     appropriations bill is inadequate in addressing the health \n     care needs of our veterans' population.\n       During consideration of the budget resolution, we offered \n     an amendment that increased veterans' health care in fiscal \n     year 2000 by $2 billion above the level contained in the \n     budget resolution. The U.S. Senate accepted the Johnson-\n     Wellstone amendment by a 99-0 vote. Many of our Nation's \n     veterans' organizations endorsed our efforts to increase \n     veterans' health care.\n\n  Unfortunately, this appropriations bill only contains a $1.1 billion \nincrease. Now we have added an additional $600 million to that, which \nis a step in the right direction. Therefore, we will be offering an \namendment which would now provide for an additional $1.3 billion to \nmake the total increase for veterans' health care up by $3 billion.\n\n       The VA budget has been flatlined for the past 3 years and \n     this catchup effort is badly needed.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to marshal the evidence why I believe it is \ncritically important my colleagues support this amendment. On June 15, \n1999, I sent a letter to 22 of the veterans integrated service \nnetworks--that is what we mean when we are talking about the VISNs--\nasking them for data as to what they were dealing with, what were the \neffects of flatline funding. Each director was asked to provide \nspecific information about the impact on veterans' health care of the \nClinton administration's fiscal year 2000 proposal and possible \ncongressional appropriations levels.\n  By July 12, it was amazing. All 22 directors had provided a response \nto my office. I want to summarize some of what they had to say.\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\n  By the way, some of what they have said, some of the data, is deeply \ntroubling. They made it clear that then-Under Secretary for Health \nKenneth Kaiser's words in an internal memo earlier this year, that the \nPresident's proposed budget posed ``very serious financial \nchallenges,'' was no exaggeration.\n  We have made some improvement with this amendment that Senator Bond \nhas introduced. But let me go on with the amendment I have introduced, \nwhich my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, also wants to \ncosponsor. I ask unanimous consent he be included as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 20 of these VISNs would have funding \nshortfalls under the Clinton budget. Twenty out of 22 VISNs reported \nthat the Clinton administration's fiscal year 2000 budget would result \nin a shortfall of funds necessary to provide either current services or \ncurrent services combined with new mandates and demands.\n  As many as 10,000 employees would be cut under the Clinton budget. \nNineteen of the 22 VISNs indicated that staff reductions would be \nnecessary under this budget. Altogether, the VISNs reported that \nstaffing levels would have to be reduced by as many as 10,000 employees \nthrough a combination of attrition, furloughs, buyouts, and reductions.\n  Ten of these would reduce patient workload under the President's \nbudget; 71,000--and then I will get to my colleague's improvement to \ntalk about why I think it is an improvement but falls short of what we \nshould be doing--71,129 fewer veterans would be served under this \nbudget.\n  Let me go to the negative impact of the Clinton budget, plus the \nadditional $500 or $600 million that we have here.\n  I asked them on the $500 million, the majority of VISNs reported on \nthe budget $500 million above the President's proposal. It is $500 \nmillion above, which is not quite the level that my colleague from \nMissouri has proposed.\n  Again, here is what we hear: 12 reported they would experience \nshortfalls in providing services; 13 talked about reduced staffing; \nand, again, 38,000 fewer veterans would be served. And over and over \nand over again what I heard from these directors, which reflected the \nindependent budget report by these veterans organizations, is: \nSenators, if you want to honor your commitment to veterans, if you want \nto say thanks to us, then you have to recognize the impact, the \ndramatic negative impact of these flatline budgets.\n  I say to my colleagues on the floor, I am being scrupulously, if you \nwill, nonpartisan in my critique. The President's budget was woefully \ninadequate. But what these veterans organizations did, since we have \nbeen saying to them for years, ``Stop being so negative; tell us what \nyou need,'' is they got together in an excellent coalition effort. They \nput together this independent budget, and they talked about what we \nwould need to do to help an increasingly aging population, what we \nwould need to do to make sure we had adequate staff, what we would need \nto do to make sure that staff wasn't doubling up on hours, what we \nwould need to do to make sure there were not longer waiting lines, what \nwe would need to do to get more community-based care not only to \nelderly veterans but to veterans who are struggling with posttraumatic \nstress syndrome--what we would need to do to honor our commitment.\n  This amendment by our colleague is a step in the right direction. It \nis what the House has called for, but it is not what Disabled American \nVeterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America--let me simply read from this \nletter from PVA, and then I say to my colleague from New Hampshire, if \nhe wants to speak on this amendment, I will finish up.\n\n       Dear Senator Wellstone,\n       On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, I am \n     writing to urge you to provide a $3 billion increase for \n     veterans' health care. The $1.7 billion increase provided by \n     the House of Representatives--\n\n  Which is now what we have here--\n\n     is inadequate and would only serve to maintain the continuing \n     deterioration in health care provided to veterans. The $1.1 \n     billion increase provided in the bill provided by the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee does not even reach the level of \n     inadequacy.\n\n  In fact, the $1.7 billion increase represents a net increase of only \n$300 million. The Administration's budget proposal not only flat-lined \nveterans' health care for the fourth year in a row but called for $1.4 \nbillion in ``management efficiencies''--cuts in personnel and health \ncare. Once these cuts are averted, veterans' health care will be left \nwith a $300 million net increase. If the increase of $1.1 billion \nprovided in S. 1596 is maintained, the VA will suffer a net decrease of \n$300 million.\n\n       The Independent Budget identified the resource needs--\n\n  This is the operative language--\n\n     of the VA, as requiring a $3 billion increase. This was also \n     the same amount identified by the Senate Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs in its ``Views and Estimates'' --\n\n  That is our Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--\n\n     which stated:\n       VA requires over $3 billion in additional discretionary \n     account funding in FY 00 to support its medical care \n     operations.\n\n  Mr. President, what I am simply saying to my colleagues is that if, \nin fact, we have DAV and VFW and Paralyzed Veterans and Vietnam \nVeterans of America who do their own analysis, present this budget, say \nwe need to go up $3 billion from the President's request, and in \naddition we came out with an amendment, Senator Johnson and I and every \ncolleague--99 Senators voted for this increase--then why in the world \nare we not going to vote for an appropriation of money that will, in \nfact, deal with these gaps, that will, in fact, make a huge difference?\n  So I send my amendment to the desk, which would increase the amount \nappropriated for the Veterans Health Administration of the Department \nof Veterans Affairs by $1.3 billion. I send this amendment to the desk \non behalf of myself, Senator Johnson, and Senator Smith.\n  I see Senator Johnson and Senator Smith on the floor. But let me just \nsummarize.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would suspend, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1747.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 17, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 108. The amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``Veterans Health \n     Administration'' is hereby increased by $1,300,000,000.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I just simply say to my colleagues, we are on record \nsupporting this increase in funding. We voted for it 99-0. In addition, \nI have three pieces of evidence to support this.\n  Our own Senate Veterans' Committee said this is really what we need. \nThat is what our Senate Veterans' Committee said. I sent out, because I \ncould not get a straight story from the Veterans' Administration, a \nsurvey to all these different VISNs, and 22 directors responded. They \nsaid: This is what we need. And they talked about staff reductions and \nlonger waiting lines and what they really needed.\n  Finally, the veterans organizations themselves spent a considerable \namount of time studying the needs of veterans and came up and said: \nListen, this is the shortfall. If you really want to make a commitment \nto us, if you really want to deal with some of these deficiencies, if \nyou really want to deal with some of these gaps in health care, if you \nreally want to say thanks to us, whatever money you are going to have \nin the surplus--which will go wherever--you ought to at least honor \nyour commitment to us.\n  That is what this amendment asks my colleagues to do. I hope there \nwill be a strong vote for it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleague a question.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has not yielded the \nfloor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to take a question.\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Let me say first, while I am very grateful for the effort that our \ncolleague from West Virginia and our colleague from Missouri have \nundertaken to try to better fund the VA budget, I commend my colleague \nfrom Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, for clarifying and making it very \nclear that in fact while the budget picture is difficult--we know \nthat--at the same time, if we were to fully fund everything that really \nought to be done, it would require a $3 billion infusion, given the 3 \nyears of flatline budget that the VA health care budget is already \nsuffering through.\n  Certainly, I applaud the effort to bring the VA health care budget up \n$1.7 billion instead of $1.1 billion. I think that is a very positive \nthing. But it does concern me that when we talked about the full $3 \nbillion increase, we were talking then about the opportunity, as I \nunderstand it--if the Senator agrees with me--that that would have been \nsufficient then to fund the hepatitis C screenings, emergency care \nservices, and 54,000 new patients in 89 outpatient clinics around \nAmerica. This is the kind of agenda we would have been able to proceed \nwith if we had been able to secure the full $3 billion instead of $1.1 \nbillion--or certainly $1.7 billion.\n  So I applaud again my friend, Senator Wellstone, recognizing we \nworked together on the budget resolution earlier this year to secure \nHouse agreement with a $3 billion increase. And we have been fighting \never since to try to hold the number as high as we can get it, \nrecognizing that when it comes to veterans' health care, would the \nSenator agree with me, this ought to be the kind of budget priority \nthat comes at the head of the line rather than one that we fund with \nwhatever is left over after everything else has been concluded.\n\n  In fact, these are the individuals who put their lives on the line, \nwho disrupted their families, who did their duty, who gave their \nservice to our Nation and made it possible for our liberty to be \nprotected, for our democracy to be preserved. Yet, too often, when it \ncomes to living up to the obligations that our Government has made to \nthe health care of our veterans and their families, we cry poverty when \nin fact virtually everything else in the budget has already been taken \ncare of.\n  It would seem to me that we do have a need to continue to put \nveterans' health care concerns among our very first priorities--in \nfact, right up there with our national security funding itself. I think \nthat veterans' health care funding--if the Senator would agree with \nme--is part and parcel of our national defense strategy--at least it \nought to be regarded in that respect--because it is part of what keeps \nso many of our best and brightest young people interested in a military \nservice career at a time when we have too many people leaving the \nmilitary, where we have retention problems.\n  It would seem to me that one of the reasons we have that problem is, \nwe have too often reneged on and neglected our obligations on such \nfundamental things as veterans' health care and veterans' benefits in \nthe past.\n  So again, I appreciate the effort to try to raise the visibility of \nour obligations to our veterans and to secure the best possible funding \nwe can possibly get out of this conference report.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from South \nDakota, first of all, I appreciate his support and his work, as I do \nthe support of my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  I remind my colleague from South Dakota that when we started out \nworking on this and brought the amendment before the Budget Committee, \nwhere colleagues voted to what would now raise this $1.3 billion above \nthe amendment from my colleague from Missouri up to the $3 billion \ndifference between what the administration had and what the veterans \nindependent budget said we needed, we were doing this on the basis of \njust lots of meetings and conversations with veterans.\n  My colleague gives some very good examples. It is not a question of \npolitical strategy. I was very moved by this letter from PBA. One of \nthe things they say to me and say to us, I say to Senator Johnson, is \nthey point out that the VA requires this is the amount--this is a \nreport from the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, views and \nestimates. This is the summary of our own Veterans' Committee of what \nwe need.\n\n       VA requires over $3 billion in additional discretionary \n     account funding in FY 00 to support its medical care \n     operations: an additional $1.26 billion to meet unanticipated \n     spending requirements; an additional $853.1 million to \n     overcome the effects of inflation and ``uncontrollables'' in \n     order that it might maintain current services; and at least \n     $1 billion--\n\n  This is the way they break it down--\n\n     in additional funding to better address the needs of an aging \n     and increasingly female, veterans population.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Would the Senator agree, with this fiscal year ending \nwith the estimated $14 billion surplus over and above that required for \nSocial Security, that we ought to be able to, with the $14 billion \nsurplus, find some additional room to address the problems of veterans' \nhealth care?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from South Dakota that given the \nsurplus and given the record economic performance, I am in complete \nagreement with him.\n  I again say to all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans--who I \nthink support this and are on record supporting this additional \ninvestment--that we get in my office back in Minnesota more constituent \ncalls from veterans than any other group. All too often these are \nveterans who fall between the cracks.\n\n  I was a cosponsor of the Bond amendment. I think it is a step in the \nright direction. But we are on record saying we know we have to do a \nbetter job. We have the Senate Veterans' Committee on record in its own \nreport. We have the veterans independent budget that identifies gaps in \nall these needs.\n  In addition, I have a survey that I did with a lot of these visiting \ndirectors in which they say they will need these resources. If we are \ngoing to say on the floor of the Senate we are for the veterans, if we \nare going to say we are for improving veterans' health care, then I \nthink this is an additional improvement to the amendment we have just \npassed. This is an amendment that does the job. This is the amendment \nthat many veterans organizations are saying we ought to fight for.\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, 99 colleagues are on record. I hope we \nwill get a very strong vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I hope \nthe leadership will be able to clear an agreement that all first-degree \namendments in order to this bill be submitted to the desk by 3 p.m. \ntoday. That will help ensure swift passage of this HUD-VA bill. In \naddition, let me clarify, the call for regular order with respect to \nthe HUD-VA bill only applies to the bankruptcy bill. Therefore, Members \ncan expect a late night this evening in order to make progress on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nJeffords and Senator Hagel be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Sarbanes be added as \na cosponsor to our $600 million VA amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Missouri \nin asking all those on my side of the aisle, please cooperate with the \ncommittee, have those first-degree amendments in by 3, so we can \nexpeditiously move this bill.\n  I also ask my colleagues on my side, those who want to speak about \naspects of the bill, come forward and be prepared to speak. We have \nalready been on the bill for 2 hours and haven't had one quorum call. I \nhope, in order to move expeditiously, we don't have big, empty spaces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I should clarify that I was not asking \nunanimous consent that all amendments be in by 3 p.m. I am hoping the \nleadership\n\n[[Page S11215]]\n\nwill be able to clear an agreement establishing a time. This was an \nexpression of hope. I am sure my distinguished colleague from Maryland \nhas the same hope burning in her heart that I do in mine, but it is not \nripe to propound as a unanimous consent at this time.\n  I was not asking unanimous consent on the 3 p.m. for filing all \namendments. We hope we can get a reasonable time.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the full committee wishes to \nspeak. I need to make just a few quick points about the Wellstone \namendment.\n  We have, as everyone knows, been working for some time to determine \nhow much VA needs in its budget. We knew that the budget submitted to \nus was entirely inadequate, and we know that the VA's own Under \nSecretary issued a memorandum last February indicating his concerns \nabout it. There were no details in the President's budget. So in our \ncommittee, where we have responsibility for preparing a budget, we take \nrequests, and these requests we judge in good faith.\n  We have the responsibility of allocating the scarce dollars. We asked \nthe VA and its networks to put together plans as to how they would \noperate. That is where we learned about the closures, cutbacks in care, \nreduction of 13,000 employees. We saw that was a disaster. We asked VA \nabout the proposed management efficiencies that networks said could be \nimplemented, and should be implemented, to improve the efficiency of VA \ncare, and they said about half of them could be. So they are finding \nmoney by making savings within their budget.\n  The things that they are doing are commonsense, good practices, such \nas bulk purchasing, improving prescription patterns, centralizing \ncertain functions, closing unused buildings, and so forth. We are going \nto have to do more of that.\n  To be clear, we expect continuing reforms. We want to see good health \ncare for veterans. In many instances in the past, that has not been \naccomplished purely by throwing in more money. We need to make sure the \nmoney is effectively spent. We have provided an additional $600 million \nto make sure they have the funds adequate to ensure the health care \ndollars do deliver to the needs of veterans.\n  The amount we have agreed to, this addition of $1.7 billion, is, I \nunderstand, the highest increase ever for VA medical care. The amount \nwe have agreed to in the budget of $19 billion will allow VA to provide \nmore care and better care to our veterans. Also, I should note that the \nVeterans Affairs budget has not been flatlined. We have been adding \nabout $100 or $200 million a year, and we think that this increase, a \nvery significant one, is vitally important.\n  The proposal the Senator from Minnesota made would not take money \nfrom the surplus. It would take money from Social Security. We are \nworking within very tight budget constraints to provide an additional \n$600 million. Any dollars above that will come straight out of Social \nSecurity. The $14 billion is onbudget, non-Social Security funds and \nhas been used up in emergency spending for agriculture, the census, and \nother emergencies. There is no free money floating out there. That is \none of the constraints under which we must operate on the \nAppropriations Committee. That is why the leadership of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the Senator from Alaska, and the Budget Committee \nhas been so important to make that we could provide additional funds.\n  I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has some \ncomments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I respond to what my colleague \nsaid, if I could ask my colleague from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is time under control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is under control.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will only speak briefly. I was in an \nappropriations conference meeting when Mr. Bond so graciously called up \nthe amendment on my behalf and on his behalf and on behalf of Senator \nStevens, Senator Mikulski, and others. I express my appreciation to \nSenator Bond for doing that. I express my appreciation to Senator \nStevens for helping us in the Appropriations Committee to have \nincreased allocations for the various subcommittees. And particularly \nwith reference to the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, and the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, have performed an extremely important job and \nhave done it well, with the limited amount of funds that have been \navailable to them.\n  In the committee, we recently increased the amount for veterans' \nhealth care by $1.1 billion. We did it because Mr. Stevens and I were \nable to find ways to add monies for the VA-HUD subcommittee. On the \nfloor earlier today, the Senate agreed to the amendment offered by Mr. \nBond on my behalf and on his behalf and the others whose names I have \nalready mentioned.\n  I am sure that each of us would like to do more. I have been in \nCongress now, this is my 47th year. I have always supported the \ninterests of our veterans. I was a member of the Senate when we did not \nhave a Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The Rules Committee, on \nwhich I served, made it possible for the Senate to consider and agree \nto the proposal that there be a standing committee of the Senate \nentitled the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I was a Senator who was on \nthe Rules Committee then and who stood up for the veterans. We received \na lot of mail at that time from veterans all over the country in \nsupport of having a standing committee of the Senate designated the \nSenate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  So, I have been very supportive of the veterans and their families, \nand legislation and appropriations that affect their welfare and their \nwell-being.\n  Now, the House has approved a figure of $1.7 billion as an increase \nover the amount that was in the President's budget. The Senate \ncommittee approved an increase of $1.1 billion. That left us $600 \nmillion short of where the House of Representatives stood. I think it \nwould be very important to the veterans if the Senate were able to go \nto the House, in conference, with a figure that matched the higher \nfigure the House has already agreed upon. That is one reason why \nSenator Stevens, Senator Bond, Senator Mikulski, and I thought it was \nvery important to increase the amount by $600 million.\n  I want to thank our veterans organizations also. Many of us can only \nimagine how difficult it must be for a soldier to be awakened in the \ndepths of the night by the startling sound of shell explosions or small \narms gunfire, to be on the other side of the world from where one's \nfamily and friends make their homes, to wade through muddy water up to \none's shoulders, to carry 50 pounds of ammunition and supplies on one's \nback, not knowing if one will live to see the sunset at the end of the \nday.\n  Our veterans have gone into harm's way time and time again in order \nto preserve the freedoms that we Americans enjoy and that our friends \nand allies have also fought and died to protect. There are many \nAmericans who have dared to know the horror of war in service to this \ncountry. I am not one of those. I am not a veteran. I worked in the \nshipyards and helped build the Victory ships and Liberty ships to \nconvey men and supplies to our military forces overseas. So I did my \npart. But I did not serve in any of the military forces.\n  Unfortunately, as the veteran population begins to reach an age where \nthey need more health care, too many American veterans are facing the \nstark circumstances wherein it may appear that the Nation they \nfaithfully and honorably served is turning its back on them in time of \nneed. We do not intend to do that. We don't intend to do that on the \nVA-HUD subcommittee. We don't intend to do that on the full \nAppropriations Committee of the Senate.\n  So we think we have responded as best we could under the budgetary \nrestrictions that confront us. We have caps that are set in statute. We \nwould like to do more in many areas where appropriations are concerned, \nbut we are restricted by the budgetary caps. I have been in favor of \nlifting those caps, but they are not lifted as of now.\n  I think it is our duty to honor our debt to the veterans who, in the \nspirit of those patriots of the Revolution,\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\ndared much, risked much, and sacrificed much that we might enjoy the \nblessings of freedom.\n  I also will take a moment here to say I was very supportive of our \nveterans when I was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. I helped \nto appropriate funds and to allocate funds to the VA-HUD subcommittee \nin order that we might add clinics, add space in various veterans \nhospitals around the country. We did it in my own State of West \nVirginia, in Huntington, Beckley, Clarksburg, Martinsburg. I can \nremember when I helped to provide $76 million for a new veterans \nhospital in Martinsburg to replace the old Newton D. Baker Hospital. I \nhave been in this fight a long time. I am not a veteran, but I think I \nhave been true to my duties and responsibilities here, one of which \nduties is to see that our veterans are taken care of, treated fairly, \nand that their services are respected, appreciated, and remembered.\n\n  Therefore, I was happy today to provide the amendment that was \noffered by Mr. Bond and cosponsored by Mr. Bond, Mr. Stevens, Ms. \nMikulski, and an additional 20 or more Senators.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for yielding this \ntime.\n  I have to go back to another appropriations conference. This time, I \nwant to take up the battle for our drought-stricken areas of West \nVirginia and other States in the eastern United States, stretching from \nTennessee up to Vermont. Again, that is with respect to the drought and \nthe problems it has created for our livestock farmers. I want to go \nthere and fight their battle. For the moment, I have been delighted to \ncome to the floor. I also appreciate the support of other Senators on \nthis amendment. I express my appreciation to Senator Stevens, who is \nnot on the floor, and to Senator Bond, and Senator Mikulski for the \nexcellent leadership they continue to give in this extremely important \nbill.\n  I thank all the cosponsors to the amendment which would provide an \nadditional $600 million for veterans' medical care, including Senators \nBond, Domenici, Stevens, Mikulski, Grassley, Bingaman, Johnson, \nSpecter, Murkowski, Wellstone, Smith of New Hampshire, Hollings, \nRockefeller, Akaka, Conrad, Kerrey, Biden, Leahy, Boxer, Hagel, Murray, \nJeffords, Sarbanes, Hutchinson, Reid, Kerry, Robb, Bunning, Bryan, \nKennedy, Roberts, Ashcroft, Snowe, Collins, Coverdell, Harkin, Abraham, \nDorgan, Durbin, Thurmond, McCain, Levin, Landrieu, Frist, and others.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know my colleague from New Hampshire \nwishes to speak. I thank Senator Byrd, and I agree with what he said. I \nwant to go over the evidence that in fact we can do better and we have \nto. I support Senator Bond's effort. But in terms of all of the data we \nhave on veterans' health care, I think the amendment meets that.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be able to follow Senator Smith. I will \nonly take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I object, Mr. President. We don't have the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to say that I \nsupport the efforts of the committee in increasing by some $600 million \nthe money for the benefits to veterans that was not in the bill. I \ncommend them for their leadership in doing it. I agree with my \ncolleague from Minnesota that this is simply not enough.\n  I think my colleague is correct. I want to say to my colleague from \nMinnesota that not only do I appreciate his efforts on the floor in \nbehalf of our Nation's veterans, but I support those efforts.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this amendment because I believe we \nhave heard horror story after horror story after horror story in all of \nour offices year after year after year. It seems as if we always have \nmoney for everything. Lord knows I have been down here many times \nopposing that ``money for everything.'' Indeed, I have an amendment \nthat I will offer very shortly. My colleague from Minnesota might \ndisagree with me, but it increases money for veterans but takes it out \nof the AmeriCorps Program, which he probably will oppose me on.\n  But on this amendment, I want to say that we agree. The veterans of \nthis country need more help. They shouldn't have to beg for it. They \ndeserve it; they earned it. We have heard it time and time again--\nwhether it is the American Legion, the VFW, DAV--whomever you spoke to. \nIn meeting after meeting in my office, we hear the same thing.\n  I think my colleague from Minnesota will agree with me on this. We \ndrive to work into Washington, especially in the winter, and nothing is \nmore painful than seeing a veteran lying on a grate in this city. This \nhappens all over America. I have seen this now for 15 years. I have \nfought for 15 years to try to correct it.\n  I am just determined now that I am going to do whatever I have to do \non this floor to see that it stops.\n  There is no way this country, as great as it is and as rich as it is, \nshould tolerate that. Enough is enough. It has happened in Democratic \nadministrations. It has happened in Republican administrations. Enough \nis enough.\n\n  Whatever we have to do to help these veterans get off those grates, \nwhatever we have to do to help veterans get the health care and shelter \nand things they need, then I am prepared to do it. I am prepared to \nsacrifice somewhere else in the budget to do it--whatever it takes, \nwhatever we have to do.\n  I say to my colleague from Minnesota that I appreciate his leadership \non this. I am proud to support him on it. I will continue to support \nany efforts that he should author, or perhaps he may support some that \nI may author, in terms of helping to get this mess straightened out so \nthat we don't have to continually hear these horror stories of veterans \nbeing denied care.\n  I know the Senator from Minnesota has, as I have, gone to veterans \nhomes. You see some of the conditions they have to endure. It is \noutrageous.\n  We give them the best. We try to give them the best when they go to \nserve, wherever that may be. We ask them to go all over the world--too \nmuch in my view. Then when they come back, they deserve the best, as \nwell, in terms of care. I think with good intentions we try to do that, \nbut we have failed. We have come up short in a lot of areas. I think \nthe Senator's amendment will help to address that.\n  I think everybody on the floor supports our Nation's veterans. I \ndon't in any way insinuate that any of my colleagues who are offering \nanother amendment of a lesser amount don't support veterans. But we \nclearly have not addressed this problem. The Senator from Minnesota \npointed out that there was a 99-0 vote on exactly what the Senator is \nproposing. I see no reason why we can't step forward. It is a shame \nthat we have to have another vote. I think it ought to be in the \nlegislation. It ought to be in the bill.\n  But I am going to stand here no matter how many times it takes, as \noften as possible, and as long as possible to make these points.\n  I am more than happy to join my colleague in doing this to help our \nNation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? Are we on the Wellstone \namendment at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Could I ask a question of the manager? Is \nit the manager's intention to have a vote on this amendment? I have one \nI would like to offer. I would be happy to offer it and have it set \naside, or have this one set aside. I don't know what the intention of \nthe manager is.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are busily working to get a unanimous \nconsent order as to the timing for the vote on this issue to \naccommodate a number of our colleagues. We are working busily right \nnow. The reason I asked that I be able to regain the floor after the \nSenator from New Hampshire spoke was to be able to propound that \nunanimous consent request. I am still hoping that momentarily we will \nhave the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, while we are waiting to fine-tune the \nunanimous consent on this amendment, I\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\nwould like to comment on this amendment.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Harry Reid be a cosponsor of the $600 million VA amendment \noffered by Senators Byrd, Stevens, Bond, and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Byrd, for his assistance on this bill and his advocacy \nfor veterans. We would not have even be able to move this bill to the \nfloor had it not been for Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd identifying \nthe $600 million. We need to look at where we were 6 weeks ago.\n  Veterans' health care under the spending caps was down $1 billion. \nThanks to the advocacy and ingenuity, I might add, of the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee and the ranking member, we were able to \ncome to the floor. That is why I also said in my opening statement that \nwe had the will, but we didn't have the wallet.\n  Again, with Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens identifying a window or \na particular technique to declare $600 million in emergency, we will be \nable to ensure that nothing is closed.\n  I don't dispute the comments of the Senator from Minnesota about the \nneed for more. I also don't dispute his comments about the need for \nbetter. The Senator from Minnesota is well known for his advocacy for \nveterans. We particularly congratulate him for his steadfastness in \ncontinuing to bring to our attention the plight of veterans with \nposttraumatic stress syndrome.\n  I also remember him speaking for the nuclear vets--those who were \nexposed to nuclear radiation where that trauma was not compensated for \nor identified.\n  I thank the Senator for what he has done, but I have to say his \namendment violates the Budget Act. It breaks the spending caps. He and \nI know the Budget Act leaves much to be desired. The budget policy \nleaves much to be desired because the spending caps have prohibited us \nfrom meeting compelling human needs.\n  I know that some time this week President Clinton will be vetoing the \ntax bill. I am glad he is going to do that because then maybe we can \nget down to serious business about how we can fund Social Security, \nextend the solvency of Medicare, and meet compelling human needs.\n  I say to the Senator that I support what he wants to do in principle, \nbut I will not be able to support his amendment because it violates the \nbudget caps. But, again, the points that he has made are very well \ntaken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, just for the information of all Senators, we \nhave been working on a time for the vote on this amendment. There seems \nto be a consensus, although I am not in a position to ask unanimous \nconsent, that most of the colleagues will be back and prepared to vote \nat 2 p.m.\n  For the information of all Senators, I will propose to raise a Budget \nAct point of order at 2 p.m. I believe the Senator may wish to make a \nmotion to waive that Budget Act point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if my colleague eventually propounds \nthis, I wonder if I might have a few minutes after he speaks to waive \nit--5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if we are able to have a unanimous consent \nagreement to establish it at 2 o'clock, I will ask for 4 minutes \nequally divided prior to that time to discuss the Wellstone \namendment. I did not understand we were ready to have that unanimous \nconsent agreement. Without the unanimous consent agreement, we cannot \nassure the Senator he will have that time because raising the Budget \nAct point of order triggers the activities resulting in potentially an \nimmediate vote.\n\n  Apparently, we are not ready to propound a unanimous consent request, \nso I urge the Senator sometime before 2 o'clock to make his comments in \nsupport of waiving the Budget Act.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator will yield, isn't it safe to say we will \nhave no votes before 2 o'clock, to protect Members?\n  Mr. BOND. It is the wish of the bipartisan leadership we not have any \nvotes prior to 2 o'clock. I assure all Senators if we conclude debate \non this amendment, it might be possible for the amendment to be set \naside and others to be considered. There will be no votes before 2 \no'clock.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to go, first of all, to the \nsubstance of what has been said about veterans' health care. Then I \nwill talk to staff about how we might debate my motion to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  Let me, first of all, say my good friend from Missouri said we didn't \nhave a flatline budget. If we increase the budget $100 million, $200 \nmillion a year, compared to medical inflation, that is a flatline \nbudget. Spend time with veterans anywhere and one knows it did not \nwork. The budget ran way behind health care needs. That is to what the \namendment tries to speak.\n  Second, I ask my colleagues, deciding what we need to do by way of \nmaking sure we are providing good health care for veterans, my \ncolleague talks about what the Veterans' Administration has said to \nhim. They have to deal with OMB and the bean counters. Or are you going \nto pay some attention to this independent budget put together by many \nveterans organizations, which calls for the need for an additional $3 \nbillion above the President's proposal, which is now, my amendment, \n$1.3 billion. We are getting there because the veterans community has \norganized and the veterans community has been heard. I am glad they \nhave done so.\n  Here is a list of independent budget endorsers: National Coalition \nfor Homeless Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam War, Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Retired Officers Association, Military Order of the Purple \nHeart, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans. There are 40 \ndifferent organizations that endorse this budget.\n  It is interesting to me; we have been saying to the veterans: You \nhave to stop complaining. Tell us what the needs are.\n  They did the research. They put this budget together. They say: Here \nare the gaps; here are the needs; here is what it will take. My \ncolleagues come to the floor on a budget resolution and 99 of them vote \nfor exactly what this amendment calls for. Then I cite as evidence our \nown Senate veterans committee, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, which I \nserve. Its views and estimates are the VA will require over $3 billion \nin additional discretionary spending to meet the needs of the aging, to \nmeet the needs of an increasingly female veteran population. That is \nwhat we say we need to do.\n  We have an independent budget, our own Senate veterans committee, \nsaying this is what we need. In addition, I sent this letter to the \nVISN directors and asked what was happening--I do not get the straight \nstory--the same people my colleague from Missouri says on whom we are \nrelying.\n  I supported the amendment of the Senator from Missouri. I did not \nsecond degree. I think it is a step in the right direction.\n  However, I ask my colleagues this question: Aren't we going to live \nup to the commitment we made in a vote not that long ago?\n  Then I am told this is going to come out of Social Security. This \ncomes out of the surplus the same way your additional expenditures for \ndefense come out of the surplus, the same way your tax cuts come out of \nthe surplus. Why don't you put as high a priority on veterans as you do \non additional defense expenditures or in tax cuts? My colleague, \nSenator Smith, obviously does. I think other colleagues will, too, when \nit comes time to vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Johnson be included as \nan original cosponsor, if he is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask that Harold R. Holmes, an intern \nwith me, be given floor privileges during consideration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, on the caps and this whole question of \nbreaking the caps, maybe I should be one of the first Senators to come \nto the floor of the Senate and say why not be straightforward about \nthis. We keep doing all the emergency expenditures. I didn't vote for \nthe caps. I didn't vote for the budget agreement. I didn't vote\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nfor the budget caps. I find it a little surprising that a lot of people \nsay: Oh my gosh, the Medicare reimbursement is struggling; our rural \nhospitals are toppling; what is happening to our producers who are \nstruggling to survive? Home health care providers are struggling to \nsurvive, and our teaching hospitals and medical schools are struggling \nto survive. All of this is true.\n  Everybody knows we will eventually get beyond these caps. We are \nsaying to the veterans, there is a surplus but we use it for defense, \nwe will use it for tax cuts, we will vote for $3 billion more--which is \nnow $1.3 billion--because we increased it. But we are going to say this \nviolates the Budget Act, and we are going to use that as a reason not \nto vote for this?\n  I will try to say this in a very substantive, quiet way. I appreciate \nwhat the Senator from Maryland said, and I thank her. I haven't heard \nany Senator come to the floor and disagree with any statements I have \nmade about the gaps in veterans' health care, about the needs, and \nabout what we really need to do to live up to our commitment. I haven't \nheard anybody refute the case that I have made on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  By the way, I say to my colleague from Maryland, I will have it filed \nby 3 o'clock. We have had various atomic votes. Every time I pass this \non the floor of the Senate, it is taken out in conference committee. I \nwill be back with an amendment on this bill. I am sure I will be told \nthis is in violation of some kind of budget agreement. People who go to \nNevada, ground zero, with no protective gear, and the Government \ndoesn't tell them they are in harm's way. It is a nightmare what these \npeople have been through because of their exposure to radiation--and \ntheir children and their grandchildren. We still don't want to provide \ncompensation. Everybody says they are for it, they don't want to vote \nagainst it, and they take it out in conference committee.\n\n  I come to the floor of the Senate and I say here is our own Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs saying we will need this $3 billion, \nwhich is now the $1.3 billion. Then I talk about my own research and \nsurvey to the VISN directors. Same conclusion. Then I say to my \ncolleague from Missouri and others: Who do you want to believe? Do you \nwant to believe the Veterans' Administration and OMB or some 30 or 40 \ndifferent veterans organizations that have endorsed this independent \nbudget?\n  I say to my colleagues, you voted for this additional investment. We \nhave come a long way, I say to the veterans community. I thank the \nveterans community for standing up for themselves and speaking for \nthemselves. We have come a long way from the President's original \nbudget proposal. We have gone on a long ways from what was originally \nproposed in the House and the Senate. My colleague from Missouri does a \ngood job helping us to really make some improvement here.\n  But in all due respect, I do not see how we can say to veterans: Here \nis the evidence. We know this is what you need. We know these are the \ngaps. We know what the problems are. We made a commitment to you. We \nhave gone on record supporting this. But now, with your amendment, we \nare going to basically say it violates the Budget Act, these caps, \nphony caps of this Budget Act which everyone knows we are not going to \nlive by. Everybody knows they are going to be busted. Everybody knows \nat the very end we are going to be spending more on key domestic needs.\n  What are we going to do? Cut Head Start and child nutrition and child \ncare and all the rest by 30 percent, or 20 percent, or 25 percent? We \nare not going to do that. So why not just be honest about it? We have \nan emergency here, and we have an emergency there, and we figure out \nother ways to do it. We are spending the money.\n  Then, too many of my colleagues were all too ready to take some money \nout of the surplus for defense and tax cuts. Now all of a sudden, I \ncome out here with an amendment on veterans' health care that speaks \ndirectly to what the evidence tells us we need to do to really improve \nveterans' health care, and my colleagues are going to vote against it \nand say it is a violation of the Budget Act?\n  I will conclude this way. I think we ought to do what is right for \nveterans. I think we are on record calling for exactly the investment \nthis amendment calls for. I think there is not a shred of evidence that \nsuggests we should do anything less for veterans. And I do not think we \nshould be hiding behind the Budget Act. I do not think we should be \nhiding behind these phony caps that we all know are not going to be \noperative when we finish up this session. So if I get to be the first \nperson to come to the floor of the Senate and say that and say it \ndirectly, so be it. If the test case is on veterans' health care, so be \nit. But I am determined to fight for what I think is right and to see \nwhether we can improve upon what my colleague from Missouri has done.\n  I hope my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will vote for this \namendment. You have supported it in the past, you are on record \nsupporting it, and I hope you will support the same investment of \nresources for veterans' health care again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. I think we are all concerned about what has happened \nwith veterans. I certainly congratulate the Senator from Maryland and \nthe Senator from Missouri for their excellent effort to try, in the \ncontext of a strict budget structure, to do the most that is available \nfor us for veterans.\n  But I do think in a philosophical discussion here we need to make \nsomething clear. ``Caps'' is not some euphemism that just gets thrown \nout and has no meaning to it. It is not just a term of art. In \nsubstance, it is a statement of the difference between spending money \nthat we raise from revenues in the general fund versus spending money \nthat is raised by taxes paid to the Social Security fund.\n  If we exceed the caps--and I am not going to argue the point; I think \nthe Senator from Minnesota and a lot of other folks in this body are \nintent upon exceeding the caps, either with emergency spending in \nagriculture or with emergency spending for Kosovo or with advance \nfunding gimmickry or with, possibly, in this case, an amendment that \nsignificantly increases funding under this bill over the caps that are \navailable to it. But I think it has to be pointed out that when that \noccurs, that money comes from the Social Security trust fund. There is \nno other place for it to come from. Every dollar the caps are exceeded \nin this budget cycle--this may not be true next year--but every dollar \nthat the caps are exceeded by in this budget cycle is going to be \ndollars that come out of the Social Security trust fund because we have \nalready spent the onbudget surplus for emergency funds, emergency \nobligations. Those are already committed. So there are not really any \nonbudget surplus funds available to us.\n  So when these amendments come forward like this, I think there has to \nbe some integrity in the debate. There has to be some statement of what \nthe implications are of these types of amendments. The implication of \nthis amendment is that the Social Security trust fund and Social \nSecurity itself will be hit for the amount this amendment exceeds the \ncaps because the onbudget surplus that is non-Social Security has \nalready been spent. That is the way it is.\n  It is easy to come to the floor and say we have to get rid of the \ncaps because ``caps'' is a term of art nobody really understands. What \nthat really means, a more honest statement would be, we have to take \nmoney out of the Social Security trust fund. We have to take money out \nof the Social Security trust fund. We have to take money out of the \nSocial Security trust fund. That is the proposal. That is where we are. \nThis Congress, this Senate, is going to have to make that decision.\n  Right now, there is a lot of effort to try to avoid that, and I am \nstrongly committed to trying to avoid that event. I chaired a \nsubcommittee, and I had the same problem the chairman of this \nsubcommittee had. We were able, as was Chairman Bond, to bring in a \nbill that was under the caps, as the Presiding Officer now presiding \nover the Senate was also able to do with his bill on military \nconstruction. We brought it in at the cap level or under the cap level. \nIt was difficult, very difficult, because we had the census in our \nbill. That was new spending which we had not really any money to pay \nfor. So we have the same problem.\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\n  But the reality is that ``caps'' is not some arbitrary event here. It \nis not some term of art that has no meaning. There is significant \nmeaning to the event ``breaking the caps.'' If we are going to have \nintegrity in the debate, instead of using this term ``breaking the \ncaps,'' we ought to say what the event is. The event is using the \nSocial Security trust fund to fund whatever amendments are proposed to \nbreak the caps. That is the way it stands because there is not any \nonbudget surplus available beyond what has now already been committed \nfor emergency funds, primarily to agriculture. So we are left only with \nSocial Security surplus money.\n  So, yes, it pits this amendment against Social Security recipients. \nThat is a public policy decision this Congress is going to have to make \nthough, because on all these amendments that come forward that are not \ncap related, that are exceeding the cap, what we are basically doing is \ninvading the Social Security trust fund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I say to my colleague, in \nthe appropriations bills, it is not true we don't have any onbudget \nsurplus. The President has only signed two appropriations bills. There \nis still money in the surplus.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator knows the President has not signed all the \nbills. The Senator also knows this Senate has committed significant \ndollars to, and I suspect the Senator voted for, the agriculture \nemergency. That takes out the onbudget surplus. So I think the Senator \ncan say: Yes, the President has not signed the bills; therefore, the \nmoney has not been spent. The fact is, the Congress has spent the \nmoney. It is just that the President hasn't agreed to it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, what we have here, I think, is \na philosophical debate. But actually it is more on the lines of what \nthe other Senator from New Hampshire said. It is a matter of where \nveterans fit in. Apparently, they come in last. We have this arcane \nrule that I am supposedly in violation of with this amendment which, by \nthe way, makes it easy for my colleagues to go with tax cuts, it makes \nit easy for my colleagues to put much more into defense, and makes it \neasy for my colleagues to then come out on the floor and say there is \nno more money left for veterans.\n  Veterans should not come last. With all due respect, if Senators want \nto vote, cast a vote that says this amendment, which provides the \nresources we need for veterans' health care, is in violation of this \narcane rule. That is the fact. The reality here is, we have this arcane \nrule, all part of this agreement that we had which is not working, and \neverybody here knows it is not working, and we still went forward with \nall the money for tax cuts and we still put more into defense.\n  I say to my colleagues, again, the President has only signed two \nappropriations bills. But now what we are told is, the veterans are \nlast. All of a sudden, there is no money for the veterans. All of a \nsudden, the veterans are to be pitted against Social Security. It does \nnot mean a thing.\n  Let me tell you what the facts are. The facts are that there are a \nlot of elderly veterans. It is an aging population. And we are nowhere \nnear where we should be in terms home-based health care for them, and \nwe are nowhere near where we should be when it comes to institutional \nnursing home care for those who need to be in nursing homes.\n  The facts are, as my colleague from New Hampshire mentioned earlier, \nthat we have a scandal of maybe as many as a third of the homeless \npopulation being veterans.\n  The facts are that we have long waits in too many places. We have \nstaff working double time. We have veterans who do not have the \naccessibility to the specialty services they need. We have a VA medical \nsystem that is not working the way it should work for veterans.\n  Those are the facts.\n  Next set of facts: My colleagues are on record in this budget \nresolution calling for exactly the same expenditure I call for in this \namendment.\n  Next fact: The veterans independent budget, put together by veterans, \nnot the VA, talks about these gaps and what we need and comes up with \nthis investment that is in this amendment.\n  Next fact: Our own Senate Veterans' Committee admits that this is \nwhat we need if we are going to fill these gaps.\n  Next fact: Since I could not get a straight answer from the VA--where \nare you now, Jesse Brown, when we need you?--I sent out my own \nquestionnaire to all these different VISNs and directors, and 22 of \nthem responded; and they talked about the gaps, and the need, and what \nkind of investment it would take to get our veterans' health care \nsystem up to where it should be for veterans, if you really want to say \nthank you to veterans.\n  Those are the facts.\n  Last fact: I voted for Senator Bond's amendment. I think it is good. \nIt helps, but it still is inadequate. It is not what we should be \ndoing. We all talk about how much we care for the veterans. We all talk \nabout how we are for the veterans. Then we ought to match the rhetoric \nwith the resources.\n  I do not think my colleagues should be able to vote against this, \narguing that it is in violation of this arcane Budget rule that we \nhave. I do not think that means a thing to veterans. I do not think it \nmeans a thing to them. I think what means something to veterans is \nwhether or not they are going to have the health care they thought they \nwere promised, whether or not our Government is going to live up to its \ncommitment. That is what this amendment calls for us to do. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ntemporarily lay aside the Wellstone amendment in order to offer another \namendment on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Wellstone amendment is laid \naside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1757\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $209,500,000 for Medical Care for \n the Veterans Health Administration, an additional $5,000,000 for the \nHomeless Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) program, and an additional \n    $10,000,000 for grants for construction of State extended care \n  facilities for veterans, and to provide an offsetting reduction of \n     $224,500,000 in amounts available for the AmeriCorps program)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith of New Hampshire] \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1757.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 23, strike ``$19,006,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$19,215,500,000''.\n       On page 8, line 10, insert after the colon the following: \n     ``Provided further, That of the funds made available under \n     this heading, $5,000,000 shall be available for the Homeless \n     Providers Grant and Per Diem (GPD) program:''.\n       On page 14, line 21, strike ``$90,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$100,000,000''.\n       On page 73, line 22, strike ``$423,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$199,000,000''.\n       On page 74, beginning on line 9, strike ``Provided \n     further,'' and all that follows through ``section 121(d)(2) \n     of such Act (42 U.S.C. 12581(d)(2)):''.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment I am \nproposing will increase funding for our veterans by transferring funds \nfrom the Corporation for National and Community Service, also known as \nAmeriCorps. So what we have here, in addition to the amendment that \npassed, the increase of $600 million and the other proposed by Senator \nWellstone, is an additional sum of money beyond that to be taken from \nthe AmeriCorps program and placed in veterans programs.\n  I think, here again, it is a question of priorities. We will need to \ndecide\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\nwhether we are going to pay volunteers--a little interesting; pay \nvolunteers--or whether we are going to pay our Nation's veterans. That \nis the crux of the matter.\n  It is going to be a test of our priorities. It is going to enable \nMembers of this body, who are concerned about our veterans, to \nbasically put their money where their mouth is. That is the bottom \nline. This vote will be a test of our seriousness about whether we are \ngoing to provide our veterans with the care they need or not. It is a \nclear-cut choice.\n  There is nothing complicated about this amendment. It is AmeriCorps \nand paid volunteers versus veterans. That is it, pure and simple. It is \nbetween a big Government program that is paying volunteers--I will talk \nabout that in a minute, whether there is such a thing as a paid \nvolunteer--and our sacred responsibility to care for those who have \nsacrificed so much for our Nation.\n  My colleagues know we have debated the question of AmeriCorps funding \nbefore. They know I have always opposed this program. That is no \nsecret. I opposed it in principle when it was proposed, and my concerns \nonly grew when I saw how it worked or did not work in practice. I think \nthe time has come to face the fact that this is money that could be \nbetter spent caring for those who fought for our liberty and in many \ncases were wounded for our liberty.\n  The rhetoric of AmeriCorps supporters is certainly stirring. The \ngoals they profess are goals with which no one would disagree. But the \nrationale for using Federal taxpayer dollars --hard-earned taxpayer \ndollars--to fund this program always breaks down when we come back to \nthe fundamental oxymoron it is based on. And it is an oxymoron. Some \nsay perhaps more ``moron\" than ``oxy''--my view--but it is an oxymoron \nbecause it says ``paid volunteers.''\n  Where I grew up, if you volunteered, you did not get paid. So I do \nnot know what a ``paid volunteer'' is. But in this city of Washington, \nnow we have come up with this new definition of a paid volunteer--only \nin Washington. It is like here in Washington we also have floors below \nthe basement in the elevators, here in the Senate. Those people who \ncome and visit know what I am talking about. You can take an elevator \nto the basement, and then you can go to the subbasement if you want to, \nor G, one below the basement. It is just too complicated to have the \nbasement be the bottom floor, I guess.\n  Now we have come up with this paid volunteer, and it is being sold to \nthe American people.\n  I checked, before I came to the floor today, in my American Heritage \nCollege Dictionary. I must confess, I probably did not look at it \nenough when I was in college and do not look at it an awful lot now. \nBut I was puzzled by this term, so I looked up the term ``volunteer.'' \nThe American Heritage College Dictionary defines a ``volunteer'' as a \nperson who performs or offers to perform a service of his or her own \nfree will, or to do charitable or helpful work without pay.\n\n  This is the definition I always grew up with. It is the definition I \nalways understood. And I believe it is the definition that most \nAmericans would also say is correct.\n  But now the President of the United States is rewriting the \ndefinitions in the American Heritage College Dictionary. He is \nrewriting the rules for federalism with his executive orders. He has \nawesome powers. Now he is redefining the word ``volunteer.'' These are \nthe volunteers whom Americans see in their communities every day. For \nthe past few years, the AmeriCorps bureaucracy has sprinkled thousands \nof so-called volunteers across America's 50 States--so-called \nvolunteers.\n  But meanwhile, 90 million Americans truly volunteer in some capacity \neach year. These are the real volunteers. These are the Americans our \nspeeches should be honoring.\n  We do not need a Government program to honor volunteers because \nvolunteers do not get paid. When true volunteers offer their time and \nenergy, they expect and receive nothing but the satisfaction of serving \ntheir neighbors.\n  What can AmeriCorps' so-called volunteers expect? Here is what they \ncan expect. They can expect a salary supplemented by a grant for \neducation expenses, and they can expect health and child care benefits.\n  I might just ask anybody out there in America listening right now, if \nyou went down and volunteered, perhaps somewhere in North Carolina \nwhere the hurricane hit, and you were throwing sandbags up there, most \nlikely you did it because you wanted to help your neighbors; I do not \nthink you would be asking whether or not you got health care benefits \nor child care or a salary.\n  If you received a hot meal and a thank-you, I think you would be very \nappreciative of that and no more, and you would be glad to do it. That \nis what voluntarism is. Now we have changed the definition. We are now \npaying volunteers under this President. Work compensated by a salary \nand benefits isn't volunteer work; it is a job. Look up the word \n``job'' in the dictionary. I think you will find that is what it says.\n  There is a difference between being a volunteer and having a job. \nThey are both worthwhile, but let us not try to blend together \nsomething that is quite different.\n  In a past year's oversight hearing on this program, a very prominent \nand distinguished Member of this body claimed that the traditional \nnotion of voluntarism has changed. Now voluntarism is no longer \nvoluntarism; it is the notion of voluntarism. The implication is that \nvolunteer work, the type performed by the 90 million Americans who are \nputting sandbags up and protecting their neighbors' homes in the midst \nof a hurricane, is obsolete. That it is gone. Now the wave of the \nfuture is the AmeriCorps volunteer, the paid volunteer, the person who \ngets health care, child care. That is what this President has said, and \nthat is what this bill is sanctioning, about $225 million worth of \nsanctions, I might add, of paid volunteers.\n  I hope it is not the case, after all the Executive orders this \nPresident has signed and all the things we have seen him do in \nredefining--he redefined NATO to be an offensive rather than a \ndefensive organization; he redefined our military to be a 911 response \nteam rather than a military; he has taken Executive orders and \nredefined federalism--that we are going to allow this President to \ncontinue moving us toward a society in which volunteer service can be \noffered only by professional volunteers and only with the assistance \nand permission of a Washington bureaucracy.\n\n  My goodness, have we really come to that? Only in Washington, only in \nsome government budget or in some government bill could we possibly \never come up with anything as stupid as this. But we have done it. Boy, \nare we good at it.\n  I hope we are not going to send our children a message that anyone \nwho volunteers should expect a salary and benefits in exchange for \nserving his or her community. Is that what we are saying?\n  Honestly, that is what we are saying. I have to wonder if we are \nserious when we say the era of big government is over. I have heard our \nVice President say that. Maybe he should take over Jay Leno's slot \nbecause that is about the funniest thing I have ever heard, to say that \nthe era of big government is over and then talk about having $225 \nmillion placed in a bill to pay volunteers. The era of big government \nis over? Somebody needs to explain that to me.\n  If we allow this program to become a permanent fixture of the Federal \nGovernment, we are going to send a message that the era of big \ngovernment is just getting started, not over. For when we allow \ngovernment to intrude on the voluntary sector, we guarantee the further \nerosion of civil society, the area of community life that falls outside \nthe purview of government. Frankly, we insult the millions, the 90 \nmillion or so Americans who do volunteer in charity after charity after \ncharity--cancer, Humane Society, helping friends in times of \nearthquakes and floods; they volunteer and do it willingly, and they \ndon't get paid. There is no such thing as a paid volunteer. Very \nbluntly and very frankly, I don't care if you are a Republican or a \nDemocrat or Independent or what you are, male or female. You should not \nsanction it by funding paid volunteers. It is wrong. We ought to \neliminate it, and we ought to take this money out. We ought to\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\ntake it out, period. But I am not even asking Members to do that. I am \nasking them to take it out of there and give it to our Nation's \nveterans.\n  I know opponents of my amendment are going to claim they simply want \nto use big government to help the volunteer sector. We are going to \nhelp the volunteer sector. How many times do we have to go down this \nroad? We let the Federal Government set up a program to help in an area \nof American life that has survived without government help, but we are \ngoing to put up a program now to help volunteers and pay them. The \ngovernment program always starts small and always gets bigger.\n  Remember the Department of Education. That started in the mid-1970s \nat about $3 billion. It is getting up there close to $60 billion now--\nnot bad in 20 or 25 years. Soon the government funding is supplemented \nwith government mandates, and then we find that something that used to \nbe a function of civil society is now a function of big government in \neverything but name. When we try to slow its growth, we are told that \nthe loss of government funds will be fatal. You will destroy the arts. \nYou will destroy the humanities. You will destroy the charities that \nserve the poor. These are areas that once functioned without government \naid. Now we have set up government monies to help them. If we take it \naway, we are accused of not wanting to help the humanities or the arts \nor help with charities.\n  Now the people who work in these areas will tell us government is \nindispensable. We have to keep it here. We have to have it. We can't \nhave volunteers now unless we have them paid.\n\n  The question is--and this is all my amendment is about--Do we want to \nhave the volunteer sector dependent on Big Brother or not? I say we \nshould not. Even in the short lifetime of the Corporation for National \nand Community Service, otherwise known as AmeriCorps, we have seen the \ninfluence of big government corroding the ethic of service that \nanimates our voluntary sector. We have seen massive administrative \ncosts. We have seen large numbers of AmeriCorps' so-called volunteers \ndeployed in Federal agencies to staff big government, and in some \ncases, to lobby for its continued expansion. That is right, paid \nvolunteers to lobby us for the continued expansion of what they are \ndoing. We have seen the promise that private sector sources would match \nFederal funds fall by the wayside.\n  Let me make one thing clear: Good work has been done under the \nauspices of this program. I don't doubt it. If you pay somebody, you \nhopefully can get work out of them, and maybe something beneficial will \ncome of it. A lot of this has been done in my own State of New \nHampshire. I have met with some people of AmeriCorps. I salute their \ndesire to offer service to their communities. No one is disputing that.\n  But I am concerned that by cultivating direct links between voluntary \nservice organizations and big government, we risk sending some of our \nmost selfless young people the message that public employment is the \nonly avenue available for serving their communities. That is not true. \nThe American people know it is not true, but that is what we are doing.\n  We risk sending true volunteers a message that their efforts are no \nlonger necessary. That is not going to be the case with people who have \nvolunteered all their lives, but look at young people today. Do you \nwant to go down and help Ms. Brown mow her lawn and not get paid? Do \nyou want to go collect money for the charity of your choice, perhaps \nthe Cancer Society, and not get paid? Or do you want to go work for the \nFederal Government as a paid volunteer and get paid and get benefits? \nWhat message are we sending to our young people? We have just redefined \nthe word ``volunteer.''\n  We just redefined the whole word ``voluntarism.'' This amendment I am \nsuggesting is far more than $225 million. It is far more than providing \nmoney from AmeriCorps to veterans. Both of those are admirable, in my \nview, but it is more important than that. We are sending a cultural, \nmoral message to the young people in our country by supporting this \namendment, and that is: You volunteer; you don't get paid. You \nvolunteer because you want to. That is the message I want to send.\n  Now, you cannot compare AmeriCorps and the veterans. There is no \ncomparison. On the one hand, we have the health and well-being of brave \nmen and women whose sacrifices have ensured our continued freedom. And \nyou talk about volunteers. Many, if not most, of the people who have \nmade those sacrifices did so as volunteers. They volunteered for their \ncountry to serve in time of war. Some were drafted, but many would have \ngone whether drafted or not.\n  When we called upon these Americans to serve their country, we took \non certain obligations. This is a sacred obligation, one that we can't \nshirk and should not shirk. On the other hand, with AmeriCorps we take \non another new obligation.\n  As I have made clear, the task of manning the voluntary sector will \nbe performed whether or not we appropriate Federal taxpayer funds for \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service. On the other hand, \nthe job of addressing the pressing medical needs of America's heroic \nveterans is one that only we in the Federal Government can do.\n  Now, Senator Bob Smith does not stand down here at any time and \npromote additional Government funds where it is not constitutional to \ndo so. I don't support unconstitutional spending, and I have cited \nexample after example on the floor of this Senate over a number of \nyears. It is constitutional, it is right, it is just, and it is our \nobligation to support our Nation's veterans with whatever it is they \nneed. This amendment says those needs are more important than paid \nvolunteers.\n\n  This amendment will add funding to critical resources in the VA \nbudget. The funding would go toward three areas: long-term care, \nmedical care, and combating homelessness. I propose increasing funding \nfor State veterans nursing homes out of this $225 million to allow our \nveterans to age with dignity and with the care they deserve. We know \nhow desperately the VA health care system needs additional funding just \nto stay afloat. I also propose increasing funding to the Homeless \nProviders Program and Per Diem Program. This would help to build \nprograms that would get veterans off the grates, if they are homeless, \nand help get them back on their feet.\n  Even the amounts I am proposing to be transferred here only scratch \nthe surface of what we need. But we have to start somewhere, and this \nis where we need to draw the line.\n  So let me summarize and conclude by saying this: It is a simple \namendment; $225 million is in the bill for AmeriCorps, paid volunteers, \nyoung people who are good young people. We are telling them we are \ngoing to pay you and call you a ``volunteer'' to do X, Y, or Z. We can \ndo that or we can send another message, which is that homeless veterans \non grates and inadequate care facilities is wrong, and we are going to \nfund those entities. Maybe it would even be a more powerful message if \nwe would ask those AmeriCorps volunteers--paid volunteers--to suspend \nthe payments and say: No, thank you, Mr. President, I am not interested \nin your benefits or your salary. Just tell me where the nearest \nveterans home is or the nearest VA hospital, and I will go there and \ngive my time to those veterans who did so much.\n  Isn't that a better message to send to America? What is wrong with \nthis country? What is happening to this country? That is what I want to \nknow. Day after day, we fund this stuff, and half of the time we don't \ntalk about it. It just slips in there and goes by--with good \nintentions, not always bad, but it is wrong. We are sending the wrong \nmessage to our people.\n  I taught school. Once you are a schoolteacher, you are always a \nschoolteacher. You are never a former teacher. We are sending the wrong \nmessage to our kids. We have sent wrong messages for the last several \nyears.\n  Starting in February, we said right here on the floor that the \nPresident of the United States can commit crimes and not have to be \nheld accountable for them. We said that. That is what we told our young \npeople. We have told our young people that it is OK to do whatever you \nwant. Do your thing. Shoot your friends and colleagues in school, and \nthen blame somebody else. Blame innocent gun owners who have done \nnothing except exercise their constitutional right to own a firearm. \nBut\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\nblame somebody else; don't blame ourselves. We abort our young children \nevery day, and we say: Johnny, go off to school, and, Mary, go off to \nschool, be a good little girl and boy, and we will abort your brother \nor sister while you are going to school being a good kid. That is the \nmessage we are sending. We do it every day.\n  So, you see, that is what is wrong with America. It is the greatest \ncountry in the world, but we need to change it. The structure is there. \nWe just need to change a few people and a few places, get reality back, \nand bring this country back to what it should be and what it can be and \nwhat it must be, what our Founders wanted.\n\n  Do you think for one minute that Thomas Jefferson, if he could stand \nhere today or James Madison or George Washington or Sam Adams or \nPatrick Henry--do you think for one minute they would stand up here and \ndefend paid volunteers? These are the people who picked up the weapons, \nput on the militia uniform, and went to Concord Bridge in Lexington and \nfought the British, sometimes never getting paid, not knowing whether \nthey were going to be paid, nor caring whether they would get paid. \nThese are the people who brought us our liberty. We disgrace what they \ndid for us by standing on the Senate floor and even proposing to pay \nsomebody to be a volunteer.\n  It is the wrong message, folks. It is the wrong message. I hope \nsomebody out there might be listening. It doesn't happen often around \nhere that we listen to each other's speeches, but I hope somebody \nlistens because we need to change the culture of this country, the \nattitude. All we can do on the Senate floor is single out things which \nare wrong and point them out--not to attack anybody. I am not attacking \nthe motives of anybody. But I am saying it is wrong. Let's accept that \nit is wrong and change it so that we don't tell America's young people \nthat paid volunteers are more important than our Nation's veterans, \nmore important than the people who sacrifice for their country, more \nimportant than those who are, today, barely able to move or speak --\nsome not able to move or speak--in veterans homes across America, who \nare being neglected. By the way, they are taken care of by nonpaid \nvolunteers, in many cases, who come and visit.\n  This is what is wrong with America. This is why America will perish, \nif we don't stop. I don't want to see that happen. I want my kids or \ngrandkids someday to say: I read old grandpa's speeches when he had the \ntime to serve on the Senate floor. He stood up and said paid volunteers \nwere wrong, and I am glad he did because we changed it. We don't have \npaid volunteers anymore and we don't have veterans lying helpless on \ngrates freezing to death. We don't have veterans who are no longer able \nto get the help they need and the care and the shelter they need. We \ndon't have that anymore because old grandpa stood up on the Senate \nfloor and said it was wrong, and we changed it. That is what I would \nlike.\n  ``Do you want to leave a legacy?'' People ask you that all the time. \nIf they write that about me, I will be happy. Nothing else. That is \nall. This is Daniel Webster's desk right here, one of the greatest \nSenators of all time. This desk belongs to the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, and I am not going to give it up.\n  I think all the time about the fact that he stood here and that we \nare just temporary stewards. We are just here for a blip on the radar \nscreen of history, trying to do our job. As great as Webster was, he is \noff the stage, as the founders are and as are so many great orators and \nSenators who have spoken in this great body. But you try to make a \ndifference. You try to make a difference. You have to speak up and try \nto make a difference.\n  I urge my colleagues, ask yourself, are volunteers whom you are \npaying more important than veterans who gave their limbs, and their \nlives in some cases, not to mention the suffering of the families--more \nimportant than those veterans? I don't think so. I am asking you to \nvote to take $225 million from paid volunteers and give it to our \nNation's veterans. There is the offset. It is not adding any more money \nanywhere. It is not costing the taxpayers another dime. That is all I \nam asking you to do.\n  Let me conclude on a couple of points about veterans because I think \nwe need to personalize this a little bit so we understand it.\n  I mentioned earlier in the debate with Senator Wellstone that driving \nto work in the morning, especially in the winter, and seeing those \nveterans on the grates--they are not all veterans. There are about \n750,000 homeless people, they tell me, in America. But they say a third \nof them are probably veterans. What happened? How did that happen? Why \nare they there? It is pretty disgraceful, really, when you stop and \nthink about it, because somewhere at some point they reached out and \nasked for help, and they didn't get it or they wouldn't be homeless.\n  I can't help but think of something that Johnny Cash immortalized so \nvery well with ``The Ballad of Ira Hayes,'' the Indian, one of the \npeople who raised the flag at Iwo Jima Hill. He was an Indian who was \ndiscriminated against when he came back but hung out around the \nreservation and became an alcoholic and died in a ditch. He was one of \nthe ones who held that flag up at Iwo Jima Hill. Why did that happen? \nBecause something slipped through the cracks.\n  There are thousands of Ira Hayeses out there in America right now, \nlying on those grates, looking for hope. This is one of the most \naffluent cities in the world. You can't go around the block without \nrunning into some function where they serve caviar, shrimp, steak, or \nsomething, day in and day out. And yet, homeless veterans have no place \nto live, nothing to eat, and are lying on grates, freezing to death. \nLet's take $220 million, help them, take it away from paid volunteers, \nand send the right message to America.\n  Homeless veterans start showing up 10 years after they are \ndischarged. Ten years after they have served this country, many times \nin combat, they start showing up. That is why, within the past 10 \nyears, the veterans homeless problem has increased. They don't give the \nveterans a fair share of the money that is designated for the homeless \nbecause somehow when they move out of the service and back into \nsociety, they slip through the net. Who knows what it is? Posttraumatic \nstress? I don't know. But they are slipping through the net.\n  This is not meant as a criticism of anybody or any agency or anybody \nelse. But let's tighten the net. Let's rethread the net. We can do a \nlot of rethreading of the net with that $220 million.\n  In my State, a veteran from northern New Hampshire who needs an MRI \nhas to take at least two van trips to have this simple test done. That \nis why we need to change that. The median age of homeless veterans is \n45. It is not a way to treat our heroes.\n  This is just one small way to try to make a difference, one moral \nlesson to send to the people of America, and to the children of \nAmerica, that we are not going to fund paid volunteers until we fund \nour Nation's veterans. Then if you want to talk about paid volunteers, \nfine. But at least be honest; let's just call them paid workers instead \nof paid volunteers.\n  That is all I am asking for with this amendment. That is all I am \nasking.\n  Mr. President, at this point for the sake of the Record, I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I will withhold. I see the manager on the \nfloor. I am prepared to yield the floor or go to a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to have a \nvote on the Smith amendment immediately following the Wellstone \namendment. There are a number of people who want to speak. The Senator \nfrom Ohio wants to speak. I know the Senator from Maryland is coming \nback to speak. But that means we only have about 35 minutes to get \ndiscussion on all of these. Since there is no time agreement, we depend \nupon the good graces of our colleagues to wrap all of the discussions \nup prior to 2 o'clock. I will then move to table the Smith amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I again ask for the yeas \nand nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S11223]]\n\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to table the Smith amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio who has been \nwaiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator withdrawing his motion to \ntable?\n  Mr. BOND. I withdraw that motion. I see the Senator from Ohio is on \nthe floor. I will address the amendments afterwards.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I again renew my request \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BOND. I move to table the amendment, and ask for the yeas and \nnays and ask that the vote be withheld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the vote be withheld to follow \nthe vote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment to the \nVeterans' Affairs-HUD appropriations bill that was submitted by the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  This morning, I had the privilege of presiding over the Senate to \nhear the presentation of the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nMaryland in what they tried to do to put together a very fair VA-HUD \nappropriations bill.\n  One of the things that was emphasized was the fact that after \nreviewing the needs of this country, particularly the health care needs \nof our veterans, they inserted in the appropriations bill another $1.1 \nbillion for health care for our veterans. Subsequent to that, Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens came to the floor with an amendment to provide \nanother $600 million for emergencies.\n  The reason I rise to oppose the request of the Senator from Minnesota \nfor another $1.3 billion is the fact that we are reaching the end of \nthe appropriations cycle. We are getting down to the nitty-gritty. The \nfact is, when anyone comes to this floor and asks for additional money \nover and above what the appropriators have appropriated, they should \nstand and point out where the money is going to come from to fund \nwhatever it is they are asking for.\n  First of all, in this particular case, I think the committee did its \nvery best to deal forthrightly with the needs of our veterans' health.\n  It seems to me from a logic point of view, the person who proposed \nthis amendment should have laid out clearly where the money, the $1.3 \nbillion, was coming from, what programs would be cut in order to come \nup with the money or, in the alternative, to explain which taxes will \nhave to be raised to pay for the funding of the program. Last but not \nleast, explain that it is not coming from Social Security.\n  I have noticed around here so many of the spending programs \nultimately would be paid for out of Social Security. I believe anyone \nwho looks at what the Appropriations Committee did in terms of this \nissue would think they did the very best they could under the \ncircumstances. No one advocates taking money out of Social Security to \npay for another $1.3 billion for health care for our veterans.\n  I think we have reached the point where we have to come clean on the \nfact that we will have a difficult time dealing with this budget. If we \nare not going to dip into Social Security, if we are not going to raise \ntaxes, if we are not going to be fiscally irresponsible, we need to \nexplain how we will be paying for these additional programs.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota for the additional $1.3 billion because the money to pay for \nthat is just not there. If we don't find the money, it means we will \nend up using our Social Security pension funds.\n  I remind Members we have a $5.7 trillion debt. Part of that is \nbecause over the years we continued to use our Social Security funds to \npay for things for which we weren't willing to pay. Today in this \ncountry out of every $1 we are spending, 14 cents is being paid for \ninterest. In fact, we are spending more money in this country on \ninterest than we pay for Medicare. It is time to be fiscally \nresponsible. It is time for truth in budgeting. We have a wonderful \nopportunity in this session of Congress to forthrightly deal for the \nfirst time in anyone's memory with the financial responsibility of the \nfiscal things we need to do in this country to enter the new \nmillennium, in what I refer as an ``intellectually honest'' way in \nterms of our budget.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Ohio for cogent and knowledgeable \ncomments. We appreciate his assistance. I thank the Senator for his \nstatements.\n  Let me make a couple of brief points about the two amendments before \nthe Senate. This year, 51 Senators wrote me in support of a $1.7 \nbillion increase in the veterans' medical care budget. The budget \nresolution which passed this body assumed a $1.7 billion increase for \nVA medical care. We have worked hard to meet the needs that we believe \nare responsibly identified for veterans' medical care. We would love to \nhave more money but we are at the end of our available stream of funds.\n  We have increased funding for homeless assistance for the veterans by \n$40 million. That is why I cannot support either of these amendments.\n  With respect to Senator Smith's amendment, I have had significant \nconcerns about the operations of AmeriCorps. I have worked closely with \nthe inspector general to clear up some of the agency's management \nproblems. There was a problem with $31 million that was lost. We are \nvery much concerned about it. The battle over whether we ought to have \nan AmeriCorps program or not is over. It has been decided. It is \nauthorized. It is funded. It is in place in communities in my State and \nacross the Nation. There are people who are providing valuable \nservices. There is strong support.\n  We have attempted to continue AmeriCorps at the existing level. We \ndid rescind $80 million because the inspector general identified that \nmoney as not needed. However, we have to develop a bill that will be \nsigned by the President. The President has already threatened to veto \nany bill that cuts AmeriCorps. It is that simple. If you want the \nadditional funding we provided for veterans, the additional $1.7 \nbillion above the President's request, then we have to have the bill \nsigned. It is a rather simple matter. If this bill is vetoed over \nAmeriCorps, then we can't get the money for veterans. To ensure that \nthe operations of AmeriCorps are properly addressed, we boosted the \ninspector general's budget from $3 million to $5 million to oversee the \nwork of AmeriCorps. The concept has already been approved. It is in \nplace. It is ongoing.\n\n  For the information of all Senators, we expect to have a vote at 2 \no'clock on a motion to waive the budget point of order, followed by a \ntabling motion on the Smith amendment. We are hoping everybody who has \nfirst-degree amendments will get them in by 4 o'clock. We have not \npropounded a unanimous consent request. People are busily working on \namendments. I do not want to discourage Members from doing that. We \nwant to see an end to the process.\n  I have had a number of colloquies provided to me. I appreciate that \npeople get them in. Colloquies sometimes explain the difficult and \ncomplex parts of a bill. If a Member has a colloquy which they want \nincluded, I ask Members to get those colloquies in by 5 o'clock this \nafternoon. We do have to review them. Sometimes we need clearance from \nthe authorizing committee. If we are hit with a rush of colloquies at \nthe last moment, we may simply not be able to deal with them and get \nthem read and approved. In order to get colloquies in, I hope Members \nwill bring them to the ranking member or me prior to 5 o'clock to \nreview them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ted \nKennedy be added as a cosponsor to the Byrd-Bond-Stevens-Mikulski VA \namendment for $600 million additional funds for VA medical care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11224]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is a sad state of affairs. This \nlast amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire is \nparticularly troubling. We all agreed that we need to fund veterans' \nmedical care. We all agreed that we needed to fund more. We all agreed \nwhen we worked in the full committee, in the Appropriations Committee, \nwe wanted to do more. We had the will but we didn't have the wallet.\n  Working on a bipartisan basis, the chairman and ranking members of \nthe Appropriations Committee found a way to add $600 million more to VA \nmedical care. It is absolutely a good idea. We intend to support it.\n  Also, the chairman and ranking member, along with Senator Bond and \nmyself, know that declaring it an emergency is a temporary technique \nbecause we are in a situation where we are operating under such tough \nspending caps.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has offered an amendment that violates the \nBudget Act because it busts the caps. We will oppose that.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, a well-known advocate for veterans, a \nstaunch supporter for the return of the MIAs, now offers an amendment. \nHowever, he takes it out of the Corporation for National Service, \notherwise known as AmeriCorps. This is a sad state of affairs, that \nwhile we are trying to meet the compelling human need of our veterans, \nwe are going to further reduce a self-help opportunity program for \nhigher education, which is exactly what our veterans want Members to \nsupport. I will go into that in a minute.\n  I will oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire and \nsupport the tabling motion of the Senator from Missouri. Why? Not \nbecause I don't want to help veterans; we are helping the veterans in \nthis bill. But we are now pitting one good program against another good \nprogram in terms of its mission and purpose. Both veterans' medical and \nAmeriCorps leave a lot to be desired in the management area. But at the \nsame time, if we stick to the mission, we can continue this bill.\n\n  I strongly believe in the importance of National Service and \nvoluntarism. I helped create the original bill. I believe we need to do \nall we can to maintain an opportunity structure for access to higher \neducation and also to teach the values of the habits of the heart--that \nfor every right there is a responsibility, for every opportunity there \nis an obligation.\n  The National Service does that. Right now, there are 66,000 people \nwho have participated in the program. They are out there doing very \nimportant community service, leveraging other volunteers. For that, \nthey are earning a voucher toward their higher education. I do not \nthink anyone can dispute the merits of a program that shows for every \nopportunity there is an obligation, for every right there is a \nresponsibility. That is one of the core values for which our vets \nfought so hard. But the corporation has already taken a cut in funding. \nIt is now being funded below last year's level and below the \nPresident's request.\n  The corporation was established to enhance those opportunities \navailable for national and community service and to provide these \neducational awards for those who participate. Through the corporation, \nwe help not only communities but those who volunteer as well. National \nService participants may receive educational awards that can be used \nfor full-time or part-time education, vocational ed, or job training. \nThis is great. I know how much the Senator from Ohio believes in the \ngreat American opportunity structure. But this is not a giveaway; you \nhave to do sweat equity in the community.\n  National Service does have its problems within its organization. Its \noversight and its management do need to be improved. But we should not \nfurther reduce the funding of National Service; we should find a way to \ndeal with the spending caps. This program is a success, and it must be \nmaintained.\n  Earlier today we adopted that amendment to increase veterans' health \ncare by $600 million. With this, it means that veterans' health care \nwill be funded at $1.7 billion over the President's request. Senator \nBond and I agree, the President's request was too skimpy. We agree with \nthat. So we added in a billion in the committee. Now we are adding \nanother $1.6 billion. So we believe we are working, as a work in \nprogress, to meet the needs of veterans' health care.\n  But I do not want to see these generational issues here. I do not \nwant to see old, sick vets pitted against young Americans who are \nwilling to be working in disaster relief, tutoring people, and also \nserving the homeless--pitted against that.\n  Guess one of the other things that National Service is doing. We talk \nabout it in our own report. The National Service volunteers are helping \nthe homeless. They also have a particular outreach program to homeless \nvets. So it should not be either/or. National Service right now, as we \nspeak--as we speak, there are over 10,000 volunteers providing tutoring \nin elementary schools. The Civilian Corps is a 10-month program on \ndisaster relief. They are right there now in North Carolina. They are \nhelping clean up other parts of our country. But we are saying no, we \nare not going to fund these programs because we want to fund veterans' \nhealth care? I think the vets would say: We need our health care; we \nneed our facilities open, with the best of the staff and the supplies \nand the prescription drugs we need. We agree with that. But I do not \nthink they would want it at the expense of these young people. I really \ndo not believe it.\n\n  One of the things National Service is doing is not only helping the \ncommunity but it is called values. What do our vets stand for? \nPatriotism. Our young people are out there serving America. They stand \nfor loyalty. These young people are learning loyalty and the habits of \nthe heart.\n  Our veterans stood for self-sacrifice, neighbor helping neighbor, and \nthe defense of the Nation. These young people are part of a national \ndefense effort, eliminating poverty, illiteracy, helping the homeless. \nAt the end of their 2-year program, they go on to school and they get \non with their lives. Just as the Peace Corps, they are forming alumni \nassociations, and they keep on giving, and they keep on recruiting \npeople who give, many of whom will visit veterans' nursing homes.\n  So let's not pit one generation of Americans against the other. Let's \nmake sure we follow a wise and prudent course to honor our veterans and \nto make sure that our young people have access to higher education, \nearning a voucher through their own sweat equity, but learning the \nvalues of the greatest generation that ever existed, those who fought \nfor us in World War II.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nSmith of New Hampshire. I am a strong supporter of AmeriCorps and the \npositive changes that Corps members have made and continues to make in \ncommunities across this country AmeriCorps members are doing an \noutstanding job helping children in schools. Over two and one half \nmillion children have been taught, tutored or mentored in the nation's \nschools, and half a million children have been served in after-school \nprograms through AmeriCorps.\n  AmeriCorps members give a year of their life to tackle critical \nproblems like literacy, crime and poverty. After their year of service, \nAmeriCorps members receive education awards to help finance college or \npay back students loans. AmeriCorps enables its volunteers to improve \ntheir communities while improving themselves.\n  In Massachusetts, the Service Alliance distributes $13 million in \ngrants a year to more than 200 service and volunteer programs across \nthe state. More than 180,000 citizens have contributed 3.5 million \nhours of service--mentoring young people, helping the homeless, and \ncleaning up neighborhoods. Through programs like City Year, Habitat for \nHumanity and Boys and Girls Clubs, volunteers have a wide choice in \nactivities and are bringing their talent and enthusiasm to communities \nacross the state.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this amendment and maintain strong \nbipartisan support for these important programs.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BOND. I have an amendment that will strike several sections of \nthe bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be set aside \ntemporarily.\n\n[[Page S11225]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n   (Purpose: Strike provisions that would amend the Fair Housing Act)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1760.\n       On page 112, strike line 3 and all that follows through \n     line 4 on page 113.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as you can see, it is a simple amendment. It \nstrikes sections 427 and 428. They were put in the bill to amend the \nFair Housing Act to provide a 72-hour cooling off period for newspapers \nthat had been accused of having published an item that was alleged to \nhave been discriminatory. The two major publishers in my State and \npublishers around the country presented to us what they thought was a \nvery unfair situation. We thought we could accommodate them with this \nprovision in the bill.\n  However, Senators Kennedy and Harkin have raised substantive concerns \nand pointed out that this amendment would violate rule XVI. I therefore \noffer this amendment to strike these provisions so we do not have to \nhave a battle over rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1760) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, since we are nearing 2 o'clock, I ask \nunanimous consent that at 1:55 the Senator from Minnesota be recognized \nto make 2 minutes of closing statements on his amendment, that I be \nrecognized to make opposing comments and raise the point of order, and \nthat he may ask that it be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take this time to speak. I want \nto make a couple of compelling points for my colleagues.\n  First, our own Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee has gone on record \nsaying, if we really want to fill these gaps in veterans' health care, \nwe require what this amendment calls for above what we have spent, \nwhich is $1.3 billion more.\n  Second, I cite as evidence this independent budget put together by \nmany different veterans organizations. We asked the veterans to really \nlook at veterans' health care and come up with recommendations.\n  Third, I cite as evidence, again, a study my office conducted when we \nreally could not get good straight information from the VA, called \nVeterans Health Care and Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Flat-Line.\n  Fourth, I want to again remind my colleagues that all of us, on an \namendment in the budget resolution, have been on record, in a 99-0 \nvote, saying we ought to make this additional investment. I think that \nis extremely important.\n  My second point is, what is at stake? We have traveled a long way \nfrom where this budget once was. The President's budget was inadequate. \nI think what the House and the Senate were doing was inadequate. \nColleagues have stepped forward. I am glad to see we have made some \nprogress. The veterans community, I think, has spoken up and has made \nit clear to us that they want to see us respond to their needs and the \ncircumstances of their lives.\n  What I am saying in this amendment is that what is at stake is the \nquality of care. It is just simply true. There is not enough good care \nfor elderly veterans, and many veterans are living to be 80 and 85 \nyears of age. There is not enough good care for those veterans \nstruggling with posttraumatic stress syndrome. The waits for care are \ntoo long. Too many of our facilities are understaffed. I do not know \nwhy we would not go forward with what we have already gone on record \nsaying we are committed to. I do not think that is acceptable.\n  What is being used against this amendment is that it is in violation \nof this arcane rule of the Budget Act. But I say to my colleagues--this \nis the point I want to make; and I will make it in the last 2 minutes \nif Senator Johnson is not here--we have, whatever it is, $15 billion in \nsurplus. We know darn well we are going to be breaking these caps and \nwe are going to be spending that money. We know that. Every single \nSenator knows we are going to be spending that money. We are going to \nbe spending that money later on.\n  When we do that later on, and we invest that money in whatever areas \nwe invest in, then you are going to have to come back and tell the \nveterans why you voted against this amendment. If you do not believe \nthat we are going to break the budget caps and spend that additional \nsurplus money on some important domestic needs, then I guess you could \nvote against this amendment. But if you know in your heart of hearts \nwhat everybody I think in the Senate knows, that we are going to spend \nthat money, we are going to break the caps, then why would you want to \nput veterans at the bottom of the list? Why wouldn't you up front vote \nfor the additional resources that we need for veterans' health care?\n  I thought maybe we would have an up-or-down vote, maybe it would be a \nvote to table the amendment. I did not realize we were going to have \nthis budget debate.\n  But I think now we have two issues. No. 1, are we going to follow \nthrough on the commitment we made to veterans? We are all on record \nsaying we need to make this additional investment. No. 2, are we going \nto sort of play this game, knowing full well we are going to spend the \nsurplus, we are going to spend this $15 billion surplus? We know that. \nWe are going to break the caps and do that.\n  We have too many glaring needs in this country, too many draconian \ncuts that are mean-spirited in their effects on many citizens--\nvulnerable citizens, children. Start with children. What are we going \nto cut? Low-income energy assistance? Are we going to cut Head Start? \nEarly Head Start? Child care? What exactly do people think we are going \nto do with these budgets we have with these caps?\n  I say to my colleagues, you know we are going to spend that surplus. \nAnd if you know that, and later on you are going to vote to spend it, \nas you should, on some of these needs, then why wouldn't you vote for \nit right now for veterans?\n\n  This is really a test case about whether or not we are going to \nfollow through on a commitment. It is also a test case not just about a \ncommitment to veterans and doing what we need to do to get the \nresources to veterans' health care--I believe so strongly about that \nquestion--but now I have come to believe as strongly about the other \nquestion, which is: Let's be honest about this in terms of where we are \nat in this budget process.\n  We cannot live within these caps. Our appropriators are two great \nSenators--I do not know why the Senator from Missouri is wrong on so \nmany issues, but he is a darn good Senator, there is no question about \nit--and they are trying to deal with this in housing for veterans. It \nis a nightmare. So I do not accept this, even though they are two \ncolleagues who I respect.\n  I do not accept this argument. I do not accept this argument that we \nare going to use this arcane rule, we are going to use these caps, we \nare going to use this budget rule as a reason for not voting for the \ninvestment in resources that would make a huge difference in the \nquality of health care for veterans in this country, especially when we \nknow we are going to go into this surplus and use this surplus on some \ncritical needs in our country. I am here to argue this is a critical \nneed--veterans' health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I know we have 5 minutes left for \nwrapup.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his \nkind words and note with gratitude that he did point out we disagree. \nThis is a great relief to many of my constituents. I thank him for that \nacknowledgement.\n\n[[Page S11226]]\n\n  But seriously, this very important amendment, the Wellstone \namendment, would eat into the Social Security reserve. It ignores the \nfact that a majority of Members of this body wrote me in support of a \n$1.7 billion increase. I therefore state that the pending amendment, \nNo. 1747, offered by the Senator from Minnesota, increases spending in \nexcess of the allocation to the Appropriations Committee; therefore, I \nraise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) \nof the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think that I can do it in 1 minute \nbecause my colleagues have been gracious enough.\n  Again, I cite as evidence our vote on the budget resolution calling \nfor this additional investment that is in this amendment; second, the \nindependent budget from the veterans; third, our own Senate veterans' \nhealth care committee, which said we need to spend the additional $3 \nbillion, this gets us up to that point; fourth, the study where I sent \na questionnaire out to all the VISN directors, when I could not get the \nstraight information from the VA about the needs; fifth, I translated \nthis into human terms, in terms of the not adequate care for elderly \nvets, not adequate care for vets struggling with PTSD, not adequate \nhome-based care, longer lines than there should be, longer waits, not \nthe access to specialists. This is important if we want to fill these \ngaps.\n\n  Finally, I say to my colleagues, I am being told this violates the \nbudget caps, but everybody knows we are going to take that $15 billion \nin surplus and spend it. We know that. There are too many glaring needs \nin this country. If later on you are going to vote to spend it on \nsomething, then why would you put veterans' needs at the very bottom? \nWhy wouldn't you vote for veterans' health care right now?\n  I think we ought to be straightforward and honest about what we are \ndoing. I think that has to do with the budget, but I also think it has \nto do with what we need to do to try to make sure veterans' health care \nis as high a quality as possible. We have a long ways to go. This \namendment takes us far in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Let's be honest. There was a budget surplus. We spent it. \nIt is gone. It is done. We had the increased spending for defense \nbecause we made commitments in many areas around the world and we have \nto defend and support our fighting men and women when we ask them to \nput their lives on the line for us. We have to remedy the shortfall \nthat every one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said the President's budget \nhas caused. We are spending it on agriculture. We approved a $7-plus \nbillion ag relief bill that came out of this body. It is now in \nconference. We have to put money in for the census. We have spent the \nmoney. It is gone.\n  So what this amendment seeks to do is to take an additional $1.3 \nbillion out of Social Security. The Senator says we have to provide \npriorities for veterans. We just added $1.7 billion over the \nPresident's request for veterans' medical care--the largest increase in \nveterans' medical care in history--to allow expanded care to thousands \nof veterans, initiating new programs for veterans, helping homeless \nveterans, providing for inflationary increases, enabling the VA to \ntreat the veterans who have hepatitis C with a new therapy.\n  The Veterans' Administration is making cuts, increasing efficiencies, \ngood business practices that will enable them to serve more. The money \nwe have already provided should assure good quality care for the next \nyear in the health care facilities for our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter dated April 30, signed by 51 of our colleagues, to Chairman \nStevens and Senator Byrd asking for the $1.7 billion to be provided by \nthe Appropriations Committee for veterans' health.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted and Senator Byrd: We write to urge the \n     Appropriations Committee to follow the recommendations set \n     forth in the Budget Resolution pertaining to the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs (VA) discretionary health care \n     appropriation.\n       Veterans' health care funding has been held virtually \n     constant for four years. The additional $1.7 billion, \n     recommended by Congress, will allow the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA) to help fulfill the country's obligation \n     to provide health care to our military veterans. The funding \n     will also help VHA address newly emerging health care \n     challenges such as the high incidence of hepatitis C among \n     veterans, emergency care, technological advances in medicine, \n     and patient safety, as well as long-term and end-of-life \n     care. Additionally, the new funding may enable VA to avoid \n     some of the recently announced personnel reductions that \n     prompted the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs to hold a \n     hearing on April 13.\n       Once again, America is facing a situation that has focused \n     enormous attention on the importance of our Armed Forces. \n     These men and women, who have answered the call of our \n     nation, may someday call on the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to come to their aid. An increase in the VA health \n     care appropriations account for FY 2000 will go a long way to \n     demonstrate that not only is America committed to be there \n     for the veterans of today, but we are prepared to handle the \n     veterans of tomorrow as well.\n       We believe it is imperative for the future viability of the \n     VA health care system that the Appropriations Committee \n     follow through with the recommendations set forth in the \n     Budget Resolution. We look forward to working with you and \n     the other members of the Committee to achieve this goal.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Arlen Specter, John D.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee, Senator Bond, and my colleague and close \nfriend from Maryland, the ranking member of the VA-HUD appropriations \nsubcommittee, Senator Mikulski, for their good work in developing this \nbill under extremely difficult circumstances.\n  All of us should recognize that due to the steadfastness of these two \nSenators, many important programs that had otherwise been scheduled for \nthe cutting block, programs that had, indeed, been severely damaged by \nthe House bill, have been largely preserved in the legislation that is \nbefore us this afternoon.\n  My colleagues, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, working with the \nstrong support of Senator Stevens, the chairman of the full committee, \nand Senator Byrd, the ranking minority member of the full committee, \nworked hard to prevent deep House cuts from being carried forward in \ntheir bill.\n  So I very much appreciate the efforts by the chairman and the ranking \nmember, for example, to preserve the affordable housing stock and to \nprovide tenant protections in cases where owners insist in opting out \nof their assisted housing contracts. That is important progress, and I \nthank them for their hard work.\n  There is always the ``but.'' While recognizing and applauding the \nwork of the subcommittee, I do not want to lose sight of the \ncontinuing, pressing affordable housing needs and the efforts that we \nmust continue to make beyond the floor consideration of this \nlegislation today as a Congress and as a nation.\n  Today, in the midst of the longest peacetime economic expansion in \nour Nation's history, we are faced with the largest number of our \ncitizens facing ``worst case housing needs.'' Let me explain briefly \nwhat that phrase means. Families with ``worst case housing needs'' are \nthose who pay over half their income in rent or live in severely \nsubstandard housing, housing that fails to meet basic standards of \nsafety and decency.\n  For families paying so much of their income for rent, homelessness is \nonly one bout of unemployment away. For those families, an unexpected \nmedical bill brought on by a sick child or an elderly parent, a broken \ndown car that makes it impossible to get to work, or any modest \nfinancial disruption in life's routines that most people could absorb, \nany of those activities can lead to eviction. Today, there are almost \n5.5 million families who live with this sword of Damocles just over \ntheir heads.\n  Work in and of itself is not a solution. A recent study indicates \nthat people working for the minimum wage, a full-time working family \nearning the minimum wage, would have to work in excess of 100 hours a \nweek at the minimum wage in order to pay the rent for a two-bedroom \napartment.\n  In other words--and the HUD statistics support this data--the fastest \ngrowing segment of the population with worst case needs are families. \nSo there is this big gap between what working at the minimum wage \nbrings in and what it costs on average for a modest apartment.\n  This underscores, in my opinion, the need to increase the stock of \naffordable housing. It also underscores, of course, the need to address \nthe minimum wage as well. But this legislation before us now deals with \nhousing.\n  We need to increase the stock of affordable housing. The fastest way \nto do that is by funding additional section 8 rental vouchers. This is \nvery much the issue I hope will be addressed in conference.\n  Last year, we worked together to authorize 100,000 vouchers for \nfiscal year 2000 in the public housing bill. The budget the President \nsubmitted included the 100,000 vouchers in the proposal. In the current \nyear, we funded 50,000 vouchers.\n  I make this point fully understanding the constraints under which \nSenators Bond and Mikulski worked to bring this bill to the floor \ntoday. As I have indicated, they did a good job within those \nconstraints. But it is the responsibility of all of us now to consider \nhow we can move beyond those constraints so we can start to meet the \nneeds of the millions of working families, the millions of poor \nfamilies, and the elderly that desperately need housing assistance just \nin order to make ends meet. I very much hope we can start to address \nthis problem in the conference. I encourage both of my colleagues to \nplace this issue of section 8 rental vouchers high on their priority \nlist as they go to conference.\n\n  Let me add two other brief points. Last year we passed important new \npublic housing legislation, working successfully in a bipartisan way \nwith Senators Mack, Bond, Mikulski, and D'Amato. That new law holds \nreal possibilities for strengthening our public housing stock by giving \nmore flexibility to local housing authorities while at the same time \nproviding important protections for the poor. To make this law work, \nhowever, we must provide adequate funding. We need to give the housing \nauthorities adequate operating subsidies to run their programs \neffectively on a day-to-day basis.\n  Furthermore, these housing authorities are public agencies that \ncannot opt out of the program, as many of their private counterparts \ndo. We must provide them the capital necessary to maintain and upgrade \ntheir units so we can begin to build the kind of economically diverse \ncommunities we know are healthier for all residents. I very much\n\n[[Page S11228]]\n\nhope this issue will also be kept in mind as my colleagues go to \nconference.\n  Finally, I note my concern with the provisions of the bill that \neliminate the Community Builders Program entirely this coming February. \nIn fact, many of these employees are the sole HUD workers in various \nState or local HUD offices. Surely, a more measured approach to \naddressing these concerns is possible. Eliminating these positions will \nresult either in offices being closed or HUD being forced to shuffle \nemployees around in ways that simply may not be optimal. From all \nreports, the community builders are doing a good job. They have been \nwell received. I hope we allow them to continue with their efforts.\n  In closing, I again thank my colleagues for their work on this bill. \nMany improvements were made possible by their resolve and their many \nefforts even before the bill was marked up, but there is still much to \nbe done. I look forward to working with both of them, and the other \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, as the bill moves to \nconference in the hope and anticipation that we may be able to move \nbeyond some of the constraints under which they were laboring and to \naddress these issues which I have outlined and, certainly, this very \npressing need for affordable housing all across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, and \ncommend both Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their extraordinary \nwork in trying to fashion an appropriations bill under very difficult \nfiscal constraints and to meet the demands for so many different \nprograms.\n  I, too, am concerned that the amount of resources devoted to the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development is not sufficient to meet \nthe demands for all Americans for adequate and safe housing. I am also \nconcerned that some of the reductions in staffing may impair the \noperations of HUD in the delivery of effective services to Americans \nthroughout the country.\n  Again, I recognize the extraordinary conflicting demands that both \nSenator Bond and Senator Mikulski faced and the remarkable job they \nhave done in fashioning the bill to date. It is my hope that as we go \ninto conference, we can find additional resources to address two \ncritical issues. First and foremost is access to affordable housing for \nall of our citizens. There is, in fact, an affordable housing crisis \nthroughout this country. The second issue, as I mentioned before, is \nrelated to the issue of staffing at HUD.\n  Let me talk about the crisis that many Americans face with regard to \naffordable housing. As Senator Sarbanes articulated, there is a request \nwithin the President's budget for 100,000 new vouchers that will allow \nindividuals to move into adequate, decent, and safe housing. It is \nestimated that there are 5.3 million households in the United States \nthat suffer from worst-case housing needs. These needs, as has \npreviously been explained, are either the fact that the family is \npaying more than 50 percent of their income for housing or that they \nare living in very substandard housing. This is not an academic problem \nanywhere in the United States; it is a real problem. In Rhode Island, \nfor example, it is estimated that there are 23,000 families suffering \nworst-case housing needs. They are spending a huge amount of their \nincome simply to find a place to live. Sometimes these places are \ninadequate. Others are in places in which, frankly, we would not live, \nnor would we want to see anyone else live. So we do have a problem. \nThis problem is worsening.\n\n  We used to build affordable housing units at a fairly substantial \nrate. Between 1979 and 1980, we built a significant number of houses. \nThat was a trend that had begun all through the 1970s. In the 1980s, we \nessentially stopped building affordable housing throughout this \ncountry. In 1995, the Government went further and stopped issuing any \nadditional rental vouchers for needy Americans. So as a result, \npredictably and understandably, we have a shortage of decent, \naffordable housing throughout the United States.\n  This problem of a lack of supply has been further exacerbated by a \nbooming economy that is driving up the price of everything, including \nthe price of houses. So we have limited housing stock and increased \ndemands. We have accelerating prices. We have families that are in \ncrisis.\n  Last year we authorized 100,000 new vouchers--I commend the \nleadership for doing that--but still there are more than 1 million \nAmericans on waiting lists for public housing or for section 8 \nvouchers. They are not waiting for days or weeks; the average waiting \ntime for section 8 vouchers in our country is 28 months. In most large \ncities, the waiting time is much longer. For example, in Philadelphia, \nthe waiting time is 11 years. In Cincinnati, it is 10 years. In Los \nAngeles, it is 8 years. In my own home State of Rhode Island, the \naverage waiting time for public housing is not quite that severe, but \nit is still 7 months. That is a long time for a family to wait to get \ninto public housing. In addition, there is a long waiting list and \nwaiting period for section 8 vouchers. That is estimated to be months \nand months, if not years.\n  So we have a problem we have to address. In light of this great \nproblem, we should this year, once again, authorize at a minimum \n100,000 new rental assistance vouchers. We haven't done that. We \nhaven't been able to do that in this particular appropriations bill. I \nhope in the conference we can, in fact, achieve that objective. Even if \nwe do that, we will not be totally satisfying the tremendous housing \nneeds of the American people, but at least it will be another forward \nstep in that appropriate march to a goal of adequate, safe, decent, and \naffordable housing for all of our citizens.\n  The second issue I will mention is the issue of staffing in the \nDepartment of HUD; in particular, the Community Builders Program. My \ncolleague, Senator Sarbanes, mentioned the concerns that I, too, share. \nThis is a program which is now, under this legislation, scheduled to be \neliminated. It has only been in operation for about a year. We haven't \ngiven it a chance to operate. If, in fact, we eliminate this program, \nnot only will we miss the opportunity to truly and effectively evaluate \nthis program, we will also take away many of the workers who are doing \nall the work in some of the regional and district offices of HUD. We \nwill effectively impair the ability of HUD to deliver their services, \nand that is not something we want to do.\n  There are reports already that the cuts HUD has made in their \nstaffing--and they have been significant over the last several years--\nhave reached a point where both GAO and the IG at HUD are questioning \nwhether or not HUD has reduced too many employees. In this context, \nwhere they have already made significant reductions and where we have a \nnew program that shows some promise, although there has been some \ncriticism, I think it is premature to eliminate the Community Builders \nProgram.\n  I hope we will study it carefully, evaluate it objectively, make \nchanges, if necessary, but certainly not at this juncture eliminate a \nprogram that deserves, I think, additional time to prove its worth and \nmerit.\n  Let me conclude by thanking Senators Bond and Mikulski for their \nextraordinary work. Also, I will work with them over the next several \nweeks and months in conference to see if we can find and dedicate these \nresources to addressing many of the issues I have raised.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nSarbanes, and the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reid, for their \ncompliments. I particularly want to thank the Senator from Maryland, my \nvery dear and esteemed colleague. We have a wonderful alignment in \nMaryland with Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member on authorizing and I \non housing appropriations. I thank him for all of the work he has done \nin terms of our housing and our urban economic development initiatives, \nand also for being concerned to make sure that HUD serves not only \nurban America but our rural and suburban communities as well. I thank \nhim for his steadfast belief that the American dream is home\n\n[[Page S11229]]\n\nownership and for his desire to promote home ownership. I am \nparticularly grateful for that, and we have done that in this bill. \nAlso, he is a champion for the homeless, which, again, I believe we \naddress in this bill.\n  Then there is the in-between group, those people working for self-\nhelp, working very hard to move from welfare to work. They often \nqualify while they are working for certain subsidies, be they food \nstamps and, in some cases, section 8 housing, essentially making work \nworth it. If you are willing to work hard every day, we are willing to \nat least subsidize housing for you and your family. So his presentation \nabout the need for more section 8 vouchers, I believe, was an excellent \none and one with which I am in complete agreement.\n  I say to my colleague from Maryland that this bill is a work in \nprogress. To be able to find an offset or a new revenue stream to meet \nthe need for new vouchers now and to be able to sustain them in the \nfuture is a set of actions I wish to take. I am working closely with \nthe administration to find an offset that would be both reliable and \nsustainable, and I look forward to our continued working relationship. \nI welcome his ongoing support and collaboration. Again, this bill is a \nwork in progress. I really do thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin where others have also begun \nby complimenting the distinguished chair and ranking member. They have \nan extraordinary working relationship. They are excellent partners in \nmoving this important bill. I commend them both for their work.\n  This has not been easy, especially this year, but they have \ndemonstrated once again what happens when two people of intelligence \nand determination can work together to achieve the product that we have \nbefore us. I certainly hope that our colleagues will recognize that \nwork and will be as supportive as I hope we can be on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  If there is one area where I hope we can take another look in \nconference it is section 8 and the question of public housing. The \naffordable housing crisis, as many know, is now at record levels. But \nwe are in a situation where very little is available in the form of new \nvouchers to deal with millions of children and senior citizens who are \ncurrently at risk, not because we don't have the desire but because we \nhaven't had the resources.\n  We have considered the demand for section 8 housing. We have looked \nat public housing in many ways but have not funded it adequately \nbecause we have felt the need to fund other priorities. In fact, we \nhave used section 8 as an offset to fund other programs. That offset \nhas now been completely depleted.\n  But 5.3 million American households suffer from the worst-case \nhousing situations--defined as paying more than 50 percent of their \nincome in rent or living in substandard conditions. I believe Senator \nSarbanes mentioned that.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, the average waiting list for public \nhousing is now 9 months for section 8. It is a very serious problem \neven in a rural State such as ours where one wouldn't think that the \navailability of public housing is nearly as much of a problem as it \nmight be in some of the larger cities.\n  But we have seen a half decade of a budget freeze on housing \nassistance. From 1977 to 1994, the number of HUD-assisted households \ngrew by 2.6 million--an average of 204,000 additional households each \nyear from 1977 through 1983, and an additional 107,000 households per \nyear from 1984 to 1994. But in 1995 we saw a reversal of that policy--a \nfreeze on new housing vouchers despite the growing need.\n  In 1999, we saw the first new vouchers in 5 years. The President has \nmade a modest request for fiscal year 2000 of 100,000 for this year. \nLast year we made available 50,000 new section 8 vouchers, the first in \n5 years. In my own State, again, 321 families would receive section 8 \nassistance with appropriations of 100,000 new vouchers. To provide no \nnew vouchers is, frankly, a flaw in what is otherwise a very important \nbill. I hope we can begin to work on it much more constructively.\n  In some areas, housing costs have risen faster than incomes of low-\nincome working families. In addition, due to the aging and \ngentrification of older housing, the number of affordable rental units \nhas actually declined.\n  The section 8 housing voucher program clearly provides one of the \nonly means--if not the only means--to subsidize the rents of apartments \nthat families locate on the private rental markets. They don't give \nfamilies a free ride. I think everyone hopefully understands that. \nThere is no free ride for families. They still must find the resources \nto pay between 30 and 40 percent of their incomes for rent. They have \nto take some responsibility in their own right. Without vouchers, many \nlow-income working families simply are unable to secure affordable \nhousing.\n  Another problem, of course, related to public housing and section 8 \nhousing is the Community Builder Program. The bill currently would \nrequire the firing of 410 HUD employees, which would eliminate local \nservice in almost two dozen communities, including South Dakota. That \nalso would be a problem.\n  I realize our distinguished colleagues had to make some very tough \nchoices. I applaud them for making many of the choices they did and \ncoming up with as fair and comprehensive a bill as we have before the \nSenate. I intend to support it strongly and enthusiastically. I do \nhope, though, when we get to conference, we can address the section 8 \nand public housing programs. I believe that is the one area where, as \ngood as this bill is, we still can demonstrate real progress.\n  Failing that, I am very concerned about the implication for housing \nfor low-income people across this country, in South Dakota, in rural \nareas, as well as in urban areas that I know are commonly associated \nwith public housing programs. This is not just an urban problem; it is \na rural problem as well. I know the distinguished ranking member \nunderstands that and is very knowledgeable and cognizant of that issue \nand problem. I hope we can do better in resolving it once we get to \nconference.\n  I congratulate my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I add another cosponsor to amendment No. \n1744. I ask that Senator Abraham be added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me first thank the distinguished \nminority leader for his kind comments. I share his concern about the \navailability of affordable housing. At an appropriate time, I want to \ndiscuss some of the problems in a little more detail. I recognize his \nconcern and the concerns raised by the Senator from Maryland, the \nSenator from Rhode Island, and others. There is a bigger problem, and \nwe will discuss that later.\n  We have been in quorum calls for almost the last hour. We have an \namendment Senator Mikulski will offer shortly on behalf of Senator \nInouye. However, we are open for business. This is daylight. This is a \ngood time to present amendments, to argue amendments, with great \ncoverage. Everybody is paying attention; everybody is awake. We beg and \nplead with our colleagues to come down and get going so we can finish \nthis up at an early hour.\n  I see the distinguished junior Senator from North Carolina who wants \nto share some views on the very serious problem caused by the hurricane \nin his State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11229-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11229-S11232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HURRICANE FLOYD\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the terrible \ndevastation that has occurred in my State of North Carolina, which most \nof my colleagues, I know, are aware of, and to\n\n[[Page S11230]]\n\ngive them an update on a report I gave last week.\n  The people of North Carolina are suffering in a way they have never \nsuffered before. This is absolutely the worst disaster that has ever \nhit the State of North Carolina. There has been tragedy, and there have \nbeen acts of heroism. It has been an extraordinarily difficult \nsituation, particularly for the people of eastern North Carolina. Thus \nfar, we have 37 confirmed deaths as a result of the hurricane. We have \nfour additional North Carolinians at this point presumed dead. We \nexpect, as the waters recede, as FEMA officials and other local folks \nare able to get into houses that have been covered by water, that we \nwill find additional North Carolinians who have lost their lives as a \nresult of this flood. Let me give one example.\n  We have one entire family that was wiped out by this flood--six \nmembers of the family. This happened in Pinetops, NC, which is one of \nthe worst hit areas of eastern North Carolina. Ben and Vivian Mayo, \nKeisha Mayo, and Cabrina and Destiny Flowers were all killed as they \ntried to escape in a small boat but the boat capsized. Yesterday, \nrescue team members who were working in the area discovered another \nmember of the family, Teshika, who was 50 feet from her grandparents' \nhome at the time of her death. She was 5 years old. That is six members \nof this family who died in the course of this hurricane. This is a \nterrible tragedy. I ask all of my colleagues and the American people as \na whole to please give their thoughts and prayers to these families as \nthey go through an extraordinarily difficult time.\n  We had business losses that we have never had in the history of North \nCarolina. An example is Jamie Milliken's family who operated an \nelectric supply company in Brunswick County. As a result of the flood, \nthey have lost $2 million worth of merchandise. They had no flood \ninsurance. Some of the hardest hit businesspeople in eastern North \nCarolina are the farmers.\n  The bottom line is--and I will talk in a little more detail about \nthis in a few minutes--there are many farmers in eastern North Carolina \nwho will be put out of business. They were already struggling, already \nhaving a very difficult time making ends meet. This has been a year \nwhere they have been hit and hit again: Hit by drought, hit by low crop \nprices, hit by low livestock prices. And then, when they are teetering \non the edge, they get the final nail in the coffin, which is the effect \nof this hurricane on their businesses and on their farms. The effect \nhas been devastating.\n  We have also had enormous problems with housing and homelessness. The \ntruth is, we have people who are desperate. For example, we got a call \nin my office from a mother whose daughter is stranded in New Hanover \nCounty, where Wilmington is located. She lost everything: Her home, her \ncar, all of her possessions, and her job. Her mother says her daughter \nhas absolutely no idea how she will go about rebuilding her life and \nshe can't stop crying. Every time she calls her, she is crying. She has \nno idea how she will deal with the situation.\n  We have about 10,000 people in eastern North Carolina who still \nremain in shelters, who cannot get to their homes because of the \nfloodwaters, and they have nowhere to go except the shelters. Mr. \nPresident, 50,000 homes have been affected by this hurricane. We expect \nthat number actually to go up as we have more time to go in and see \nwhat damage has been caused.\n  I might add, I spoke with the Director of FEMA, James Lee Witt, a bit \nago. He pointed out to me something that the people in North Carolina \nhave already thought about. When the floodwaters recede, because the \nwater has been contaminated by a variety of things, including \nwastewater treatment plants being flooded, including dead livestock, \nincluding any of a variety of things, the water is contaminated that \nhas gone into people's homes. When that water recedes, folks are going \nto want to go home. They have been out of their homes for a long time \nnow, living in shelters. They will want to go home. The problem is, \ntheir houses will be contaminated. They will have enormous health \nthreats as a result of the contamination caused by the floodwaters. We \nwill be confronted with a situation of trying to decontaminate the \nhouses, and in some cases that may be impossible. It may be required \nthat the houses simply be torn down and rebuilt.\n\n  I might add, many of these people whose houses have been flooded had \nno flood insurance. To be fair to them, they had no reason to have \nflood insurance. They didn't live in a floodplain. They didn't live in \nan area that had ever been flooded. They had no reason to believe their \nhomes would ever be flooded. They are the victims of this hurricane.\n  Water supplies. We have thousands of people in eastern North Carolina \nwho have no clean water. Many people who had wells as the source of \ntheir drinking water, the water they use on their farm, the water they \nuse to bathe--the wells are gone.\n  In Greenville, which is probably the largest city in eastern North \nCarolina, they are facing an entire shutdown of their water supply due \nto a break in the water main. If this occurs, every restaurant, every \nbusiness, will have to close and it will affect every resident in the \narea.\n  We have about 120 million gallons of hog waste caused by broken and \nflooded lagoons spilling into floodwaters. Water is flowing directly \nfrom our sewage systems into these floodwaters, which are contaminating \nhomes, contaminating businesses, contaminating farms.\n  We also have a problem with our roads. We have more than 900 roads \nthat have been washed out where floods have been recorded. One example \nof this is Interstate 95. You can just see the extent to which \nInterstate 95 has been flooded. It is totally impassable. We still \nhave, I might add, many sections of Interstate 95 and Interstate 40 \nwhich are still impassable. We have 10 bridges that have been destroyed \nduring the course of this.\n  I mentioned earlier our farms and our agriculture in eastern North \nCarolina. These folks have been devastated. They have been through \nextraordinarily difficult times. Now the bottom line is their farms are \nunderwater.\n  Just some examples of the crop losses we expect to be incurred: \nCotton, we expect to lose 80 percent of the cotton crop in North \nCarolina; soybeans, 75 to 80 percent; peanuts, 75 to 80 percent; sweet \npotatoes, to date, about 25 percent of that crop has been harvested. We \nexpect to lose anywhere from 75 to 80 percent and possibly greater of \nthe sweet potato crop. Mr. President, 50 percent of the tobacco crop, \nwhich we all know is an enormously important economic crop in North \nCarolina, has been lost.\n  Livestock: I just finished meeting a few minutes ago with livestock \nfarmers, hog farmers from eastern North Carolina, and they have been \ntotally devastated. They have virtually no insurance. A lot of these \nfarms have lost many thousands of dollars. In fact, the average amount \nof equipment that is located on these farms is worth $500,000. That \nequipment is not insured and it has been largely destroyed because the \npeople had to leave their farms so quickly when the water started to \nrise. There have been more than 100,000 hogs that have been drowned so \nfar; about 3 million poultry. Widespread starvation is facing many of \nthe animals that still are in eastern North Carolina because they are \ncut off from feed sites and they are cut off from rescue efforts.\n  The fishing industry has suffered a great deal so far, and they are \ngoing to continue to suffer. Many fishermen have lost their boats, and \nwe expect many of the environmental results of this hurricane's \ndevastation in eastern North Carolina to cause problems with our \nfishing reserves for many years to come.\n  Finally, debris and contaminated water has done enormous damage to \nthe soil of eastern North Carolina, of which our farmers are so proud \nand have relied upon for so long.\n  I can show just a couple of other examples of the flooding that \nexists in eastern North Carolina. Many folks have seen these \nphotographs from some of the television stories. But here is an example \nof the level of the flooding in a rural area in eastern North Carolina. \nThese are people who never had water on their property. They never had \nany notion they had to be worried about that.\n  Here is an example of what I saw when I traveled this past weekend \nover\n\n[[Page S11231]]\n\neastern North Carolina. What is shown in this photograph I saw all over \neastern North Carolina. You can see that it is not just flooding. The \nflooding is up to the roofs of these houses and it is extensive and you \nsee it over and over and over. It is all over the areas of eastern \nNorth Carolina. Can you imagine the folks who spent their lives living \nin these homes and the devastation this has created for them? \nEverything they own and spent their lives putting together is in these \nhomes that have been flooded.\n  Finally, I made mention of the farming operations. Here is a farm in \neastern North Carolina. Everything we see underwater in these sections \nis all farmland; all had crops on them, all a total loss, 100 percent \ntotal loss. This scene is repeated over and over. I spent hours in a \nhelicopter going over eastern North Carolina and landing in various \nplaces. I can't tell you the human tragedy associated with this for \npeople who have spent their lives here. For these folks who farm this \nland and who live in eastern North Carolina, this is not just a place \nthey live. This is a way of life for them, and they have now lost it. \nThis is something that is going to be difficult, if not impossible, for \nthe people of eastern North Carolina to ever recover from.\n\n  Having said all of this, there are a number of people we need to \nthank because the reality is there have been and there will continue to \nbe acts of heroism as a result of this catastrophe in eastern North \nCarolina.\n  First, FEMA; FEMA has done an extraordinary job so far. I expect them \nto continue to do an extraordinary job. Their Director, James Lee Witt, \nhas been on top of this problem. He has been in regular contact with \nall the people who are involved, including myself and Governor Hunt. \nThe American Red Cross has been omnipresent in eastern North Carolina \nand will continue to be so. They have done a wonderful job.\n  The Salvation Army and the Marine Corps have done a wonderful job. \nThe Army, the troops who are located in eastern North Carolina, the \nCoast Guard, the Navy, the National Guard have all worked \nextraordinarily hard to deal with this problem.\n  I might add, our mayors and our State and local officials have done a \nwonderful job. I include in that group our Governor, Jim Hunt, who has \nbeen on top of this situation from the very beginning. I am proud of \nthe job he has done.\n  I am also proud of the job that has been done by many of the folks in \neastern North Carolina. The bottom line is North Carolina has been \ndevastated in a way that we have never been devastated before. We have \npeople who are struggling, who are confronting situations they never in \ntheir lifetimes thought they would have to confront. People's lives \nhave been lost, people's futures have been lost, and their businesses \nhave been lost. There are farmers who spent their lives farming this \nland who will have a very difficult time getting back to the place \nwhere they can farm their land again.\n  What we ask is simply for the prayers and support of my colleagues in \nthe Senate and of the American people because the reality is we are in \na difficult situation. We need their help. We know the American people \nwill respond in the way they always have to this kind of tragedy, which \nis to support us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me express my gratitude to the Senator \nfrom North Carolina for outlining the tragic situation he faces in his \nState. As one who has faced similar circumstances in my State, seeing \nnothing but the tops of flooded buildings, I can tell you I was very \ngrateful for then-chairman of the committee, Senator Mikulski, who came \nto my State and worked with us during the floods of 1993. I know there \nis nothing more important to these people who have lost everything than \nto know that somebody is trying. There is no way we can make them \nwhole. We intend to see that FEMA meets their needs.\n  I have already discussed with the senior Senator of North Carolina \nsome of the needs. I assure both Senators that we on the committee will \ndo whatever is necessary to make sure FEMA has the resources needed. We \nbelieve they have adequate reserves right now, but we are going to \ncontinue to work on this problem and follow FEMA's activities. We look \nforward to working with the Senators from North Carolina to make sure \nwe do have adequate resources available.\n  I join with the Senator from North Carolina in saying we appreciate \nand congratulate James Lee Witt and the entire FEMA operation for what \nappears to be a very prompt response to a disaster situation.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful for the courtesy of the \ndistinguished manager of the bill, Mr. Bond, for his willingness to \nwork with me to make sure that FEMA is fully prepared to respond to the \nneeds of victims of flooding caused by Hurricane Floyd. I do not \nexaggerate when I say that North Carolina is facing the worst flooding \nin its history.\n  There is no need for me to catalogue the details of the enormous \nsuffering caused by this storm because I know that Senators understand \nand share my dismay in hearing the incredible damage reports still \ncoming in from my home state. I am so very grateful for the kind words \nof my colleagues who have told me they are thinking of--and praying \nfor--the people of Eastern North Carolina, and I know they join in \npledging that the federal government will do its part to alleviate \ntheir suffering.\n  So, Mr. President, I genuinely appreciate Senator Bond's efforts to \nassure that FEMA is currently funded at a level to respond to the \ndeveloping situation in Eastern North Carolina. I hope it is understood \nthat this is a serious and ongoing situation and that state and local \nofficials are still scrambling to grasp the enormity of the loss to \nlife and property. North Carolinians have become gratefully familiar \nwith the splendid work FEMA does in the wake of natural disasters, but \nour familiarity does not minimize the heartfelt gratitude we feel for \nthe dedicated public servants who are helping the victims of flooding.\n  I have the utmost faith in Senator Bond and his fine staff, and I \nappreciate their willingness to consider any additional needs that FEMA \nmay identify as this bill goes to Conference. At the same time, I \ncertainly understand that there will be an effort to make an accurate \naccounting of the funding--if any--that FEMA needs and I pledge that I \ndo not intend to make unreasonable demands upon appropriators. It is \nimportant that we do not act heedlessly in our understandable haste to \nhelp those in desperate need, and I will certainly make every effort to \nmake sure that any aid requested is genuinely necessary.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the diligence of \nSenator Helms and his willingness to work with me as we both seek to \nmake sure FEMA is ready to help the victims of Hurricane Floyd. I know \nhow deeply he cares for his constituents, and I join him in sending my \nthoughts to the people of Eastern North Carolina--as well as those \nsuffering in other affected states--as they begin the hard work of \nrecovering from this very serious natural disaster.\n  I certainly intend to work with him every step of the way to make \nsure that FEMA has the financial resources it needs to continue the \nimportant work already underway in North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, wish to, first of all, express \nmy support for the people of North Carolina. I believe the way we \nexpress our support and our concern is not only with kind words, which \nwe would like to say many, but with deeds. Right now James Lee Witt and \nother emergency management people are responding with gallantry and are \ntrying to get a swift assessment of damage. We want to work with you, \nSenator Helms and Governor Hunt, to really be able to get emergency \nassistance to the communities and to do it in a way that is swift, \nhelpful, and also affordable.\n  I, too, have been hit by damage in my State. Senator Bond is right. \nOne of the first things we did together was to be in Missouri because \nthey had been hit by floods. A short time later we were hit by ice \nstorms and floods.\n  You know what is so heartbreaking: After the floods and the waters \ncome, then the water goes down, and you just see broken dreams, the \nhard work of lifetimes just washed away. You go\n\n[[Page S11232]]\n\ninto a home, and there is the tattered photograph of the wedding \npicture, there is the mud-saturated picture of the graduation, and the \nappliances when you open the door. I think what I remember also, most \nof all, in addition to the tears, is the mud, the smell, and so on.\n  The first thing is that it breaks your heart. We want to make sure it \ndoes not break their pocketbook. That is what we can work on.\n  Hurt hearts. I believe the people of North Carolina will have so many \ncommunal ways that those hearts will be healed. But the immediate thing \nwe can do is to make sure that the devastation to the pocketbook is not \npermanent and that they have the opportunity to restore a way of life.\n  So I just say to the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, that \nhe is not alone nor are those thousands and thousands of people. We \nhave been thinking about you. We have been praying for you. Our hearts \nare filled with sadness that people have lost their lives. We really do \nnot want to see the loss of their way of life.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I want to take a moment to thank the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Missouri for their very kind comments. I \nknow they will, as they always have, step to the front and help the \nfolks in North Carolina who need help so desperately.\n  I would add to that, I say to Senator Bond, that Senator Helms is \nworking very hard, the senior Senator from North Carolina, on this \nproblem. He and I have talked about it on a couple of occasions \nalready. We will continue to talk about it. He is working very hard on \nthis problem. So is our Governor.\n  We appreciate very much your help and support. I appreciate your \nthoughts and prayers. This is one of those times where we need all the \nhelp and support we can get, I can promise you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am prepared to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine who has a matter of great importance \nin her State.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me begin by praising the terrific \nwork done by the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland in \nputting together this appropriations bill. I know a lot of the issues \nare very difficult. They have worked together in a bipartisan way to \ncome up with a bill that is responsible fiscally and yet meets some \nurgent needs of many people in our Nation. I commend them both for \ntheir efforts in this regard.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Missouri giving me this opportunity to \nengage him in a discussion on an issue of great importance to Maine and \nthe Nation as a whole. That is the issue of providing fair Federal \nassistance to our homeless men, women, and children, regardless of \nwhere they live. Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski have been leaders in \naddressing housing issues affecting underserved and vulnerable \npopulations, especially our Nation's homeless population.\n  Under their leadership, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment homeless assistance grants have increased from $823 million \nin fiscal year 1998 to $975 million in fiscal year 1999. I am very \npleased to note that the appropriations bill that is before us now \nwould further increase funding for vital homeless assistance grants by \nproviding a little more than $1 billion for these critical programs.\n  Senator Bond's continued dedication to this vital and often forgotten \nissue has served the public well, as has the commitment of the Senator \nfrom the State of Maryland. I salute them for their effort to direct \nthe funding of the resources to those most in need.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Maine for her kind words. I know \nof her personal commitment to helping the homeless. I strongly support \nthese important programs which do benefit the homeless men and women in \nAmerica. I hope we can come up with a permanent solution to \nhomelessness, especially for those persons with mental disabilities.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Although Congress has done a good job in recognizing the \nneed for more funding in this area to serve this very vulnerable \npopulation, I have become extremely concerned about the process that \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development has used to award a \nparticular kind of homeless grant, and that is the continuum of care \ngrant. This has been a real problem in my State, and I suspect the \nSenator from Missouri has heard from other States as well.\n  Mr. BOND. Unfortunately, we have had a number of Members express to \nus their concern about the continuum of care grant award process. Many \nbelieve that the HUD process has proven to be confusing for applicants \nand perhaps even incomprehensible to anyone outside the HUD compound.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I note that has been exactly the very unfortunate \nexperience in my State. Let me give you a little background.\n\n  The needs of the homeless population in Maine have increased in \nrecent years. Often when we think of the homeless, we think of large \ncities. In fact, there are homeless people throughout this Nation, \nincluding in rural States such as Maine.\n  From 1993 to 1996, Maine's homeless population grew by almost 20 \npercent. It is estimated that more than 14,000 people are homeless in \nmy home State today. Despite this great and growing need, however, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development denied both the \napplications from the State of Maine for continuum of care funding last \nyear. In effect, the HUD competitive homeless assistance funding \ndistributed to the State of Maine went from $3.7 million to zero. You \ncan imagine the impact on my State.\n  Moreover, we were stunned by HUD's decision because Secretary Cuomo, \nin 1998, had awarded Maine's programs with the HUD ``best practices'' \nawards of excellence.\n  A vigorous public campaign by people in Maine and repeated efforts by \nthe congressional delegation ultimately compelled HUD to provide $1 \nmillion to the city of Portland to renew certain projects. This money, \nthough welcomed, was far from sufficient to allow the State to meet the \nneeds of its homeless population.\n  That is the experience I wanted to share with the Senator from \nMissouri and the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. BOND. What happened to Maine, and other States, in the \ncompetitive award process simply should not have occurred. To me, it is \nquite puzzling. As many of us know, the problem of rural homelessness \nis complicated; it is pervasive. I live in a rural area. Rural areas \nhave higher poverty rates and a higher percentage of the population \nliving in inadequate housing, which are key factors contributing to \nhomelessness. Providing service to the rural homeless is not easy. It \nis complicated by distance, isolation, and lack of effective \ncommunication.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It seems to me that HUD needs to understand the impact \non the homeless, on the very people we are trying to serve, of simply \nshutting States out from the housing award process. HUD needs to take \ngreater care to work with States where funding may be in peril in order \nto ensure that we are not hurting the homeless people of our Nation.\n  Contrary to what HUD seems to think, homeless men and women do not \ndisappear. Their needs do not disappear when funding is cut off. In \nfact, their desperate needs still exist.\n  To address these problems, I have introduced a Senate bill which \nwould require a minimum distribution of continuum of care homeless \nassistance funding to each State. I realize that I cannot offer that on \nthis bill because of the rule XVI issue, but I hope the chairman and \nthe ranking minority member will agree with me that this is an \nimportant issue.\n  Would the chairman agree that the goal of HUD should be to make every \neffort to ensure that every State can receive some homeless grant \nfunding because every State has homeless people, unfortunately?\n  Mr. BOND. I certainly agree with the sentiments expressed by the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S11233]]\n\nfrom Maine. I am very sympathetic to the intent of the bill. As she has \npointed out, we are not able to accept it on this bill. But I do look \nforward to working with the Senator from Maine, and the many other \nSenators who expressed their concerns, to ensure that HUD does meet the \nhomeless needs of every State.\n  In the past, I have been a strong supporter of using block grant \napproaches to the States, which I think can best serve the needs of the \nhomeless. We look forward to working with the Senator and the \nauthorizing committee to solve the current HUD award process problems.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for bringing this very real and very \ncompelling problem to our attention. I assure her we will continue to \nwork to resolve the problem.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, a comment on the remarks made by the \njunior Senator from Maine. I, too, share her concern to ensure that the \nneeds of the homeless are recognized, and we try to do that in our \nbill. As she knows, under this bipartisan coalition, we increased \nfunding for the homeless by $45 million. We have to talk about not only \nmore but how it is distributed.\n  I share the Senator's concern about the rural homeless because it is \nnot only isolated but it is often invisible because of distance and the \nvery culture of small towns and also, I might add, in Maine, that \nYankee spirit of ``we take care of our own,'' not wanting ``to turn to \ncharity,'' yet at the same time facing very rugged winters, some of \nwhich now, with fall weather, are on their way. So when we think about \nMaine, it is not all L.L. Bean catalogs and fall foliage. It is some \nvery serious problems.\n  We want to work with the Senator on it. Know that we face some of \nthese same rural issues in our own home States. I thank the Senator for \nbringing even more heightened visibility in our debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues for their \nassurances. I hope we have sent a very clear signal to HUD that it \nneeds a funding process that ensures the needs of our homeless men and \nwomen and children, no matter where they live, are being met. It is \nparticularly important in a State such as Maine, where our winters can \nbe quite severe, that we provide that kind of shelter and assistance in \nhelping people not only get a bed for the night but to put their lives \nback together.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for their assistance in this matter, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I begin my brief comments this afternoon by \ncomplimenting our colleagues, Senators Bond and Mikulski, for a fine \npiece of work on this legislation under what were less than ideal \ncircumstances, I am sure. I know they have labored long and hard to \ncraft a bill that will meet the needs of our fellow constituents across \nthe country. I, for one, appreciate their labors.\n  I rise in the spirit of making this product even better. In \nparticular, I rise in support of what I understand will be an amendment \noffered by Senator Kerry in the area of section 8 housing. I do so not \nonly because I believe the merits of his amendment warrant our support, \nbut also because I believe the American dream of quality affordable \nhousing should be extended to every citizen across our country because \nI believe in the emphasis that we have been placing upon personal \nresponsibility. Along with that must go the tools to ensure that every \nperson has a chance to make personal responsibility become successful, \nand no one can deny that quality affordable housing is one of those \nbasic building blocks of opportunity in our society.\n  Finally, I rise in support of this prospective amendment because I \nbelieve in fiscally responsible solutions to the challenges that face \nAmerica. Few can argue that quality affordable housing is a challenge \nthat continues to face our great country.\n  For well nigh a generation, there was a bipartisan consensus across \nour land for quality affordable housing for all Americans. This \nconsensus was interrupted in 1995, when additional section 8 housing \nopportunities were frozen in place after more than 2 million Americans \nhad been helped over the previous 18 years. Starting this fiscal year, \nwe began to see a thaw in the freeze, but unfortunately the legislation \nnow before this body would reinstitute that freeze. It is ironic that \nat a time of unparalleled prosperity for so many Americans we should \nsee a freezing of the opportunities in the area of affordable housing. \nWhile 1 million elderly are finding themselves in a position where more \nthan 50 percent of their disposable income is spent on rent or \nsubstandard housing, 2 million families with children find themselves \nin this position. More than 22,000 Hoosier families in my capital city \nof Indianapolis alone find themselves in a position of devoting a \nmajority of their household income to rent or to substandard housing.\n  As we gather, 1 million Americans find themselves on waiting lists. \nThe question before us is, How long must they wait. In some cities--\nPhiladelphia, Los Angeles and others--families find themselves in a \nposition of waiting for years, waiting with dreams deferred, hopes \ndelayed, opportunities lost, this at a time when our robust economy and \nmarket conditions are driving rents up, pricing too many American \nfamilies out of the market for quality affordable housing.\n  My answer to the question of how long they must wait is that the time \nis now to act. The time is now to act to extend the opportunity of \nquality affordable housing to every corner of the land, to prevent this \nfrom becoming the first generation of Americans to be divided into \nclasses of haves and have-nots. Now is the time to put flesh on the \nbones of personal responsibility, to ensure every family that is \nwilling to work hard, play by the rules and save has a chance to get \nahead and realize the American dream of quality affordable housing.\n  Now is also the time to put into place fiscally responsible solutions \nto the challenges that face our great land. This proposed amendment by \nSenator Kerry is fiscally responsible. We will be taking money that was \nsaved from this year's budget in unused welfare-to-work vouchers and \nusing it for 50,000 new section 8 vouchers, which are also important \nfor making the welfare-to-work process a success.\n  I add my voice as strongly as I know how to Senator Kerry, to the \nSecretary of Housing, to Senator Mikulski, and my other colleagues who \nbelieve if we are to be a great nation, and not just a prosperous one \nbut a compassionate one, we must address the unmet needs of housing for \nthose who are less fortunate across our land. I conclude my remarks by \nsaying: If not now, when our land is filled with plenty, then when?\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment. Again, I thank Senators Bond \nand Mikulski for their yeoman's work. I think we can make a good bill \neven better by adopting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. I am a member of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies, and I know the severe funding challenges faced by \nSenator Bond, our chairman, and Senator Mikulski, our ranking member.\n  They and their staffs have done an outstanding job in meeting the \nmany priorities of this bill: critical health care services for \nveterans, homeless assistance funding for continued research in space, \nand funding for important environmental infrastructure projects along \nthe United States-Mexico border.\n  I can't adequately describe the pride I feel in the committee's \ndecision to make veterans programs the highest priority in the bill. \nThe committee provided $1.1 billion above the President's budget \nrequest for medical care for veterans. This increase will help address \nnewly emerging health care challenges, such as the high incidence of \nhepatitis C among veterans, emergency care, technological advances in \nmedicine, patient safety, and long-term and end-of-life care. I \nappreciate the commitment and sacrifices made by the men and women who \nserved our country in wartime. This increase is worthy of them and \nworthy of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S11234]]\n\n  I am proud of the committee's decision to fully fund NASA at $13.6 \nbillion. The House dealt NASA a devastating blow in their VA-HUD bill, \ncutting the programs by almost $1 billion. The funding provided in this \nbill underscores the Senate's ongoing support for exploration of the \nfinal frontier, including the space shuttle and the international space \nstation.\n  The international space station is the most ambitious scientific \nproject ever undertaken. The efforts and resources of 14 nations are \ninvolved in the design, construction, and operation of the orbiting \nlaboratory. Assembly of the international space station has already \nbegun. We expect the international space station to provide \nunparalleled scientific research opportunities. It will enable advances \nin medicine, materials science and earth observation, new technologies \ndeveloped in a microgravity environment, and accelerate the technology \nand engineering in Earth-based industries. Quite simply, the space \nstation will maintain U.S. global leadership in space science and \ntechnology. And its successes will be felt by all of us here on Earth. \nThe space shuttle's capabilities and versatility are unmatched by any \nspacecraft in the world. The space shuttle has been, and will continue \nto be, a critical element in space exploration well into the 21st \ncentury. The shuttle is also the vital transportation link in the \nassembly and utilization of the international space station. With \nplans, upgrades, and improvements by both NASA and industry, the space \nshuttle will continue to play a major role in future space exploration.\n\n  Finally, we are providing the ongoing support of the Senate for the \npoorest part of our Nation, the United States-Mexico border. This bill \nprovides $50 million for critical water and wastewater projects on the \nsouthwest border, most of which will be administered by the North \nAmerican Development Bank.\n  As an aside, when I first came to the Senate, I brought up the \ncritical issue of environment and diseases on the border. It was at \nthat time when the now ranking member, Senator Mikulski, was the \nchairman of the subcommittee and she said, ``This is outrageous in \nAmerica and we are going to do something about it.'' That was the first \nfunding that we got for the colonias on the border, where citizens of \nour country are living in filth. I appreciate that. We have added to \nthat $50 million every year since I have been in the Senate, and now \nunder the leadership of Chairman Bond.\n  Washington, DC, is a long way from the border. Recently, I visited \ncolonias--these colonies--along our border that have no infrastructure. \nI visited colonias near Laredo and McAllen, TX. On rainy days, the \nunpaved streets in these colonias wash out, making it impossible for \nschoolbuses to enter the neighborhood. Children walk to school on mud-\nfilled streets and yards, sometimes flooded with human waste that is \noverflowing from inadequate septic systems. Texas has nearly 1,500 of \nthese subdivisions, with a population of nearly 350,000 people. The \nnumbers in the other southwest border States are equally as staggering.\n  The $50 million we provide in this bill, added to the $300 million \nthat has accumulated in years past, continues the commitment we have \nmade to end this national shame. No person in the United States should \nlive as do the people in these colonias. I appreciate Senators Bond and \nMikulski working with me to give this matter the proper attention in \nour subcommittee.\n  I also want to mention we are working on another amendment that would \ndeal with the phase II stormwater sewer regulations that are so \nimportant to our smaller counties around the country. I hope the EPA \nwill work with us to try to make sure we don't put regulations on these \nsmaller counties that they can't possibly accept and do not have the \nfunding to do.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill is good for our Nation. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their hard work and sensitivity to the \ncritical issues in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWINE and Mr. Hagel pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1617 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first I would like to ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Dick Durbin be added to amendment No. 1744, the Byrd, Stevens, \nBond, Mikulski $600 million VA-HUD amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1777\n\n(Purpose: To make an amendment with respect to a special purpose grant \n         for the community of Kohala in the County of Hawaii.)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to propose a technical amendment \nin behalf of Senator Inouye. This amendment is simply a technical and \ncorrecting amendment. It makes a technical correction to a HUD grant \npreviously awarded to Hawaii. It has been cleared on both sides of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), for Mr. Inouye, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1777.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     amount made available under the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 1991 (Public Law 101-507) for a \n     special purpose grant under section 107 of the Housing and \n     Community Development Act of 1974 to the County of Hawaii for \n     the purpose of an environmental impact statement for the \n     development of a water resource system in Kohala, Hawaii, \n     that is unobligated on the date of enactment of this Act, may \n     be used to fund water system improvements, including \n     exploratory wells, well drillings, pipeline replacements, \n     water system planning and design, and booster pump and \n     reservoir development.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as I commented, it is technical and \ncorrecting and has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we accept the amendment and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1777) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is a good time to do a couple of \nthings. We started off with a good pace and had a major amendment \napproved by voice vote. Then we had votes on two more amendments. We \nhave had some wonderful speeches and some great colloquies. We are open \nfor business. It is daylight. We want to get people here because we \nface a tremendous deadline with the end of the fiscal year approaching. \nWe need to get this bill passed this week to make sure we keep these \nagencies funded. I ask colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please, \nif you have amendments, colloquies, or items we need to deal with, \nplease bring them. Otherwise, I am ready to go to third reading in the \nnot too distant future.\n  Something has been brought up which I hope we can spend some time \ndiscussing. A number of my colleagues have talked about the tremendous \nneed for housing. They have equated that with the need for additional \nsection 8 incremental or additional assistance.\n\n[[Page S11235]]\n\n  I want to go through some of the difficult problems we face. Perhaps \nas I straighten out in my own mind the complexity of section 8, my \ncolleagues will understand why we came to this point. This bill does \nnot provide any of the 100,000 incremental section 8 vouchers requested \nby the President. The addition of these vouchers to the bill would cost \nan additional $578 million per year. Last year, we agreed to the \nPresident's absolutely necessary request for 50,000 additional section \n8 vouchers. We pointed out at the time that this caused a real problem, \nand we would need additional money to fund them in future years. The \nrepresentatives of the administration assured Members they would make \nprovisions for that additional required budget authority.\n  What did we get this year from the administration? We received a \nrequest that we defer $4.2 billion in budget authority to the following \nfiscal year. In other words, they were not able in their budget \npresentation to fund existing certificates, the section 8 vouchers, \nbefore we added the incremental, and they asked that $4.2 billion be \ndeferred. In other words, their recommendation to us was $4.2 billion \nless than is needed to renew section 8 vouchers on a full-year basis in \nfiscal year 2000. That ought to demonstrate there is a problem.\n  Let me explain as best as I understand it what the problem is. The \nsection 8 account is one of the most difficult accounts for funding in \nthe bill. Not only would the administration's request for 100,000 new \nincremental vouchers result in an annual cost of almost $600 million \neach year, it does not acknowledge or address the long-term funding \nneeds of this account. Let me be specific. We currently fund some 3 \nmillion section 8 vouchers or assisted living units, as well as 1.5 \nmillion public housing units. Much of the cost of these 3 million units \nis hidden, meaning the annual cost in outlays is some $20 billion. In \nother words, we are paying out this year $20 billion in section 8 \nvouchers. We appropriate around here on budget authority. Most of the \ncosts were accounted for in previous year's budgets when the Congress \napproved long-term 15-year and 20-year section 8 contracts.\n\n  Now, the budget authority was committed in future years, but they \nsaid OK, Congress, you are going to have to pay out all that money each \nyear in outlays. What is even worse, the budget authority requirement \neach year goes up because as contracts expire, we renew contracts on a \nyear-to-year basis. We have to put that budget authority in each year's \nbudget. As these contracts expire, we have to pay for the expiring \ncontracts as an annual recurring cost in the section 8 account.\n  Let me show you a chart. This is how the budget for section 8 has \ngone up. In fiscal year 1997, we only had to appropriate $3.6 billion \nin budget authority to cover the $20 billion or so, almost $20 billion \nin section 8 vouchers. The next year, we had to come up with budget \nauthority of $11.1 billion. In the current year we would have had to \ncome up with $12.8 billion, but we have adopted, because of the tight \nbudget, the administration's proposal to defer $4.2 billion of that \ninto fiscal year 2001.\n  Guess what happens. We are coming into fiscal year 2001 about $8 \nbillion short in budget authority. If we are to fund the existing \ncontracts next year, we are going to have to come up with $8 billion \nmore in budget authority. The news does not get any better. The next \nyear, we would have to come up with $15.6 billion, the next year $17.0 \nbillion, the next fiscal year 2004, $18.2 billion.\n  This year, the administration has requested and we have proposed \ndeferring $4.2 billion. So we took the easy out. The only easy out was \ndeferring that $4.2 billion in budget authority for those portions of \nthe section 8 vouchers which would actually have to be funded, actually \noutlayed in fiscal year 2001.\n  That is confusing. I have worked on it for a long time. I am happy to \nwork with any of my colleagues who have questions about it. With the \nhelp of staff, I think we can explain it. However, we made long-term \ncommitments in budget authority. Each year, we have been spending \noutlays at a very high level. However, we can't get the budget \nauthority to rise to the level needed to maintain those outlays.\n  What is worse, in the HUD budget submitted by OMB--this is their 10-\nyear budget. This is the budget projection they sent us--for this year, \nthey said budget authority is right about what is needed, close to $14 \nbillion. But for the coming year, the next year, they have lowered that \nto $11.3 billion for BA.\n  Here is the BA need creeping up each year. Each year, it increases. \nThe long-term projection of OMB, the President's budget, the budget of \nthe Department of HUD, is to keep that budget authority at a flat level \nof $11.3 billion. What would happen if that occurred? Very simply, 1.3 \nmillion families or elderly or disabled would have to be kicked out of \nsection 8 housing over the 10-year period. We do not have the budget \nauthority, we do not have the funds, to continue supporting those \nresidents who depend upon section 8 housing. That, to me, is a major \nproblem. We have been forced, out of necessity, to defer $4.2 billion \nin section 8 assistance until 2001.\n  While we have adopted this proposal--some would call it a gimmick--\nlet's say, because everybody seems to agree on it, this necessary \nbudget tool for the year 2000, we have done so unwillingly and with the \ngreat concern that this will create a nearly untenable budget hole for \nnext year, 2001, when we have to fund section 8 contract renewals by an \nincrease of some $8 billion, for a total of $14 billion.\n  In fiscal year 2000, some $6.8 billion was needed for section 8 \ncontract renewals, but in 2001 we have to make up the $2.2 billion in \nadvance appropriations. So we are going to have to find some way to get \nan additional $6.8 billion and still defer the budget authority for \noutlays in future years to those future years.\n  I am extremely worried about how HUD is handling this very \ncomplicated and difficult problem. We understand that HUD has \nunderestimated renewal needs for this year and is close to running out \nof section 8 renewal funds. We are very concerned that we will not be \nin this position when that happens next year.\n  The problem is, as I said in my opening statement, that HUD is a \nhigh-risk area designated by the General Accounting Office, the only \nDepartment so designated. HUD's management deficiencies are \nparticularly acute in the section 8 area.\n  Part of the problem is that HUD loses some $900 million per year in \nits public and assisted housing programs due to fraud and abuse in the \ncollection of rent in the assisted housing program. If HUD and its \nagents were able to collect this $900 million, some 135,000-plus \nadditional low-income families could receive section 8 assistance \nannually. That is why we have added $10 million in this budget for the \ninspector general to hire outside professional help to try to identify \nwhere those funds are being lost and to find some means of recovering \nthose because that is a tremendous loss.\n  Let me explain another problem. A major problem with section 8 is, \nwhile section 8 is one of the most important Federal housing programs, \nit is not a panacea for providing affordable housing for low-income \nfamilies. While vouchers do provide choice in housing for low-income \nfamilies, the fair market rent restriction is currently set at the 40th \npercentile of the housing market, and therefore it severely curtails \nhousing choice. As a practical matter, this has created market \ndistortions in the availability of section 8 housing, leaving many low-\nincome assisted families in very-low-income neighborhoods living in \nsubstandard housing.\n  In a number of areas, families with vouchers are unable to use their \nvouchers to obtain affordable housing. I am told in St. Louis County \ntheir public housing authority has to release 100 vouchers to get 50 \nvouchers that are actually used because half the people who are given \nthe vouchers cannot find housing. The lack of choice can also result in \nde facto redlining.\n\n  HUD has also suggested that incremental vouchers will mean the \nconstruction of new low-income housing units. I disagree. There is \nabsolutely no evidence that incremental 1-year section 8 assistance \nwill ever leverage construction funding. When we went from the 15- or \n10-year down to 1-year, we took away the financing incentives and the \nbasis for constructing low-income housing to fulfill section 8 needs.\n  I agree with HUD in that we do not have enough low-income housing \nunits.\n\n[[Page S11236]]\n\n We need to develop a housing production program with deeper targeting \nthan the low-income housing tax credit program. This should be a theme \nin the next Congress. We need to continue to fund HOME and CDBG, which \nare used by communities to provide additional housing. We need the \nadditional funds we put in section 202 housing to build housing for the \nelderly. We need to continue to work with organizations that are \npresent in every State, and which we celebrated in Missouri on Monday \nwith the 100,000th home through the Enterprise Foundation. Enterprise, \nEnlist and others are building affordable homes. Habitat for Humanity \ndoes a great job of rebuilding homes.\n  But, frankly, there are many problems with the availability of \naffordable housing that go far beyond the availability of incremental \nsection 8 vouchers. We have not identified the means to pay for the \nsection 8 vouchers that we have already. Unless and until we do, I fear \nit is a hollow promise, to add incremental vouchers when we cannot \nassure that those people who now have them will be able to continue to \nget the vouchers and continue to get that housing assistance in the \nfuture.\n  I assure you, this committee, and I believe everybody in Congress, \nwants to continue them. We are going to do everything we can to assure \nrenewal, but right now it is a huge financial and budgetary task. We do \nnot have the answers on how we are going to do it. Before we start \nadding incremental housing, I ask that somebody sit down and work with \nus on how we will pay for them next year, the year after, and the year \nafter.\n  We are going to be revisiting this issue frequently on the floor. I \nwanted to give that background so people will know what I am talking \nabout when I say we have a tremendous wave of needs coming in for \nbudget authority for section 8. We do not have the money. There is no \nprojection we are going to get it. Before we continue to increase that \noutyear bow wave, we need to have some assurance we will be able to \nfund it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1778\n\n         (Purpose: To increase funding for lead hazard control)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk which I ask \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1778.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 42, line 12, strike ``$80,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$100,000,000''.\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) There is appropriated out of any money in the \n     Treasury that is not otherwise appropriated for fiscal year \n     2000 for expenses necessary to carry out section 1011 of the \n     Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, \n     $20,000,000.\n       (b) Each amount appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for each program, project, or activity relating to salaries, \n     expenses, and program management under title I, II, or III of \n     this Act (other than this section) that is not required to be \n     appropriated or otherwise made available by a provision of \n     law is reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to reduce \n     the total amounts appropriated for such programs, projects, \n     or activities by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague, Senator Feingold \nfrom Wisconsin, who was here before but graciously allowed me to go \nahead to introduce this amendment.\n  Also, having come to the floor earlier today and not only commended \nChairman Bond and ranking member Mikulski for their valiant efforts to \nreach priorities in very limited financial circumstances, I will \nannounce up front I am going to propose this amendment which would \nincrease lead funding as a means to talk about the issue, but I will \nwithdraw the amendment in recognition of not only the serious efforts \nthe chairman and ranking member have made, but also in recognition that \nlast year when I came to the floor, both Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski were instrumental in increasing the appropriation by $20 \nmillion and, indeed, holding that appropriation at conference. So I am \nvery confident, with their efforts, they will continue to work hard to \nmake sure this remains a critical priority.\n  The problem of lead exposure to children in the United States is \nsomething that I believe is critical, one that we must address. I have \nbeen supported in that opinion by many of my colleagues.\n  Earlier this year, 14 of my colleagues joined me in a letter urging \nthe chairman and the ranking member to do all they can to increase \nappropriations for lead abatement in this appropriations bill. Those \ncolleagues include Senators Jeffords, Specter, Leahy, Lautenberg, \nChafee--my colleague from Rhode Island--Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, \nKerry, Boxer, Kohl, Snowe, Torricelli, and Durbin. All of them from \nacross this country recognize the critical need to eliminate lead \nexposure, particularly with respect to children.\n  But there are two of my colleagues who deserve particular praise. \nSenator Collins and Senator Torricelli are cosponsors of this \namendment. Senator Collins has been a strong and very effective \nadvocate for this program of lead abatement.\n  I was pleased to join her in Providence, RI, several weeks ago for a \nhearing of the Public Health Subcommittee, where we looked at lead \npaint exposure to children in Rhode Island. It was a very good hearing. \nI am pleased to say I will be able to join Senator Collins in Maine in \na few weeks to have a similar hearing.\n  Senator Torricelli and myself have been very active not only with \nrespect to this issue but also with respect to the issue of appropriate \nscreening and treatment for children who have elevated levels of lead \nin their blood systems.\n  I admit that over the last 20 years we have made significant progress \nin our society with respect to exposure to lead principally because we \nhave banned lead paint, we have banned lead solder in food cans, and we \nhave deleaded gasoline. This has resulted in significant reductions.\n  But, nevertheless, nearly a million children enter kindergarten each \nyear with elevated levels of lead in their blood. This is a preventable \nproblem. This is a problem, if it is not prevented, that causes serious \ncognitive development problems with children. This is also a problem \nthat is not exclusive to one part of the country.\n  In fact, if you look at cities across the country, you will see there \nare elevated blood lead levels in children.\n  In Baltimore, for example, there is a lead poisoning rate of 27.9 \npercent. Almost 30 percent of the children who are tested have elevated \nlead levels. In Milwaukee, 22.5 percent; St. Louis, 23 percent; \nChicago, 20.6 percent; Philadelphia, 38 percent; and Memphis, 12.1 \npercent. This is a nationwide problem. The major cause of this exposure \nis lead paint in the homes of these children.\n  Indeed, children who are in low-income circumstances, particularly \nchildren who are living in housing that was constructed before 1974, \nare significantly vulnerable to lead exposure and lead poisoning.\n  More than half the U.S. housing stock was built prior to 1978, so as \na result we have thousands and thousands of units that still contain \nlead paint which is the source of contamination for these young \nchildren.\n  In fact, it has been estimated that 20 million housing units \nthroughout the United States contain hazardous levels of lead paint.\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, it is estimated that about 90,000 \nunits present moderate to high lead paint exposure risks to children \nwho live there.\n  This is a very difficult and expensive problem to deal with. It has \nbeen estimated that to modify and to remediate all these homes in my \nown home State, it would cost about $300 million. To deal with every \nseriously contaminated residential unit in the United States would cost \nsomething on the order of $500 billion. But those costs also must be \nmeasured against the cost of doing nothing, the cost of allowing \nchildren to be exposed to lead paint, and those costs are dramatic and \nsevere.\n  Many educators point to lead paint exposure as one of the reasons why \nspecial education costs are so high. In\n\n[[Page S11237]]\n\nfact, it has been estimated that children with elevated levels of lead \nin their blood are seven times more likely to drop out of school before \nfinishing high school. These costs are significant and severe. I think \nwe have the obligation to try to remedy this problem before these \nchildren are exposed, before their academic, intellectual, and \nemotional development is impaired by exposure to lead.\n  Since 1992, the Office of Lead Hazard Control in HUD has been dealing \nwith this issue, principally through their Lead-Based Paint Hazard \nControl Grant Program. They have been able, since 1993, to provide $435 \nmillion to the States--31 States and the District of Columbia--to deal \nwith this issue.\n  These States have used the money for testing young people for \nexposure, inspecting and testing homes, modifying homes; in fact, to \neven relocate children who are exposed and the home cannot be modified.\n  I have seen the results in Rhode Island.\n  Since 1993, in Rhode Island, we have been able to perform lead \nabatement in more than 500 homes. But it costs money, the kind of \nresources that we need to incorporate in this bill, the kind of \nresources that are necessary to address a problem that spans this \nNation.\n  My amendment would propose an increase of $20 million for the Office \nof Lead Hazard Control. It would be offset by an across-the-board cut \nin salaries, expenses, and other program management budget items in the \nHUD budget.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1778, Withdrawn\n\n  Recognizing the severe constraints that the chairman and the ranking \nmember are laboring under, recognizing the fact they are already \ndemonstrating a commitment to provide for these resources, I withdraw \nthis amendment in the hopes that as we go to conference, under the \nleadership of Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, we can find additional \nresources to address this extremely important and critical issue that \naffects the health and welfare of our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. REED. I again thank the chairman and the ranking member and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11237-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11237-S11251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FEDERAL DAIRY POLICY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss possible \nlegislation that would devastate family dairy farmers throughout the \nUpper Midwest.\n  I understand that the Agriculture appropriations conference committee \nmay report a bill that contains poison pill dairy amendment that \nthreaten the livelihood of dairy farmers throughout the United States.\n  I call them poison pills because they threaten to scuttle the entire \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  It is my duty to my constituents as a Senator from the great dairy \nState of Wisconsin to make my colleagues aware of these possible \nactions, and their insidious effects on America's dairy industry, and \nthe effect they may have on our ability to move legislation in these \nwaning days of the 104th Congress.\n  Our current system is hopelessly out-of-date, and completely out-of-\ntouch with reality. Fortunately for our farmers--and I am grateful for \nthis--the USDA has proposed a rule that would begin to modernize our \nantiquated system.\n  According to the Secretary of Agriculture, the new system ``more \naccurately reflects the current market condition, is fairer to farmers \nand consumers alike, modernizes and reforms an antiquated system sorely \nin need of streamlining and revision.''\n  In fact, according to the USDA, dairy farmers would have earned 87 \ncents per hundredweight more for Class I milk under USDA's reforms than \nunder the current system.\n  For 60 years, America's dairy policy has both imposed higher costs on \ntaxpayers and consumers, and at the same time destroyed tens of \nthousands of family farms.\n  This destructive policy has to go. We need to restore equality to \nmilk pricing, stop regional bickering, and work to ensure that all of \nour Nation's dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk. My message \nis simple: our Federal dairy policy is hopelessly out of date, \nfundamentally unfair, and in dire need of reform.\n  Congress created the current Federal dairy policy 60 years ago when \nthe upper Midwest was seen as the primary producer of fluid milk. \nDuring the Great Depression, many worried that consumers in other parts \nof the country, including young children, did not have access to fresh \nmilk because of inadequate refrigeration and transportation technology.\n\n  To address these concerns, Congress at that time set up the so-called \nEau Claire system, under which producers were reimbursed according to \ntheir distance from the small town--I shouldn't say small town; it is a \npretty good-size town for Wisconsin--the great town of Eau Claire, WI, \nin my home State. It is a little unfair to call this the Eau Claire \nsystem because it is a lousy system and Eau Claire is a great town. I \nlike calling it the anti-Eau Claire system. My daughter is happily \nensconced at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire, a huge fan of \nEau Claire. But it is generally called the Eau Claire system. So be it.\n  This is how it works. The farther away a farmer lives from Eau \nClaire, WI, the more he receives for his fluid milk. Under this system, \nEau Claire, WI, geographically, is ground zero when the fallout of \nartificially low prices lands most harshly on Wisconsin dairy farmers \nand their neighbors in the upper Midwest.\n  Back in the days of the Great Depression, apparently this system \nseemed to be a great idea. But like delivery in old metal milk cans, \nthe current system is obsolete, failing to meet the needs of either \nproducers or consumers. Six decades ago, the poor condition of \nAmerica's infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration \ntechnology prevented upper Midwest producers from shipping their fresh \nmilk to other parts of the country. In order to ensure an adequate milk \nsupply in distant regions, Congress authorized higher fluid milk prices \noutside the upper Midwest. These higher prices are referred to as class \nI differentials. Let's take a look at how this system rewards producers \nin different parts of the country.\n  This chart illustrates the class I differential received by dairy \nfarmers throughout the United States. In Eau Claire, WI, the class I \ndifferential is $1.20 per hundredweight. You will notice that it is \n$1.40 in Chicago. It is $1.92 in Kansas City, MO, and $3.08 in \nCharlotte, NC. Our friends in Florida receive $3.58 in Tallahassee and \n$4.18 per hundredweight in Miami for the exact same amount of milk that \nwe produce in Wisconsin. So class I differentials are an arbitrary \nmeasure of the cost of milk production.\n  In fact, in recent years, when our dairy farmers have tried to sell \ntheir milk in Chicago--in Chicago, a very close distance to Eau Claire \nand the other Wisconsin communities compared to other places in the \ncountry--when they have tried to sell their milk in Chicago, they have \nbeen beaten out of that market by milk from the South and the \nSouthwest. That is a sign of an archaic system. This archaic system was \ndesigned to make these regions produce milk for their own needs so \nchildren in Texas could have fresh milk, not so their producers could \nunfairly compete against Wisconsin dairy farmers in Chicago. \nUnfortunately, this system worked too well. The chief result of this \nsystem, the only real result of this system, as far as I am concerned, \nis that our Midwestern farmers are now subsidizing farmers in the \nSoutheast and in the Northeast through these higher class I \ndifferentials.\n  Of course, a great deal has changed since the creation of the current \nsystem. We can now easily and safely transport perishable milk and \ncheese products between the States and throughout the country. The \nindustry has perfected the system to such a degree that we can export \ncheese to countries all over the world. It seems almost comical that in \nan age when you can order milk through the Internet, our Federal milk \npricing system continues to be based on an irrelevant factor. That \nfactor, again, is a producer's distance from this wonderful Wisconsin \ncommunity of Eau Claire, WI. That is what this whole thing is based on, \nhow far the farmer is from Eau Claire, WI.\n\n  Unfortunately, the current system's effects on farming communities \nare\n\n[[Page S11238]]\n\nanything but common. The current milk pricing system has been putting \nfamily dairy farms out of business at an alarming rate. Since 1980, my \nhome State of Wisconsin has sadly lost nearly one-half of its dairy \nfarms. This isn't starting with 2,000 or 3,000 dairy farmers. This is \nstarting with 45,000-plus dairy farmers. We are below 25,000 now. That \nis since 1980 that we have experienced that kind of loss.\n  The trend is accelerating. Between 1990 and 1998, in those 8 to 9 \nyears, Wisconsin lost 11,000 dairy farmers. So the overwhelming message \nI hear from family dairy farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota and \nthroughout the Midwest is that we need milk marketing order reforms. We \ndesperately need a new dairy policy, one that does not arbitrarily \npenalize the Midwest and devastate the small farmer. We must replace \nthis outdated Depression-era system with a new policy that ensures our \nNation's dairy farmers get a fair price for their milk.\n  Ironically, one of the few changes, one of the only changes, we have \nhad at all to Federal dairy policy over the last 60 years has \naccelerated the attack on small farmers. It has made it worse. Of \ncourse, I am referring to the now infamous Northeast Dairy Compact.\n  During the consideration of the 1996 farm bill, Congress sought to \nmake changes in the unjust Federal pricing system by phasing out the \nmilk price support program and reducing the inequities between the \nregions. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Unfortunately, because of \nbackdoor politicking during the eleventh hour of the conference \ncommittee, America's dairy farmers were stuck with the devastatingly \nharmful Northeast Dairy Compact. It could happen again. The temporary \nfix of the compact may yet be extended again. We in the upper Midwest \ncannot stand for that or any change that further disadvantages our \ndairy farmers, the ones who are left, not the over 20,000 who are gone \nbut the less than 25,000 who remain. We are determined to keep them in \nbusiness.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact accentuates the current system's \ninequities by authorizing six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New \nHampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--to establish a \nminimum price for fluid milk, higher even than those established under \nthe Federal milk marketing order. The compact not only allows these six \nStates to set artificially high prices for their producers, it permits \nthem to block entry of lower-priced milk from producers in competing \nStates. Further distorting the markets are subsidies given to \nprocessors in these six States to export their higher-priced milk to \nnoncompact States.\n  Despite what some have argued, the Northeast Dairy Compact doesn't \neven help small Northeast farmers. Since the Northeast first \nimplemented its compact in 1997, small dairy farms in the Northeast, \nwhere this is supposed to help, have gone out of business at a rate of \n41 percent higher than they had in the previous 2 years--41 percent \nhigher. In fact, compacts often amount to a transfer of wealth to large \nfarms by affording large farms a per-farm subsidy that is actually 20 \ntimes greater than the meager subsidy given to small farmers.\n  Fortunately for America's dairy farmers, the 1996 farm bill also \nincluded language requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nreplace the current depression-era milk pricing system with a much \nsimpler regulatory plan. After 3\\1/2\\ years of study and thousands of \ncomments from America's dairy farmers, the USDA published a final rule \nthat consolidates the complex web of Federal milk marketing orders and \nalso reforms the price of class I milk.\n  Mr. President, 59,000 dairy farmers--59,000--participated in a recent \nreferendum, and over 96 percent of them voted in favor of USDA's final \nruling.\n  While the USDA's reforms are a welcome improvement, they are only a \nmodest first step in improving the current system.\n  Let's take a look, then, at the final rule's effect on the different \nmilk marketing orders. This chart illustrates the producer class I \nbenefits under the current system, and the USDA's Federal milk \nmarketing order rule. This benefit simply multiplies the class I \ndifferential with the utilization rate, or the percentage of class I \nmilk produced in that region. As you can see, upper Midwest producers \nwill continue to get the short end of the stick. They will receive a \n38-cent-per-hundredweight benefit under the new rule. In contrast, \nNortheast producers will continue to receive a high per hundredweight \nbenefit of $1.20, and producers in Florida will receive a whopping \n$3.95 per hundredweight class I benefit.\n  Unless we follow-up on these reforms and lower the class I \ndifferentials, we will continue to lose small dairy farms throughout \nthe United States. Loss of these farms has already devastated rural \nAmerica for far too long, especially in the upper Midwest.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, our Nation's dairy farmers are not out \nof the woods yet. Some in Congress believe that they know better than \nAmerica's dairy farmers and wish to prevent these moderate reforms, or \nto circumvent the entire rulemaking process altogether. Who in this \nCongress knows more about dairy farming than 96 percent of America's \ndairy farmers?\n  As Congress considers any future dairy reforms, I urge my colleagues \nto recognize the national nature of milk marketing, the corrosiveness \nof artificial regional pricing schemes, and the need for comprehensive \nreforms. We must recognize the inequalities inherent in our current \nsystem and work to ensure that our Nation's dairy farmers get a fair \nprice for their milk.\n  If Congress does not act quickly, our Nation's family dairy farms \nwill continue to suffer. Let me be clear. I will use every means \navailable to a Senator to ensure that these necessary reforms go \nforward and that compacts do not. America's dairy farmers deserve \nnothing less.\n  After all, approving USDA's final rule is a moderate first step to \narresting the devastating effects of the current Federal milk marketing \norder system.\n  Dairy compacts are simply no way to legislate a national dairy \npolicy. I would like to make my colleagues aware of some of the effects \nthe dairy compacts can have on consumers and taxpayers.\n  Let me begin by citing from an article called ``Dairy Compacts A Sour \nDeal For All U.S. Farmers.'' The sub-headline is, ``The Agreements \nThreaten to Undermine Export Growth For The Rest Of American \nAgriculture,'' by Dennis T. Avery, of the Hudson Institute. It says:\n\n       Enthusiasm for ``dairy compacts'' is sweeping America. \n     Nearly 30 states now seem likely to pass legislation for such \n     compacts, which are designed to bar dairy products from \n     outside a state or region.\n       The U.S. government has already authorized such a dairy \n     compact for New England, and dairy farmers recently staged a \n     Washington fly-in to rally congressional support for \n     expanding the concept.\n       Supporters of these compacts are trying to recreate a dairy \n     industry of price supports and supply management. Such a \n     vision is incompatible with reducing tariffs on other farm \n     commodities or ending Europe's price-depressing export \n     subsidies.\n       Europe dumps huge amounts of dairy products, along with \n     wheat, foodstuffs and meat, onto the world market at prices \n     far below cost, depressing world markets.\n       U.S. dairy compacts threaten to undermine export growth for \n     the rest of American agriculture and fly in the face of \n     liberalizing farm trade.\n       Free farm trade can't be arranged one commodity at a time. \n     What U.S. dairy farmers are considering could limit the \n     potential for lowering trade barriers on beef, pork, corn, \n     wheat, soybeans and poultry.\n       Although dairy farmers have never seen themselves as \n     exporters, perhaps they should start. After all, this is an \n     era of high-value cheese markets, chilled concentrated and \n     ultra-heat-treated milk, and rising demand in industrializing \n     countries like India.\n       Moreover, South Korea's bonds have regained investment \n     status, after a year of being classified as lower-rated \n     ``junk bonds.'' Over the next three years the South Koreans \n     will lead a parade of Asian countries back into the realm of \n     economic growth.\n       At the moment, however, dairy farmers are willing to write \n     off export markets. Producers of other commodities can't do \n     that--exports are their only path to prosperity.\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to make my colleagues aware of the effects \non consumers and taxpayers. The Washington Post said it well in an \nApril 6, 1999, editorial entitled ``The Price of Milk'':\n\n       The government sets the price of milk in this country. \n     That's not all bad. Prices are somewhat higher than they \n     would be if left to the market, and some inefficient dairy \n     farmers are kept in business. But supplies of the perishable \n     product are adequate, and small producers are protected \n     against what\n\n[[Page S11239]]\n\n     otherwise might be the predatory and harmful tactics of large \n     buyers.\n       Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has just completed a \n     congressionally required review of the system whereby the \n     government plays God in the market. He has proposed some \n     changes that would rationalize it in certain respects. But he \n     has found the basic balance between the interests of \n     producers and consumers about right. There may be a lesson in \n     that as Congress struggles with the question of how much to \n     support the prices of other commodities or the incomes of \n     their producers.\n       In the 1996 farm bill, a new Republican Congress acted \n     according to conviction, and against political interest as \n     conventionally defined, to put farm supports on a declining \n     path. The theory was that if farmers grew for the market \n     rather than for the government, they and the consuming public \n     alike would be better off. The rollback worked well for a \n     couple of years, while prices and supports were both still \n     high. Now, both have fallen, and even some sponsors of the \n     legislation, if not quite wondering whether they went too \n     far, are busily seeking extra aid.\n       Compelling points can be made on both sides of this \n     argument. The economists are right that artificial price \n     supports are costly in that they shelter inefficient \n     producers. But supports when not excessive also protect \n     against swings in price and production that can harm \n     consumers and producers alike. Costs are involved in going \n     too far in either direction.\n       That's more or less where Mr. Glickman came out on milk. \n     There was a fight about milk marketing orders in the context \n     of the 1996 bill. Midwesterners thought--still think--that \n     their region is disadvantaged by the system in that their \n     efficient dairymen could undersell producers in competing \n     regions were it not for the artificially high minimum prices \n     that the marketing orders impose. They wanted to abolish the \n     system unless it was radically reformed in their favor. \n     Congressmen from less efficient areas were equally determined \n     to preserve it, even members who in other contexts were \n     devout free-marketeers. In the end the two sides compromised \n     by booting the issue to the secretary.\n       Mr. Glickman has proposed modernizing the inherited system \n     in a number of respects, particularly with regard to the \n     price differentials between various regions. On average, he \n     would lower the price of milk by a couple of cents a gallon. \n     But in general he would support the system as fair to both \n     buyers and sellers of milk. If supports should not be \n     excessive, neither should they be so low as to leave both \n     sides in the milk transaction total prey to the market. That \n     may not be an intellectually elegant standard, but it's \n     probably right.\n\n  The dairy industry is an integral part of our Nation's culture in \nhistory.\n  Let's take a look at that role, if we can.\n  Before I do that, let me quote briefly from the New York Times \narticle from Sunday, April 11.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will yield for a question without \nrelinquishing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, for those of us who are trying to bring up \namendments on this bill, will the Senator, perhaps, give us an idea of \nhow long he might proceed?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am not certain how long I will be \nproceeding at this point. It will be for a while.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the New York Times has written a piece \nabout ``Bringing Markets To Milk,'' ``A Pricing Policy Was Confusing. \nIt Still Is,'' by Mr. Weinstein. I would like to read some portions of \nthat. He writes:\n       Ponder a perverse question: What public policies would \n     pummel the poor? Here is one answer: Impose a levy that falls \n     more heavily on them than on the rich, singling out a staple \n     in the diet of poor families and driving up its price.\n       No one would seriously entertain such an idea--no one, that \n     is, except members of Congress.\n       Federal milk-pricing rules dating from the 1930's drive up \n     the price that consumers pay for milk, in effect taking money \n     from urban parents, among others, and handing it over to \n     rural dairy farmers.\n       Proponents say the rules stabilize milk prices, thereby \n     assuring reliable supplies across the country. But opponents \n     say the system is archaic, Byzantine and unnecessary--a \n     giveaway to the dairy farm lobby. And it's regressive: poor \n     families spend about twice as much of their income on milk as \n     do other families, on average.\n       Consumer advocates took heart three years ago when Congress \n     told the Agriculture Department to improve the program. But \n     their hopes were dashed recently when the department released \n     its proposals, scheduled to go into effect on Oct. 1.\n       The new rules, the department said, would be ``simpler, \n     more market-oriented.'' But rather than taking a mallet to \n     the program, the department wielded a toothpick. John M. \n     Schnittker, an economist at Public Voice for Food and Health \n     Policy, a nonprofit research group in Washington that plans \n     to merge with the Consumer Federation of America, estimates \n     that the current program raises the cost of milk an average \n     of 18 cents a gallon. The department says its plan will cut \n     prices by about 2 cents--a trim Mr. Schnittker calls ``almost \n     an insult.''\n       The current rules impose a complex set of minimum prices \n     that processors are requited to pay farmers in each of the 31 \n     marketing regions.\n       The department starts by setting a base price for milk used \n     in the manufacture of products like cheese from a survey of \n     prices in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Then it tacks on \n     additional charges, mostly reflecting location, to set the \n     minimum price for so-called fluid milk.\n       Kenneth C. Clayton, deputy administrator of the agency that \n     runs the system, says the controls stop milk prices from \n     gyrating wildly and make sure that milk flows from areas \n     where there are surplus supplies, like upstate New York and \n     Wisconsin, to areas where there is scarcity, like Boston and \n     Chicago.\n       But he concedes that those flows would occur without \n     Government guidance. What the rules do, he says, is ``divide \n     up the pie--insuring that dairy farmers capture more of the \n     dollar that consumers pay to processors.'' Another set of \n     complex rules dictates how the processors' payments are \n     divided among farmers.\n       Many economists challenge Mr. Clayton's benign \n     interpretation. Processors operate in reasonably competitive \n     markets, the economists say, so if they are forced to pay \n     more for milk, they have little choice but to pass on the \n     added cost to customers. Mr. Schnittker points to studies \n     that show consumer prices rising along with Government-\n     imposed charges on processors.\n       He also challenges another rationale for the milk-pricing \n     rules: Preservation of the family farmer. ``Two-thirds of \n     milk production comes from only about a quarter of the \n     nation's dairy farmers,'' he said. ``The milk-pricing rules \n     overwhelmingly line the pockets of mega dairy farms.''\n       The government's overhaul would simplify things by \n     collapsing the 31 regions into 11. But it would also make the \n     system more complicated, by setting the base price for milk \n     use in manufactured products according to surveys around the \n     country, rather than just the Midwest, and by adjusting the \n     price to take into account the milk's protein content and \n     other qualities using complex mathematical formulas.\n       Add charges to take account of location and some transition \n     rules, and out come 600-plus pages of regulations. Some \n     economists suggest that the rule-making would fit comfortably \n     in the playbook of the former Soviet Union.\n       And though the proposal would bring down average milk \n     prices a small amount, it would leave most of the high prices \n     intact. Indeed, the proposal would actually raise the minimum \n     price in some places, like Chicago, a decision more political \n     than economic.\n       Critics point out that this is not the first time the \n     Agriculture Department has sided with dairy farmers over \n     consumers. It also approved the creation of a dairy cartel \n     among farmers in the Northeast that blocks low-price imports. \n     Milk prices in New England rose about 20 cents a gallon after \n     the compact went into effect in July 1997.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will yield without relinquishing my \nright to the floor for a question.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, recognizing the right of the Senator to \ncontinue to hold the floor, we are trying to figure out how we are \ngoing to manage the VA-HUD bill, which was the pending business until \nwe yielded for the Senator's unanimous consent. Would the Senator share \nwith me approximately how long he will continue to speak so we can \norganize our other speakers and amendments?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the answer to the question is, I intend \nto speak for a fair amount of time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the operational definition of that?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that may be determined more by factors \nthat I can't control than my own intentions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the Senator talking about--5 minutes or 5 \nhours?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Somewhere in between, probably.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Senator, I really do need senatorial courtesy because \nthere are 99 other Senators trying to figure out what we are going to \ndo with the rest of the evening. If the Senator would just share that \nwith me, if the Senator wants to talk 5 hours, that is his business. If \nhe wants to talk 10 hours, that is his business. But the pending VA-HUD \nbill is my business.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. My pending business that I think needs to be addressed \nby the Senate and the Congress is the outrageous treatment of Wisconsin \ndairy farmers.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator not going to answer my question?\n\n[[Page S11240]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my answer to the Senator's question is \nthat this needs to be addressed, and that is why I am here.\n  Mr. President, I have the floor, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, since the question has been raised, I \nthink it is time to review what has happened on the floor of the Senate \nand in the Congress on this issue in the past.\n  What has happened on this issue is that we have fought this battle \nfair and square in the Senate, won the battle, and then every time we \nget to conference committee, somehow the will of this body is undone. \nIn 1996, we had the only rollcall vote on the issue of the New England \nDairy Compact, the Northeast Dairy Compact. I remember staying up until \nlate at night lobbying Members, and we had a vote fair and square on \nwhether or not we were going to set up this actually absurd notion of a \nNew England Dairy Compact.\n  So what did we do? We won the vote fair and square. I think it was \nsomething like 50-46. I remember the wonderful help and support I \nreceived from the distinguished majority leader at the time, Senator \nDole, in feeling it was a tough battle--one of these tough inter-\nregional battles--not a Republican or Democrat issue but that we had \nwon fair and square. The House had not voted on the issue, but then \nthey go over to the conference committee, and in the middle of the \nnight, without any basis from the action of either House, they just \nstick in the conference committee the idea that the Secretary of \nAgriculture could create a region in New England that would establish \nan artificially high price for milk for only one part of the country to \nthe disadvantage of farmers everywhere else.\n  That is how we got here. This was part of the so-called Freedom to \nFarm Act.\n  We had hopes that the Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, for \nwhom I have great regard and have enjoyed working with, would \nunderstand what a mistake it would be to create this compact in the \nfirst place. We did everything we could to persuade him not to go down \nthis road--that it wouldn't make sense; that it wouldn't save \nnortheastern dairy farmers; that it wouldn't help consumers, and, in \nfact, would hurt consumers; that it would drive up production \nartificially in a way that would reduce prices for dairy farmers. I \nbelieve that is exactly what happened.\n\n  Secretary Glickman is a bright guy, and he has an open mind. He \nwatched this for a year and a half. He concluded that the New England \nDairy Compact was not a good idea and proposed, along with his \nsuggestions on changing the milk marketing order system, that we not \nhave it anymore, that it expire.\n  We pointed out on the floor of the Senate on many occasions how this \nnotion of a dairy compact, a regional economy for milk, could be \napplied in other situations. Perhaps we should say all the maple syrup \nin Vermont and States in that region should be sold, bought, and \nconsumed in that one area and not exported to the rest of the country. \nOthers have said we could do the same thing with blueberries. There \nwould be a southern or Georgia peanut region, and all the peanuts grown \nthere would have to be sold and consumed there. There would be an \nartificially high price for peanuts there but not anywhere else. Others \ncarried it further. Since we associate the great city of Seattle, the \nState of Washington, with computers, why not have computers sold in the \nNorthwest?\n  I found even more interesting the notion that country music should \nonly be marketed in States such as Tennessee and Kentucky. I happen to \nbe a fan of country music, so I find that troubling, although some of \nmy younger staffers would be delighted if we had that kind of \nlimitation on country music. I don't think they like it.\n  That is what this is, an artificial corruption of what should be a \nnational dairy system. I don't mean corruption in the sense of \nimpropriety; I mean in the sense of undercutting the notion of free \nenterprise in which the dairy industry should be able to participate. \nThe Secretary reviewed it, and he concluded we shouldn't have this \nanymore.\n  There has been an effort on the Senate floor and throughout the \nsummer on and off to attach the New England Dairy Compact to other \nbills, including the agricultural appropriations bill. It was a hard \nfought battle. I give credit to those who want to preserve the New \nEngland Dairy Compact for their willingness to continue and to fight \nfor their cause. They thought they were going to have 60 votes. They \nthought they had the votes to force this on to the bill. They did not, \nfrankly, come very close at all. As I recall, they came some seven \nvotes short of the goal rather than one or two.\n  It was a decisive statement that made many in Wisconsin hope that \nfinally, instead of just the politics of this, people would listen to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture and realize this was not a good idea. We \nfigured it was done. We knew we couldn't be sure because of what was \ndone in 1996 in the conference committee. But we had hopes that this \nwould not happen again. However, this is, unfortunately, now what is \nhappening or what we fear could be happening.\n  In the conference committee, which I had a chance to observe last \nweek for a while, there is a real possibility that the Secretary's \nreasonable recommendations to modify to some extent the milk marketing \norder systems and to discontinue the Northeastern Dairy Compact--those \nitems may be reversed and placed in the agricultural appropriations \nbill even though there has been no vote in the Senate or in the House \nto continue the dairy compact.\n  Although I certainly regret having to come to the floor and proceed \nin this manner, I essentially have no choice. My farmers expect me to \ncome to Washington and fight for their rights. It won fair and square \non the floor. Yet somehow in conference committee these fair votes are \ntaken away. Once again, as has been the case over and over again, dairy \nfarmers in the upper Midwest are given the short end of the stick. It \nis only because these mistakes were made in terms of putting this \ncompact together. Even the person who approved them, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, now sees it was not a very good idea and should be \ndiscontinued.\n  I say to the Senators whose bill is up--and it is an important piece \nof legislation--it is a matter of what is going on in the conference \ncommittee now that forces me to come to the floor and explain in more \ndetail to my colleagues just what is at stake. I don't know how many \ntimes I will repeat this. I have already mentioned it. We had over \n45,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin around 1980. Only about 19 years \nlater, we have fewer than 25,000. That is a huge loss not only of a way \nof life but of an economic base in our State. It is a tragedy for our \nState to have this trend continue.\n  Let me discuss a bit about the way the dairy industry is an integral \npart of our Nation's culture and history. We will look at that role.\n  Cheese, unlike its ancient cousin, yogurt, is not a novel food to \nAmericans. It came over to America with the earliest settlers who made \nCheddar cheese in their own homes.\n  Like yogurt, though, the popularity of cheese has been steadily \ngrowing. One of the most natural and oldest of food products, dating \nback to the domestication of animals, about 9000 B.C., cheese was once \nso highly esteemed it was even used as a medium of exchange. It \ntraveled with Greeks, the Romans and with the armies of Genghis Khan. \nDuring the Middle Ages, monks in the French monasteries developed a \nsoft-ripened cheese, starting a cheese renaissance. Centuries later, in \n1851, Jesse Williams built the first commercial cheese factory in \nAmerica. Herkimer, in upstate New York, grew into the cheese center of \nthe United States until the westward expansion of the country resulted \nin Wisconsin gradually exceeding New York in total annual production. \nAs pioneer wagons moved west, boats continued to carry others from \nacross the ocean. The immigrants introduced their own favorite cheeses \nto America and contributed to the ``melting (cheese) pot.''\n  As the number of cheeses available in the United States has enlarged, \nso has the consumer demand. The consumption of cheese in 1975 was 14.2 \npounds per person compared to 9.1 pounds in 1965.\n  Natural cheese is a product of milk that has been heated, pressed, \nand cured. In the United States, cheese is made from pasteurized cow's \nmilk.\n\n[[Page S11241]]\n\nWhile milk is generally used except for some varieties such as cottage \ncheese which uses skim milk. When milk is heated, usually with a \nstarter of some kind, rennet or bacterial culture, it separates into \nsoft curd and liquid whey.\n  After the milk has been heated, but before it has started to ripen, \nthe soft curd may be separated from the whey and with some additional \ntreatment made into a fresh natural unripened cheese.\n  Unripened cheeses contain relatively high moisture and do not undergo \nany curing or ripening. They are sold fresh and should be used within a \nfew days after purchase. The gjetost and primost, however, because they \ncontain very low moisture, may be kept refrigerated for several weeks \nor even months.\n  Cottage cheese, is low calorie cheese, is made in different sized \ncurds. The small-curd type is usually used in salads because it holds \nits shape better than the larger curds which are suitable for all other \npurposes. To prepare creamed cottage cheese, fresh cream is mixed with \nthe curd to give it additional moisture and flavor.\n  Cream cheese is of American origin and is one of our most popular \nsoft cheeses. It is a mixture of milk and cream that is coagulated but \nunripened.\n  Unripened cheese may also be divided into soft or firm types.\n  Cream cheese and cottage cheese are examples of a soft unripened \ncheese. An example of firm unripened cheese is mozzarella.\n  To make natural ripened cheese, the soft curd is taken from the \nliquid whey and then cured by holding it at a certain temperature and \nhumidity for a specified period of time.\n  Natural ripened cheeses may also be classified according to their \ndegree of hardness. Authorities generally group natural cheese into \nfour distinct groups of hardness: soft, semi-soft, firm, and very hard. \nHardness has to do with moisture. The older the cheese, the lower its \nmoisture content.\n  Brie and Camembert, both of which originated in France, are ripened \nby mold. The curd is not cut nor is it pressed. Cheese lovers all over \nthe world hold these two cheeses in the highest of esteem.\n  Brie is considered to be the Queen of Cheeses. There are probably \nmore literary references to Brie than to any other cheese. Its \ndescriptions are often accompanied by superlatives but it is a \ndifficult cheese to buy satisfactorily because it goes from under \nripened to over ripened in a matter of a few days.\n  It is at its peak when it has a consistency of a heavy slow-pouring \nliquid and a yellow sheen. Under ripe Brie is flaky and chalky. \nOverripe Brie is very soft and has an off-order like ammonia.\n  Camembert is a popular cheese in France and is widely known in the \nUnited States. It has as devoted a following as Brie and also the same \nephemeral quality of being ripe for only a very short time.\n  Limburger and Liederkranz are examples of bacteria-ripened cheeses. \nThe different bacteria used in the ripening process are responsible for \ntheir characteristic flavor and odor.\n  Included in this category are the blue-veined cheeses. There are now \nover fifty varieties of blue cheeses made all over the world. However, \nthe best known and most highly prized are Roquefort, Stiliton, and \nGorgonzola.\n  Blue cheeses are called the ``king of cheeses.'' They are made from \ncow's milk. Roquefort is the exception. It is made from sheep's milk \nand is cured in the cool damp caves of southwestern France.\n  Bel Paese is a popular, all purpose cheese made in Italy and under \nlicense in the United States--Wisconsin, of course. It is a table \ncheese as well as cooking cheese.\n  Brick is an original American Cheese whose name derives from either \nthe shape of the cheese or, perhaps, from the brick originally used in \npressing the curd. It is softer than Cheddar and less sharp. It is a \nstrong cheese, but not as strong as Limburger.\n  Muenster, as made in France where it is very popular, is strong \ncheese. It is used as table cheese. However, the American kind is much \nmore bland and is suitable for cooking as well as for a table cheese.\n  Port du Salut originated in a Trappist monastery in France. The \nFrench import is usually mellow with a slight edge.\n  The hard or firm cheese list includes the two most popular cheeses in \nthe United States, Cheddar and Swiss.\n  Cheddar cheese accounts for almost half of all the cheese consumed in \nAmerica. It ranges from a very mild cheese to a very sharp one \ndepending upon how long it's been aged. A versatile cheese, suitable \nfor most cheese dishes, it melts well.\n  Canadian Cheddar is imported into the United States, but English \nCheddar, by law, is not. The English relative to Cheddar, the famous \nCheshire is imported.\n  More American Cheddar cheese is made in Wisconsin than any other \nstate. There are variations to different kinds of cheese. Colby is \nprimarily made in the Midwest while Monterey (Jack) and Tillamook is \nprocessed on the West Coast. Colby is not as compressed as the other \ncheddars and it has a higher moisture content. Monterey is also a \nmilder cheddar and has a higher moisture content. There is a more aged \nMonterey called ``dry Monterey'' that can be used for grating.\n  A large amount of Cheddar cheese sold in the United States is sold as \nprocessed American cheese.\n  Provolone and Cacciocavalle are spun cheeses. The curd is placed in \neither hot water or hot whey and then stretched into its desired shape \nor size. They are an important ingredient in Italian cooking. The \nProvolone is usually smoked.\n  The Edam and Gouda cheeses are the most popular cheeses imported from \nthe Netherlands. Similar in flavor, the Edam is made from partly skim \nmilk and the Gouda from whole milk.\n  In the category of very hard cheeses, Parmesan has a mild to sharp \npiquant flavor and is famous as a seasoning in cooking. It has the \nnatural ability of enhancing the flavor of foods. The imported Italian \nParmesan is a highly prized cheese and is used as a table cheese as \nwell as for seasoning. The domestic varieties are primarily grated for \nseasoning and for cooking.\n  Romano is a sharper cheese than Parmesan. In Italy it is usually made \nfrom sheep's milk instead of from cow's milk. It is primarily a grating \ncheese but the less sharp cheese may be used as a table cheese. The \ndomestic variety is primarily a grating cheese.\n  Sap Sago is a grating cheese from Switzerland to which has been added \ndried clover. It is made by mixing whey and skim cow's milk.\n  I would like to say a little more about the process of making \ncheeses, butter, cream, and yogurt at home.\n  Although animals have been milked by man almost from the dawn of \ncivilization, there are Egyptian paintings showing cattle being milked \naround 2000 B.C., the use of liquid milk was almost unknown until \ncomparatively recently.\n  Until the beginning of the 17th century, milk drinking was considered \nquite injurious to health and, in view of the low standards of dairy \nhygiene, the incidence of cattle plague, and the fact that milk \ncontained dangerous pathogenic factors, especially the germs of \ntuberculosis and typhoid, this was probably right at the time.\n  It reminds me of a dairy farmer who came to see me after I was \nelected to the Senate. I met him in the reception area outside the \nChamber. He told me he was going over to some of the former Soviet \nRepublics to try to help farmers there learn some of the skills we have \nin dairy farming. He told me his goal was to make sure that the milk in \none of these former Soviet Republics could not walk to the market by \nitself. I understood what he was saying. If you do not do this right, \nas we do in America, in Wisconsin, then we have to be concerned. That \nis one of the reasons milk might have gotten off to sort of a slow \nstart in some of these countries, given the risks.\n  The fact is, many children died of tuberculosis of bovine origin up \nuntil the late 19th century. It was not until the 1930s, when \npasteurization and refrigeration of milk became accepted, and when \nconcentrated efforts were inaugurated to eradicate the disease of \nbovine tuberculosis, that milk became safe and acceptable. I can tell \nyou, growing up in Janesville, WI, we were taught about pasteurization \nas one of the most important events in human history. When you are from \nWisconsin, that is a big deal, as it is almost anywhere.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S11242]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Without yielding my right to the floor, I am happy to \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I heard the Senator earlier talking about what is going on \nin the conference committee now, dealing with agricultural \nappropriations. The Senator talked about the Northeast Dairy Compact. \nAs mentioned, we had a full and open debate, had a floor vote, and were \nable to defeat the compact--as we did 2 years ago, by the way. Also, we \ntalked about farmers across the country, dairy farmers, recently voting \nfor a compromise on milk marketing orders, the new orders that were put \nout by the USDA. It was not everything everybody wanted, but it was a \ncompromise between the 1-B and the 1-A. But now we find out again, as \nhappened in 1997, people are working actively inside the conference to \ntry to insert language to basically overturn those issues that have had \nwidespread solid support, both among the dairy farmers across the \ncountry and also Members on the floor of the Senate.\n  I was wondering why is this going on in the conference, in the \nSenator's opinion?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his question. I \nnote the presence of the senior Senator from Minnesota. Minnesota has \nfewer dairy farmers than Wisconsin, but it has a whole lot. Together, \nour two States comprise a tremendous percentage of dairy production in \nthe country. We are adamant in this effort to try to stop what the \nSenator from Minnesota correctly points out is the same old trick. We \nwon fair and square in 1997. There was not a vote in the House. They \ndid not have a vote: should we have a New England Dairy Compact or \nnot. We did. It was a tough vote.\n\n  I tell you, this is a tough issue, a hard issue. One thing I like \nabout it is that it is not about Republicans versus Democrats. It is \none of those rare times when everyone in the body is open to be for \nsomething not based on their party but based on what is best for their \narea and what is best for the country.\n  So we had quite a debate. We all worked together on it. As I pointed \nout earlier, it was a close vote, but we won--I hope I am not given the \nwrong number--I think with roughly a 50-46 bipartisan vote where we \nvoted not to have the compact. It went to conference.\n  I was in the State legislature in Wisconsin for 10 years. We had \nconference committees. They were often not the most attractive moments, \nof course, as things that go on in conference committees get a little \nrough. But there was a basic understanding that unless there was some \nbasis from one house or the other for the outcome, it could not be \ndone.\n  That is not what was done in this conference committee in 1996. \nWithout any justification, this compact, or the permission to allow the \nSecretary of Agriculture to put the compact into effect, was placed in. \nAnd yes, I fear--although I hope it does not happen--that is exactly \nwhat is happening again.\n  There was an attempt here to force the compact continuation or \nextension on to the Ag appropriations bill. All three of us and Senator \nKohl and others worked together and many other Senators from across the \ncountry, and they did not even come close to getting the 60 votes.\n  So that is my concern. That is why I am out here.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I would like to follow up my question.\n  I know Senator Wellstone would like to be part of this debate and ask \na question as well.\n  But I know we have some differences on the Freedom to Farm, but one \nthing Freedom to Farm did not do is pit one region of farmers against \nanother, whether it was dealing with corn or soybeans or any of the \nother commodities. But somehow when it comes to dairy, an antiquated \nsystem, as you mentioned, needs to be changed.\n  We are looking at something that basically says we are going to have \nsome winners in this country--when it comes to dairy--but we are going \nto have some losers. In other words, the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and \nMinnesota have the Government with an antiquated dairy program standing \non their necks and saying: You are not going to be able to succeed \nbecause we are going to put limits on you. Yet we are going to give \ntremendous advantages to others.\n  All we are asking for is fairness, a level playing field. We are not \nasking for farmers in the Northeast or the Southwest to be \ndisadvantaged. But we sure cannot support a program that says: You are \ngoing to have some farmers who are winners and some who are losers.\n  So how do we work this into a new dairy bill coming out of this \nsession that is going to give our farmers just an opportunity to \ncompete, which is all they ask for?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. To answer the excellent question of the Senator from \nMinnesota, this makes no sense. You and I have views on the Freedom to \nFarm Act. I strongly oppose it. I thought it was a bad idea. In fact, \nthe results of it are shocking.\n  No one has been more eloquent about this than the senior Senator from \nMinnesota, who has pointed out the enormous tragedy that has occurred \nwith many farmers around the country because of that law.\n  But what is bizarre about it, as you point out, is that in one area, \ninstead of going the Freedom to Farm route, they voted to keep not just \nGovernment regulation but to put in place a system of regulation and \nmarketing that only dealt with one small region of the country where \nthere are only a few thousand dairy farmers, when there are some 25,000 \nin Wisconsin and a substantial number in Minnesota. It is a complete \nopposite of the notion of a free market national system.\n  Even for those of us who oppose the Freedom to Farm Act, those of us \nwho oppose the Freedom to Farm Act are not proposing for wheat or corn \nor pork or beef or anything else that there be regional markets. \nWhatever philosophy you have, whether it be Government supports to \nguarantee our farmers do not fall below a certain level, or whether you \nbelieve in a complete freedom to farm or freedom to fail, some would \nsay--either way--this idea of a regional market for a particular \ncommodity is an example of ridiculous Federal interference.\n  We need a national dairy market. Upper Midwestern farmers will do \nfine in a national dairy market. But one that is unfairly skewed for \none region, when the underlying system is already terribly unfair, is a \ndouble whammy that has cost us far too many lives and far too many \nlivelihoods of farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota and throughout the \nupper Midwest.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, \nfor his questions and his work on this issue. He has really been \ntireless in his advocacy for dairy farmers in Minnesota.\n  I actually have two questions for the Senator from Wisconsin to which \nI would like him to respond.\n  The first question is whether or not the Senator, since he is out \nhere on the floor right now, could translate this debate about the \ndairy compact in personal terms. In other words, there is a reason why \nyou must be out here. If you could give other Senators a feel for what \nit has been like to be out at dairy farms, meet with dairy farmers, and \nwhat is happening to the families in Wisconsin and Minnesota.\n  My second question would be, since the Senator is out here--and I \ndon't know what is the period of time; I know the Senator from Maryland \nwants to get some clarity on that, and I imagine the Senator will do \nwhat he needs to do and then move on with this bill, with the VA-HUD \nbill--I want to ask the Senator the other question, which is, again, \nthe particular concern that he has about the nature of this process in \nthe conference committee.\n  You are out here to basically sound an alarm. You are out here to \nsay: Listen, I want to make it clear that in no way, shape, or form \nshould you be able in conference committee--which is almost behind the \nscenes basically--to negate a vote we had already.\n  So I wonder whether you could deal with those: In personal terms, \nwhat this is about for dairy farmers in our States; and second, the \nparticular point you intend to make right here on the floor of the \nSenate about what is happening right now in conference.\n\n  You said it before, but I think it needs to be repeated.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S11243]]\n\n  I say no one has made it more his business to articulate what has \nhappened to American farmers in general, particularly in the last few \nyears. He was an inspiration to me in that regard before I got to this \nbody. We are proud in Wisconsin, but not too proud to look west to \nMinnesota for that kind of inspiration at times.\n  Let me start with the second question. The first one involves, as you \nknow, a lot of memories: 17 years of working with farmers.\n  But the second question really is always a hard one. People say to \nme: How can it be that you have a vote, fair and square, in the body in \nwhich you have been elected to serve, and there was no vote in the \nother House, and somehow this committee that is appointed to get \ntogether to resolve the differences between the Houses ends up coming \nup with the exact opposite of what the Senate had resolved?\n  You can say: Well, that's the way things always are. But that does \nnot satisfy people. There are supposed to be some rules, both formal \nand informal, about the way business is done. It has always been my \nunderstanding, unless there is some basis in one House or the other for \nputting something into the conference committee, it should not be put \nin there.\n  It sounds like, as they say, inside baseball. But what it really is \nis a cynicism that what we do out here is irrelevant to what happens in \nthe conference committee.\n  So I am sounding the alarm, as you suggested. I know people hate to \nlose. I hate to lose. I hated to lose when we won fair and square 2 \nyears ago. I hated to lose when we begged the Secretary of Agriculture \nto not do this because we thought it was a lousy idea. He did not \nagree. Now he admits it is not a very good idea.\n  I think it is time for those on the other side to understand that \nsometimes you win and sometimes you lose. There are rules, there is \nfairness, and there is no fairness to this process when we win this \nvote time and again on the floor of the Senate, and somehow we are \nstill stuck with this thing because of a few people in the conference \ncommittee.\n  I hope it does not happen, I say to the Senator from Minnesota, but I \nam worried about it. I certainly feel bad that I am compelled to do \nthis in light of the wishes of the Senator from Maryland and people who \nare bringing this bill forward. It is a terribly important piece of \nlegislation. We have to act on behalf of our dairy farmers and because \nof what has happened in the past. Because of the fact that fairness is \nnot applied to our issue, we have no choice but to speak. The reason I \nfeel so strongly is that I have watched the decimation of Wisconsin's \ndairy farmers. I became a State senator in 1982, just 2 years after the \nyear I like to mention as sort of the benchmark, when we had over \n45,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin. I grew up in a family and am old \nenough to remember, we didn't get our milk and our eggs at the store. \nThe milk was delivered every morning by the milkman, and we got the \neggs once a week by going out to farms in the area. That, to me, was \nthe way it was done. We knew personally many of the family farmers in \nour area, and they were good friends of our family. It was part of our \ncommunity.\n\n  There was no question in my mind, when I was elected to the Wisconsin \nState Senate, representing a largely rural area, that at the very top \nof my list had to be making sure these folks who had been providing \nfood for us forever could continue to live. I would have been stunned \nand horrified to know that 17 years later I would be out here with \nabout half of Wisconsin dairy farmers being lost.\n  I can trace it for the Senator from Minnesota, if he would like, \nthrough the hundreds of conversations I have had. I had them as a State \nsenator, and I have had them as a U.S. Senator. I go to every 1 of \nWisconsin's 72 counties every year and hold a town meeting. We open the \ndoor, and whoever wants to come to the town hall can come in. And in \nevery 1 of Wisconsin's 72 counties, except for possibly Milwaukee, a \nfarmer has come in or many farmers have come in and told me about the \npressure on them because of this pricing system and, in the last couple \nof years, because of the overproduction that this New England Dairy \nCompact has caused. It varies. Sometimes they are just concerned.\n  But I say to the Senator from Minnesota, in the last 2 years I have \nhad farmers I have known for 17 years, proud men and women, come to my \ntown meetings and begin their presentation clearly, concisely, \npolitely, but near the end of their presentation they have started to \ncry because they are sick and tired of not being able to pass on that \nfarm to their kids.\n  That is not a very fun thing to watch--to watch a 70-year-old man who \nis still working his farm take the time to come to my town meeting and \nto try to say how he felt and to be unable to complete the presentation \nand to probably feel embarrassed, but it is that bad.\n  The hardest thing for me to hear is the farmer who says: I wanted my \nkids to go into farming, to go into dairy, but I cannot tell them it is \na good idea. That is usually the point at which one of the farmers just \ncan't go on. His dream, a lot of times the dream of his son or \ndaughter, is actually to continue the family tradition, and they can't \nbecause the Federal Government is meddling in having a fair and open \ndairy market, the kind in which they would have done very well.\n  That is a brief answer, and I could go on and on.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for one final question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator has talked about his indignation about \nwhat might happen in conference committee, and we are on the floor \ntrying to make it clear that it will be unacceptable and we will fight \nit all the way, if there should be an effort to undo the vote of the \nSenate.\n  The Senator has talked in personal terms. I want to say to him as a \nfriend--I am not trying to get psychological here--but he spoke \ndifferently than I have ever heard him speak on the floor of the Senate \nwhen he talked about some of the farmers and conversations and how \npeople start out very eloquent and rational and then just break down \ncrying. I have had the same thing going on right now with many of our \nproducers, dairy and crop and livestock, across the board. That is the \nconvulsion in agriculture right now. It is awful. We have to change it.\n\n  Could the Senator explain for people the connection between this \nfight, the plight of dairy farmers, and the national interests. Could \nhe make a linkage as to why he thinks it is in the interest of our \ncountry not to have these compacts and to make sure that dairy farmers \nin Wisconsin and Minnesota have a fair shake and have the opportunity \nto be able to earn a decent living.\n  In other words, I can see how some would say, he is out here doing it \nfor Wisconsin--we are doing it for our States--but what is the \nconnection to the rest of us?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I say to the Senator from Minnesota, that really is the \nfundamental question. It relates closely to what he has done such an \nexcellent job of talking about. This isn't just about whether or not we \nare going to have a higher price for dairy farmers in New England or \nsomewhat lower price in Wisconsin and the age-old regional battles. \nSomething happens that is very dangerous to our democracy when we lose \nthese small farms. We lose the ability to have people who own their own \nproperty produce our food. I think that is dangerous.\n  What is happening in every sector of the economy, especially in \nagriculture, is the consolidation of the control of the food supply \ninto a few hands. I think the Senator from Minnesota knows the \nstatistics better than I do, but I think in grain, I was told that one \ncompany is going to control something like 95 percent of the grain.\n  The Senator from Missouri, who was on the floor before, has made the \npoint in meetings that we have a problem in this country when we go to \nthe store and we buy some ham and we pay more for it than the farmer \nwas getting for the whole pig for awhile. Somebody is making the money. \nIt is not the small farmer. Dairy is only one example of this trend.\n  What happens is, when you lose these small farms in places like \nMinnesota and Wisconsin, of course, milk is still being produced, but \nit tends to be produced in these very large corporate operations, \nwhether they are in Wisconsin, but more likely in other places.\n\n[[Page S11244]]\n\n I remember flying into a western State that I won't name and flying \ninto an airport saying: What is that down there? It looked similar to \nthe General Motors plant in Janesville. Somebody told me it was a dairy \nfarm.\n  This isn't the dairy farming that I grew up to believe not only was \nbasic to our economy but basic to our culture, basic to our democracy, \nand, yes, control of our own food supply. If big corporations and \nmultinational corporations own our land and our food supply, isn't this \neven a question of national security? I think it is an element of \nnational security if we own our own food product. The best way to keep \nowning it is to have small, individual producers all over this country \ncontinue to survive.\n  To me, I don't know if that is exactly what the Senator from \nMinnesota was getting at, but it is a fair point that this isn't just \nabout the upper Midwest versus New England and so on. What it is really \nabout is, can these small operators who live in Wisconsin and Minnesota \ncontinue to exist?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the Senator is going to continue to \nspeak, then that is one thing. I don't want to hold up deliberations. I \nthink the Senator from Maryland has a question to ask. I will just \nsimply defer.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I was prepared to go on to discuss the \nVA-HUD bill, and I am prepared to continue to discuss the VA-HUD bill.\n  Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me say, because the Senator from \nMaryland has been very patient, I am sorry I had to delay this \nimportant legislation to this point. I am going to conclude for now. \nAgain, I regret that this is necessary. However, as a Senator from the \ngreat State of Wisconsin, I will continue to fight for a fair national \ndairy policy as we await the outcome of the conference and in the days \nto follow.\n  Obviously, in taking this unusual step, I am merely signaling to the \nSenate that there certainly will be more discussions of the same kind \nif this goes forward.\n  Before I yield the floor, I see the Senator from Minnesota. I wonder \nif he wanted to ask me one more question.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I wanted to ask a quick question if I could. What we are \nasking for doesn't cost money. This is not a request to give farmers in \nMinnesota or Wisconsin more money but to allow them the ability to \ncompete on a level playing field. That is all we are asking for, as far \nas this dairy policy goes.\n  As you mentioned, and very well have laid out the problem, this is a \nprogram set up in 1930, completely outdated. If we were going to begin \na new milk marketing program today, it would not look like anything \ndebated in the committees at all. This is an unfair system, outdated. \nIt has no rhyme or reason to markets or regions or producers or our \ndairy farmers. So we have a system now, and all we are asking for is \nlegislation or a program that would allow our farmers to compete. We \nare willing to compete with anybody in any part of the country and let \nthe chips fall where they may.\n\n  At the same time, this program will cost consumers additional money, \nwhether it is low-income, whether it is school lunch programs, or \nwhatever it is. So this program has a lot of negatives to it, and all \nwe are asking for is a level playing field and competition. Is that \nwhat the Senator says?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes. I thank both Senators from Minnesota for joining \nme. Of course, the Senator is absolutely right. This is not about a \nguaranteed price for the farmers. It is not about any kind of \nlegislation, some of which I might support. This is an attempt to \nprevent the continuation of an absurd distortion of our dairy market in \nthe New England Dairy Compact. We are looking for fairness both in \nterms of the policy and the procedure of this institution. I thank the \nSenator from Minnesota. Again, I thank the Senator from Maryland for, I \nhope, understanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCarl Levin and Senator John Kerry be added as cosponsors to the Bond-\nByrd-Mikulski-Stevens VA health care amendment, No. 1744.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as you know, we intended to have an \nextended conversation about the VA-HUD bill. Obviously, I appreciate \nthe Senators' needs to defend their constituents' interests, and the \nplight of people losing businesses, of course, is significant to us \nall. I wish I would have known the time so we could have been better \nable to organize and plan our amendments.\n  I know the leadership of both parties is now consulting on what is \nthe best way to proceed for the rest of the evening in terms of \namendments to be offered. I know there are amendments that are being \ndrafted, and I also know the two leaders are discussing what is the \nbest way to come to closure on the number of amendments to be offered. \nSo right this minute, because we missed a certain window to offer two \nimportant amendments, we are now involved in a process. But I am \nreluctant to yield the floor except to Senator Bond because I am going \nto stick on VA-HUD, and with all of the compelling issues in that bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my very able ranking member for her \nefforts to move the bill forward. We certainly intend to do so. I have \na clarifying amendment, a technical correction amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1779\n\n    (Purpose: To clarify the prohibition on using Federal funds for \n        lobbying or litigating. This is a technical correction)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1779.\n       On page 111, beginning on line 4, strike out ``or be used'' \n     and all that follows through ``litigation activity'' on line \n     5.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this is simply a technical correction the \nexperts have told us is necessary to assure that the provisions in the \nlaw at that point are properly phrased. I know of no controversy on it. \nIt is technical in nature. I believe it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I think we are in agreement on this \namendment. I am prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1779) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and all our colleagues. We \nhave been making great progress. We are ready to move forward on \nseveral matters relating to the housing section of the bill.\n  I am sorry that it appears we are not ready to do so.\n  I renew my request to all Members who have amendments. We welcome the \nopportunity to look at them. On some of these amendments, we find we \ncan work them out in a way that is very easy to accommodate the \nreasonable requests of our colleagues. We want to do so in every \npossible way. But as I believe we have said many other times, we are \nfacing a real time deadline.\n  We need to get this measure passed out of the Senate, I hope, no \nlater than tomorrow. Then we can go to conference committee and get it \nback and send the conference report to the President prior to September \n30 so this measure will not have to be included in the continuing \nresolution. To do so would relieve a tremendous amount of burdens from \nthe agencies that are covered and would certainly move forward the work \nof this body. We have had good discussions, and we have had very \nhelpful discussions from a number of Members who have not offered \namendments. We are not looking for more amendments, but if there are \nSenators who have either colloquies they wish us to include or \namendments they wish to offer, we would be happy to consider them at \nthis time.\n\n[[Page S11245]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to convey to the Senator from \nMissouri that we are trying to reach the Senator from Massachusetts \nabout his amendment. As you know, he was prepared to offer them and \nthen he moved on to other constituent meetings because we didn't know \nif we were in a filibuster or not. I didn't even know, and we are sorry \nthat we could not pinpoint the time.\n  I say to the Senator from Missouri, just another few moments of \npatience. We are contacting Senator Kerry to see if he can break free \nfrom the meetings and come to the floor to offer his amendment within \nthe next 20 minutes or so, or shorter. In the meantime, we also know \nthe Senator is anxious, as I am, for a unanimous consent to be hotlined \nwith a deadline for amendments to be filed.\n  As I understand it, we are waiting for the majority leader to see if \nhe is in agreement with the UC as proposed by the Democratic leader. We \nare waiting, one, for Senator Lott on the UC, and Senator John Kerry, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, to come this evening. If he can, we \nwill keep on going. If not, I am not quite sure what the other \namendments are. I know the Senator from Missouri has a whole group of \nconstituents who are a special affinity group for him that he is \nanxious to get to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nhelp.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1780\n\n(Purpose: To require a report on the effect of the allocation of funds \n  under Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) formula on the \nrural subregions of the health care system administered by the Veterans \n                         Health Administration)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1780:\n\n       On page 17, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       Sec. 108. (a) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that it should be the goal of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to serve all veterans equitably at health \n     care facilities in urban and rural areas.\n       (b) Report Required.--(1) Not later than six months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the Senate and the House of Representatives a \n     report on the impact of the allocation of funds under the \n     Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) funding formula \n     on the rural subregions of the health care system \n     administered by the Veterans Health Administration.\n       (2) The report shall include the following:\n       (A) An assessment of impact of the allocation of funds \n     under the VERA formula on--\n       (i) travel times to veterans health care in rural areas;\n       (ii) waiting periods for appointments for veterans health \n     care in rural areas;\n       (iii) the cost associated with additional community-based \n     outpatient clinics;\n       (iv) transportation costs; and\n       (v) the unique challenges that Department of Veterans \n     Affairs medical centers in rural, low-population subregions \n     face in attempting to increase efficiency without large \n     economies of scale.\n       (B) The recommendations of the Secretary, if any, on how \n     rural veterans' access to health care services might be \n     enhanced.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have let the clerk read the entire sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution because I think it makes the point. I believe \nthere is nothing further I can add to the terms of that Senate \nresolution. It simply requires VA to undertake a study of rural \nsubregions. I urge its adoption.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with its adoption and want to \ncongratulate the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, for this amendment. Her \ncriteria on Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation--nicknamed VERA--is \nabsolutely right. I hope the VA uses it as a model for looking at the \ndelivery generally: Travel time to veterans' health care, waiting time \nfor appointments, costs associated with additional community-based \noutpatients, and also not only the waiting period but what we heard in \nother debate is, sometimes they wait and then they are sent home, \nsending them back another 150 miles and coming back another 150 miles. \nI believe our veterans have marched long enough and they shouldn't have \nto march to get their health care.\n  This side of the aisle accepts this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1780) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank my colleague \nfrom Maryland. I believe it is a very good amendment.\n  We are at this moment waiting to find out from others what the \nschedule will be for this evening and whether there are additional \namendments to be offered.\n  At this point, we intend to stay on the bill. I see the Senator from \nNevada is ready to speak on the bill. I withhold my suggestion on the \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two important \ncomponents of the legislation before us today that would severely \nimpact the state of public housing both in my home state of Nevada and \nthroughout our nation.\n  The distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nhave undoubtedly worked hard to provide the needed funding for a number \nof critical programs in the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I commend them \nfor their efforts. Nevertheless, I am forced to say that I am \ndisappointed that this bill falls far short in continuing our \ncommitment to provide affordable, quality housing to low and moderate \nincome families.\n  Of particular concern, Mr. President, is the lack of funding for any \nnew section 8 housing vouchers despite the considerable demand and need \nfor such assistance in communities throughout the nation.\n  The section 8 program provides vital assistance to American families.\n  In 1998, 1.4 million Americans were receiving assistance under this \nprogram and countless more have been on waiting lists for months and \nsometimes years for this needed assistance.\n  Who receives assistance under the Section 8 program? According to \nCRS, recipients of section 8 vouchers are typically single-parent \nhouseholds with children under the age of 18. Most participants have \nincome well below the poverty level, and the average household income \nof a recipient is well below $10,000.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware that the American economy has been \nroaring for the last few years, and we are all delighted that inflation \nand unemployment numbers are at record lows and job growth and housing \nstarts are at record highs. But lost in this economic expansion and \nprosperity are millions of Americans who continue to struggle to make \nends meet and adequately provide for their families.\n  The section 8 program has historically served as a lifeline to low \nincome households, providing needed assistance to those American \nfamilies seeking to raise their children in quality, affordable homes \nin safe, livable communities.\n  Last year we were successful in providing almost 100,000 new section \n8 vouchers to address the substantial shortage in affordable housing, \nthe first new vouchers in five years.\n  As my colleagues will recall, the authorizing legislation passed by \nthe Senate last year authorized 100,000 new section 8 housing vouchers \nfor the upcoming fiscal year.\n  And yet the legislation before us provides no new vouchers despite \nthe growing gap between the public housing assistance needed and \nassistance available.\n  As an example of how disconcerting this issue has become in my own \nstate of Nevada, low and moderate income families in Las Vegas, Reno \nand numerous other communities currently have to wait for a period of \nover 8 months for public housing--8 months, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S11246]]\n\n  The wait for section 8 vouchers in Nevada is even worse. That delay \nis over 50 months, Mr. President. Over four years for a section 8 \nvoucher. And yet the legislation before inexplicably does not provide \nany additional funding for section 8 housing vouchers despite this \nsubstantial increase in demand.\n  It is my understanding that there will be an amendment to this bill \nto provide additional vouchers along the lines of the administration's \nrequest and I look forward to supporting that effort.\n  Let me address another issue that I believe was inadequately \naddressed in the bill and that I regret to say in my view is a setback.\n  I was also disappointed to learn that the underlying legislation \nbefore us today seeks to zero-out HUD's highly effective Community \nBuilders Program.\n  Let me say parenthetically that during the recently concluded August \nrecess my staff and I had the chance to visit with some of the \ncommunity builders to learn about their effectiveness, and in the very \nshort time that this program has been in existence I have heard \nconsiderable feedback from local officials, community leaders, and \nothers throughout our State in praise of the Community Builders \nProgram.\n  By way of example, the eight community builders working in HUD's Las \nVegas regional office have been able to bring HUD officials and \ncommunity leaders together to solve local problems by developing \nstrategies that draw resources from a multitude of Federal programs. \nAll who are familiar with the Federal bureaucracy know it can be very \ndifficult to bring together all the various programs with all of their \nintricacies and requirements and to meld those together to develop an \neffective program for the housing needs of our communities.\n  During the brief existence of this program, we have witnessed a \nnumber of success stories in both the southern and northern parts of \nNevada. Let me share some recent accomplishments of the program in the \nLas Vegas area. Community builders in Las Vegas have partnered with \nsouthern Nevada's local office of the Bureau of Land Management to \nfacilitate the conveyance of a large tract of vacant BLM land to the \ncity of Las Vegas for the development of affordable housing for low-\nincome and moderate-income residents.\n  Community builders are working with several housing partners to \ndevelop two to four units of single-family detached housing using \ntechnologically advanced materials and building processes to show how \ntechnology can reduce the cost and improve the quality of single-family \nhousing.\n  Community builders are undertaking the first phase of development of \na new 400-unit mobile home park in Pahrump, NV. Pahrump, NV, is located \nin my county and one of the 10 fastest growing counties in the entire \ncountry. This is being done at the same time by streamlining housing \ncode compliance to ensure safety and yet also to reduce the cost.\n  Community builders in Las Vegas are working to develop a lender \ncertification program designed to assist in the extension of mortgage \nprograms and products to an increased number of low- and moderate-\nincome families and individuals. These success stories in the southern \npart of our State have also been mirrored in northern Nevada.\n  For example, when BHP Copper Mine in Ely shut down mining operations, \nmore than 400 individuals representing 12 percent of the area's \nworkforce were laid off, dealing a devastating blow to a struggling \ncommunity. The community builders in Reno immediately went to work, \njoining with local officials in organizing a community partnership \nforum with community leaders and representatives from many Federal, \nState, and nonprofit agencies. This effort resulted in the development \nof an action plan that identified solutions and opportunities for \nmitigating the adverse economic and housing effects caused by these \nmassive layoffs. This initiative is being held up as a model throughout \nrural Nevada for rural communities to develop comprehensive local \nstrategies responsive to economic downturns in the mining industry and \nthe longer-term need for greater economic diversification.\n  I might add as an aside, we learned from two of our counties, \nHumboldt and Lander Counties, two counties I visited and spent time in \nwith their county commissioner and citizens in August, those counties \nhave also been affected as a result of a series of layoffs in the \nmining industry. They, too, are buffeted by worsening economic \nconditions.\n  Once again, the community builders are being called into action to \nassist community leaders in finding ways to stabilize rural economies \nand housing markets in the face of falling gold prices in the global \nmarket.\n  In sum, the Community Builders Program strikes me as a smart and \ncost-effective way to do business. By breaking down the old \nbureaucratic hurdles that often hinder customer service and working at \nthe grassroot levels with communities ranging from the sprawl of Las \nVegas to a rather small community such as Ely, NV, the Community \nBuilders Program has proven highly effective in finding solutions to \ncritical challenges facing our urban and rural communities.\n  It is my hope that before this legislation is passed by the Senate, \nthese two critically important and highly successful programs are \naddressed in a way that will allow the Federal Government to continue \nits commitment to providing affordable housing to the millions of \nAmericans who depend upon such assistance and to allow the Community \nBuilders Program to continue its work in building successful \npartnerships within our communities to solve local problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words the Senator from \nNevada shared. We did appreciate working with the Senator on these very \nimportant bills. I thank him for his interest.\n  With respect to the new vouchers, I believe I have already addressed \nat some length why we have not recommended any new vouchers. We do not \nhave the resources identified to maintain the ones we have. In fact, \nthere are $40 million worth of additional vouchers for the disabled. We \nput in $100 million for the Opt Out Program to protect the residents in \nsection 8 housing where the landlords are choosing to get out of the \nprogram. We are also working through HOME and CDBG to provide \nadditional housing facilities. I have stated those points before. I \nwill not reiterate them at any length.\n  With respect to community builders, we will address this in \nconference. The bill would terminate HUD's Community Builders Program \nfor all external community builders. We were originally told there were \nsupposed to be about 200 staff. It is now up to 800. The program \nrepresents about 9 percent of the HUD staff. In fiscal year 1999, HUD \nis expecting to spend as much in funds for staff and support costs for \nthis program as they will spend for the HUD's community planning and \ndevelopment staff, which is responsible for administering programs such \nas CDBG and the homeless.\n  I believe investing in 2-year terms for employees hired out of the \nnormal practices of HUD is a questionable use of scarce resources. What \ndoes it say about the capabilities of existing HUD staff when the \nSecretary says we have to bring in people who are hired for a 2-year \nterm outside of the normal hiring practices to explain HUD programs? It \nsays something is going on.\n\n  Before the community builders' staff was hired, the roles were not \nadequately defined by HUD. It is still in the process of developing and \ndefining the role, even though most of the positions have been filled \nfor several months. According to the information we have from the IG, \n76 percent of the external community builders' initial hiring was not \nin accordance with Federal selection rules. The hiring appeared to be \npolitical despite the assurances to the contrary.\n  The FHA Commissioner in charge of the multifamily housing has \nwritten:\n\n       Community Builders in certain areas have misinterpreted or \n     overstepped their role in dealing with HUD's identified \n     multifamily projects.\n\n  In his letter, the Commissioner states:\n\n       It cannot be stressed too strongly that the Community \n     Builders must communicate with the appropriate HUD staff.\n\n  In my view, community builders are not acting as HUD staff. They are \nacting in the capacity of lobbyists or public affairs representatives \nfor HUD.\n\n[[Page S11247]]\n\nHUD already has a public affairs office. The public affairs office is \nproviding the direction to these people. The Department recently \ndirected the community builders to reach out to the media to voice \nstrong opposition to the House of Representatives appropriations fiscal \nyear 2000 budget. I can state that they are also reaching out to lobby \nCongress to keep the community builders. I don't need to fund a group \nof people whose job it is, in addition to all the other normal \nfunctions of HUD, to lobby me and tell the news media how valuable they \nare when they are only on for 2 years and, according to the information \nwe have, have not even in some instances been able to define the job of \nHUD and the roles and the programs of HUD adequately.\n  I don't believe there is an amendment pending. We will have more to \nsay about that at length if it is brought up in the form of the \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1785\n\n (Purpose: To provide a period of time for consultation and evaluation \n  of any realignment plan for the VISN 12 health care delivery system)\n\n  Mr. BOND. On behalf of Senators Fitzgerald and Durbin, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. Fitzgerald, \n     for himself, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1785.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available in \n     this Act for the Medical Care appropriation of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs may be obligated for the realignment of \n     the health care delivery system in VISN 12 until 60 days \n     after the Secretary of Veterans Affairs certifies that the \n     Department has (a) consulted with veterans organizations, \n     medical school affiliates, employee representatives, State \n     veterans and health associations, and other interested \n     parties with respect to the realignment plan to be \n     implemented, and (b) made available to the Congress and the \n     public information from the consultations regarding possible \n     impacts on the accessibility of veterans health care services \n     to affected veterans.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. There had been great concern in the Chicago area about the \nrealignment of the VA facilities. This measure simply assures \nappropriate procedures are followed so all parties involved have an \nopportunity to express themselves.\n  This has been a longstanding concern with the VA. We do believe they \nshould continue to move forward, as we said before, in closing unneeded \nfacilities. But in doing so, it is vitally important they go through \nthe proper processes which allow those affected to have a say and a \nstake in the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator Bond for \nworking with the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin. I know Senator \nFitzgerald also had a keen interest in this particular issue. I am \nready to also accept this amendment and wish to note, though, this \nseems to be a pattern with VA, where our colleagues in the Congress \nhave to keep giving them commonsense criteria on how to decide what is \nthe best way to serve veterans.\n  We know we are in the veterans' health care business. We know we are \nnot in the veterans' real estate business. But surely, clear criteria \nand talking with the people most affected would go a long way.\n  There was a saying in the early Polish Parliament that said:\n\n       Nothing about us without us.\n\n  I think that is the way the veterans feel. That is the way the \nMembers of the Senate feel: Hello, Veterans Administration. Please, get \nto work on these criteria and follow what the Senate is telling you.\n  I am happy to accept this amendment and urge its adoption.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1785) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we thank the Senators from Illinois for \nworking with us on what we think is a very positive step forward that \nwill allow the VA to perhaps shift resources to serve veterans better. \nWe are very pleased we could fashion an appropriate format for \ndeveloping criteria to make sure the process is done in a fair and \nequitable manner.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio. I believe he has two amendments to \noffer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1782\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the National Aeronautics and \n  Space Administration for the establishment at any field center of a \n  research capability that would duplicate a research capability that \n                    exists at another field center)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send amendment No. 1782 to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1782.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 431. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by this \n     Act may be obligated or expended for purposes of establishing \n     at a field center of the Administration any research \n     capability that would duplicate a research capability that \n     currently exists at another field center of the \n     Administration.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, and my colleague from Maryland, Senator \nMikulski. They have produced, I believe, under some very tough, \ndifficult circumstances, a very excellent, very fair, and very balanced \nbill. Members of the Senate are certainly indebted to them for the \ntremendous work they have put in and the product they have produced.\n  The amendment I have just sent to the desk is a very commonsense \namendment. In fact, I believe it really builds upon the very \ncommonsense language included in the VA-HUD appropriation bill \ncommittee report. That part of the committee report states the \ncommittee is concerned about the duplication of work being performed \nthroughout the NASA field centers. It instructs NASA, by April 15 of \nthe year 2000, to produce a preliminary action plan to map out what \neach of the field center's future roles and responsibilities will be.\n  The most important part of this report language states:\n\n       NASA should identify where a center has or is expected to \n     develop the same or similar expertise and capacity as another \n     center, including justification for this need.\n\n  I do not believe, at a time when NASA's overall funding is \nincreasing, NASA should be duplicating any capabilities that already \nexist at one center at a different center. It just makes no sense. This \nreally defies logic. My amendment would simply prevent NASA from \nspending any money to duplicate capabilities that already exist.\n  Let me say in conclusion, I appreciate that the authors of this bill \nare willing to accept this amendment. Let me pledge to the authors of \nthe bill, I will continue to work with them and continue to work with \nNASA to resolve this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Ohio on his \nstaunch support and advocacy of the programs at the Glenn Space Center. \nBecause of his very strong advocacy, we included funds for the future \nlaunch program and other things that we think are vital to the long-\nterm interests of NASA. We expect those programs will go forward. My \nview is, I am willing to accept this amendment and the additional \namendment he proposes to ensure that NASA preserves the integrity of \nthe mission of the Glenn Space Center.\n\n[[Page S11248]]\n\n  Having said that, I have some problems. The amendment, if finally \nadopted into law, would be too constraining and might result in \nunintended consequences. We need to call NASA's attention to these \nproblems but also give them needed flexibility that might not be there.\n  That said, I expect NASA to operate in good faith in maintaining the \nprograms at the Glenn Space Center. This is critical. I expect NASA can \nresolve the concerns of Senator DeWine so these provisions can be \ndropped in conference. I might note for my colleagues, the Senate \nreport for NASA already states that ``each NASA center be vested with \nspecific responsibilities and activities.''\n  I think we are all moving in the same direction. I believe the \nSenator's admonitions included in this amendment that will be accepted \nhere should suffice.\n  So I urge we accept the amendment. I will urge we accept the second \namendment as well.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with the analysis offered by \nSenator Bond. Rather than simply repeat, I concur in his comments. I \nsay that to the Senator from Ohio.\n\n  You have the Ames Research Center in Ohio. It has served the Nation \nwell. It needs to be respected for what it has given to the Nation. As \nwe look to the future of NASA, there needs to be the kind of analysis \nwe talked about. So I concur with both the comments and the strategy \noffered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Voinovich \nbe added to this amendment and the subsequent amendment I will offer in \na moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I think we are ready to vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1782) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1781\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds by the National Aeronautics and \n Space Administration for the transfer of research aircraft from Glenn \n           Research Center, Ohio, to any other field center)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1781.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 431, None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration by this Act may be obligated or expended for \n     purposes of transferring any research aircraft from Glen \n     Research Center, Ohio, to another field center of the \n     Administration.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, again the chairman and ranking member have \nindicated they accept this amendment. I appreciate their consideration \nvery much.\n  I want to say in regard to the previous amendment, I appreciate the \ncomments. I am sure this is a matter that can be resolved in \nconsultation with NASA. We are all trying to achieve the same thing. I \nfully expect this will be done.\n  Mr. BOND. With the same caveat added on the first amendment, this \nside is willing to accept the amendment. I commend the Senator for \ndealing with this very real concern, and I trust this will send the \nappropriate message to NASA.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1781) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As though in morning business?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. It is on this bill. I don't need to ask unanimous \nconsent, do I?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. What a great body.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns about the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. I first thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor their efforts on the bill. This is a bill with many important \nprograms that are very popular which has a limit to funding. I know how \nhard it is to please everybody on this bill. Under the budget caps, it \nis next to impossible to find the money to do what is necessary. So I \nappreciate that.\n  But I do rise to voice my concerns. I will support the amendment to \nbe offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, if he \nshould offer it, to add an additional 50,000 section 8 affordable \nhousing vouchers, because this amendment is a step in the right \ndirection. I hope the Senate will adopt the amendment and work with the \nHouse to ensure that it is part of any package sent to the President.\n  New York City and New York State have a severe housing shortage. It \nis not just in New York City. In New York City, there are over 400,000 \npeople who need homes. In Rochester, there are nearly 20,000 families \nwith severe housing needs. In New York City, there are over 150,000 \nfamilies on public housing waiting lists alone; and 220,000 families \nwaiting for section 8 help. The waiting list is as long as 8 years in \neach case.\n  In Syracuse, families must wait 2 and a half years before they get \nsection 8 help. In Rochester, there are 1,700 families waiting for \npublic housing, and 4,500 are waiting for section 8. The bill will make \nthese families wait even longer.\n  The bill adds no new section 8 vouchers, and the public housing is \ndramatically underfunded.\n  New York State Comptroller Carl McCall--our excellent comptroller--\nissued a report in July highlighting that New York City's public \nhousing needs over $7 billion in major repairs.\n  Under this bill, I fear these properties will further deteriorate, \nthreatening the health and safety of children and seniors, the disabled \nand veterans who live in these communities who depend on this Congress \nto meet our obligations.\n  Our Nation has invested over $90 billion to house the poorest \nAmericans. This bill, I believe, uses these investments as spare parts \nfor other parts of the budget. Let's put a face on the budget.\n  Many of those who are helped by the housing programs that are \nunderfunded by this budget are the most vulnerable in our society. \nAbout half of section 8 beneficiaries are children. Over 40 percent of \nthose in public housing are children.\n  Last year, Congress did take a step forward. We authorized 100,000 \nadditional section 8 vouchers in the public housing reform bill. We \nmade progress by adding 50,000. This year, however, the Senate and the \nHouse decided the Nation does not need any more.\n  The hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers, and many more other \nAmericans, waiting for safe and affordable housing need more than the \nbill offers.\n  About 5 and a half million families spend more than half their income \non housing. Many of those are in New York State. Recent studies have \nindicated that for many of these families the situation is getting \nworse. The Kerry amendment will help them.\n  The section 8 vouchers that this amendment funds will help Congress \nfulfill its promise to working families, particularly families leaving \nwelfare. If we are committed to strong communities and want to shrink \nthe welfare rolls, new section 8 authority can only help.\n\n  If the bill was absolutely perfect for veterans, but shortchanged \nhousing, I would be a little happier. Although I feel strongly about \nsection 8 public housing, the bill also achieves only a bear minimum \nfor veterans.\n\n[[Page S11249]]\n\n  As other Senators have pointed out, 99 of us are on record that a \nfull $3 billion over the President's request is needed. I agree with \nthis and I am disappointed that the Wellstone amendment failed.\n  Veterans hospitals across my State have laid off hundreds of staff \nthis year alone. Despite promises from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, I believe that even more staff will have to go if this bill \ngoes through.\n  So, in conclusion, I appreciate the job, the difficult job that the \nchairman and the ranking member face. It is not easy when there are so \nmany important needs and so few funds. I just wish either we could find \nthe extra money or at the very least the priorities were a little \ndifferent because of housing and veterans needs that are so pressing in \nmy State.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their courtesy.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for his \nvery moving comments. I agree with him that we need more housing. I \nstated earlier my concerns that section 8 is not providing more \nhousing. This is a long-term problem on which we must work. There are \nmany challenges in the section 8 program, not the least of which is, as \nI said earlier, being able to continue the section 8 assistance for \nthose who have it. So I will not pursue this discussion any longer. We \nwill have an opportunity to do so tomorrow.\n  I believe we are winding up.\n  Mr. President, I do have one other amendment I would like to offer \nwhich simply calls on the GAO to conduct a study of possible revisions \nto the capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and \nreport to the Congress not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this act.\n  I am sure everybody is looking forward to having another study from \nGAO.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1786\n\n  I send this amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1786.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . GAO STUDY ON FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK CAPITAL.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study of--\n       (1) possible revisions to the capital structure of the \n     Federal Home Loan Bank System, including the need for--\n       (A) more permanent capital;\n       (B) a statutory leverage ratio; and\n       (C) a risk-based capital structure; and\n       (2) what impact such revisions might have on the operations \n     of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, including the \n     obligation of the Federal Home Loan Bank System under section \n     21B(f)(2)(C) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.\n       (b) Report to Congress--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall submit a report to the Congress on the \n     results of the study conducted under subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. BOND. It is a simple amendment. I urge the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side has reviewed the amendment. We \nthink a GAO study on this topic will definitely be in the national \ninterest. I am willing to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1786) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to convey to the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that the Senator from Massachusetts said he would be ready \nto go first thing in the morning. So I know of no other amendments this \nevening where the Senators are ready to offer them. My suggestion would \nbe that we close out this evening and begin bright and early with the \nKerry of Massachusetts amendments on section 8 and also the issue of \nhousing for AIDS patients.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I share the Senator's hope. It does appear \nthere will not be any further business on this bill tonight. We are \nawaiting the final OK from the leadership.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all remaining \nfirst-degree amendments, other than one for each leader and a manager's \npackage and a measure relating to Y2K by Senators Dodd and Bennett, to \nthe HUD-VA appropriations bill be relevant or sense-of-the-Senate \nlanguage. I further ask unanimous consent that all second-degree \namendments be relevant to the first-degree amendment they propose to \namend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I take the floor to commend my friends, the \nchairman and the ranking member, for their efforts in coming forward \nwith a bill that provides valuable funding for veterans and key housing \nprograms.\n  However, I urge my colleagues to provide additional funding for \nsection 8 vouchers. We have talked a lot about this. In my State of \nHawaii, there is a 20-month wait for public housing and a 44-month wait \nfor section 8 vouchers. Without additional funding for these programs, \nHawaii's residents will only see an increase in the waiting period for \npublic housing and section 8 vouchers. We must ensure that adequate \nfunding is provided for these important programs which benefit so many \npeople.\n  Lastly, I wish to also urge my colleagues to revisit the Community \nBuilders Program and provide HUD with the ability to continue this \nvaluable program. In my State, this program has provided a valuable \nservice for Hawaii's low-income families.\n  Once again, I commend the chairman and ranking member for making very \ntough decisions in crafting this legislation. I know it was not easy, \nand I am pleased the committee sought additional funding for our \nNation's veterans' health care system. But I hope we also understand \nthe need for affordable housing, and I urge the committee to revisit \nthis issue in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Hawaii for his \nperceptive comments. We will be happy to discuss those issues. We \nappreciate the insights and look forward to working with him to attempt \nto deal with the specific problems he finds in his beautiful State. I \ndo appreciate his coming to share with us his views.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity first \nto applaud Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for the tremendous job \nthey have done balancing the demands of some of our most important \nprograms with a very limited budget. The Fiscal Year 2000 VA/HUD and \nIndependent Agencies appropriations bill which they have crafted is a \ngood bill and stands in stark contrast to the House passed bill which \nincluded some devastating cuts to a number of very important housing \nand community development programs. The Chairman and Ranking Member \nwere very responsive to my requests and concerns with the bill as were \ntheir staffs.\n  I do remain concerned about funding for several HUD programs and I \nhope that there will be an opportunity in conference to revisit these \naccounts and provide some additional funding. In particular, the \nfailure to fund incremental section 8 vouchers will cause a real \nhardship for the thousands of families across the country on wait lists \nfor rental assistance. In Vermont alone the wait for Section 8 rental \nassistance can stretch for years and some lists have been closed \ncompletely because of\n\n[[Page S11250]]\n\nthe extensive wait. The booming economy is great for business but not \nso good for low-income families who are finding themselves priced out \nof the housing market. More and more people in Vermont and throughout \nthe country are paying more than 30 percent of their income for \nhousing. Last year Congress authorized 100,000 vouchers for FY 2000. \nThe Administration has included those vouchers in their budget request. \nWe should include funding for those vouchers in the FY 2000 VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill.\n  I would also like to voice my concern for the funding provided for \nthe Youthbuild program and for the Neighborhood Reinvestment \nCorporation. Youthbuild is a wonderful example of a program that is \nhelping develop leadership skills in at-risk youth while providing much \nneeded affordable housing. The program has been an unqualified success \nin Vermont where Youthbuild participants have constructed and \nrehabilitated affordable housing in Burlington's Enterprise Community. \nFrom weatherizing homes to building single and multi-family housing, \nYouthbuild Burlington has proven the value of this program in investing \nat-risk youth in their communities while building skills for the \nfuture, and meeting the critical need for quality affordable housing in \nBurlington. Earlier this year I joined 49 of my colleagues in a letter \nto Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski supporting a $75 million \nappropriation for the Youthbuild program. Unfortunately the bill we are \nconsidering includes only $42.5 million for this valuable program. The \nDepartment's ability to offer grants to new Youthbuild programs or \nprovide additional support for existing programs would be greatly \nreduced by this funding level. I hope that we will be able to increase \nfunding for Youthbuild in Conference.\n  The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) is another important \nHUD program which received a significant funding cut. This bill reduces \nfunding for the NRC by a third. The NRC has been an invaluable partner \nin the drive to increase home ownership in Vermont and throughout the \nnation. Four homeownership centers in Vermont are currently \nimplementing the Neighborworks model of ``full cycle lending'' which \nhas made such a difference in bringing the opportunity of homeownership \nto lower income families in my state. Time after time, these \nhomeownership centers have allowed families who would not otherwise \nhave been considered by commercial lenders, to secure mortgages for \naffordable homes, and helped families who would otherwise have suffered \nforeclosure remain in their homes. The level of funding proposed in the \nSenate bill would prevent 12,000 families currently in the pipeline \nfrom receiving further assistance, and would result in 8,700 fewer \nfamilies realizing the dream of homeownership and 80,000 families not \nreceiving homebuyer or foreclosure prevention counseling. I hope that \nwe can prevent those results by providing additional funding for this \nvaluable program in conference.\n  Finally, I would like to once again express my support for the \nCommunity Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) program. The Senate \nbill provides $80 million for this important program, $15 million below \nlast year's level and $45 million below the President's request. The \nCDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted with \noverwhelming bi-partisan support several years ago. The program is an \nimportant investment tool for economically distressed communities. CDFI \nleverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. This \nprogram is working effectively in communities across the country, and I \nbelieve additional resources are needed to maximize the value of this \nimportant federal investment.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond \nduring conference to secure additional funding for these programs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to FEMA's \nproposed Public Assistance Insurance Rule that is currently pending at \nthe Office of Management and Budget. The rule is referenced in the \nreport language of both the House and Senate VA/HUD Appropriations \nbills.\n  I support FEMA's efforts to reduce the costs of federal disasters. \nHowever, the proposed rule, in its current form, would require public \ninstitutions to purchase ``all hazard'' insurance for public buildings. \nThis includes local school districts, cities, non-profit hospitals, \nuniversities and other non-profits.\n  California risk managers and insurance brokers have told me there \ncurrently is no insurance available to public institutions. They would \nbe unable to obtain, at any price, the coverage required by the FEMA \nrule.\n  Even if insurance were to be available, it is highly unlikely that \nthe individual insurers would be able to pay out in the event of a \ncatastrophic earthquake. The financial implications for California are \nenormous and should be considered before implementing the proposed FEMA \nrule.\n  During Committee markup, I was told by Senator Bond that cities and \ncounties that could not obtain hazard insurance would be exempt from \nthe FEMA rule. FEMA says this is not the case. I believe the FEMA \nproposal is ambiguous in many areas and it needs to be more thoroughly \nexamined. I am concerned that FEMA may be rushing to implement this \nregulation without a thorough understanding of its true impact.\n  The House VA-HUD bill requests a GAO study of this issue before \nmoving forward with the proposed rule. The Senate bill makes no mention \nof a GAO study, and supports the proposed rule change. It is my sincere \nhope that we can work together to develop an approach similar to that \nof the House. I believe that we must have an independent analysis of \nthis important and potentially costly issue before it is finalized.\n\n\n                             KYOTO PROTOCOL\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, pages 78 and 79 of the fiscal year 2000 \nVA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill and page 83 of the \naccompanying Committee Report contain language regarding implementation \nof the Kyoto Protocol. During the debate on this appropriation last \nyear, we agreed that EPA should not use appropriated funds for the \npurpose of issuing regulations to implement the Kyoto Protocol, unless \nand until such treaty is ratified by the United States. We also agreed \nthat our intent was not to interfere with important and on-going \nvoluntary energy conservation and climate change related programs and \ninitiatives--such as the Climate Challenge program, Green Lights, \nEnergy Star, the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles. These \nprograms have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy \nefficiency across a broad range of domestic industrial sectors. These \nprograms make sense for other reasons as well, including saving \nconsumers and businesses money, creating export opportunities, reducing \nour dependence on foreign oil, and addressing local air pollution \nproblems.\n  I ask the distinguished manager of the bill, Senator Bond, whether \nthe language in the bill and the report this year maintain the \nagreement that we reached last year on this issue?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The language cited by the Senator \nreflects the agreement reached on this issue during the conference last \nyear. Previously funded, ongoing projects and voluntary initiatives can \ngo forward. We expect the agency to spend the money in an effective and \nappropriate manner.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                            bethune-cookman\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, \nSenator Graham, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator Bond, in \na colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an \nimportant priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in \nthis bill. Last year, the public housing reform act passed by Congress \ncontained authorization for the construction of a community services \nstudent union building at Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, \nFlorida. Accordingly, we included this project as one of our important \npriorities for the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I join my friend from Florida in support of this project. \nThe building will serve as a full-service facility not only for the \ncollege's 2,300 students, but also the 28,000 citizens of West Daytona \nBeach. The facility would allow the college to expand its long record \nof exemplary service to low-income and disadvantaged residents in the \ncommunity. I would appreciate the Chairman working with his\n\n[[Page S11251]]\n\ncolleagues on the conference to find funding for this important project \nin FY 2000.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Florida for their \ncomments and I appreciate their support for the facility. Should this \nmatter come before the conference, you can be assured I will give it \ndue consideration. I thank my friends for bringing this matter to my \nattention.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances.\n\n\n                Reusable and Alternative Water Projects\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, \nSenator Graham, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator Bond, in \na colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of two \ncritical projects in Florida that did not receive funding in this bill. \nThe first is the City of West Palm Beach's water reuse project. This \nwetlands-based potable water reuse program is critical not only to the \nwater supply of the City of West Palm Beach but also to the Everglades \nrestoration effort.\n  During dry season, the City takes water from Lake Okeechobee which is \na critical primary source of water for the Everglades. West Palm Beach \nis attempting to eliminate this water use through their innovative \nwater reuse project. The City has received federal support in each of \nthe past three fiscal years. Work is progressing on schedule, but a \nfinal installment of federal funding is needed to complete the work and \nbring the project on line.\n  I would point out to the Chairman that this project is funded in the \nHouse VA/HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. I would urge \nthe Chairman to work with our House colleagues during the upcoming \nconference to ensure that funding for this critical project is \ncompleted in this fiscal year.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend from \nFlorida and understand the importance of this project to his State. I \nwill do all I can with my colleagues in the House to secure funding for \nthis project during the conference.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \nChairman for a moment to address another important project to the State \nof Florida, the Alternative Water Source Projects. These central \nFlorida water projects are providing valuable assistance to local \ngovernments in devising alternative and expanded water supplies for the \nregion. To date, the federal government has provided $46.6 million \ntoward this important effort. This project was also funded in the House \nof Representatives but did not receive funding in this bill. I would \nalso appreciate the Chairman's consideration of Florida's ongoing \nwater-related needs as this bill goes to conference with the House.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida for his \ncomments and understand the merits of this project. I would like to \nassure both my colleagues that I will do my best to work with the other \nmembers of the conference to provide funding for this project.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances.\n\n\n                            water treatment\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend from Florida, \nSenator Graham, to engage the distinguished Chairman, Senator Bond, in \na colloquy. Specifically, I wish to make the Chairman aware of an \nimportant priority for the State of Florida which was not funded in \nthis bill. The city of Sarasota, Florida has long been working with the \nfederal government to address its water treatment system problems. Many \nof the city's residents are still on septic tanks and the federal \ngovernment has been interested in addressing this problem because of \npolluted runoff into the Sarasota Bay National Estuary.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would agree with the comments of my Florida colleague \nand add that the federal government has been working through the \nNational Estuary Program to help it address this problem in previous \nyears. During this year's appropriations process, we requested a grant \nout of the State and tribal assistance grant portion of this bill to \ncontinue this process. It would be my hope that the Chairman would work \nwith us and with the other members of the upcoming conference committee \nto find funding for this project. It has the full support of Florida's \nHouse delegation and I would appreciate the Chairman's support as we \nmove toward the next stage of the process.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friends from Florida for their \ncomments and I am familiar with this project from previous years. If an \nopportunity arises in the conference to fund it, I will work with my \ncolleagues from the House to do so. I thank my friends for bringing \nthis matter to my attention.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Chairman for his assurances.\n\n\n          northeast states for coordinated air use management\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from Missouri for his \ndiligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. \nUnder these constraints, you were able to increase funding for the \nEnvironmental Programs and Management over Fiscal Year 1999. However, \none very important organization in the Northeast was not funded this \nyear. For more than a decade, this body has supported an organization \ncalled the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management or \n(NESCAUM) with a modest $300,000 line item. NESCAUM is a non-profit \norganization that provides technical assistance to the Northeast states \nand the nation on a host of important air quality issues. By providing \nrecommendations for consistent regional action, NESCAUM helps both \nstates and regulated industry avoid a costly patchwork of differing \nregulatory requirements. While I know that this is a very difficult \nyear, I believe that NESCAUM provides a valuable service and is \nstrongly supported by the Senators from our region. At a minimum, I \nbelieve the Environmental Protection Agency should be encouraged to \nallocate $300,000 from the Environmental Programs and Management \naccount to NESCAUM.\n  Mr. BOND. I recognize that we have provided NESCAUM this support for \nmany years. The same can be said for several entities that do not \nreceive line-item funding in this year's legislation. However, \nrecognizing the broad support for NESCAUM's activities from a number of \nstates, I concur in supporting encouraging EPA that it seek to provide \nNESCAUM with $300,000 of general support consistent with previous \nyears.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him \nand the Environmental Protection Agency to continue the good work of \nthis organization. It has been a model of state collaboration. Most \nrecently, its efforts to develop market-based approaches to air quality \nimprovement have helped move our region toward specific steps to reduce \nemissions within our states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11251-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11251-S11253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I opposed the District of Columbia \nappropriations conference report for a number of reasons but the reason \nI speak out today is my grave concern with provisions in the report \nthat continue to prohibit the government of the District of Columbia \nfrom engaging in needle exchange programs. These valuable programs curb \nthe spread of HIV/AIDS by allowing injecting drug users to exchange \ntheir used, potentially contaminated needles for sterile ones. Yet, the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations conference report not only banned \nthe use of Federal funds but prohibited the District from using its own \nmonies to support this valuable program.\n  We in the Senate wisely did not include such a provision in the DC \nappropriations bill that passed this body, and it should not have been \nin the conference report.\n  Therefore, I opposed the conference report because it was an attack \non this city's public health. AIDS is the leading cause of death for \nD.C. residents ages 30 to 44, an AIDS death rate seven\n\n[[Page S11252]]\n\ntimes the national average. What this conference report did to needle \nexchange programs was both unnecessary and unjustifiable. Indeed, \nincluding a needle exchange prohibition in this conference report is a \nhazard to the public health.\n  The prohibition in this report is unnecessary because there was \nalready a ban on Federal funding for needle exchange programs. This ban \ndates to 1989, when Congress declared that no Federal funds could be \nspent to support needle exchange programs until there was scientific \nevidence that the programs, first, could reduce the spread of HIV and, \nsecond, did not encourage drug use. There are thus two main questions \nfacing us as we decide the fate of federal needle exchange program \nfunding: Do these programs achieve their public health purpose of \nslowing the spread of a deadly, infectious disease? And do these \nprograms compromise our drug abuse prevention efforts by encouraging \nillicit drug use? Science has provided answers to these questions.\n  A preponderance of evidence shows that needle exchange programs cause \na decrease in HIV infection rates. The National Institutes of Health \nfound that needle exchange programs reduce risk behaviors by as much as \n80 percent in injecting drug users while reducing HIV infection rates \nby an estimated 30 percent. In addition, a 1997 study published in \nLancet, the respected British medical journal, compared HIV \nseroprevalence over time among injecting drug users in 29 cities with \nneedle exchange programs and 52 cities without needle exchange \nprograms. While seroprevalence increased by 5.9 percent per year in the \n52 cities without needle exchange programs, it decreased by 5.8 percent \nper year in the 29 cities with programs.\n  Similarly, in the city of Baltimore, HIV infections among IV drug \nusers have declined 30 percent since the start of its needle exchange \nin 1993 while the infection rate has increased 5 percent in Baltimore \nCounty, which has no exchange program. Numerous studies also show that \nneedle exchange programs decrease needle sharing; decrease unsafe \ndisposal of syringes; decrease re-use and passing of syringes; and \nincrease needle disinfection.\n  Needle exchanges also do not encourage drug use--they compliment our \nefforts to stop drug use. Needle exchange programs can be linked with \ngreater entry of addicts into drug treatment. After using a needle \nexchange program for more than 6 months, 58 percent of participants \nreport having enrolled in detox or drug treatment. In New Haven, \nConnecticut, drug treatment entries doubled in the three years \nfollowing the opening to its needle exchange. In Tacoma, Washington, \nneedle exchange programs constitute the largest referral source for \ndrug treatment, accounting for 43 percent of treatment participants.\n  In addition, injection drug users referred by needle exchange \nprograms are more likely to enter drug treatment and to be retained, \neven in the face of the greater severity of drug use and psychosocial \nproblems common among this population. Needle exchanges therefore \nsupply a valuable opportunity to provide additional preventive services \nto difficult-to-reach individuals. Furthermore, studies show that \nneedle exchange programs decrease the frequency of injection among \nparticipants and do not tempt individuals to begin using drugs.\n  These overwhelmingly conclusive results have fostered wide support \nfor improving access to sterile needles. Groups supporting needle \nexchange programs include: the American Medical Association, the \nNational Institutes of Health, the National Academy of Sciences, the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, the American Foundation for AIDS Research, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, the National Association of County \n& City Health Officials, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. As a \nNational Institutes of Health Consensus Statement concludes ``There is \nno longer any doubt that these programs work, yet there is a striking \ndisjunction between what science dictates and what policy delivers. . . \n. Can the opposition to needle exchange in the United States be \njustified on scientific grounds? Our answer is simple and emphatic--\nno.''\n  Because of this evidence I believe policies that inhibit the creation \nand expansion of needle exchange programs are unjustifiable. I am \nbaffled and outraged by such policies. We all come to Washington to \nmake laws that help the American people, that combat social ills and \nthat raise the quality of life in our country. We all want to win the \nwar on drugs. We all want to stop the spread of HIV. So then why, when \nwe have evidence that needle exchange programs work, do we continue to \nput millions of citizens at unnecessary risk? Cutting funding to these \nprograms is a death sentence to thousands of men, women, and children.\n  I want you all to think for a moment about those children. It is \nimperative to realize that needle exchange programs go far beyond \naiding addicts; they protects the partners and children of addicts. 70 \npercent of cases of women of childbearing age with HIV are directly or \nindirectly linked to IV drug use, causing 75 percent of the cases of \nbabies born HIV positive to be the result of the use of dirty needles. \nFor this reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics supports needle \nexchange programs as a means of reducing the spread of HIV to infants, \nchildren and adolescents. These programs are pro-family and pro-child.\n  We should not be undermining the District of Columbia's local control \nof pubic health decisions and to setting a dangerous precedent for the \nmany states and localities that fund needle exchange programs through a \ncombination of local, state, and private funds. Right now more than 110 \ncommunities in 30 states use needle exchange programs to slow the \nspread of HIV. Despite continued lack of federal funding, needle \nexchange programs have expanded in terms of the number of syringes \nexchanged, the geographic distribution of programs, and the range of \nservices offered. Needle exchange programs were able to do this because \nthey are supported by two-thirds of the American people as well as many \nstate and local governments.\n  In Minnesota, needle exchange programs are an important component of \nefforts to decrease the transmission of HIV and to end drug use. \nMinnesota has two successful needle exchange programs. One program, \nWomen with a Point, has exchanged approximately 63,000 syringes in the \npast 18 months while providing on-site HIV testing, referrals for \nchemical abuse recovery programs, information on risk reduction \ntechniques and Hepatitis C, and case management for HIV positive \ninjection drug users. The other, Minnesota AIDS Project, has also \nexchanged thousands of needles and provided users with HIV testing, \nneedle disinfection kits, numerous services for HIV positive \nindividuals, and information about risk reduction techniques.\n  We must face the reality that the second most frequent reported risk \nbehavior for HIV infection is injecting drug use. Data from the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention indicate that approximately one-\nthird of AIDS cases in the United States are directly or indirectly \nassociated with injecting drug use. Moreover, according to a report in \nthe American Journal of Public Health, 50 percent of new HIV infections \nare occurring among injection drug users.\n  We know that lowering the rate of injection-related HIV infections \nrequires increasing the availability of drug treatment and increasing \naccess to clean needles. We have scientific evidence that broad \nimplementation of needle exchange programs would aid us in our battle \nagainst HIV.\n  In other words, we have scientific evidence that legal impediments to \nclean needle possession encourage high-risk behavior and do nothing to \nreduce drug use. We should not therefore be passing legislation that \nfurther hinders the establishment and expansion of needle exchange \nprograms. We should instead of pushing for the removal of the Federal \nban on funding--not enacting legislation that prohibits local \ngovernments, like the District of Columbia, from adopting good public \nhealth practices, practices that have been shown in communities across \nthe United States to reduce the circulation of contaminated needles and \nthe rate of HIV infection.\n  My colleagues in the Senate, President Clinton has threatened to veto \nthis conference report because of its unwarranted intrusion into the \npublic health of the citizens of the District of\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\nColumbia. And he is right. Colleagues, I ask you to avoid that veto, \nand to send this report back to the conference committee so this \nintrusion can be eliminated. Please join me and vote ``no'' on this \nconference report as it now reads.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11253-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to let my colleagues know \nthat I am a cosponsor of S. 1473, the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise \nCommunities Act. I believe this bill is an important step in the right \ndirection, though I still have serious concerns about the discrepancy \nof funding levels between rural and urban Empowerment Zones.\n  First, let me say I strongly support the Empowerment Zones/Enterprise \nCommunity concept. Areas that are designated as Empowerment Zones and \nEnterprise Communities combine tax credits and social service grants to \npromote long-term economic revitalization. These communities take a \ngrassroots approach to revitalization by building partnerships with \nlocal government, non-profit groups and the private sector--thus \nallowing the federal government to support the work done on a local \nlevel.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that Round II Empowerment Zones are \nnot fully funded and are not receiving the same tax benefits as Round I \nEmpowerment Zones. Will Rogers once said, ``I don't make jokes. I just \nwatch the government and report the facts.'' I'm afraid this holds all \ntoo true for those who have struggled to see the Round II Empowerment \nZones live up to their expectation. When the Griggs/Steele Empowerment \nZone in eastern North Dakota was designated a Round II Empowerment Zone \nlast year, the federal government made a commitment to help leaders in \nthese communities create jobs and economic opportunity. Unfortunately, \nhowever, this Empowerment Zone still hasn't received one dime of \nfederal funding. Those who live in the Griggs/Steele Empowerment Zone \nare now beginning to question the commitment of the federal government \nto make good on its promises.\n  I am co-sponsoring this bill because I think Congress has a \nresponsibility to do the right thing and fully fund Round II \nEmpowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities throughout this country. \nHaving said that, I am very concerned about the discrepancy in funding \nbetween rural and urban areas. Like far too many proposals we debate \nhere in Congress, this bill disproportionately grants much more funding \nfor urban areas than rural areas. Of the $1.75 billion this legislation \nwould provide over 9 years, urban areas receive almost 86% of the total \nfunding. Although I recognize that we've made some progress and \nnarrowed the gap that existed between rural and urban areas in the \noriginal proposal, I hope we can do more to help rural areas of this \ncountry currently facing so many challenges to economic prosperity.\n  Despite my concerns about the bill on these grounds, I am \ncosponsoring this legislation because I recognize that Empowerment \nZones and Enterprise Communities need this funding in a timely manner \nto accomplish the economic revitalization the federal government \npromised. I will continue to work to ensure that rural Round II EZ/ECs \nreceive the full funding and tax benefits they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11253-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Internet Tax Freedom Act to broaden its \nscope and make the moratorium permanent, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \ntoday which will ensure that Internet commerce remains free from \nburdensome, anti-consumer taxation. Simply, this bill would make \npermanent the moratorium on sales and use taxes for e-commerce, and \nwould encourage the Administration to urge our world trading partners \nto do the same.\n  I believed that this was the right approach last year. However, \nothers were concerned about the impact on so-called ``main street \nbusiness'' if such a prohibition against taxation of e-commerce was \nimplemented. Therefore, I agreed to a temporary moratorium to allow \nmore information to be gathered and those issues to be further \nconsidered. I now believe that additional information and further \nanalysis of\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\nInternet taxation issues confirms that indeed a complete moratorium is \nthe right approach, and we should act now to protect the engine of our \neconomy from unnecessary regulation and taxation.\n  In addition to the discussion here in the United States, protection \nof the Internet against international tariffs is also a topic of \ninterest to our trade partners. It is important for us to set the tone \nfor discussion with the international Internet community by \nestablishing the Internet as a world-wide ``tax-free zone.''\n  Conslusions included in a recent study completed by the respected \nauditing and consulting firm Ernst & Young supports passage of this \nlegislation. The report found that the total sales and use taxes not \ncollected by state and local governments from Internet e-commerce \ntransactions amounted to only ``one-tenth of one percent of total state \nand local sales and use tax collections.''\n  Further, Ernst & Young determined that the small effect of commerce \ntransaction on sales and use tax revenues is due to several factors, \nincluding the fact that ``an estimated 80% of current commerce is \nbusiness-to-business sales that are either not subject to sales and use \ntaxes or are effectively subject to use tax payments by in-state \nbusiness purchasers,'' ``an estimated 63 percent of e-commerce sales \nare for intangible services, such as travel and financial services, or \nexempt products, such as groceries and prescription drugs'' which are \nnot subject to tax in most states.\n  As a result, ``. . . only 13% of total e-commerce retail sale have \npotential sales and use tax collection issues.'' Thus, the nearly \ninfinitesimal effect on local revenues is not causing a financial \ncrisis for either states or local communities.\n  Mr. President, what is clear is that the issues raised in relation to \ne-commerce transactions are really broader policy issues related to a \nfair and equitable tax policy in this country. Debate on this larger \nissue needs to take place. The discussion includes not just Internet \nsales or even catalog sales, but all of the ramifications of taxing \nsales of goods across state and international boundaries.\n  We must look at the costs to small businesses of administering \ndifferent tax policies for each location in which it conducts business. \nWe need to look at the effects of taxation on consumers. And, we need \nto consider how taxes affect the United States' position as the world \nleader in technology application.\n  I look forward to the report in April from the panel commissioned \nlast year by Congress to explore these issues. Recent media accounts \nsuggest that they may not reach agreement on a plan to propose to \nCongress. I think it is important to move forward on ensuring that the \ndefault position absent a consensus proposal is not to lift the \nmoratorium, but to place the burden of proof on those advocating \ntaxation of e-commerce. This places the burden on those who support \ntaxation to provide both the rationale and a workable methodology. I \nwill be skeptical of both, but invite them to make their case and allow \nthe debate. This bill ensure, however, that we don't provide an \nincentive for inaction. This bill confirms that the right answer is to \nnot tax unless there is a good reason to, and unless there is a fair \nmechanism for doing so.\n  I look forward to debate on what is a fair tax system in the United \nStates, at both the national and state levels. However, while we \ncontinue that debate, we must also ensure that we do not perpetuate the \nproblems currently ingrained in our tax system by applying them to the \nInternet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MORATORIUM MADE PERMANENT; SCOPE.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``during the period beginning on October 1, \n     1998, and ending 3 years after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act--'' \n     and inserting ``after September 30, 1998:'';\n       (2) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in paragraph \n     (1);\n       (3) redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and\n       (4) inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) sales or use taxes for domestic or foreign goods or \n     services acquired through electronic commerce; and''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that United States \n     representatives to the World Trade Organization, and any \n     other multilateral trade organization of which the United \n     States is a member, should resolutely advocate that it is the \n     firm position of the United States that electronic commerce \n     conducted via the Internet should not be burdened by national \n     or local regulation, taxation, or the imposition of tariffs \n     on such commerce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1612. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain irrigation project property to certain irrigation and \nreclamation districts in the State of Nebraska; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n   the missouri river basin, middle loup division project facilities \n                             conveyance act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Hagel in \nintroducing the Missouri River Basin, Middle Loup Division Project \nFacilities Conveyance Act.\n  The bill provides for the transfer of title of irrigation project \nfacilities and lands from the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of \nInterior to the Middle Loup Division irrigation districts in central \nNebraska. These districts have operated the facilities there for over \n35 years.\n  The project facilities are part of the Missouri River Basin Project, \nand provide water from the Middle Loup River to over 64,000 acres of \nirrigable land, as well as providing recreating and fish and wildlife \nbenefits. Principal features of the projects include the Sherman Dam \nand Reservoir, the Arcadia Diversion Dam, the Milburn Diversion Dam, \nirrigation canals and laterals, drains and pumping plants.\n  Crops grown on these irrigated lands primarily include alfalfa, small \ngrains, sugar beets, and corn to provide feed for a thriving livestock-\nfeeding economy in my state of Nebraska, which includes beef cattle, \nhogs, and poultry.\n  In 1995, the Vice President indicated that the Bureau of Reclamation \nof the U.S. Department of Interior should transfer titles to allow \nlocal ownership of irrigation projects such as this. The Bureau has \nindicated to me that this project is a top candidate for title transfer \nto be achieved. This transfer also has the support of Nebraska's Game \nand Parks Commission as well as the Middle Loup Public Power and \nIrrigation District. When this legislation passes, Nebraska will become \nthe first state where title transfer efforts have been successful.\n  Two trust funds are to be created: one by the Districts and one by \nNebraska Game and Parks Commission. Those two trusts will be equally \nfunded from the proceeds of the transfer. Details of those two trusts \nare as follows:\n  First, a ``Nebraska-Middle Loup River Community Environmental Trust'' \nwill be created by the Districts and will be funded with the proceeds \nof the transfer from the power producers share of the total payments. \nThat fund will be administered and used by the Districts for \nenvironmental and conservation enhancements, to protect lands and \nfacilities in the area of the River Basin in which the project \nfacilities exist, and $500,000 of the funds will be used expressly for \ndrainage work required in the Middle Loup River valley near Loup City. \nThe funds cannot be used for routine operation and maintenance of the \nproject facilities.\n  And second, a ``Nebraska-Middle Loup River Game and Parks Trust'' \nwill be created by Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and will be \nfunded by the proceeds of the transfer from the District's share of the \ntotal payments. That fund will be administered and used by the Game and \nParks Commission to improve and enhance fisheries and recreation \nopportunities and to expand knowledge of water and land resources for \nenhancing project operations and improving the service of project \npurposes. Like the other trust, funds cannot be used for routine \noperations and maintenance of project facilities.\n  The irrigation projects and facilities were constructed between 1955 \nand 1966\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nunder authorities of the Flood Control Act of 1944, and are currently \noperated and maintained under contracts between the Bureau and the \nirrigation districts and power producers. The transfer will provide for \ntotal repayment of all outstanding obligations on behalf of the \nirrigation districts and power producers, while retaining all current \nuses and purposes for the projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \ndevelop within the Department of Veterans Affairs a system for \ncollecting payments under the Medical Care Cost Recovery Program that \nutilizes collection practices similar to private collection practices, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                    Better Medical Cost Collections\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nincrease the funding available to the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) without requiring an additional appropriation from the Congress \nfor that chronically short-changed agency. The bill would improve VA's \nability to collect insurance costs from third-party providers, \ngenerating new financial flows to the VA and benefiting all American \nveterans.\n  My colleagues are well aware that the President's budget request for \nthe VA--scandalously, the fourth year in a row of effectively flat \nbudget requests for the agency--falls fully $3 billion short of what is \nneeded for veterans' medical care in fiscal 2000, according to some of \nour most prominent veterans service organizations. Congress has tried \nto make up for this shortfall, but budget caps and competing priorities \nhave made that effort exceedingly difficult. I previously wrote to the \nChairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee and the Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee to urge them to add fully $3 billion in \nfunding for veterans medical care. Nonetheless, I congratulate the \nAppropriations Committee for adding $1.1 billion in new money for \nveterans medical care.\n  The 1997 Balanced Budget Act gave VA the authority to retain \ncollections from private insurers for veterans health care as part of \nan agreement to free VA funding. However, VA has proven incapable of \neffectively collecting these private insurance payments. In fiscal \n1996, VA sought recovery of about $1.6 billion it was owed by private \ninsurers but recovered only $563 million, or 35 percent of the billed \namount and a 3 percent decrease in collections from the previous year. \nThat decline continued in fiscal 1997, when collections totaled $524 \nmillion, and in fiscal 1998, when collections totaled about $562 \nmillion. A 1998 Coopers and Lybrand study comparing VA and private-\nsector cost-recovery confirmed that VA's medical collection program is \nineffective confirmed that VA's medical collection program is \nineffective and delinquent. In short, the VA loses hundreds of millions \nof dollars in revenue every year that could be used to provide enhanced \nservices to America's veterans, rather than be written off by \ngovernment book-keepers.\n  The Independent Budget prepared by AMVETS, Disabled American \nVeterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars \nexplicitly calls for Congress to give VA the authority to privatize its \nMedical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) program. This legislation would \nmandate that VA privately contract for those collections for a period \nof three years, during which the VA would develop an internal process \nto improve medical cost recovery.\n  I am open to suggestions from other Members of Congress and our \nveterans service organizations regarding other means to improve VA cost \ncollection firm private insurers, and I note the Appropriations \nCommittee's requirement for a VA study on this issue. However, I \nbelieve this legislation offers a near-term way to collect these much-\nneeded funds.\n  Our veterans are being short-changed by their government, which \npledged to support and care for them in exchange for their honorable \nservice. I was proud when the Senate passed legislation Senator \nWellstone and I sponsored to add $3 billion in budget authority for the \nVA earlier this year. Unfortunately, we could not come up with a \nmatching appropriation, although I applaud the increased funding for VA \nhealth care contained in the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. But we can \nempower the VA to improve its Medical Care Cost Recovery program in a \nway that increases VA revenues, thereby enhancing care for America's \nveterans. I hope every Member of Congress would agree that they have \nearned it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEVELOPMENT WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                   OF SYSTEM OF COLLECTIONS UNDER MEDICAL CARE \n                   COST RECOVERY PROGRAM USING PRIVATE COLLECTION \n                   PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Development of Proposal.--(1) The Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall develop a proposal for a system within the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs for the collection of payments \n     from third party payers under the Medical Care Cost Recovery \n     Program of the Department which system shall, to the maximum \n     extent practicable, utilize procedures for the collection of \n     payments from third parties similar to the procedures \n     utilized in the private sector for the collection of payments \n     for health care costs from third parties.\n       (2) In developing the proposal, the Secretary shall \n     consider a variety of procedures utilized in the private \n     sector for the collection of payments for health care costs \n     from third parties.\n       (b) Use of Private Cost-Recovery Entities During \n     Development.--(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary shall, during the period referred to in \n     paragraph (3), provide for the collection of payments from \n     third party payers under the Medical Care Cost Recovery \n     Program solely through appropriate private entities with \n     which the Secretary contracts for that purpose.\n       (2) The fee paid a private entity for the collection of \n     payments under a contract under this subsection shall be a \n     contingent fee based on the amount of payments collected by \n     the entity under the contract.\n       (3) The period referred to in this paragraph is the period \n     beginning as soon as practicable after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and ending on the date that is six \n     months after the date on which the Secretary commences \n     collections under the Medical Care Cost Recovery Program \n     through a system within the Department under this section.\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\n       (c) Safeguards.--The Secretary shall take appropriate \n     actions to ensure that any collection practices utilized \n     under this section do not impose unwarranted financial or \n     other burdens upon veterans who receive medical care from the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs.\n       (d) Submittal of Proposal.--Not later than three years \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the proposal developed \n     under subsection (a).

A bill to promote primary and secondary health promotion and \ndisease prevention services and activities among the elderly, to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to add preventive benefits, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         medicare wellness act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Chafee, Senator Bryan, Senator Rockefeller, \nand Senator Kerry to introduce the Medicare Wellness Act. The Medicare \nWellness Act represents a concerted effort by myself and my \ndistinguished colleagues to change the fundamental focus of the \nMedicare program.\n  It changes the program from one that simply treats illness and \ndisability, to one that is also proactive. It enhances the focus on \nhealth promotion and disease prevention for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, despite common misperceptions, declines in health \nstatus are not inevitable with age. A healthier lifestyle, even one \nadopted later in life, can increase active life expectancy and decrease \ndisability. This fact is a major reason why the Medicare Wellness Act \nhas support from a broad range of groups, including the National \nCouncil on Aging, Partnership for Prevention, American Heart \nAssociation, and the National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n  The most significant aspect of this bill is its addition of several \nnew preventative screening and counseling benefits to the Medicare \nprogram. The benefits being added focus on some of the most prominent, \nunderlying risk factors for illness that face all Medicare \nbeneficiaries, including: screening for hypertension, counseling for \ntobacco cessation, screening for glaucoma, counseling for hormone \nreplacement therapy, screening for vision and hearing loss, expanded \nscreening and counseling for osteoporosis, and screening for \ncholesterol.\n  The new benefits added by the Medicare Wellness Act represent the \nhighest recommendations for Medicare beneficiaries of the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force--recognized as the gold standard within \nthe prevention community. Attacking these prominent risk factors will \nreduce Medicare beneficiaries' risk for health problems such as stroke, \ndiabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, and blindness.\n  The addition of these new benefits would accelerate the fundamental \nshift, that began in 1997 under the Balanced Budget Act, in the \nMedicare program from a sickness program to a wellness program. Prior \nto 1997, only three preventive benefits were available to \nbeneficiaries: pneumococcal vaccines, pap smears, and mammography.\n  Other major components of our bill include the establishment of the \nHealthy Seniors Promotion Program. This program will be led by an \ninteragency work group within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. It will bring together all the agencies within HHS that \naddress the medical, social and behavioral issues affecting the elderly \nand instructs them to undertake a series of studies which will increase \nknowledge about and utilization of prevention services among the \nelderly.\n  In addition, the Medicare Wellness Act incorporates an aggressive \napplied and original research effort that will investigate ways to \nimprove the utilization of current and new preventive benefits and to \ninvestigate new methods of improving the health of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this latter point is critical. The fact is that there \nare a number of prevention-related services available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries today, including mammograms and colorectal cancer \nscreening. But those services are seriously underutilized.\n  In a study published by Dartmouth University this spring (The \nDartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1999), it was found that only 28 percent \nof women age 65-69 receive mammograms and only 12 percent of \nbeneficiaries were screened for colorectal cancer. These are disturbing \nfigures and they clearly demonstrate the need to find new and better \nways to increase the rates of utilization of proven, demonstrated \nprevention services. Our bill would get us the information we need to \nincrease rates of utilization for these services.\n  Further, our bill would establish a health risk appraisal and \neducation program aimed at major behavioral risk factors such as diet, \nexercise, alcohol and tobacco use, and depression. This program will \ntarget both pre-65 individuals and current Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The main goal of this program is to increase awareness among \nindividuals of major risk factors that impact on health, to change \npersonal health habits, improve health status, and save the Medicare \nprogram money. Our bill would require the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, known as MedPAC, to report to Congress every two years and \nassess how the program needs to change over time in order to reflect \nmodern benefits and treatment.\n  Shockingly, this is information that Congress currently does not \nreceive on a routine basis. And this is a contributing factor to why we \nfind ourselves today in a quandary over the outdated nature of the \nMedicare program. Quite frankly, Medicare hasn't kept up with the rest \nof the health care world.\n  While a vintage wine from the 1960s may be desirable, a health care \nsystem that is vintage 1965 is not. We need to do better.\n  Our bill would also require the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to \nconduct a study every five years to assess the scientific validity of \nthe entire preventive benefits package. The study will be presented to \nCongress in a manner that mirrors The Trade Act of 1974.\n  The IOM's recommendations would be presented to Congress in \nlegislative form. Congress would then have 60 days to review and then \neither accept or reject the IOM's recommendations for changes to the \nMedicare program. But Congress could not change the IOM's \nrecommendations.\n  This ``fast-track'' process is a deliberate effort to get Congress \nout of the business of micro-managing the Medicare program. While \nlimited to preventive benefits, this will offer a litmus test on a new \napproach to future Medicare decision making.\n  In the aggregate, The Medicare Wellness Act represents the most \ncomprehensive legislative proposal in the 106th Congress for the \nMedicare program focused on health promotion and disease prevention for \nbeneficiaries. It provides new screening and counseling benefits for \nbeneficiaries, it provides critically needed research dollars, and it \ntests new treatment concepts through demonstration programs.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act represents sound health policy based on \nsound science. Before I conclude, I have a few final thoughts.\n  There are many here in Congress who argue that at a time when \nMedicare faces an uncertain financial future, this is the last time to \nbe adding new benefits to a program that can ill afford the benefits it \ncurrently offers.\n  Normally I would agree with this assertion. But the issue of \nprevention is different. The old adage of ``an ounce of prevention is \nworth a pound of cure'' is very relevant here.\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\n  Does making preventive benefits available to Medicare beneficiaries \n``cost'' money? Sure it does. But the return on the investment, the \navoidance of the pound of cure and the related improvement in quality \nof life is unmistakable.\n  Along these lines, a longstanding problem facing lawmakers and \nadvocates of prevention has been the position taken by the \nCongressional Budget Office, as it evaluates the budgetary impact of \nall legislative proposals.\n  Only costs incurred by the Federal government over the next ten years \ncan be considered in weighing the ``cost'' of adding new benefits. From \na public health and quality of life standpoint, this premise is \nunacceptable.\n  Among the problems with this practice is that ``savings'' incurred by \nincreasing the availability and utilization of preventive benefits \noften occur over a period of time greater than 10 years. This problem \nis best illustrated in an examination of the ``compression of \nmorbidity'' theory developed by Dr. James Fries of Stanford University \nover 20 years ago.\n  According to Dr. Fries, by delaying the onset of chronic illness \namong seniors, there is a resulting decrease in the length of time \nillness or disability is present in the latter stages of life. This \n``compression'' improves quality of life and reduces the rate of growth \nin health care costs. But, these changes are gradual and occur over an \nextended period of time--10, 20, even 30 years.\n  With the average life expectancy of individuals who reach 65 being \nnearly 20 years--20 years for women and 18 years for men--it only makes \nsense to look at services and benefits that improve quality of life and \nreduce costs to the Federal government for that 20 year lifespan.\n  In addition to increased lifespan, a ten year budget scoring window \ndoesn't factor into consideration the impact of such services on the \nprivate sector, such as increased productivity and reduced absenteeism, \nfor the many seniors that continue working beyond age 65. The bottom \nline is, the most important reason to cover preventive services is to \nimprove health.\n  As the end of the century nears, children born now are living nearly \n30 years longer than children born in 1900.\n  While prevention services in isolation won't reduce costs, they will \nmoderate increases in the utilization and spending on more expensive \nacute and chronic treatment services.\n  As Congress considers different ways to reform Medicare, two basic \nquestions regarding preventive services and the elderly must be part of \nthe debate.\n  (1) Is the value of improved quality of life worth the expenditure? \nAnd,\n  (2) How important is it for the Medicare population to be able to \nmaintain healthy, functional and productive lives?\n  These are just some of the questions we must answer in the coming \ndebate over Medicare reform.\n  While improving Medicare's financial outlook for future generations \nis imperative, we must do it in a way that gives our seniors the \nability to live longer, healthier and valued lives. I believe that by \npursuing a prevention strategy that addresses some of the most \nfundamental risk factors for chronic illness and disability that face \nseniors, we will make an invaluable contribution to the Medicare reform \ndebate and, more importantly, to our children and grandchildren.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss in pointing out that the \nMedicare Wellness Act represents the first time in this Congress that \nRepublicans and Democrats have gotten together in support of a major \npiece of Medicare reform legislation. This bill represents a health \ncare philosophy that bridges political boundaries. It just makes sense. \nAnd you see that common sense approach today from myself and my \nesteemed colleagues who have joined me in the introduction of this \nbill.\n   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join us on this \nimportant bill and to work with us to ensure that the provisions of \nthis bill are reflected in any Medicare reform legislation that is \ndebated and voted on this year in the Senate.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Graham, to introduce the Medicare Wellness Act of 1999. This \nlegislation will modernize Medicare benefits and improve the preventive \ncare received by our nation's seniors.\n  The Medicare program was designed in 1965 to provide seniors with \naccess to the same health care services enjoyed under private health \ninsurance plans. Medical science has grown by leaps and bounds in the \ndecades since that time. Most of the private sector acted swiftly to \ncover preventive benefits when they realized that it is cheaper to \nscreen for an illness and treat its early diagnosis than to pay for \ndrastic procedures in a hospital later on. Congress has been too slow \nin extending to Medicare beneficiaries the same advances in quality \ncare enjoyed throughout the rest of the health care system.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act adds to the Medicare program those benefits \nrecommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. These include: \nscreening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, screening \nfor glaucoma, counseling for hormone replacement therapy, screening for \nvision and hearing loss, expanded screening and counseling for \nosteoporosis, and cholesterol screening. These are some of the most \nprominent risk factors facing Medicare beneficiaries. If these symptoms \nare addressed regularly, beneficiaries will have a head start on \nfighting the conditions they lead to, such as diabetes, lung cancer, \nheart disease, blindness, osteoporosis, and many others.\n  Beyond the eight new preventive benefits under this bill, the \nInstitute of Medicine (IOM) will conduct a study every five years to \nassess the scientific validity and cost-effectiveness of the preventive \nbenefits package. When presented to Congress, the study will recommend \nwhat, if any, preventive benefits should be added, or removed from the \nMedicare program. By facing such regularly scheduled considerations of \npreventive benefits, Congress will do a much better job of keeping the \nMedicare program up to date with the rapid advances in medical science.\n  The Medicare Wellness Act also instructs the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and the Health Care Financing Administration to establish a \nRisk Appraisal and Education Program. This program will target both \ncurrent beneficiaries and individuals with high risk factors below the \nage of 65. Outreach to these groups will offer questions regarding \nmajor behavioral risk factors, including the lack of proper nutrition, \nthe use of alcohol, the lack of regular exercise, the use of tobacco, \nand depression. State of the art software, case managers, and nurse \nhotlines will then identify what conditions beneficiaries are at risk \nfor, based on their individual responses to the questions, and inform \nthem of actions they can take to lead a healthier life.\n  Any modern health care professional can tell you that effective \nhealth care addresses the whole health of an individual. A lifestyle \nthat includes proper exercise and nutrition, and access to regular \ndisease screening ensures attention to the whole individual, not just a \nsolitary body part. It is time we reaffirm our commitment to provide \nour nation's seniors with quality health care.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senators Graham, Chafee, Bryan, \nRockefeller, and Kerry for their dedication to the idea of changing \nMedicare from a sickness program to a wellness program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Roberts, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Dorgan, and \n        Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 1619.

Today, our Nation is being injured by the \nrefusal of\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\nsome foreign countries to comply with World Trade Organization, WTO, \ndispute settlement rulings. Let me repeat that. Other countries are \nfailing to comply with the rulings of the WTO. As many of my colleagues \nknow, the WTO has a very detailed process for handling trade disputes \nbetween member nations. Unfortunately, some member nations are simply \nundermining this entire process by refusing to comply with the final \ndispute settlement decision, even after losing their cases on appeal.\n  Noncompliance with dispute settlement rulings severely undermines \nopen and fair trade. As many of our farmers, cattle ranchers, and large \nand small businessowners know firsthand, this is having a devastating \nimpact on their efforts and attempt to maintain or gain access to \nimportant new international markets.\n  In an effort to secure compliance, the dispute settlement process \nprovides the winning nation the authority to retaliate. The winning \nnation, after a decision has been made, can legally retaliate. That is \nwhat the provision is; they can retaliate against that losing nation. \nThey can do so if, at the end of a reasonable period of time, the \nlosing country does not abide by the final decision. Retaliation \nusually begins with the estimation of damages caused by the refusal, \nfollowed then by WTO authorization to impose penalty duties on the \noffending country's exports. However, even with retaliation, some \nnations are still refusing to comply.\n  The European Union has made it clear that it is willing to live in \nperpetuity with the present U.S. retaliation lists, which is why the \nWTO ruled in both the pending beef and banana trade cases that the \nUnited States can impose retaliatory tariffs on European imports. We \nare doing that. Moreover, they are entertaining the possibility of \nsubsidizing their affected domestic targets to counter our WTO-\nauthorized action. Not only are they ignoring what the ruling was, not \nonly are they ignoring our retaliation, now they are turning around and \npreparing to subsidize these particular products. Both of these trade \ncases that I have mentioned took several long years to work through the \ndispute settlement system and were undertaken, frankly, at great \nexpense to the U.S. Government and to the private sector in our \ncountry.\n  The European Union's actions are establishing a very dangerous \nprecedent. If they are successful, then other nations can be expected \nto follow a similar course. Something simply must be done. Something \nmust be done to increase the likelihood of compliance, or we risk \nlosing more than a WTO case; we risk losing American jobs. Therefore, \nit is important that the WTO's dispute settlement process be \nstrengthened. That is what this bill does, and that is what we are \ntalking about today.\n  Our proposed Carousel Retaliation Act will help ensure the integrity \nof the WTO settlement dispute process because it will provide a \npowerful mechanism that will place considerable pressure on \nnoncompliant countries to comply. The measure will shake these \nnoncompliant countries up and it will complicate any effort they \nundertake to counter U.S. retaliatory measures. Specifically, our bill \nwould amend the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 by requiring the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to periodically carousel--or rotate--the list of goods \nsubject to retaliation when a foreign country or countries have failed \nto comply with a WTO ruling. Let me add that this is very clearly \nconsistent with WTO rules.\n  Under our bill, the retaliation list would be carouseled, or rotated, \nto affect other goods 120 days from the date the first list is made, \nand then every 180 days thereafter. The bill provides the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative the authority to make exceptions. The representative \nwould not have to do this if, 1, it could be determined that compliance \nis imminent; or, 2, if both the U.S. Trade Representative and the \naffected petitioners agree that carouseling in that particular case is \nnot necessary. Currently, the U.S. Trade Representative has the \nauthority to carousel retaliation lists, but is not required to do so. \nWhat our bill does is change the law and requires the Trade \nRepresentative to do this.\n  The WTO is one of the most important means for American businesses \nand producers to open foreign markets, liberalize commerce, resolve \ndisputes, and ensure more open and fair trade. American farmers and \nagribusiness, for example, are major net exporters, posting exports of \nmore than $57 billion in 1997. But frankly we can do more and better, \nand we must. Of the nearly 50 complaints filed by the United States in \nthe WTO, almost 30 percent involved agriculture. If countries fail to \ncomply with WTO rulings, American agriculture and other U.S. sectors in \nneed of trade relief will suffer greatly. The American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American \nMeat Institute, the U.S. Meat Export Federation, and the Hawaii Banana \nIndustry Association support the bill.\n  The ``Carousel Retaliation Act,'' candidly, is tough, but it is meant \nto be tough. It is the right response to chronic noncompliance with WTO \nrules.\n  Again, I commend my colleague, Senator Hagel, who is on the floor at \nthis moment, and Senators Lott, Akaka, Inouye, Roberts, Bunning, \nVoinovich, Dorgan, and Conrad for their dedication to this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join this effort to protect our Nation from \nillegal foreign trade practices and cosponsor the ``Carousel \nRetaliation Act.''\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I see my colleague from Nebraska is on the floor. I suspect he would \nlike to talk about this bill as well.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague \nand friend from Ohio for his leadership on the ``Carousel Retaliation \nAct.''\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\n  I am a free trader, but I am also a fair trader. Trade is our \neconomic future. It is especially so in agriculture. Trade is our \nstrongest engine of economic growth.\n  I, as have many of my colleagues, have fought for legislative reform \non unilateral sanctions policies that hurt our trade, trade reform, \nfast-track authority for the President, and other trade-related \nlegislation.\n  Free trade is a two-way street. Unfortunately, throughout the world \nthe instinct for protectionism still remains strong. If trading \npartners take advantage of us, we can't simply remain passive and \npermit American exporters--especially farmers and ranchers--to continue \nto take a beating in foreign markets.\n  Trade is a two-way street. Free, fair, and open trade is a two-way \nstreet. Access to markets improves all people's standard of living. \nSome of our trading partners believe this. Some people talk about it, \nand some people actually do something about it. Unfortunately, many of \nour trading partners' rhetoric is stronger than their actions. That is \nwhy I am an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  As you heard from my colleague, Senator DeWine, this bill would \nrequire the U.S. Trade Representative to periodically review a \nretaliation list of foreign products from countries that fail to comply \nwith the World Trade Organization rulings or do not reduce trade \nbarriers against the United States. Different products would be rotated \non and off the list every few months until the offending countries made \nthe right changes in trade policy.\n  That is what we as a community of nations of civilized people decided \nto do when we formed the World Trade Organization. That is what the \nWorld Trade Organization is about--to sort through disputes in trade. \nIf we cannot rely on the World Trade Organization to make tough \ndecisions, settle those disputes, and then enforce the WTO rulings, \nthen what good is the organization?\n  If the members of the World Trade Organization find some rulings \nagainst their own self-interest and not in compliance with what they \nthink is right, or if they believe they must pick and choose which WTO \nrulings they will enforce and live with, then we don't have much of an \nopen, fair, and free trade organization that today is known as the \nWorld Trade Organization. It is a myth and it is a charade unless we \nall comply with the WTO rulings and enforce the rulings. That is the \nonly way it will work.\n  The policy of targeted tariffs is prompted, quite honestly, by the \nEuropean Union's ban on American beef. There is no scientific evidence \nto support the European Union's contention that using growth-enhancing \nhormones in cattle poses any health threat to humans. There is no \nscientific evidence at all.\n  But yet, even though we have won case after case in the World Trade \nOrganization, the European Union continues to walk through this charade \nof artificial tariffs and barriers. The hormone argument is a very \nflimsy excuse, at best, for straight out, raw protectionism. The WTO's \nrecent position vindicating their position was essentially a slap on \nthe wrist for the EU, and still the EU is trying to delay compliance \nwith even this token penalty.\n  If the EU keeps playing games with the United States in the hormone-\nenhancing beef issue, this policy of targeted tariffs will provide us \nwith a flexible, effective way to respond. No one wants to take this \nkind of action. But each one of us in this body represents hard-working \nconstituents who seek to improve their communities, enhance the growth \nof their families, give the world opportunities, and playing by the \nrules. That is what we are talking about here--playing by the rules \nstraight out, to be honest.\n  Again, I don't look forward to working on this bill to implement it \nif, in the interest of open, fair, and free trade, we must resort to \nthis kind of activity. American farmers and ranchers are hurting partly \nbecause of weak export markets. It is not because they are not \nproducing quality products. We produce quality products. But it is \nbecause of politics and protectionism.\n  I strongly support this bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. \nI am sorry we have to take this measure, but it is necessary. And the \nworld must understand that the United States will do whatever it takes \nto support our producers and to assure, as best we can, that the world \nimproves all people's lives, all people's standard of living, hope, \nopportunity, and economic growth if we continue to make progress with \nfree, open, fair trade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 1620. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey \ncertain land to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission permit holders; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           MOUNT BAKER SNOQUALMIE NATIONAL FOREST LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in recent years, I have become \nincreasingly frustrated with the inability of the Forest Service to \ncomplete work on several small hydroelectric projects located on the \nMount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest in my State. The Service's \ninability to make important decisions on these renewable energy \nresources is based on an inaccurate interpretation of the President's \nNorthwest Forest Plan (``ROD'') which has stopped these projects from \ngoing forward.\n  The President's Northwest Forest Plan states clearly that \nmultipurpose uses of the federal forests are not precluded, and that \nthe plan must follow existing law applying to such uses. Yet, since its \nadoption in 1994, the Forest Service has and continues to paralyze the \ndevelopment of small hydroelectric projects by ignoring laws applying \nto multipurpose. This inaction has delayed and stifled review of such \nprojects by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--the agency \nresponsible for issuing federal licenses for hydroelectric projects.\n  Forest Service interpretation of the ROD intrudes directly on the \nability of the Commission to perform its hydroelectric licensing \nfunction of balancing development and nondevelopment issues. Both the \nCommission, when determining consistency with the purpose of a national \nforest under Section 4(e) of the Act, and the Forest Service, when \ndetermining whether to issue a special use permit, must apply existing \nlaw fairly. Forest Service inaction on pending projects (some of which \nhave been under review for over a decade) prevents FERC from completing \nits licensing responsibilities.\n  In terms of federal forest management, the six small hydroelectric \nprojects proposed for the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest are \nvirtually inconsequential. All are located well above areas affecting \nanadromous fish, and would occupy a total of 10 to 40 acres each, with \nmost of the sites being untouched except for the portions needed for \nproject facilities. Adverse impacts to fish, wildlife or other \nenvironmental resources are subject to mitigation by FERC and the \nForest Service.\n  Project proponents in my state have spent millions of dollars to \nsecure approval of six projects located in the Mount Baker/Snoqualmie \nNational Forest, including project design and environmental analysis \nnecessary to gain approval from the Forest Service and FERC. In spite \nof the fact that the 1994 ROD instructs the Forest Service to use \n``transition'' provisions to approve pending projects, it has not done \nso, and continues to add project review requirements not allowed by the \nROD or existing law. As a result, the Forest Service is stopping FERC \nfrom making timely licensing decisions on these projects. Shifting \nstandards of review and delay by the Forest Service have deprived \nproject proponents of their right to rely upon clear standards for \nproject approval before expending funds in reliance on such standards.\n  Many aspects of these projects were found to be in compliance with \nprior forest regulations and other environmental laws, and are being \nsubjected to duplicative and inconsistent review. Provisions of the ROD \ndeveloped for application to extremely large-scale timber harvest are \nnot meant to impact small-scale hydroelectric projects. Timber \nmanagement regulations are totally disproportionate with the scale of \nany potential environmental impacts of small scale hydroelectric \nfacilities. In fact, the ROD itself explicitly recognizes that uses \nother than timber harvest do not require the same level of \nrestrictions.\n  The Forest Service continues to use the ROD as a reason for imposing \nnew study requirements, increasing mitigation demands, and ignoring \nagreements\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\non project compliance with forest plan standards and FERC requirements. \nEach new requirement adds onerous financial burdens on project \nproponents, delays project approval, and undermines the regulatory need \nfor an end to project review so a final licensing decision can be made \nby FERC.\n  Actions by the Forest Service have placed that agency in direct \nconflict with FERC, a result not intended by the ROD. FERC's \njurisdiction over hydroelectric project licensing is unaltered by the \nROD, which itself calls for increased interagency cooperation, not \nconfrontation.\n  Mr. President, I have tried in recent years through my position as \nChairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee responsible \nfor funding the Forest Service's annual budget to get some answers from \nthis agency as to why it was holding up these hydroelectric projects. \nIn 1995, I inserted language directing the Forest Service to ``conduct \nan expeditious review'' of projects covered by the ROD. In subsequent \nhearings, I have continued to ask agency witnesses for a status report. \nTo date, none of the responses from the Forest Service have satisfied \nmy concerns or adequately addressed this issue.\n  For this reason, I am introducing legislation today that would \nexpedite the hydroelectric project review process. It will require the \nForest Service to convey to permit holders and license applicants for \nthese projects at fair market value the parcels of land necessary for \ndevelopment of these projects. While I would prefer and am still \nhopeful that this issue can be resolved in negotiations between the \nproject proponents and the agency, clearly this process is broken and \nneeds to be fixed. This legislation should serve as a catalyst for \nresolving outstanding hydroelectric project review issues. Project \nproponents deserve at least that much.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux)\n  S. 1621. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize funding to carry out certain water quality restoration \nprojects for Lake Pontchartrain Basin, Louisiana, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          the lake pontchartrain basin restoration act of 1999\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of myself \nand my colleague, Senator John Breaux to introduce legislation that \nwould restore and maintain the ecological health of the Lake \nPontchartrain Basin--one of the largest estuarine systems in the United \nStates. Known for its slow flowing rivers and bayous, tranquil swamps \nand lush hardwood forests, the Pontchartrain Basin contains the most \ndiverse topography in the State of Louisiana.\n  The Pontchartrain Basin is a 5,000 square mile watershed encompassing \n16 parishes in southeast Louisiana and 4 Mississippi counties. The vast \nwetlands and marshes that surround the Basin's waters provide essential \nhabitat for countless species of fish, birds, mammals, reptiles and \nplants. At the center of the Basin is the 630 square mile Lake \nPontchartrain, which is surrounded by 1.5 million residents, making it \nthe most densely populated area in Louisiana. Lake Pontchartrain is \njust one part of a vast ecological system called the Pontchartrain \nBasin. The Basin also includes Lake Maurepas and Lake Borgne. These \nthree contiguous water bodies make up the largest estuary system in the \nGulf Coast region, and their wetland fisheries contribute over $35 \nmillion to the local economy and provide the abundance of fresh seafood \nthat has made southeastern Louisiana famous.\n  Since the 1940's, increased population, urbanization, and land use \nchanges have altered or destroyed much of the Pontchartrain Basin's \nvaluable ecological resources. The Lake's south shore--once a famous \ngathering ground for swimmers, has been closed since the late 1960's \nbecause of pollution and other conditions caused by stormwater and \nwastewater discharges, oil and gas development and some agricultural \nactivities. Natural occurrences such as shoreline erosion, hurricanes, \nand land subsidence combined with sea level rise also have harmed the \nBasin's sensitive ecology.\n   Mr. President, we introduce the ``Lake Pontchartrain Basin \nRestoration Act of 1999,'' with the purpose of restoring and \nmaintaining the unique ecology of this nationally significant \nwatershed. This important legislation would establish a well \ncoordinated and technically sound management program for the \nrestoration and sustainable health of the Pontchartrain Basin \necosystem.\n  This legislation would also: coordinate the restoration efforts of \nfederal, state and local agencies and organizations in the restoration \nof the Basin; authorize and provide resources for restoration projects \nin the Pontchartrain Basin; and establish a Lake Pontchartrain Basin \nRestoration Program within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n  We believe this is a nationally significant watershed restoration \neffort that deserves our support. The Pontchartrain Basin is the center \nof Southeastern Louisiana's unique cultural heritage--providing \nvaluable habitat for wildlife and countless recreation opportunities \nfor sportsmen and other outdoor enthusiasts. The area is brimming with \na diverse population of people bound by a common interest: The desire \nfor clean and healthy waters in the Pontchartrain Basin. Over the last \ndecade, the restoration of the Lake Pontchartrain Basin has become one \nof the strongest grassroots watershed clean-up efforts in the nation.\n   Mr. President, I would also like to publicly acknowledge the Lake \nPontchartrain Basin Foundation, the University of New Orleans and the \nRegional Planning Commission for the Louisiana parishes of Orleans, \nJefferson, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Plaquemines, for their efforts \nin developing this important legislation. We strongly urge our \ncolleagues to support this measure as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Frist, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1622. A bill to provide economic, planning, and coordination \nassistance needed for the development of the lower Mississippi River \nregion; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                the delta regional authority act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Delta \nRegional Authority Act of 1999, which is aimed at improving the economy \nof the Mississippi Delta region, the poorest region in the country.\n  The lower Mississippi Delta region, following the course of the \nMississippi River, stretches from southern Illinois to the Delta of the \nMississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. According to the latest Census \nfigures, communities in the Delta region of seven States--Illinois, \nMissouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana--\nface a poverty rate of 22 percent while the national average is 12 \npercent.\n  This legislation seeks to build on efforts begun more than a decade \nago, when Congress created the Lower Mississippi Delta Development \nCommission. Under the leadership of former Arkansas Senator Dale \nBumpers, the Commission was charged with studying the unique problems \nof the Delta region and recommending a course of action. I refer my \ncolleagues to Senator Bumpers' statement, which appears on page S25689 \nof the September 27, 1988 Congressional Record, in which he introduced \nlegislation authorizing the Commission. The Commission submitted its \nreport, ``Realizing the Dream . . . Fulfilling the Potential,'' in \n1990. The Chairman of the Commission, former Arkansas Governor Bill \nClinton, called the report a ``handbook for action.''\n  The report highlighted problems facing the Delta, whose economy has \ntraditionally been based on agriculture. The report noted the Delta \nfaced high unemployment, low levels of income and education, welfare \ndependency, poor health care and housing, along with serious \nshortcomings in transportation infrastructure. Unfortunately, a decade \nafter the report was issued, these problems still exist. While Congress \ntook one bold step toward solving these problems when we passed welfare \nreform, there is still much to be done.\n  In particular, this bill seeks to improve the infrastructure of the \nDelta region. It is common knowledge that when industries seek to \nexpand and build new facilities, they look at the availability of \nroads, water systems\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nand other infrastructure. The Federal Government has tried to foster \ndevelopment in these areas by providing Federal grant monies, but we \nhaven't approached the economic problems in the region with an \nappropriate understanding of the unique demographic and geographic \nchallenges that face the Delta.\n  Education programs are available, but if there's no technical \nassistance to help people actually access the grant resources, then the \nprograms are essentially wasted. We can encourage young folks to pursue \nhigher education and start their own businesses, but if there is no \nbasic infrastructure, if transportation and other resources are \ninadequate, how can they succeed? For instance, in many areas of the \nArkansas Delta there are no copy shops, computer repair stores, or \noffice supply stores. These basic offerings that we take for granted in \nlarger cities simply are not available and that is why creating a \ncentral location for technical assistance is so vital. We may not be \nable to put copy shops in place, but we can provide help that will be \nonly a phone call or an e-mail away.\n  Currently, many communities in the Delta have problems gaining \nfederal grants for two reasons. First, they often don't have the \ntechnical expertise to complete the grant applications. Second, they \noften don't have enough money to meet the local matching requirement. \nThe Delta Regional Authority created by this legislation will be \nauthorized $30 million annually to provide technical assistance in the \ngrant application process. In effect, local communities across the \nseven state region will have one-stop shopping when they need \nassistance completing grant applications and accessing resources for \neconomic development. Second, the Delta Regional Authority will be \nauthorized to provide money to help grant applicants meet the federal \nmatch. Certainly the matching dollar requirement in the grant \napplication process is important to demonstrate the community's \ncommitment to the project, but we shouldn't exclude the very \ncommunities who need grant assistance the most.\n  The Delta Regional Authority will function along the same lines as \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission. But it will operate entirely \nindependently of the ARC. The Delta Regional Authority's mission will \nbe to help create jobs, attract industrial development and grow the \nlocal economies by improving infrastructure, training the workforce and \nbuilding local leadership.\n  I would like to thank staff of the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nwho worked very closely with us in drafting this legislation. Special \nthanks also is due to the National Association of Development \nOrganizations, the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Center and many \nlocal economic development groups who provided suggestions and input. \nLast, but certainly not least, I would like to commend Representative \nMarion Berry, who represents my home in the First Congressional \nDistrict of Arkansas, who has introduced companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Delta Regional Authority Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the lower Mississippi River region (referred to in this \n     Act as the ``region''), though rich in natural and human \n     resources, lags behind the rest of the United States in \n     economic growth and prosperity;\n       (2) the region suffers from a greater proportion of \n     measurable poverty and unemployment than any other region of \n     the United States, resulting in a drain on the national \n     economy and diminishing national wealth;\n       (3) the greatest hope for economic growth and \n     revitalization in the region lies in the creation of jobs, \n     the expansion of businesses, and the development of \n     entrepreneurial local economies;\n       (4) the economic progress of the region requires an \n     adequate physical infrastructure, a skilled and trained \n     workforce, enhanced local leadership and civic capacity, and \n     greater opportunities for enterprise development and \n     entrepreneurship;\n       (5) a concerted and coordinated effort among Federal, \n     State, and local agencies, the private sector, nonprofit \n     groups, and community-based organizations is needed if the \n     region is to share in the prosperity of the United States;\n       (6) economic development planning on a regional or \n     multicounty basis offers the best prospect for achieving the \n     maximum benefit from public and private investments; and\n       (7) improving the economy of the region requires a special \n     emphasis on those of the region that are most economically \n     distressed.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote and encourage the economic development of \n     the region--\n       (A) to ensure that the communities and people in the region \n     have the opportunity to participate more fully in the \n     prosperity of the United States; and\n       (B) to ensure that the economy of the region reaches \n     economic parity with that of the rest of the United States;\n       (2) to establish a formal framework for joint Federal-State \n     collaboration in meeting and focusing national attention on \n     the economic development needs of the region;\n       (3) to assist the region in obtaining the basic \n     infrastructure, skills training, local leadership capacity, \n     and opportunities for enterprise development that are \n     essential for strong local economies;\n       (4) to foster coordination among all levels of government, \n     the private sector, community organizations, and nonprofit \n     groups in crafting common regional strategies that will lead \n     to broader economic growth;\n       (5) to strengthen efforts that emphasize regional \n     approaches to economic development and planning;\n       (6) to encourage the participation of interested citizens, \n     public officials, groups, agencies, and others in developing \n     and implementing local and regional plans for broad-based \n     economic and community development; and\n       (7) to focus special attention on areas of the region that \n     suffer from the greatest economic distress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT AIRPORT POLLUTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the serious ground level ozone, noise, water pollution, \n     and solid waste disposal problems attendant to airport \n     operations require a thorough evaluation of all significant \n     sources of pollution;\n       (2) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)--\n       (A) requires each State to reduce emissions contributing to \n     ground level ozone problems and maintain those reductions; \n     and\n       (B) requires the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency to study, in addition to other sources, the \n     effects of sporadic, extreme noise (such as jet noise near \n     airports) on public health and welfare;\n       (3) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \n     et seq.) establishes a regulatory and enforcement program for \n     discharges of wastes into waters;\n       (4) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) \n     establishes primary drinking water standards and a ground \n     water control program;\n       (5) the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) \n     regulates management and disposal of solid and hazardous \n     waste;\n       (6) a study of air pollution problems in California--\n       (A) has determined that airports are significant sources of \n     air pollution; and\n       (B) has led to the creation of an airport bubble concept; \n     and\n       (7) the airport bubble concept is an approach that--\n       (A) treats an airport and the area within a specific radius \n     around the airport as a single source of pollution that emits \n     a range of pollutants, including air, noise, water, and solid \n     waste; and\n       (B) seeks, by implementation of specific programs or \n     regulations, to reduce the pollution from each source within \n     the bubble and thereby reduce the overall pollution in that \n     area.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to require the \n     Administrator to conduct--\n       (1) a feasibility study for applying airport bubbles to \n     airports as a method of assessing and reducing, where \n     appropriate, air, noise, water, and solid waste pollution in \n     and around the airports and improving overall environmental \n     quality; and\n       (2) a study of air pollutant emission standards established \n     by the Environmental Protection Agency for airplane engines \n     to determine whether it is feasible and desirable to \n     strengthen the standards.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (2) Airport bubble.--The term ``airport bubble'' means an \n     area--\n       (A) in and around an airport (or other facility using \n     aircraft) within which sources of pollution and levels of \n     pollution from those sources are to be identified and \n     reduced; and\n       (B) containing a variety of types of air, noise, water, and \n     solid waste sources of pollution in which the aggregate of \n     each type of pollutant from the respective sources is \n     regulated as if the various sources were a single source.\n       (d) Study of Using Airport Bubbles.--\n       (1) In general.--The Administrator shall conduct a study to \n     determine the feasibility of regulating air, noise, water, \n     and solid waste pollution from all sources in and around \n     airports using airport bubbles.\n       (2) Working group.--In conducting the study, the \n     Administrator shall establish and consult with a working \n     group comprised of--\n       (A) the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration (or a designee);\n       (B) the Secretary of Defense (or a designee);\n       (C) the Secretary of Transportation (or a designee);\n       (D) a representative of air quality districts;\n       (E) a representative of environmental research groups;\n       (F) a representative of State Audubon Societies;\n       (G) a representative of the Sierra Club;\n       (H) a representative of the Nature Conservancy;\n       (I) a representative of port authorities of States;\n       (J) an airport manager;\n       (K) a representative of commanding officers of military air \n     bases and stations;\n       (L) a representative of the bus lines that serve airports \n     who is familiar with the emissions testing and repair records \n     of those buses, the schedules of those lines, and any \n     problems with delays in service caused by traffic congestion;\n       (M) a representative of the taxis and limousines that serve \n     airports who is familiar with the emissions testing and \n     repair records of the taxis and limousines and the volume of \n     business generated by the taxis and limousines;\n       (N) a representative of local law enforcement agencies or \n     other entities responsible for traffic conditions in and \n     around airports;\n       (O) a representative of the Air Transport Association;\n       (P) a representative of the Airports Council International-\n     North America;\n       (Q) a representative of environmental specialists from \n     airport authorities;

ROSE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life of \nFrederick P. Rose who died last week at the fine age of seventy-five, \nafter a life that enhanced the lives of so many others. He was, of \ncourse, a member of the celebrated Rose family which rose, if you like \n(and he would have done!) with New York City itself, ever upwards and \nonwards. His craft was building--he was a graduate engineer--his art \nwas friendship, but his genius lay in the way he would use his own \nwealth and epic energies to engage the support of legions of friends in \nthe widest range of\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\ncivic enterprise. The range was exceptional, from the New York Public \nLibrary, to the American Museum of Natural History, to Yale University. \nAs his richly-detailed obituary in The New York Times records, most \noften his gifts were anonymous, although eventually most were known, \nfor how could we not notice how things changed around him.\n  He was for all this rather a private person, devoted to family, his \nwife Sandra, their children and grandchildren, his brothers Daniel and \nElihu. These and also the musicians and chess players and plain fun-\nloving folk with whom he cavorted through three-quarter's century of \nthe life of New York with a grace rarely imagined and yet more rarely \nattained.\n  We whom he leaves behind take consolation in Yeats' lines:\n\n     Think where man's glory most begins and ends,\n     And say my glory was I had such friends.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have his full obituary printed in the \nRecord.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 16, 1999]\n\nFrederick P. Rose, 2d-Generation Builder and a Major Philanthropist, Is \n                               Dead at 75\n\n                         (By Charles V. Bagli)\n\n       Frederick P. Rose, a highly successful builder who poured \n     his energy into two dozen major apartment projects and an \n     equal number of institutions that adorn the New York skyline, \n     from Lincoln Center to Rockefeller University and the \n     Children's Aid Society, died Tuesday night. He was 75.\n       He died at his home in Rye, N.Y., after a brief illness, \n     his family said.\n       A second-generation member of a New York real estate \n     dynasty, Mr. Rose could be found until earlier this year \n     supervising construction of a 50-story apartment house, the \n     Belvedere, at 29th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues.\n       It was the latest project for Rose Associates, which owns \n     or manages 12,000 apartments in New York and four million \n     square feet of commercial space.\n       At the same time, and with equal enthusiasm, he was \n     overseeing construction of the $150 million Frederick Phineas \n     and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space at the \n     American Museum of Natural History, the giant sphere that \n     houses the new Hayden Planetarium. Mr. Rose not only wrote a \n     $20 million check for the planetarium but also was the \n     project leader for the trustees.\n       ``He was a builder in every sense of the word, not just of \n     buildings, but of institutions,'' said Ellen Futter, \n     president of the American Museum of Natural History.\n       Over the years, Mr. Rose also donated $5 million to the \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art, $15 million to the New York \n     Public Library and $18 million to Lincoln Center; in all, he \n     gave away more than $95 million.\n       A forceful man with a reputation for keeping his word, Mr. \n     Rose could breeze into a meeting, as he did earlier this year \n     with his longtime friend and partner, Charles Benenson, and \n     within minutes size up the situation and agree to a $24 \n     million real estate deal for land on 44th Street, near Third \n     Avenue, for a 51-story apartment house.\n       Mr. Rose was still building tall buildings while his \n     nephew, Joseph B. Rose, current chairman of the New York City \n     Planning Commission, labored to change the zoning laws to bar \n     oversized towers in Manhattan.\n       Although the Rose family's buildings were known more for \n     efficiency than architectural detail, Mr. Rose was most proud \n     of building two towers that won awards for design: the \n     Bankers Trust Building at 280 Park Avenue, near 48th Street, \n     and a 40-story apartment house at 45 East 89th Street.\n       His interests ranged widely.\n       Mr. Rose always carried a stack of foreign currency and \n     American dollar bills, which he would fold into intricate \n     origami figures of birds, cows and walruses and present to \n     his delighted friends.\n       At the end of a stuffy board meeting at Lincoln Center, Mr. \n     Rose would often stroll over to a piano and play a few songs \n     for the amusement of the other directors. He played golf up \n     to four times a week and, last year hired a national chess \n     champion to sharpen his skills.\n       Mr. Benenson, who had been a partner in many of Mr. Rose's \n     real estate deals since the early 1960's, said he called his \n     friend two months ago, suggesting that they raise $100,000 \n     from each of 10 people for the refugees in Kosovo.\n       The next day, Mr. Benenson recalled, the developer called \n     back and said, ``O.K., we'll do it through the American \n     Jewish Committee, because we want to show the world that \n     Jewish people are helping Muslims.''\n       ``Two or three days later,'' Mr. Benenson concluded, ``we \n     had $1.4 million.''\n       An engineer by training, Mr. Rose wrote in a 1994 journal \n     commemorating the 50th anniversary of his graduation from \n     Yale University that the central focus of his life had been \n     his family. He wrote that he had been on the boards of 35 \n     organizations, from Con Edison to Yale University. He took \n     pride in being a builder.\n       Finally, he wrote: ``I don't read trash, watch TV or have \n     an interest in spectator sports. This leaves time for active \n     participation in things I enjoy: music, chess, tennis, golf, \n     travel, skiing and friendship.''\n       Mr. Rose's insistence on providing advice and hiring \n     consultants for projects to which he had contributed \n     sometimes rankled other developers, but institutions and \n     their directors embraced him.\n       Until recently, Mr. Rose was chairman of the real estate \n     company started by his father, Samuel B. Rose, and his uncle, \n     David Rose, in the Bronx around the time he was born, in \n     1923. The two brothers built small apartment houses in the \n     Bronx before moving into Manhattan a decade later. Samuel had \n     three sons, Daniel, Elihu and Frederick, all of whom joined \n     the company after World War II. Frederick's son, Adam, is now \n     president of Rose Associates.\n       Mr. Rose married his teen-age sweetheart, Sandra Priest of \n     Rye, in the early 1940's. She survives him, along with a \n     daughter, Deborah Rose; two sons, Jonathan F. P. Rose and \n     Adam R. Rose, both of New York; two brothers, Daniel and \n     Elihu, and three grandchildren, Ariel, Rachael and Sarah.\n       Mr. Rose served in the construction battalions of the Navy \n     Seabees during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant \n     before he returned to New York and Rose Associates. He took \n     charge of design and construction, while Daniel did the \n     planning and finances and Elihu took over management of the \n     family's apartment houses.\n       Mr. Rose built more than 2,000 units of middle-income \n     housing under the state's Mitchell-Lama program, as well as \n     the family's first office tower, at 280 Park Avenue.\n       But unlike some developers who showed up in the gossip \n     columns during the 1980's and 1990's, Mr. Rose and his family \n     avoided publicity. He usually contributed money to charities \n     anonymously, and word of the donations rarely leaked out \n     until years later.\n       ``He built good-quality housing and he was devoted to \n     community service,'' said Robert I. Shapiro, a real estate \n     broker who knew Mr. Rose.\n       A longtime opponent of rent control, Mr. Rose converted \n     more than 3,000 apartments in Manhattan during the early \n     1990's to condominiums and co-ops. Many people in the \n     industry thought it was a risky move, given the recession.\n       But unlike many landlords at the time who were struggling \n     with enormous loans, the Rose family had buildings that were \n     largely free of debt, and the conversion went off without a \n     hitch.\n       ``He secretly believed he was the finest construction \n     superintendent in the city,'' said his brother Daniel, who is \n     now chairman of Rose Associates. ``He liked to kick the \n     bricks.''\n       Mr. Rose applied the same energy enthusiasm and discipline \n     to his philanthropic work as his professional work, his \n     brother said. When Mr. Rose, along with his wife, gave $15 \n     million to Lincoln Center, he also helped engineer the \n     construction of the Rose Building, a 31-story tower that \n     houses rehearsal space and dormitories for the Juilliard \n     School of Music and offices for the School of American Ballet \n     and the New York Philharmonic.\n       ``He had a mercurial mind and it was fun trying to keep up \n     with him,'' said Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln \n     Center. ``He was a man of the world in every sense of the \n     word. I'm really going to miss him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/22/senate-section/article/S11274-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.
