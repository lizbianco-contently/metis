COOPER\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, America's journalism pool got a little \nsmaller last week as David B. Cooper, one of Ohio's most respected \njournalists, hung up his typewriter.\n  For almost 22 years, Dave was a powerful voice in Ohio, in charge of \neditorials and op-eds as the associate editor for the Akron Beacon \nJournal. Over the length of his career, Dave was never known to mince \nwords or pull punches. He was brutally honest when he didn't think \nsomeone--usually a politician--was living up to expectations. And \nusually you didn't have to be reminded twice--you got the message. I \nwill say that many politicians from the State of Ohio, including yours \ntruly, worked very, very hard to live up to Dave's high expectations of \nus.\n  Dave's principles always shone through in the topics he wrote about. \nHis analysis was precise and he showed genuine care about the issues in \nand subjects of his columns. And he worked hard to make sure that he \nwas easily understood.\n  Dave's legacy is his journalistic leadership at the national, state \nand local level. He was outstanding. He began his career 44 years ago, \nwriting for the Raleigh News and Observer and the Winston-Salem Journal \nand Sentinel during the 1950's and 1960's. In 1968, he started his \nassociation with Knight-Ridder newspapers by accepting a position with \nthe Detroit Free Press.\n  It wasn't until 1977 that Dave saw the light and realized his calling \nwas in the State of Ohio with the Akron Beacon Journal. The Ohio \njournalism corps has truly been enhanced with his presence.\n  I have enjoyed a wonderful relationship with Dave. He didn't always \nagree with me--and I certainly never expected him to--but he was always \nfair. In fact, I always looked forward to reading Dave's editorials \njust to find out how he thought my administration was doing.\n  For the last 2 years, Dave and I have shared something in common--\nwe're both grandfathers, although I'm a little newer at being one than \nhe is. There is sort of an unspoken bond between grandfathers that is \nreadily apparent in the smiles we wear and the glint in our eye, as we \nregale others with the exploits of our precious little ones. Dave has \nfour grandchildren and I know that he is more proud of them than any \neditorial or column he has\n\n[[Page S2788]]\n\nwritten. In fact, Dave's best writing has been about his grandchildren!\n  One of the great things about the relationship Dave and I have is our \nmutual love of fishing. Many times when we've been talking about topics \nof the day, we've gone off the subject talking about fly-fishing \ntechniques, favorite streams, or the one that got away.\n  Dave and I have done some fishing together, but not nearly enough. \nAnd even though Dave and his lovely wife Joanne are moving to \nCalifornia, I look forward to doing more fishing with him in the years \nto come.\n  And while I prefer polka, Dave loves jazz. Dave knows more about \njazz--jazz records, jazz singers, and jazz history--than anybody I \nknow. I suspect that his knowledge of jazz surpasses all but a few \njournalists in America. He even has a jazz radio show in Akron! He has \nwritten about jazz extensively and he never tires of speaking about it.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by saying I have immense respect for \nDave. He is and always has been a true professional. And although I am \nsorry to see him retire, I am confident that the citizens of Akron have \nnot heard the last from him.\n  Dave and I will always be friends. I wish him well as he and his wife \nJoanne embark on their new life together.\n  I notice that my colleague, Senator DeWine, is on the Senate floor, \nand I yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend, Senator \nVoinovich, in paying tribute to one of the leading figures in the \nhistory of journalism in the State of Ohio. My good friend Dave Cooper \nis retiring after 22 years as editor of the editorial and opinion pages \nof the Akron Beacon Journal.\n  David B. Cooper began as a reporter with a genuine love for political \njournalism. After reporting for the Raleigh (North Carolina) News and \nObserver and Winston-Salem Journal and Sentinel, he joined the Detroit \nFree Press--where he moved over to the writing of editorials.\n  In 1977, the Akron Beacon Journal hired Dave to run its editorial and \nopinion pages. In that capacity, he has been more than just a \nprincipled observer and commentator on the political life of Ohio and \nAmerica--he has also been a powerful force in the cultural life of his \ncommunity.\n  Indeed, some of his best writing has been on music. In fact--since \n1994--he has hosted a weekly jazz program on radio station WAPS.\n  The same feeling that infuses his writing and commentary on jazz is \npresent in his political writing. Dave knows that if all you want is \naccuracy, you have merely to know your subject. And believe me, Dave \nknows the stuff he writes about! But he also knows that if you want to \ngo beyond that--beyond mere accuracy toward the kind of deep \nunderstanding that goes to the heart of an issue--you must not just \nknow, but love, your subject.\n  That's the kind of work that creates positive change in a community. \nIt is the type of work that Dave has done.\n  Dave Cooper says his pet peeve is ``politicians who are pompous.'' \nAnd that really reflects Dave's personality--he doesn't do what he does \nfor his own ego; he does it to help people understand things. He does \nit to make a real difference. And that's why he holds people in public \nlife to the same high standard.\n  I am proud to call Dave Cooper my good friend, and I wish him and \nJoanne well as they begin a new life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from New Mexico for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n638, S. 639, and S. 640 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2788-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2788-S2789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FINANCING SOCIAL SECURITY WITH GENERAL REVENUES\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the financing \nof the Social Security program. The President's plan to reserve the \nsurpluses for Social Security has presented us with an opportunity to \nhave a discussion about the way Social Security is currently financed--\nand to have a debate about how we want to finance the Social Security \nsystem in the future.\n  I want to say at the outset that some of my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle have closely examined the President's proposal to infuse \nthe Social Security system with general revenues--and decided not to \nsupport a financing reform mechanism that does not lead to structural \nreforms. For my colleagues on the Democratic side who have decided not \nto support general revenue transfers to Social Security, this is a \npolitically difficult position to support--but a commendable one.\n  With his plan to reserve the surpluses for Social Security, the \nPresident has helped me to understand for the first time that the \nSocial Security program is facing a serious funding problem in the year \n2013. I now realize that in 2013, the payroll tax dollars flowing into \nthe Social Security program will no longer be large enough to fund the \ncurrent level of benefits. As a result, the Social Security \nAdministration will start cashing in its trust fund assets--those \nspecial-issue Treasury bonds--to pay for Social Security benefits.\n\n  The Treasury has to make good on these bonds by giving Social \nSecurity a portion of general revenues. This means that starting in \n2013, Social Security beneficiaries have a claim on not only the \npayroll tax dollars, but also the income tax dollars of working \nAmericans. Let me say that again, Mr. President. Starting in 2013, \nSocial Security beneficiaries have a claim on both the payroll tax \ndollars and the income tax dollars of working Americans. So as not to \nmislead, let me say that these beneficiaries will also have a claim on \nother general revenues, such as corporate income tax dollars. \nFurthermore, in order for the Treasury to make good on these \nobligations without cutting discretionary spending, it is likely \nCongress will either have to raise income taxes or return to deficit \nspending.\n  Now under current law, this infusion of general revenues into Social \nSecurity is scheduled to end in 2032--at which point a future Congress \nwill have to decide whether to raise payroll taxes or cut benefits. The \nPresident's proposal allows this Congress to pass the responsibility \nfor enacting reform off to the Congress convening in 2055. Furthermore, \nwhat the President proposes to do is to fund a substantially larger \nportion of the program with income tax dollars. In fact, he is turning \na funding problem into a funding virtue by guaranteeing that future \nincome tax dollars will continue to fund Social Security benefits until \n2055. This means that the baby boomers will have an even larger claim \non future tax dollars.\n  On how many future income tax dollars do the boomers have a claim? \nWell, in fact, the Social Security actuaries have quantified for us \nexactly how many more general revenues will be given to the Social \nSecurity program as a result of the President's plan. According to the \nactuaries, Social Security beneficiaries already have a claim on \ngeneral revenues worth $6.45 trillion in nominal dollars. President \nClinton will commit an additional $24.765 trillion in general revenues \nto the Social Security program between the years of 2015 and 2055--for \na total of $31.215 trillion in general revenues.\n  You heard me correctly, the President's plan commits an additional \n$24.765 trillion of general revenues--$4.85 trillion in constant 1999 \ndollars--to pay for Social Security benefits--above and beyond the 12.4 \npercent payroll tax that is levied on all workers. This chart \ndemonstrates that in any given year we will be committing up to $2 \ntrillion of general revenues for Social Security benefits. If you look \nat this in terms of constant 1999 dollars, we are talking about $200 to \n$300 billion\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\nof general revenues that will be committed to Social Security each year \nin the 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s. If you look at it in terms of a \npercentage of GDP, the Clinton plan will divert general revenues worth \n1.5 percent of GDP to Social Security for each year from 2032 through \n2055. That is a general revenue transfer each year nearly as large as \nthe entire defense budget.\n\n  Now it may come as a surprise to my constituents watching this at \nhome to hear that the President is committing massive amounts of future \ngeneral revenues to Social Security. And the reason they aren't aware \nof this fact is because he has made no effort to inform them. He has \ncleverly hidden his proposal behind the rhetoric of ``saving the \nsurplus for Social Security.'' If the President wants to openly make \nthe case for funding more Social Security benefits through income tax \ndollars, let me be the first to encourage an open and honest debate on \nthat very subject. In fact, it is a very Democratic argument to fund \nSocial Security through the more progressive income tax rather than the \nregressive payroll tax. But I encourage him to enter this debate \ncandidly and to explain to the American public the tradeoffs of \ninfusing general revenues into the Social Security program.\n  I have heard the group of us who are working on substantive Social \nSecurity reforms--Senators Moynihan, Breaux, Gregg, and Santorum--\nreferred to as the ``Pain Caucus'' because we advocate structural \nreforms to the system through benefit changes or future payroll tax \nadjustments. Well, we believe less in pain that in truth in \nadvertising. The President also has a great deal of pain in his plan--a \nhidden pain in the form of income tax increases that will be borne by \nfuture generations of Americans. I strongly disapprove of a plan that \nprovides a false sense of complacency that Social Security has been \nsaved by this nebulous and vague idea of ``saving the surplus''--while \nfailing to disclose the real pain that will be imposed on future \ngenerations.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the history of the Social Security \nprogram and its financing. The idea of a Social Security program was \nfirst discussed by Frances Perkins as a means for providing the widows \nof coal miners a financial safety net. Today, the Social Security \nprogram provides an intergenerational financial safety net to retirees \nand the disabled, and their spouses, survivors, and dependents. Social \nSecurity has always been financed by a tax on payroll. When the program \nbegan, the total payroll tax was 1 percent of the first $3,000 of \nearnings--paid for by both the employer and employee. Today, all \ncovered employees pay a Social Security payroll tax that is equal to \n6.2 percent of the first $72,600 of their annual wages. In addition, \nthe employer must pay an additional 6.2 percent payroll tax on the \nfirst $72,600 of each employee's wages.\n\n  The excess Social Security payroll tax income has always resided in a \ntrust fund. Through the 1970s, this trust fund generally had only \nenough assets to pay for about one year's worth of benefits. The 1977 \nSocial Security amendments marked the first time that the trust funds \nwere allowed to accrue substantial assets--though this accrual was not \nnecessarily deliberate.\n  During the 1983 reforms, Congress made this implicit accrual of \nassets explicit--and declared its goal to be the prefunding of the baby \nboom generation's Social Security benefits. Congress tried to pre-fund \nthe baby boom generation by accelerating the payroll tax rate schedule \nincreases that were agreed to in the 1977 amendments, by covering all \nfederal government and non-profit employees, and by raising the payroll \ntax rate on the self-employed.\n  Not surprisingly, several Presidential administrations took advantage \nof the overflowing Social Security coffers--and used an overlevy of the \npayroll tax to fund both the general operations of government and \nexpensive income tax cuts. Many of the payroll tax dollars that flowed \ninto the trust funds were immediately borrowed to pay for tanks, roads, \nand schools. Many of these payroll tax dollars were also used to offset \nmajor income tax breaks. Is it any surprise that Reagan was able to \nafford a reduction in the top marginal tax rate from 70 to 50 percent \nin 1981 and from 50 to 28 percent in 1986 in the wake of the payroll \ntax hikes of 1977 and 1983?\n  The irony is that the story has now come full circle. While former \nPresidents financed income tax cuts with payroll tax hikes, Mr. Clinton \nnow wants to maintain a lower-than-necessary payroll tax rate by \nincreasing future income tax revenues.\n  Mr. President, one of my goals today is to make clear my desire that \nthis Congress and this President have an honest debate about how to \nfinance Social Security. But one of my other goals today is to talk \nabout the need to reform the program to improve the lives of our \nNation's minimum wage workers. As many of my 206,278 Nebraska \nconstituents collecting old-age Social Security benefits can attest--\nSocial Security is not a generous program. In fact, the average old-age \nbenefit in Nebraska is under $750 a month. When you factor in rent, \nfood, prescription drug benefits, and part B premiums, $750 is not a \ngenerous benefit.\n  As many of my colleagues may know, the size of a retiree's Social \nSecurity check depends on a number of important factors--how much you \nworked, how much you earned, and at what age you retire. In order to \ndetermine your monthly benefit, the Social Security Administration \ntakes all of this information and applies a complicated benefit formula \ndesigned to replace a portion of the monthly income to which you have \nbecome accustomed over the course of your life. This replacement \nformula is not very generous for low-wage, low-skill workers or for \nworkers who have been in and out of the workforce sporadically. The way \nit works is that Social Security will replace 90 percent of the first \n$505 of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) over your lifetime; \nplus 32 percent of the next $2,538 of earnings; and 15 percent of any \nearnings over $3,043 per month.\n  Complicated? Yes. But what this means is that a worker who has been \nconsistently in the workforce and has had lifetime annual earnings of \n$10,000 per year will receive a Social Security benefit check of about \n$564. This is not substantial--and barely livable. What I propose to do \nis change the benefit formula to replace a larger portion of the income \nof these low-income, low-skilled workers who play a very important role \nin our service economy. And I propose doing this in a cost neutral way. \nBy simply changing the replacement formula, we can boost that workers' \nmonthly income by 22 percent.\n  What I have tried to show this morning is that we need to have an \nhonest and open debate about the way we want to finance the Social \nSecurity program. We also need to have a candid and constructive \ndiscussion about Social Security reforms that will improve the \nretirement security of all working Americans--including those working \nAmericans who are toiling away at low-paying service sector jobs. I \nbelieve that Congress and the President can and should work together to \nachieve real structural reforms in the program--and do so in a way that \nhelps low-income Americans and that shares costs across all \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, Harry Truman had a sign on his desk which read: ``The \nbuck stops here.'' Unfortunately, what this President's plan is saying \nis that the buck stops there--in 2055.\n  Our generation has a historic opportunity to make some sacrifices \nnow, so that our children and grandchildren may benefit from our having \nserved this nation. The sacrifices we make may not be as dramatic as \nthose of the generation that lived during Harry Truman's Presidency, \nbut they will have a significant impact on the future of our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2789-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2789-S2790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to transfer \nthe operation of an irrigation project in Montana from the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs to the local irrigators. This is a bill, which has been \nbefore Congress before, but has been changed to address the concerns \nexpressed by the BIA and groups which have opposed this legislation in \nthe past.\n  Years of management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs has led to a \nproject in poor physical condition. Rather than being an asset for the \ngovernment and the users, the Flathead Irrigation is rapidly becoming a \nliability. Using current estimates, the project is in need of $15 to \n$20 million worth of repair and conditioning. Government managers admit \nthat costs associated with rehabilitation of this project could be as \nmuch as 40 percent higher than if the project were under local control.\n  The irony of this project however, is the fact that studies on \nlocally owned irrigation projects in Montana and Wyoming show that the \ncosts of operation and maintenance of the Flathead project are some of \nthe highest in the Rocky Mountain Region the condition of the project \nmay be worst in that same region. What do these people, and for that \nmatter the taxpayer, get for the higher costs associated with the \ncurrent management? Not much if anything at all.\n  Let's take a moment here to see what local control of this irrigation \nproject would mean to the irrigators and to the taxpayer. First of all, \nlocal control will mean increased accountability of the monies \ncollected by and used in the operation of the Flathead Irrigation \nProject. At the current time the BIA is unable, or unwilling, to \nprovide basic financial information to the local irrigation districts. \nThis despite the fact that the local farmers and ranchers pay 100% of \nthe costs to operate and maintain the project. At the same time, the \ncurrent management cannot even deliver a year-end balance of funds paid \nby the local irrigation users.\n  Local control will also create savings over the current operation \nmanagement. By using these savings the local management could be used \nto restore the Flathead Irrigation Project to a fully functioning, \nefficiently operating unit.\n  Wihtout the transfer to local control, the residents of the Flathead \nface an uncertain future. This irrigation project is located in one of \nthe most beautiful valleys in western Montana. Current trends in \nagriculture have put farmers and ranchers in a difficult position. \nMontana farmers and ranchers have always been land rich and cash poor. \nIn the case of this valley in Montana, this is the rule and not the \nexception. They live in an area that is being changed daily due to the \nnumber of summer home construction, because of the beauty and a \ntemperate climate for Montana.\n  The family farmers and ranchers in this area continue to face \neconomic pressures from outside. Which has led to a number of folks \npacking up and subdividing their land for residential home sites. Those \nwho have packed up and left the area, have taken their land and \nsubdivided it for the residential development, removing the land from \nagricultural production.\n  The subdivision of the land has a number of negative impacts on this \nvalley and Montana and the Nation. The landscape is dotted with \nmagnificent homes which impacts on the landscape and open spaces, and \nof course wildlife. Another of the major impacts is on the local and \nstate economies and governments. Agriculture land in Montana pays \napproximately $1.29 in property taxes for every dollar invested by the \nlocal government for services. Residential subdivisions only pay \napproximately $0.89 for every dollar they receive in local government \nservices.\n  Preservation of the small family farm and ranch in the Mission, Jocko \nand Camas valleys in Montana is dependent upon local control. As local \ncontrol of the Flathead Irrigation Project will provide these hard \nworking Americans an opportunity to control and have input on the costs \nassociated with the operation of this vital water source.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2790-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2790-S2791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ST. PATRICK'S DAY STATEMENT BY THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the past year has seen far-reaching \ndevelopments which bring the dream of peace in Northern Ireland closer \nthan at any time in our lifetimes.\n  Today, the Friends of Ireland in Congress is releasing its annual St. \nPatrick's Day Statement. The Friends of Ireland is a bipartisan group \nof Senators and Representatives opposed to violence and terrorism in \nNorthern Ireland and dedicated to a United States policy that promotes \na just, lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict, which has \ntaken more than 3,100 lives over the past 30 years.\n  I believe the Friends of Ireland statement will be of interest to all \nof our colleagues who are concerned about this issue, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Statement by the Friends of St. Patrick's Day 1999\n\n       On this St. Patrick's Day 1999, the friends of Ireland in \n     the United States Congress join with the 44 million Americans \n     of Irish ancestry in commemorating an extraordinary year for \n     the people of the island of Ireland. We are proud of the \n     dramatic progress achieved in last year's Good Friday \n     Agreement. We commend those who contributed to this historic \n     agreement.\n       The Agreement is a unique opportunity to end a tragic \n     conflict which has caused needless tragedy and destruction. \n     It holds out the promise of a new beginning, honorable and \n     realistic, for all involved. The Agreement was endorsed \n     decisively by the people in both parts of the island of \n     Ireland as a clear democratic mandate to their political \n     leaders. We call on all those leaders to implement that \n     mandate fully and fairly, and to embrace the opportunity for \n     peace offered by the Agreement with courage, imagination and \n     empathy. History will not deal kindly with those who fail to \n     do so.\n       We are pleased to welcome to Washington over the St. \n     Patrick's Day period many of those who were central to the \n     success of the negotiations leading to the Good Friday \n     Agreement. We particularly welcome the Taoiseach, Bertie \n     Ahern, whose outstanding commitment and leadership, both \n     during the negotiations, and in the succeeding months, have \n     been deservedly recognized. We also pay tribute to Prime \n     Minister Tony Blair, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland \n     Marjorie Mowlam, Minister for Foreign Affairs David Andrews, \n     the leaders of the Northern Ireland political parties, and \n     many other Irish and British Government officials for their \n     courage and determination to reach agreement despite the \n     opposition they faced.\n       We congratulate John Hume and David Trimble on the award of \n     the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of their efforts for \n     peace. We take pride in the contribution made to the peace \n     process by President Clinton and many other leaders in the \n     United States. We especially salute our former colleague, \n     Senator George Mitchell, for his indispensable leadership, \n     and welcome the recent establishment by the U.S.-Ireland \n     Alliance of the Mitchell Scholarships in his honor. We \n     welcome the generous $3 million contribution of the Irish \n     Government to this scholarship fund, announced by the \n     Taoiseach last September during our President's visit to \n     Ireland. We also welcome the Irish Government's support of \n     the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, through a \n     grant to promote the Festival of Irish Arts, in May 2000.\n       Ireland has given to America in many ways, including men to \n     fight our battles from the Revolutionary War to Desert Storm. \n     In appreciation for these services, and as a special tribute \n     to 12 Irish citizens who gave their lives as members of the \n     U.S. Armed Forces in the Vietnam War, we are pleased to note \n     that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund's travelling wall, \n     called the Wall that Heals, will be making a tour of Ireland \n     from April 16 to May 3 this year.\n       This July, we look forward to welcoming the first 4,000 \n     young men and women who will enter the United States under \n     special visas provided by the Irish Peace Process and \n     Cultural Training Program Act of 1998. The visa will allow \n     these young adults from both communities an opportunity to \n     experience America's unique blend of cultural diversity and \n     economic prosperity. After their visit, they will return home \n     providing the crucial skill base needed to attract private \n     investment in their local economies. That Congress initiated \n     and passed this visa with\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\n     unanimous support is evidence of our continuing bipartisan \n     commitment to supporting the Good Friday Agreement.\n       We believe the most crucial task now facing the Irish and \n     British Governments and all the political leaders in Northern \n     Ireland is to build momentum for the full implementation of \n     the Agreement.\n       Inevitably, there will be continuing difficulties to \n     surmount in resolving this deep and longstanding conflict. We \n     believe the implementation of the Agreement offers the best \n     way forward and the best yardstick to judge the policies and \n     actions of those struggling to overcome these difficulties. \n     We do not believe that the goals of the Agreement can be \n     served by inaction or procrastination in implementing its \n     provisions. Those who take political risks for the \n     implementation of the Agreement can be assured of our \n     consistent support.\n       Following last month's decision by the Assembly to approve \n     the designation of the Northern Ireland Departments and the \n     list of cross-border bodies, and the signing last week by the \n     United Kingdom and Ireland of the historic treaties to set up \n     the institutions, it is vital that this decision be \n     implemented without delay. Progress in all of these areas is, \n     of course, dependent on the establishment of the multi-party \n     Executive, as provided in the Agreement. We are dismayed at \n     the delay in establishing the Executive, and urge it be \n     established as soon as possible. It is the best way to create \n     conditions for progress on other difficult issues, including \n     the problem of decommissioning.\n       The carnage inflicted on the town of Omagh last August was \n     a grim reminder that, in spite of all that has been achieved, \n     there are those who still do not recognize the futility of \n     violence. The cowardly murder of Rosemary Nelson this week \n     reminds of the urgency of the task at hand. The horror of \n     these actions unites all the people of Ireland and Great \n     Britain, and friends of Ireland everywhere, in a \n     determination that such methods will be totally repudiated \n     and will never succeed. We also condemn, in the strongest \n     terms, the practice of sectarian attacks, punishment \n     beatings, and other acts of violence. These actions are a \n     violation of fundamental human rights, and serve only to \n     promote further division and recrimination. Against this \n     background of irresponsible and unacceptable reliance on \n     violence, we commend all those who, notwithstanding the \n     pressures caused by these attacks, refuse to be diverted from \n     the pursuit of peace and political progress.\n       We have in the past consistently drawn attention to the \n     importance of developing a police organization in Northern \n     Ireland capable of attracting and sustaining the support of \n     all parts of the community. We welcome the creation of the \n     Patten Commission to propose new arrangements for policing, \n     accountable to and fully representative of the society. A \n     major responsibility rests on the members of the Commission \n     on this vitally important issue. Their mandate from the \n     Agreement should lead to farreaching change and we look \n     forward to their report later this year.\n       We attach particular importance to the provisions in the \n     Good Friday Agreement which promote a new respect for human \n     rights. Such respect is essential if the commitment to \n     equality, which lies at the very heart of the undertaking, is \n     to be given practical effect. We are heartened by progress in \n     relation to the Human Rights Commissions and look forward to \n     the development of close cross-border co-operation on this \n     vital issue. We also hope to see early progress on the review \n     of the criminal laws, and the dismantling of emergency \n     legislation.\n       We are concerned by evidence of the lack of protection for \n     lawyers active on human rights cases in Northern Ireland, as  \n     described by the Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission \n     on Human Rights, and urge an early response to calls for \n     an independent inquiry into the murder of Belfast lawyer \n     Pat Finucane. We will also continue to follow closely the \n     progress of the inquiry into the tragic events of Bloody \n     Sunday in Derry in 1972.\n       As preparations for this year's marching season begin, we \n     note with concern that, despite efforts to encourage \n     dialogue, the situation at Drumcree remains disturbing. We \n     call on all involved to uphold the decisions of the Parades \n     Commission.\n       The Friends of Ireland welcome the strong support which \n     President Clinton and both parties in Congress have given to \n     the peace process, and to the full implementation of the Good \n     Friday Agreement, including the continuing support for the \n     International Fund for Ireland. We salute the parties on what \n     has been achieved thus far and believe that with commitment \n     and determination, and a readiness to seek accommodation, the \n     remaining differences can be overcome.\n       As we prepare to enter the new century, the parties to the \n     Good Friday Agreement have a truly historic opportunity to \n     achieve peace with justice for the benefit of all generations \n     to come. As always, we in the Friends of Ireland stand ready \n     to help in any way we can.\n\n\n                 FRIENDS OF IRELAND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE\n\n       House: Dennis J. Hastert, Richard A.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a man who is a \nMember of this body who has devoted his entire adult life to public \nservice. Today I speak of Senator John Breaux of Louisiana. I do that \ntoday because there are a number of things that have been written since \nyesterday, when the Medicare Commission made their report. I think lost \nin the information that has been produced is the fact that Senator \nBreaux has spent tireless hours, weeks, and months on this one \nproposal.\n  When I came to the Congress in 1982, Senator Breaux had already been \na Member of the House of Representatives for 10 years. He came to the \nHouse of Representatives when he was 28 years old. As I said, he has \nserved his entire adult life in public service. Even prior to coming to \nthe House of Representatives, Senator Breaux had worked on a \ncongressional staff.\n  Here is a man who could have been a success, as he has been as a \nMember of the House of Representatives and the Senate, in anything he \nwanted to do. He had a fine record as a student. He could have made a \nlot of money practicing law, but he decided to devote his life to \npublic service. I think too often we lose sight of what people do to \ncontribute to the public good.\n  In my estimation, no one has contributed to the public good more than \nSenator John Breaux in the years he has been a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. If there is a difficult problem, John \nBreaux has to be called in to work on that problem.\n\n  This is an example. He was called to be the Cochairman of the \nMedicare Commission, a very difficult job, but there was someone needed \nwho understood the finances of this country; and that includes the tax \nstructure of this country, that includes the very difficult health care \ndelivery system we have, not only for those people who are not seniors, \nbut particularly seniors, people who are on Medicare. I think we tend \nto forget how complex Medicare is and how important it is to the well-\nbeing of this country.\n  Mr. President, I served as a member of a county hospital board when \nMedicare came into being in the 1960s; 1966 through 1968 I served on \nthat board. Prior to Medicare coming into being, about 40 percent of \neveryone that entered our hospital who were seniors had no health \ninsurance of any kind. And that is the way it was around the rest of \nthe country.\n  Today, though, Mr. President, over 99 percent of seniors have health \ninsurance. That is because of Medicare. Senator Breaux understood this \nvery difficult problem. That is why he was asked to be the Chairman of \nthis Commission.\n  Of the 17 members of this Commission, 10 of them agreed as to what \nshould be done. I am not going to get into the merits of what the \nfindings of the Commission were other than to say it was very \ndifficult. Ten people agreed to the findings because of the diligent \nwork of Chairman Breaux.\n  I repeat, he did not spend hours on this program; he did not spend \ndays--he spent weeks of his time. When other people were doing other \nthings with their constituencies at home or taking a little time off \nfrom the rigors of this body, he was devoting his time to working on \nMedicare.\n  I mention that because not only was Senator Breaux called in to be \nthe Chair of the Medicare Commission, he has also done a number of \nother difficult things. We in the West understand the Wallop-Breaux \nlegislation which established a program for restoring our coastal areas \nin the country. It set damages for boats that damaged the environment. \nIt is a very important part of the environmental movement that has \ntaken place in this country. Senator Breaux was at the forefront of \nthat. The legislation is named after him.\n\n[[Page S2792]]\n\n  When, in 1993, we needed to pass a bill, the Budget Deficit Reduction \nAct, we needed to pass a bill that would put this country on a sound \nfinancial footing, one of the persons that worked on this to make sure \nthat this was able to be accomplished was Senator Breaux. He worked on \nthe energy part of that legislation. Being from the State of Louisiana, \nhe knew that area as well as anyone.\n  As a result of his good work on that, enough votes were gathered on \nthe Democratic side of the Congress to pass that legislation. Without \nhis work it could not have happened, and we would not be in the \neconomic situation we are in today where we have reduced a series of 30 \nto 40 years of yearly deficits to now where we are having a surplus, \nwhere we are talking now about what we are going to do with the budget \nsurplus.\n  A lot of what we are talking about today is the direct result of work \nin that legislation and other pieces of legislation by Senator Breaux.\n  In short, I want to make sure that Senator Breaux and the people of \nLouisiana understand our appreciation for the work that he has done \nwith his Medicare Commission and what he has done as a Member of \nCongress generally.\n\n  I have worked as a legislator on the State level, and back here now \nfor going on 17 years. I think John Breaux is really an example we can \nall look to. I repeat, if a difficult problem arises, we call upon John \nBreaux to be part of the consensus building. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise, the art of consensus building. And no one stands for being \na good legislator more than Senator John Breaux.\n  As far as the Medicare problem he worked on, as a result of his \nleadership, it is going to mean a great deal to this country. As \nSenator Breaux has said, the battle is not over. He said, ``I'm going \nto keep working on this issue as long as I'm in Congress.''\n  So I again extend my appreciation and applause and recognition to \nSenator John Breaux for the good work that he did on this legislation. \nI do not know of anyone that could have accomplished what he did. It \nwas a masterful piece of work. The people of the State of Nevada and \nthis country should be as appreciative as we are of the work that he \nhas done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2792-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, thank you very much for your generous \ndescription.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of a colleague, that \nthe privileges of the floor be granted to the following member of \nSenator Biden's staff: Ms. Joan Wadelton, during the pendency of the \nNational Missile Defense Act, S. 257. And the request is for each day \nthe measure is pending and for rollcall votes thereon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President we are now returning to the National Missile Defense \nAct of 1999, which is a very important policy issue before the Senate. \nMy expectation is we will complete work today. I had noticed two \namendments; and I shall not offer the amendments today, to the relief \nof those who are counting the amendments that are ahead of us.\n  But I did want to take the floor to at least describe especially the \nsubstitute amendment, because while I will not offer it to this bill, \nthis is really a debate about policy. This policy will not mean \nanything until it is funded.\n  The real debate will be on the appropriations, it seems to me. What \nis it we want to buy and pay for? We can talk until we are blue in the \nface, but if we are not willing in an appropriations process to pay for \na policy, it is not going to be deployed.\n  Let me talk a bit about that. My substitute amendment will be \nsomething that I will likely offer during an appropriations debate and \nwill wait until that day for a vote.\n  The proposition before the Senate offered by my colleague, Senator \nCochran, is very simple. Yesterday, I was holding something from \nSenator Lott and when I was referring to Senator Cochran I called him \nSenator Lott, for which I apologized. I certainly know the difference, \nand I respect both of them immensely. Senator Cochran has offered a \nproposal on the floor of the Senate that says it shall be the policy of \nthis country to deploy a national missile defense system as soon as \ntechnologically feasible. In other words, notwithstanding other issues, \nas soon as it is technologically feasible to put a national missile \ndefense system in place, we should do so.\n  What is this national missile defense system? We had one once, 24 \nyears ago, in my home State. This country built the only antiballistic \nmissile system that was ever built in the free world. Members ought to \nsee the concrete that was poured, this huge concrete building in \nnortheastern North Dakota, a sparsely populated region of our State, \nwhere the ABM, antiballistic missile, system was built. In today's \ndollars it costs about $20 billion. It was declared operational 1 day \nand mothballed the very next day. It produced a lot of good jobs in \nnortheastern North Dakota as a result, a lot of construction, a lot of \nbuilding.\n  But what did we get for our money? And was a national ballistic \nmissile defense system feasible 24 years ago? The answer, I suppose, is \nyes. We had a national ballistic missile site built and declared \noperational 24 years ago, so it was feasible. It used a different \ntechnology. The proposition was if we were attacked by some incoming \nmissile from some hostile power, we would send up these antiballistic \nmissiles with nuclear warheads on our missiles and we would shoot off a \nnuclear warhead somewhere in the heavens and we would destroy all the \nincoming missiles. That was the technology then, and we built it--paid \na lot of money for it--and it was declared mothballed the day after it \nwas operational.\n  Now the proposition is that the national missile defense is a \ndifferent kind of technology. It has the ability to hit a bullet, a \nspeeding bullet, with another bullet. That is the proposition. We have \nhad a lot of tests--a few successful, most unsuccessful. It is a very \ndifficult proposition.\n  The experts in the Department of Defense tell us that they have spent \nas much money as they can spend to pursue the technology to build a \nnational missile defense system, but the technology does not yet exist. \nNow, when the technology does exist, what kind of consideration should \nexist in terms of its deployment?\n  Russia has a lot of weaponry; Russia, of course, is the dominant \ncountry in what was the old Soviet Union. Their weaponry consists of a \ngreat many nuclear warheads on top of intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles and bombers. We need to be concerned about those. As a result \nof that, we have engaged with the old Soviet Union and now Russia in a \nregime of arms reductions. Arms control talks resulted in START I and \nSTART II. The Russians, we hope, are prepared very soon to adopt START \nII. We have already done so.\n  As a result of all of that, yesterday I held up part of the wing of a \nRussian bomber. Last year, I held up a metal flange from the door of, I \nbelieve, an SS-19, an intercontinental ballistic missile that held a \nnuclear warhead, a missile aimed at the United States. Yesterday, I \nheld up at this desk a wing strut from a Russian bomber; one would have \nexpected in the cold war that the only way you would hold a piece of a \nRussian bomber in your hand is if somebody shot it down in hostile \naction. That wasn't the case. I held up\n\n[[Page S2793]]\n\na piece of a wing from a bomber from Russia that used to carry nuclear \nweapons that would threaten our country because the wing was sawed off \nthat bomber.\n\n  Who sawed the wing off of the bomber? Was a wing shot off in hostile \naerial combat? No, not at all. It was sawed off as the bomber was on \nthe ground, because part of the agreement between us and the Soviet \nUnion is that they would reduce the number of missiles, reduce the \nnumber of warheads, reduce the number of bombers, and so would we. The \nresult is these arms reductions have resulted in significant reductions \nin the number of nuclear warheads, the number of missiles, the number \nof bombers, the number of delivery systems. That is a success.\n  I also talked last fall about the Russian launch of a number of \nintercontinental ballistic missiles early in the morning, and as those \nRussian missiles lifted off in the early morning and pierced into the \nsky, one could have wondered what on Earth was happening in our world--\na launch of significant numbers of ICBMs by the Russians. But it didn't \nworry the United States because those missiles were launched and \ndestroyed in the area by prior agreement--part of arms control, \nsomething we agreed upon--that they destroy their missiles.\n  Isn't it much better to destroy their missiles by taking them apart, \npinching the metal and putting them in a warehouse, or sawing the wings \noff their bombers? Isn't it better to destroy a weapon before it is \nused? That is precisely what arms control is all about.\n  The question I ask about this country's national missile defense \npolicy is not whether we should have one--we likely will have a \nnational missile defense system at some point, some day, when it is \ntechnologically feasible, when it is financially practical, when it \nwill not injure our arms control agreements and not threaten future \nagreements. We will likely have some kind of national missile defense \nsystem. We will likely have it because many are worried that a rogue \nnation now--not Russia, but a rogue nation; Saddam Hussein or North \nKorea testing medium-range missiles--a rogue nation gets ahold of an \nICBM and puts a nuclear weapon on top of an ICBM and aims it at this \ncountry and fires it. What kind of a catcher's mitt do we have to \nintercept it and prevent it from hitting our country? We do not have \nsome sort of technological catcher's mitt that goes into the heavens \nand intercepts that missile. Therefore, we need to have it, we are \ntold. We didn't have that kind of a catcher's mitt to intercept \nmissiles all during the cold war.\n  How did we avoid having a missile fired at us by the Soviet Union? By \nan arsenal in the cold war that assured anyone who attacked us with \nnuclear weapons would be vaporized and destroyed immediately. That \nconvinced virtually anyone who would have thought about launching a \nnuclear attack against this country, that convinced them it was very \nunwise to do so. No one would launch a nuclear attack against this \ncountry.\n  Some might say that might still be the case. But suppose a madman in \ncharge of some rogue nation who gets one ICBM; ought we not have the \ncapability of intercepting that? The answer is yes. That is one of the \nthreats.\n  If you take a look at the kind of threats, one of the threats is that \na rogue nation will get ahold of an ICBM--it is not likely but it could \nhappen. They are more likely to get ahold of a cruise missile, which is \nmuch more prevalent--of course, the national missile defense system \nwill not intercept a cruise missile--that could be launched off the \ncoast about 20 or 50 miles, fly a few hundred feet above the ground. \nThat is not what this is designed to protect against.\n  Another area of threat is a suitcase nuclear bomb stuck in the trunk \nof an old rusty car at a New York City dock to terrorize this country. \nIt doesn't do much about that. Another threat of mass destruction is a \nvial of the deadliest biological threats put on a subway in a major \ncity.\n  We have a variety of threats, not the least of which is that a \nforeign ruler, of a bizarre nation will get ahold of an \nintercontinental ballistic missile, but if that happens will we have a \nmechanism to intercept it? The answer is yes, I believe, we will. But \nwe must do what we are doing now with substantial research and \ndevelopment into developing a technology that works, and then deploying \nit in a sensible way that says we are deploying a technology that works \nin a manner that is cost effective--not a blank check, not a break-the-\nbank approach--a technology that will work to offer real protection in \na way that offers it at an affordable price and doing so in a way that \nwill not jeopardize our arms control agreements that now reduce nuclear \nweapons.\n  The amendment I had intended to offer says:\n\n       (A) It is the policy of the United States to develop for \n     potential deployment an effective National Missile Defense \n     system capable of defending the territory of the United \n     States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether \n     accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).\n       (b) It is the policy of the United States to deploy a \n     national missile defense system if that system--\n       (1) is well managed, proven under rigorous and repeated \n     testing, and cost-effective when assessed within the context \n     of the other requirements relating to the national security \n     interest of the United States;\n       (2) is deployed in concert with a variety of additional \n     measures to protect the United States against attack by \n     weapons of mass destruction, including efforts toward arms \n     reduction and weapons nonproliferation issues; and\n       (3) is deployed in a manner that contributes to a \n     cooperative relationship between the United States and Russia \n     with respect to a reduction in the dangers to both countries \n     posed by weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  A final point: I want everybody to understand that I have supported \nand will continue to support substantial research and development on \nthe issue of protecting against a missile attack against this country. \nThat has never been the issue. The issue here is, when shall it be \ndeployed and with what confidence will the American people feel they \nare protected?\n  Now, to make one point about the last issue, one Russian missile, an \nSS-18, with 10 reentry vehicles--or 10 warheads--will not be able to be \nblocked by this national missile defense system. One MIRVed SS-18 will \nbe able to defeat this national missile defense system because this \nsystem is designed to provide some kind of technological catcher's mitt \nto go up and grab one, two, three, perhaps four or five incoming \nwarheads--but not 10.\n  And so, as we proceed, we need to understand what we are doing, what \nthe limits are, and how we should proceed in a manner designed to \nprotect the efforts that now exist to destroy the SS-18s that Russia \nhas in their silos through massive reductions in delivery systems and \nnuclear warheads. Anything we do in this country to upset that \ncapability, to upset arms control regimes, to upset the progress we \nhave made under Nunn-Lugar, the kind of stability that exists when you \nbring down the number of arms between the two major superpowers, \nanything we do to upset that, I think, would not be in this country's \ninterest.\n  Let me end where I began and say I was intending to offer this \namendment, but I don't think I will offer it today inasmuch as two \namendments were accepted yesterday to the Cochran legislation. I don't \nnecessarily view those amendments quite the same as others do. \nNonetheless, the feeling is that some of those amendments offer the \ncapability of saying, yes, deployment must also be consistent with our \narms control issues with the Russians and others and must not injure \nthose efforts. It must be consistent with something that relates to \nsensible costs. This cannot be a blank-check approach. So I understand \nthat, and because of those two amendments, I think it is better to \nleave this issue at this point and come back another day on the \nappropriations side to further discuss this policy.\n  Now that the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, is on the \nfloor, let me again say to him, I don't quarrel with the question of \nwhether we ought to be aggressively pursuing this issue about a \nnational missile defense. We should. We have had robust research and \ndevelopment. In fact, last fall, $1 billion was added--it wasn't asked \nfor, but it was added--to DOD in the emergency legislation for national \nmissile defense. I don't quarrel with a robust research and development \neffort. Nor would I quarrel with deployment. But deployment cannot \nstand\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nalone. Deployment decisions by this country must be decisions made \nconcurrent with issues about its impact on arms control, about not only \nthe technological feasibility of being able to deploy a national \nmissile defense system, but also the cost-effectiveness of it and a \nrange of other issues.\n  So, Mr. President, I shall not offer the two amendments that I had \nprotected. I thank the Senator from Michigan for his good work on this \nlegislation. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for raising important \nquestions and for his courtesy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise with many in this Chamber who have \nrisen and will rise to commend our distinguished colleague from \nMississippi for his untiring leadership on this issue. It has been my \nprivilege to work with him over these past months and to work with my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, in having our \ncommittee address these issues and reporting the bill to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I wish to convey to the Senate my strong support for \nS. 257, which was introduced again by Senators Cochran and Inouye. This \nis a very important and timely bill which deserves overwhelming support \nin the U.S. Senate. S. 257 was referred to the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee early this year, and after consideration, the bill was \nreported out of committee favorably on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. President, even once S. 257 is enacted, the administration and \nCongress will decide, on an annual basis, how much to spend on NMD, \npursuant to the normal authorization and appropriations process. Such \nspending decisions will be informed by the best information available \neach year regarding technical progress in the program and the status of \nthe threat.\n\n  I also heard that S. 257 would make no contribution to the \ndevelopment or deployment of an NMD system. I do not agree, most \nrespectfully. Commitment to the deployment of an NMD system will have \ntwo crucial impacts on the security of the United States.\n  First, it will signal to the nations that aspire to possess ballistic \nmissiles with which to coerce or attack the United States that to \npursue such capability is a waste of both time and resources of that \nnation. In this sense, commitment to an NMD system would have a \ndeterrent effect on proliferation.\n  Second, if some aspiring states are not deterred and commit to deploy \nan NMD system, it would ensure that American citizens and their \nproperty are protected from limited missile attack, to the best of our \ncapability. I use the word ``ensure'' the American citizens. We can \nonly offer our best technical protection. I am not sure any ensurance \nabsolutely can be devised.\n  In addition to convincing the rest of the world that we are serious \nabout defending the U.S. against rogue missile threats, S. 257 will \nmake it clear to the American people that we are truly serious about \nthis undertaking. This is important, in particular, for those in \nGovernment and industry who are now working so hard to make an NMD \nsystem a reality. Nothing could be more important to them than a clear \nsignal that we are seriously behind them and that this is not just \nanother false start.\n  On August 31, 1998, North Korea tested the Taepo Dong 1 missile over \nJapan and demonstrated the capability to deliver a small payload to \nU.S. territory. Technically, that is feasible. This event demonstrated \nthat the proliferation of technology expertise and hardware with which \nto build a long-range ballistic missile is accelerating rapidly.\n  As the Rumsfeld Commission reported:\n\n       The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities \n     is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has \n     been reported in estimates and reports by the [greater] \n     Intelligence Community [of our country].\n\n  To its credit, the administration has now acknowledged the existence \nof this threat and has taken significant steps to address it. I commend \nSecretary of Defense Cohen for his decision to increase funding for NMD \nby $6.6 billion over the Future Years Defense Program.\n  In my view, however, these developments fundamentally change the \nrationale supporting the ``3+3'' policy. This policy has been based on \na perceived need to gather more information on the ballistic missile \nthreat, on NMD program affordability, and on technology maturity, \nbefore making a deployment decision. The administration has now \nindicated that the threat is all but here.\n  It has also budgeted funds needed to implement the deployment \ndecision, implicitly confirming that the program is affordable. The \nadministration's only remaining decision criteria for which additional \ninformation is needed relates to technology development. S. 257 makes \nclear that the deployment would only proceed once the technology is \nmature. There is no apparent reason to further delay a deployment \ndecision.\n  Although the United States must engage Russia with caution and \nrespect--and I underline ``with caution and respect''--I do not believe \nthat postponing an NMD deployment decision will facilitate negotiations \nto change the ABM Treaty. Delay only perpetuates uncertainty about our \nposition and creates the potential for misunderstanding. If Russia does \nnot believe that we are serious about an NMD deployment, it will have \nno incentive to cooperate, in my judgment, in these talks. Once a firm \ncommitment to NMD deployment has been announced, only then will Russia \nseriously engage in negotiations to modify the ABM Treaty.\n  We must never forget that treaty was between the United States and \nthe then-Soviet Union, the only superpowers that had intercontinental \nballistic missile technology. And it is against that background that we \nmust review the revisions of this treaty. It is in the national \ninterest of the United States of America. There are many places today \nin the world where other capabilities to develop these missiles are \nrapidly progressing. It is in our national interest to modify that \ntreaty at this time. I do not say abolish it. I say carefully modify \nit.\n  The United States must make it clear that the decision to deploy an \nNMD decision is based on a threat not envisioned at the time the ABM \nTreaty was negotiated. I was then Secretary of the U.S. Navy, and I was \nin Moscow when the ABM Treaty was signed. I have a vivid recollection \nof that backdrop.\n  The United States, however, must make it equally clear that it will \nproceed with deployment of an NMD system whether or not Russia agrees \nto modify the ABM Treaty. The only way to clearly send such a signal is \nby a change in U.S. policy. In my view, the best way to send that \nsignal is by enacting S. 257.\n  Mr. President, in summary, I believe the need for the deployment of \nNMD is compelling. I believe it is equally clear that we must modify \nour policies so everyone knows where we stand on NMD deployment. We \nmust send this signal to our potential enemies, to Russia, and, indeed, \nto ourselves. And I do not put Russia in the context of a potential \nenemy; other nations I was referring to in that statement. The threat \nexists, and continues to grow. S. 257, which clearly indicates the \ncommitment to deploy NMD, will ensure the United States is prepared to \nmeet that threat.\n  Mr. President, I am going to pose a question or two to my good friend \nand distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, who is the \nranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which we serve \ntogether. But over our 21 years in the Senate, it is interesting that \nSenator Levin, Senator Cochran, and I all came to the Senate at the \nsametime. Senator Cochran, however, is senior to me. I will always \nrespect him for that, and he reminds me on a daily basis. But \nnevertheless, we came together. We have many, many times in those 21 \nyears debated on this glorious floor of the U.S. Senate the issues \nrelating to arms control. All too often, regrettably, Senator Cochran \nand I are on one side and Senator Levin on the other.\n  But I remember not so long ago in the context of the expansion of \nNATO that I tried as forcefully as I could to resist that expansion. \nThat is history now. The decision was made by this body to go forward \nand accept three new nations. I stated from this very chair that I \nwould support that. So the\n\n[[Page S2795]]\n\ndebate is over. But it is interesting to go back and look at some of \nthe statements made in the context of NATO expansion and see how they \nrelate to this very debate that we are having today.\n  Many of those who stood on this floor defending expansion--my good \nfriend from Michigan was among them--now argue that we must not declare \nour policy to deploy a national missile defense system. I ask the \nquestion, Should the Senate be more concerned about Russia's opposition \nto NMD than we were to Russia's opposition to NATO expansion? It is a \nfair question.\n  I am reminded of the statements by Secretary of State Albright to the \nForeign Relations Committee. And I happened to have been in the room at \nthe time she made it. I quote:\n\n       Russian opposition to NATO enlargement is real. But we \n     should see it for what it is:\n\n  A very interesting statement, ``But we should see it for what it \nis.''\n\n       a product of old misperceptions about NATO, and old ways of \n     thinking. . . . Instead of changing our policies to \n     accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need to encourage \n     Russia's more modern aspirations.\n\n  If we simply deleted Secretary Albright's reference to ``NATO \nenlargement,'' and substitute the term ``NMD,'' I think we would have \nan interesting quote. If I may, I respectfully revise the statement of \nmy good friend, the Secretary of State, to read: ``Russian opposition \nto NMD is real. But we should see it for what it is: a product of old \nmisconceptions about NMD and old ways of thinking. . . . Instead of \nchanging our policies to accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need \nto encourage Russia's more modern aspirations.''\n  Secretary Albright also indicated to the Foreign Relations Committee \nthat NATO enlargement would in no way jeopardize START II, as some of \nmy colleagues have argued the National Missile Defense Act would do. \nOnce again, if we substitute the term ``NMD'' for the term ``NATO \nenlargement,'' I think it would be about right. I quote:\n\n       While I think this prospect [Duma ratification to START II] \n     is by no means certain, it would be far less so if we gave \n     the Duma any reason to think it would hold up [NMD] by \n     holding up START II.\n\n  I just hope that at some point my good friend from Michigan might \nreply to the observations of his good friend, the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  I say with respect to the President, Secretary of State, and others \nthat this is an example of the difficulty that we are having with \ncontinuing confrontations between this administration and the Congress \nof the United States, most particularly the Senate, on very, very \nserious foreign policy concerns.\n  Mr. President, today we are facing tremendous uncertainties in \nKosovo, and trying to address major decisions as to whether to use \nforce should the talks not be successful in Paris. The outcome of that \nsituation could definitely relate to the future of our work and our \ncommitment of over $9 billion in Bosnia.\n  We have a serious problem with China today as to the degree that we \ncontinue or not continue our relations with China given this tragic \ncase of espionage, the allegations of which are being studied by this \nbody with great care, and, indeed, by the committee over which I am \nprivileged to be Chair.\n  I can count other serious foreign policy considerations. Here we are \ndebating this missile defense legislation, and we are now seeing under \nthe leadership of Senator Cochran, and, indeed, greater and greater \nbipartisanship which is evolving on the other side of the aisle, a \nconsensus coming about to pass this critical piece of legislation.\n  I say to the administration that they have to select more carefully \nthe battles they wish to wage with the Congress for fear of losing them \nall. This is a battle which should have been recognized by the \nadministration months ago as one not to be waged with the intensity \nthat this one has experienced. That same fervor and intensity should be \napplied to the other major issues before us, whether it is Kosovo, \nBosnia, or China, and not have the attention of the U.S. Senate so \nreflected to resolve this.\n  But, nevertheless, I thank, again, the distinguished leader from \nMississippi for his tireless work. I think that this bill will emerge \nwith the strongest bipartisan support. To some extent I think the \namendments have helped. But I have studied both of them carefully. Both \nof the votes were 99 to 0. I think that that tells a story in and of \nitself, but nevertheless I wish our managers well.\n\n  I see my distinguished colleague from Michigan about to seek \nrecognition. I just wonder if the Senator has a comment about my NATO \nobservations, I say to my good friend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, my good friend from Virginia is very wise \nand perceptive. Indeed, I do have a comment. He asked the question \nwhether the Senate is more concerned about Russian reaction to national \nmissile defense than about Russian reaction to NATO expansion. And, of \ncourse, there is a huge difference. In one case we have a treaty with \nRussia. It is called the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And before we \npull out of that treaty, or unilaterally act in a way that is in \nviolation of that treaty, we ought to consider the ramifications.\n  The point is we have a treaty with Russia that has made possible \nsignificant nuclear arms reduction. We had no such treaty with Russia \nrelative to NATO; quite the opposite--our NATO treaty was against the \nformer Soviet Union. Russia wasn't part of any NATO treaty. Its \npredecessor, the Soviet Union, was the problem against which that NATO \ntreaty was created. So this is a day-and-night comparison. Surely, when \nyou have a treaty with someone, before you unilaterally breach it or \nthreaten to breach it, you should consider the consequences of that. We \nhave such a treaty with Russia. The opposite was true with NATO. So the \ndifference is a 180-degree difference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleague that we had, \nin the course of that debate on expansion in the same time period, led \nthe way for Russia to begin to work with NATO, and while it wasn't a \nformalized treaty as such, it was a very interesting and unique \narrangement between Russia and NATO whereby Russia would have a forum \nin which it could express its concerns and hopefully work \ncooperatively.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is exactly correct. And that is precisely what \nwe are now doing relative to our treaty with Russia, with the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty. We are sitting down with Russia now and \nseeing whether we can't negotiate a modification in that treaty which \nwould permit two things to happen: 1, the deployment of a national \nmissile defense should we decide to deploy it; and, 2, continuing \nnuclear arms reductions which have been provided for--in effect, \npermitted -- under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. So that is \nexactly what we are trying to do now.\n  But any comparison between the situation of having a treaty \nrelationship with somebody and having a treaty which was aimed against \nthat person, it seems to me, is an inapt comparison. I just wanted to \nbriefly comment on it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may, did the Senator from Michigan \nhave a chance to see a rather interesting comment by Mikhail Gorbachev \nand how he referred to the NATO expansion as being an act that was in \ncontravention of his clearest of understandings with the leaders of \nthis country, the United States, at that time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I did. I believe that our leaders have denied such an \nagreement with Mr. Gorbachev, and we would be happy to dig up the \ndifference relative to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could ask one other question of my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan, he refers to negotiations, and \nindeed I think those negotiations have been ably conducted by a former \nmember of our Armed Services staff, Mr. Robert Bell, for whom the \nSenator from Michigan and I have respect, having worked with him \nthrough the years. But how many such negotiations have taken place over \nwhat period of time, I ask my friend?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think those negotiations began just a few weeks ago. And \nI was urging the administration in the middle of last year to begin \nthose discussions and those negotiations. So the actual preliminary \ndiscussions I think began in February. As far as I am concerned, it \nwould have been better to begin those discussions before that, and I \nhad urged the administration last \n\n[[Page S2796]]\n\nyear to begin them. But as I understand it, there were informal \ndiscussions which had occurred before this recent visit that the \nSenator from Virginia, my good friend, has referred to.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my recollection is that this had been \ngoing on for at least 2 years. Whether you caption it as informal \nversus today being formal, we will have to look at the record, but this \nhas been going on for 2 years without any real, I think, ``concrete''--\nand that is the famous word that the old Soviet Union and now Russia \nuse--results. And I believe the initiative by the Senator from \nMississippi and what I anticipate will be the passage of this bill by \nthe Senate will give the proper incentive to get those negotiations \ncompleted in a mutually satisfactory way.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would agree that the bill as it now stands, with an \namendment which adopts as a policy of the United States to continue to \nnegotiate arms reductions with Russia, is indeed going to be an \nincentive to those discussions because it no longer threatens to just \nunilaterally breach a treaty between ourselves and Russia.\n  On the first point, however, I would disagree with my dear friend \nfrom Virginia. I believe the discussions with the Russians on our \nNational Missile Defense program did not begin until last year, and the \ninformal discussions relative to modifications in the ABM Treaty did \nnot occur until February. I believe, in fact, I wrote the \nadministration--and I think I shared my letter with my friend from \nVirginia--I wrote the administration I believe in August urging that \nthese discussions and negotiations take place.\n  Mr. President, in 1993 the administration, the Clinton \nadministration, just as it came into office, terminated the defense and \nspace talks which dealt precisely with modifications of the ABM Treaty. \nI think we can produce a record how this debate on the ABM Treaty has \ngone on for a very, very long time without any productive or concrete \nresults.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The debate on the ABM Treaty has gone on since before the \ntreaty was up here for ratification.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am talking about, Mr. President, the negotiations \nbetween the administration and Russia on such modifications as we felt \nwere necessary for various aspects of our missile defense program.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The discussions between us and the Russians relative to \nthe demarcation line, for instance, between a theater missile defense \nand strategic defense, the defense against strategic missiles has, \nindeed, been going on a long time.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is not the issue, though, that we have been \ndiscussing here this morning. The issue we have been discussing here \nthis morning is whether or not we can work out with the Russians a \nmodification of the ABM Treaty such as to permit us to deploy what is \nadmittedly covered now by the treaty, namely a limited National Missile \nDefense system.\n  The discussions which have been referred to by my friend from \nVirginia had to do with the question of what is or is not covered by \nthe treaty as it is currently written: What is the correct demarcation \nbetween those missile defenses which are covered by the treaty and \nthose missile defenses which are not? And, indeed, he is correct; those \ndemarcation discussions have been going on with the Russians, and \nindeed there was an agreement relative to the proper demarcation line. \nBut the discussions relative to modifying the treaty so that we could \ndeploy a limited national missile defense against what is admittedly \ncovered by the treaty are discussions which have only begun in a \npreliminary manner in February of this year and informally began, I \nbelieve, last year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend that is correct. \nAn agreement was reached between Russia and the United States, and it \nis interesting that agreement has never been submitted to the Senate, \nalthough I and other Senators have repeatedly called for it. This is \nanother example where I think the Senate needs to assert itself more \nstrongly in areas of foreign policy, and this is one of those areas \nwhich is very clearly in need of a show of strength by the Congress, \nthrough the Senate, to assert its really coequal right under the \nConstitution to deal with issues of foreign policy. And that is why I \nso strongly support the legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is intriguing--Mr. President, I do not know who has \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, what is intriguing is, in fact, we did \nassert our position relative to the correct demarcation line, and \nindeed we put it in law, and indeed the demarcation line which was \nadopted by this administration and Russia followed what we had put into \nlaw. So we had asserted what our position was as the U.S. Senate and, \nif my memory is correct, as a Congress, because I believe the language \nended up in the final authorization bill as to where that demarcation \nline should be. The agreement which was reached indeed--my \nunderstanding is and my recollection is--followed the demarcation line \nwhich the Congress had set forth in that authorization bill.\n  So it is nothing new for Congress to assert its involvement in these \nkinds of issues. We should. We have. We should be partners with the \nadministration on this issue. I believe this bill as amended--I know it \nis now acceptable to the President with these amendments--represents \nthe effort to come up with a more bipartisan approach to these critical \nnational security issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may, I say to my good friend, the \nBush administration was close to changing the ABM Treaty pursuant to \nnegotiations with Russia to deploy a limited NMD. I draw that to my \ncolleague's attention. When the Clinton administration came in, it \nterminated these talks in 1993 and, indeed, downplayed significantly \nthe need for an NMD system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Virginia would \njoin in a colloquy, if possible, to try to flesh out a couple of \nissues.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin my question to him by saying \nI, with many others here, am cognizant of the threat that has now been \nmore realistically defined and is more present. I think most people \nfeel a safety measure with the capacity that might save Hawaii or some \nother sector of the United States from some accidental, rogue, or \nunauthorized launch, makes sense in theory. And I certainly support \nthat. But many people have expressed concerns. I know the Senator from \nVirginia has long been a member of the Arms Control Observer Group, \nlong been involved in these issues, and has a great sensitivity to the \nperceptions of other countries which often drive arms races and the \nbuilding of weapons.\n  I assume, based on that experience, the Senator from Virginia will \nacknowledge that if the United States proceeded in some way that \naltered the perception of another country--be it Russia or China or \nsomeone with whom we are currently trying to cooperate--that could, \nindeed, have an impact on the weapons they might build or, ultimately, \non the security of the United States itself.\n  Is that a fair statement of how perceptions operate in arms races?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I readily concede that misconceptions can \narise. But Russia today, while President Yeltsin still holds, let's \nsay, the trappings of office, is largely guided by Mr. Primakov. I have \nhad the opportunity to deal with him through the years, as has, I \nthink, my good colleague from Massachusetts, likewise.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. Primakov is not a man who doesn't fully \nunderstand exactly the nature of this debate and the need for the \nUnited States of America to prepare for its defense, not necessarily \nagainst Russia, but against other nations emerging with this threat. I \ndo not think, in the context of this debate on this amendment, a \nmisconception could arise, given Mr. Primakov's extensive experience. \nHe will soon be visiting the Nation's Capital as a guest of our \nPresident. I am hopeful that I, and perhaps the Senator from \nMassachusetts and others, can\n\n[[Page S2797]]\n\nhave an opportunity to engage him, as we have in years past, in a \ncolloquy on a wide range of issues. He is a very well informed and a \nvery astute individual.\n\n  So in this particular instance, I do not believe that is a serious \nproblem, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could further continue the colloquy--\nand I thank the Senator for his answer--I concur with his judgment \nabout Mr. Primakov. I have had the pleasure of having a discourse or \ntwo with him. He is a very thoughtful and articulate person who \nunderstands the nature of this. But that is not to say that other \npoliticians, other wings of other various ideologies, do not try to use \nthese kinds of issues to play politics within their countries. Nor is \nto it say that conceivably--and I am only talking about the \npossibilities here, because it is important for us to put any \ndeployment issue or any future procurement issue in the context of \nthese realities --China could also make certain determinations with \nrespect to this. Is that not also a fair judgment?\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator, as a generality, I think you speak with fairness \non this issue. But, again, I wish to just try to limit my remarks as to \nthis specific piece of legislation, although prior to coming on the \nfloor I did make what I felt were some constructive criticisms. The \nadministration should begin to pick its fights with the Congress on \nforeign policy issues. This is one that should have been reconciled \nsome time back, quietly, and acknowledging that it was in the interests \nof the United States to proceed as we are now doing on this \nlegislation, and save its full force and effect for other issues, \nwhether they are Kosovo or China or Bosnia or whatever they may be.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, I appreciate the answer and I \nappreciate the sensitivity the Senator has shown, as to how we might \nhave gotten here otherwise. I cannot disagree with him with respect to \nthat. But, by the same token, there has been a push here to try to \nachieve certainty with respect to technology, technological feasibility \ngoverning an issue of deployment. There are a lot of questions about \nwhat kind of system we might or might not really be building.\n  The early concepts that surrounded this entire debate envisioned a \nsystem that did more than simply address the question of a rogue \nmissile or an accidental launch or even a few individual missiles. The \nbest estimate of the threat from North Korea, in 15 or 20 years, is \nstill dealing with minimalist numbers. Always, when we are debating in \nthe context of Russia or in the context of China, we are dealing with \nmultiple numbers, and the system you need to deal, with any reality, \nwith those kinds of potential adversaries--I underscore ``potential''; \nwe view neither of them that way today, as the Senator has said--but \nthe kind of system that would be needed to deal with that is a system \nthat most people make the judgment is technologically so expensive and \nso complicated--because it requires the SWIR intercept capacity at \nboost phase, it requires the capacity to go exoatmospheric for a \ncertain phase, you have to hand off for the next phase for LWIR \ncapacity for tracking, the capacity to distinguish between multiple \ndecoys--all of this gets into such a zone of expense and of arms \ndeterrence imbalance that a whole series of other questions have to be \nput on the table.\n  So what we are talking about, in terms of a system, is really a \ncritical, critical component of what we might be willing to deploy and \nwhat might ultimately work and what we might even be able to afford \nrealistically.\n  Mr. President, let me say also, if you developed a system that had \nall of the capacity I just defined--it could distinguish between \ndecoys, it could actually hit at the level that gave you an assurance \nthat you have the kind of protection you are trying to achieve--you \nhave actually shifted the entire balance of power, because you have \ncreated a near first strike capacity, if not a perfect first strike \ncapacity. If you can shoot down anything that comes at you, then \nclearly you have changed the balance of power. So we are not making \nourselves more secure necessarily. Plus, everyone in the business knows \nthat we are talking, in that case, about intercontinental ballistic; \nthey will simply go cruise missile, go underneath or any other \nalternatives. The notion that we are making ourselves, in the long run, \nsomehow very significantly safer by building this larger system, I \nthink, is a debate we put aside some time ago.\n\n  I come to the floor supportive of the notion that we are in a new \nworld today. I appreciate what the Senator said about thinking about \nMadeleine Albright's language of how you perhaps change, together with \nother countries, to meet that new world. But that new world, to me, is \nquite delimited. It is a new world that seeks to protect us against a \nrogue, against accidental or unauthorized. That is a very limited kind \nof system. It is one that we ought to be able to negotiate, if we can \ndevelop it with China, with Russia, with other people, all of whom have \na similar kind of threat to think about with respect to unauthorized or \naccidental or rogue launches.\n  I simply want to make it part of the record of this debate that that \nis my understanding of the direction we ought to be going in--and I \nhope and think it is the understanding of the Senator from Virginia--\nthat we do not rush headlong into the building of a system that simply \ncreates greater unrest, greater instability, greater question marks \nand, I might add, is measured against a $60 billion expenditure that to \ndate, even in the THAAD program, has not shown success. There isn't \nanybody who won't tell you that when you are switching from THAAD into \nthe intercontinental ballistic, you are moving into levels of \ncomplexity so much higher in terms of intercept and distinguishing \ncapacity.\n  It is my judgment that while we ought to proceed, I hope the Senate \nis going to contemplate this in the context of really building \nstability in our relationships and also in trying, as diligently as we \ncan, to negotiate with these other countries the process by which we \nwill move forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to my \ncolleague's remarks. I wish to make very clear, at the end of this \ncolloquy, page 2 of the bill:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \n     is technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n     (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).\n\n  It is simply a system constrained to those particular threats. I \nthink the Senator said those same threats face other nations, notably \nRussia and China. It seems to me in the common interest that this go \nforward.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I think, again, that the clarification here is important because, \nobviously, we come to this through the experience of a very large \nexpenditure and a very different kind of concept than was contemplated. \nI think it is vital, as we proceed forward, that technological \nfeasibility not be the only judgment which we will use as we proceed \nforward. I think the amendment which has thus far been accepted, the \nnotion that the Senate now embraces the continued efforts to have \nnegotiated reductions with Russia and that we do not want to upset \nthat, is a very important statement that puts into context the down \nsides if we don't proceed with the sensitivity which most of us feel is \nso important here.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to Jacob Bylund, an intern in my office, for \nconsideration of S. 257 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a member of my staff, Clint Crosier, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor for the remainder of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to express my\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\nwholehearted, overwhelming, passionate, and unwavering support of the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999.\n  Finally, after years of fighting to get this legislation to a point \nwhere we can pass it, we appear to have succeeded. I sincerely hope it \nis not too late. The President had promised to veto this bill if we \npassed it. I was glad to hear last night that he has now dropped his \nveto threat. Unfortunately, his pledge comes a little late and still \nfalls far short of the full support that we need to truly protect our \ncitizens.\n  As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces, I have devoted myself wholeheartedly to the cause of \nmissile defense for many years. It has always troubled me that the \nPresident of the United States has refused to engage us and help us to \npass a bill to defend the United States of America and its citizens \nfrom ballistic missile attack. It has been especially troubling in \nrecent days, with news that data on our most sophisticated nuclear \nwarhead may have been stolen by China--which may have already used this \ninformation to perfect their own warheads on missiles aimed this very \nminute at the United States.\n  The President seems to believe we need to let Russia have a vote on \nwhether or not we choose to protect ourselves from blackmail and \ncoercion from China, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. With all due respect, \nI am not interested in having the Russians determine whether or not we \nshould protect ourselves. I am more interested in having us determine \nwhether or not we should protect ourselves.\n  The administration tells us that there are four critical criteria \nthat must be met before we can decide whether to deploy a national \nmissile defense: threat, technology, operational effectiveness, and \ncost. Let's look at these four issues; first, the threat. The \nAdministration's national missile defense agenda is based upon, I \nbelieve, a false assumption that we will have plenty of warning to \nrespond to the threat.\n  We can't base the security of the United States of America on our \nability to detect and predict existing or emerging threats around the \nworld. And we do not have to--it is here even as we speak. The \nadministration can no longer ignore the threat. It is real, it is \ndangerous, and it is here now, today, this moment.\n  In May of 1998, India conducted three nuclear tests that shocked the \nworld, and even worse, surprised our intelligence community. Ten days \nlater, Pakistan conducted their own nuclear test.\n  In July of 1998, a bipartisan commission headed by Don Rumsfeld, \nformer Defense Secretary, came to some very startling assertions. Here \nis what he said:\n\n       Hostile nations such as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are \n     making concerted efforts to acquire ballistic missiles with \n     biological or nuclear payloads that will be able to inflict \n     major destruction on the U.S. within five years of a decision \n     to acquire such capability. And further, the U.S. might not \n     even be aware if or when such a decision has been made.\n\n  That is a pretty sobering analysis, Mr. President.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       The threat from rogue countries is evolving more rapidly \n     than U.S. intelligence has told us, and our ability to detect \n     a threat is eroding because nations are increasingly able to \n     conceal important elements of their missile programs. The \n     U.S. faces a missile threat from hostile states with little \n     or no warning.\n\n  The Rumsfeld Commission was bipartisan, and its conclusions were \nunanimous. Yet the entire report was downplayed by the administration. \nIt was dismissed as paranoid, alarmist, and out of touch with current \nintelligence estimates. But only 2 months later, 2 months after the \nRumsfeld report, the North Koreans shocked the world with the launch of \na three-staged Taepo Dong missile over Japan.\n  This signaled their progress toward the Taepo Dong 2 that could hit \nthe continental United States. Some in the Senate have been willing to \nwrite off Hawaii and Alaska because they are not continental. I notice \nthat the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii were not willing to write \nthemselves off, however. They were early advocates and supporters and \ncosponsors of this legislation in both political parties.\n  Not to be outdone, after North Korea, Iran tested their own new \ngeneration missile within weeks of the Rumsfeld report. On February 2 \nof this year, CIA Director George Tenet testified before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee:\n\n       I see a real possibility that a power hostile to the United \n     States will acquire before too long the ability to strike the \n     U.S. homeland with weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  In an interview with Defense Week on 23 February, Lieutenant General \nLyles, Chief of the BMD organization, said:\n\n       We now have indications that the threat is growing, and \n     certainly there is little doubt that this threat will be \n     there around the year 2000.\n\n  The CIA recently reported that China has at least a dozen nuclear \nmissiles aimed at U.S. cities right now.\n  I say to my colleagues, the threat is here. How much more warning do \nwe need?\n  Let's go to the technology and the operational effectiveness issues \nthat the President and some of this bill's critics have talked about. \nThey say that this bill would require a deployment before the \ntechnology is ready. But technology and operational effectiveness are \nthe cornerstones of this legislation. No one is suggesting we deploy a \nsystem before it is ready. How can we deploy something before it is \nready? How can we deploy something that doesn't work? And yet we have \nhad a big debate on this terminology. The Senator from Mississippi has \ndone a good job, I think, in shooting holes in that false argument.\n  I honestly do not understand what the debate between \n``technologically possible'' and ``operationally effective'' is all \nabout. This is what the bill says:\n\n       . . . to deploy as soon as technologically possible an \n     effective national missile defense. . . .\n\n  It is pretty clear. When the technology allows us to build an \neffective system, we deploy it. Is that too much for the American \npeople to expect from their elected leaders, who are sworn to protect \nand serve them? Are we going to build a system, know that it is \neffective, but then not deploy it? I do not think so. If we had \nsomething that was technologically possible and operationally effective \nand we didn't deploy it, I think our constituents would be a little \nupset with us.\n  There are also those who claim it is simply too hard to, as they say, \nhit a bullet with a bullet. If we all had that attitude, we would still \nbe using bows and arrows to defend ourselves. We certainly would not \nhave the technology that we have today in stealth and missiles and \nlasers if we adopted that ``can't do'' attitude.\n  Just 2 days ago at White Sands, we did successfully intercept a \nmissile target with a Patriot-3 missile, proving we can hit a bullet \nwith a bullet. The only problem is that when you hit the bullet with \nthe Patriot, you are hitting it pretty close to you. What we want to do \nis hit that bullet long before it gets anywhere near us.\n  The third issue the administration wants to base a deployment \ndecision on is affordable cost. Boy, there is a bureaucratic attitude \nif I ever heard one. That statement is--frankly, with all due respect \nto those who made it--unconscionable. On February 2, Director Tenet \ntold the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       North Korea's Taepo Dong 1 launch last August demonstrated \n     technology that, if further developed, could give Pyongyang \n     the ability to deliver a payload to the western edge of the \n     United States of America.\n\n  To put it bluntly, North Korea will soon be able to strike San Diego, \nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle with nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons--and the President is telling us he is \nworried about the cost? He is worried about the cost? What is the cost \nof one of those missiles hitting one of those cities? What in the world \nis he talking about? I wish he had been as worried about having a spy \ncontinue to operate in one of our weapons labs for 3 years without \ndoing anything about it.\n  I note that the combined population of just the five cities I \nmentioned is 30 million people. The total population from San Diego to \nSeattle is 50 million people. What is the cost of losing 30 to 50 \nmillion people to that kind of missile attack? With all due respect, is \nthe President willing to go out there and look those 50 million people \nin the eye and say, ``We're going to check this out to see if it is \naffordable''? I say, if we are worried about money, then let's\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\ntake money out of someplace else in the budget and protect 50 million \npeople along the western coast of the United States of America.\n  The President wants to tell U.S. citizens we cannot protect them from \nweapons of mass destruction until we figure out how much it might cost. \nI say it is the opposite. We have to defend our citizens, and worry \nlater about the cost.\n  This is not an imagined threat. The CIA recently reported that China \nnow has a dozen missiles aimed at the United States. We have all heard \nthe reports of the Chinese general who, in 1996, warned that if we \nchose to defend Taiwan, we had better be willing to sacrifice Los \nAngeles. This, from a nation that the administration says we must \nengage. Those are pretty tough words from a country that we are \nsupposed to be engaging. Maybe we ought to disengage a little bit from \nChina when it threatens us with nuclear attack and steals our nuclear \nsecrets from our lab at Los Alamos.\n  Cost is a matter of relative priorities, Mr. President. As Senator \nSessions pointed out recently, the cost of a 3-year deployment to \nKosovo could reach 50 percent of what this administration plans to \nspend on national missile defense. We have already spent as much in \nBosnia in the past 3 years as an entire NMD program is estimated to \ncost. Priorities, I say to my colleagues, priorities. Kosovo, Bosnia or \n50 million people along the coast of the United States? We know what \nthe President has chosen as his priority. What is the Senate going to \nchoose for its priority?\n  Let's go to the last issue, the ABM Treaty of 1972, the bible for \nsome people in this body. The biggest fear is that we are going to \nundermine the ABM Treaty. What ABM Treaty? We signed the ABM Treaty \nwith the U.S.S.R. The last time I looked, there was no U.S.S.R.\n  On the 20th anniversary of the ratification of the treaty, President \nNixon said:\n\n       The ABM Treaty has been overtaken by the cold war's end.\n\n  Dr. Kissinger, the primary architect of the treaty, said in 1995 in \ntestimony before the Congress that the time had clearly come to:\n\n       . . . consider either amending the ABM Treaty or finding \n     some other basis for regulating the U.S.-Russian strategic \n     relationship. The ABM Treaty now stands in the way of our \n     ability to respond in an effective manner to the \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles, one of the most \n     significant post cold war threats.\n\n  That came from the architect of the treaty. He is saying that the \ntreaty stands in the way of our ability to defend ourselves.\n  Even Secretary of Defense Cohen recently said before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee that we may have to consider withdrawing from the \nABM Treaty.\n  I am not advocating withdrawing at this point. I am just insisting \nthat we not let the treaty harm our national security.\n  How absurd would it be for us to continue to honor the treaty with \nRussia, preventing us from protecting ourselves from weapons of mass \ndestruction, while all other nuclear-capable countries of the world \nwould be free to develop their own missile defense? What would that do \nto American security if we could not defend ourselves, but our enemies \ncould? Does that make sense? Am I missing something here? I just do not \nunderstand the foreign policy of this administration.\n  In conclusion, it would be indefensible to the American people to \nconcede that the threat of rogue missile attacks is real and credible, \nbut offer only a self-imposed weak defense against it. It is \nunconscionable. If the threat to the American people is real, then the \ndefense against these attacks must be real; not only that, it must be \naggressive, full-scale and monumental. Whatever resources are \nnecessary, the American people deserve to be defended.\n  Some in the minority claim that the passage of this bill might lead \nto a new arms race with the Russians. But everyone knows that any \nmissile defense currently in development would not upset the balance of \npower between Russia and the United States. NMD will provide defense \nagainst only limited and rogue attacks, not against incoming Russian \nmissiles.\n  What about Russia's proliferation of missile technology to rogue \nstates? Between technology transfers to Iran, India, and perhaps even \nChina, Russia is a large part of the reason we are here debating this \nbill today, because they are selling their technology around the world. \nProliferation is already a growing threat, independent of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we must pass this bill. This is not a partisan issue. \nIt is an issue of national security. And the defense of the American \nhomeland against a real and growing threat of ballistic missiles and \nour national security depends on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill, and to do it today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 74\n\n                    (Purpose: To modify the policy)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 74.\n       On page 2, strike lines 7 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n       It is the policy of the United States that a decision to \n     deploy a National Missile Defense system shall be made only \n     after the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \n     Director of Operational Test and Evaluation of the Department \n     of Defense, has determined that the system has demonstrated \n     operational effectiveness.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me explain my amendment and then \nhopefully discuss with the two managers, the chief sponsor of the bill, \nmy friend from Mississippi, and the manager on the Democratic side, my \nfriend from Michigan, their understanding of what the underlying bill \nprovides and the appropriateness of my amendment.\n  We had a hearing the other day in the Armed Services Committee. Mr. \nGansler was there, and he testified that the administration's plan, \nwith regard to this national missile defense program, is to handle this \nas they would handle other major weapons programs, weapons systems; \nthat is, they would proceed with development, but they would not go the \nnext step, they would not go into full production and deployment until \nthey had done the necessary operations tests to determine the \neffectiveness of the system.\n  I have had some concerns, frankly, about this legislation. I opposed \nthis in the last Congress because of those concerns, concerns that we \nwere, in this legislation, changing those ground rules on the \nDepartment of Defense and saying to them, ``No, you should not do the \nappropriate testing. In this case, you should go ahead and proceed to \ndeploy the system regardless of how ready it is for prime time.''\n  I guess that has been the concern that has prompted me to offer this \namendment. In private discussions with the manager of the bill, the \nsponsor of the bill, he has assured me that he does not see it that \nway. I want to just ask, if I could, the Senator from Mississippi if he \ncould just respond to a question sort of directly on this.\n  I was encouraged, frankly, by the statements I just heard from the \nSenator from New Hampshire, where he said that it is his understanding \nand his intention, clearly, by this legislation, that we would not be \nrequiring the Department of Defense to do anything by way of full \nproduction or deployment until they were convinced that this weapons \nsystem was operationally effective. Is that the understanding of the \nSenator from Mississippi also?\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, it seems to \nme clear from the language in the bill that we contemplate the \ndevelopment of a system that is effective. We use that word--an \n``effective'' ballistic missile defense, and that the deployment would \ntake place when it is technologically possible. So when the technology \nis matured, it is proven to work, and we know the missile system would \nbe effective to defend against ballistic missile attack. That is what \nthe sentiment is. That is the policy that is reflected in the language \nthat is used in the bill.\n  So that is consistent with the intent that this Senator has, as an \nauthor of\n\n[[Page S2800]]\n\nthe bill. And in discussing it with other cosponsors, I think that is \nthe sentiment of the Senate and would be reflected in future \nauthorization and appropriations measures. That is another part to this \nas well. And one of the concerns, I think, with the amendment that the \nSenator has sent to the desk is that it could be construed, with a \ndelegation of authority to the executive branch, to remove Congress \nfrom the decisionmaking process. We think Congress has a very important \nrole to play in oversight and also in the authorization of deployment \nand the funding of deployment decisions that will be made in this \nweapons system development and deployment.\n  So those are my reactions, my sentiments. I hope that they are not \ninconsistent with the concerns of the Senator from New Mexico. And I \nreally do not think they are.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi very much for that \nexplanation. I agree with him that clearly Congress needs to maintain \nits oversight of this program, as well as all other programs. And this \nis a very high priority for many of us here in Congress and everyone, I \nthink, who is concerned about national security issues. So I would not \nwant, by my amendment, to bring into question the ability of Congress \nto maintain that oversight. I do not believe the language of my \namendment does that.\n  I am encouraged to hear that the Senator believes that operational \neffectiveness is an essential part of what has to be established before \nwe go ahead and actually deploy something.\n  I want to just ask, in order to sort of complete the circle here, my \ngood friend, the ranking member on the Armed Services Committee, which \nI have the privilege of serving on, Senator Levin, if he has any \nthoughts about the underlying bill.\n  Again, I guess the question is, Is there, in the language of the \nunderlying bill, essentially a requirement that the Department of \nDefense treat this weapons system and this program the way it treats \nother major programs; and that is, to put them through the appropriate \noperational tests before they go forward with any deployment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. To my good friend from New Mexico, I say there is no \nprohibition in this bill against them using the regular procedures. So \nit is my assumption they would use those procedures given the absence \nof any prohibition.\n  Secondly, the word ``effective'' that is in the bill, it seems to me, \ndoes include the critical operational effectiveness concept which the \nSenator has referred to. Indeed, the word ``effective'' could cover a \nnumber of elements of effectiveness, but surely one of them is, I \nbelieve--and the sponsor of the bill has just confirmed this, I \nbelieve--that ``operational effectiveness'' would be included in the \nconcept of ``effectiveness.''\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate that explanation as well.\n  The Senator from Mississippi, I see, is on the floor. If he has any \nadditional comment, I would be anxious to hear it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I appreciate \nhis allowing me to comment further.\n  So the Record is complete, I would like to read into the Record some \ncomments that I wrote down after considering the amendment of the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  This bill is intended to establish a broad policy, stating the intent \nof the United States to defend itself against limited ballistic missile \nattack. It does not seek to micromanage the Defense Department's \nconduct of the program. It gives the Department of Defense flexibility \nin determining whether the national missile defense system is effective \nand technologically ready for deployment. That decision will be made \nwith congressional involvement and oversight provided by the \nappropriate committees.\n\n  The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology has \nstated in testimony before the Armed Services Committee that the \ncriteria to be used by the Defense Department in making such \ndeterminations are tailored to the needs of individual programs and the \nurgency of the threat they are intended to address.\n  So I think with those further statements we show what we consider to \nbe the meaning of the bill, the effect of the bill, and its \nrelationship between the Congress and the administration.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for that \nadditional explanation.\n  Mr. President, in order that I not delay or further confuse the \nRecord, let me take those assurances that I have heard from the Senator \nfrom Mississippi and the Senator from Michigan and state that I do \nbelieve with those assurances the bill does provide for this \nrequirement that operational effectiveness be demonstrated. That has \nbeen my primary concern as we considered this bill in the previous \nCongress, and I am glad to have that resolved.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 74 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will at this point withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 74) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from New \nMexico. He has raised a very important issue which was the subject of \nmajor discussion at the Armed Services Committee the other day; that \nis, the importance that any weapon system, before it is deployed, be \nshown to be operationally effective. I think his sensitivity to that \nissue has been longstanding, and I want to thank him for clarifying the \nRecord relative to this bill.\n  So that it is clear to Senator Bingaman and to all of the Members, \nthe word ``effective'' in the bill includes the concept of operational \neffectiveness. There are other elements of effectiveness which could \nalso be covered, but surely it includes the operational effectiveness \nconcept which the Senator has championed for so long.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 257, the \nNational Missile Defense Act, and to thank my friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, for his continued \nleadership on this issue--not today, not last year, but over a \nsustained period of time--to help educate America as to why this issue \nis so important to our future. I thank the cosponsor of this bill, \nSenator Inouye from Hawaii, who has joined over the years with Senator \nCochran in leading the debate and, hopefully, moving this body to a \ndecisive action today on passing the National Missile Defense Act.\n  Mr. President, the security of the American people is the first and \nmost important responsibility of the National Government. One of the \nprimary threats facing our national security in the 21st century is the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced, \nsophisticated missile technology.\n  Surveys show that many Americans think our Armed Forces can shoot \ndown any missile fired at the United States today. As the debate has \npointed out over the last few days, that, in fact, is not the case; it \nis a myth. We don't have a missile defense system today, we won't have \na missile defense system tomorrow, and we won't have a missile defense \nsystem next year. Yet the nations who are developing their own weapons \nof mass destruction are not waiting. Last year, two new countries \nentered the nuclear club, India and Pakistan. Other nations whose \nmotives are less than friendly toward the United States and our allies \nare aggressively pursuing these weapons and the ability to launch, the \nability to deliver, a nuclear weapon.\n  As technology spreads throughout the world, the threat increases not \nonly from rogue states but also from terrorist organizations. For \nyears, America was assured by our intelligence agencies that the \nability to strike the U.S. mainland by any rogue state was years away \nand that we would easily have enough time to develop a new missile \ndefense system before that possibility would occur.\n  Last July, a bipartisan commission headed by the distinguished former \nSecretary of Defense, former Chief of Staff to the President, former \nMember of the House of Representatives, Don Rumsfeld, sounded an alarm: \nAll was not quiet on the ballistic missile front. The Rumsfeld \nCommission examined the emerging and current ballistic missile threat \nto the United States. As\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nSecretary Rumsfeld testified last October before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee:\n\n       We concluded unanimously that we are now in an environment \n     of little or no warning.\n\n  The Rumsfeld Commission report contains several alarming conclusions.\n  One, Russia and China continue to pose threats. Both possess \nintercontinental ballistic missile capability of reaching the United \nStates mainland. We must be prepared for the possibility of an \naccidental launch--an accidental launch. In addition, and even more \ndeadly in terms of the threat it poses, both Russia and China have \nemerged as major suppliers of technology to a number of rogue nations \nand other countries.\n  Two, the Rumsfeld Commission found that North Korea and Iran could \neach pose a threat to the United States within 5 years of a decision to \ndo so.\n  Three, Iraq was estimated to be certainly within 10 years of posing a \nthreat. Whether we have been effective at limiting this development \nwith our airstrikes is unknown in Iraq because Iraq is now able to \ncontinue its work without the oversight of UNSCOM inspectors. These \nnations are not isolated; they work together. As Secretary Rumsfeld \nstated with regard to North Korea:\n\n       They are very, very active marketing ballistic missile \n     technologies.\n\n  Iran alone received technology assistance from Russia, China, and \nNorth Korea, which gives it a wider array of options.\n  And perhaps one of most striking comments made by Secretary Rumsfeld \nin his testimony in October was one that rang true with plain, \nstraightforward common sense. Again I quote Secretary Rumsfeld:\n\n       We have concluded that there will be surprises [deadly \n     surprises]. It is a big world, it is a complicated world, and \n     deception and denial are extensive. The surprise to me is not \n     that there are and will be surprises, but that we are \n     surprised that there are surprises.\n\n  The Rumsfeld Commission report was greeted with some skepticism by \nthe intelligence community. Then on October 31 of last year, the myth \nthat technology was years away was shattered when North Korea launched \na Taepo Dong I missile, a three-stage rocket, over Japan and into the \nPacific. This is a missile that, with upgrades, could have delivered a \nsmall payload, a nuclear payload, to Hawaii or Alaska. We know that the \nNorth Koreans are in the advanced stage of developing a Taepo Dong I \nintercontinental missile with the capability of delivering a nuclear \npayload to the American interior.\n  Finally, last month the CIA reversed itself saying the threat was \nreal, imminent, and very dangerous. In testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, CIA Director George Tenet stated:\n\n       I can hardly overstate my concern about North Korea. In \n     nearly all respects, the situation there has become more \n     volatile and more unpredictable.\n\n  Why has it taken us this long to wake up to the threats facing our \nNation? How many more intelligence reports and missile test firings do \nwe need? Vast oceans in time protected America at the beginning of \nWorld War II. Oceans in time will not protect America today. Time has \nrun out.\n\n  I was very pleased to see news reports this morning, Mr. President, \nthat President Clinton has dropped his threat now to veto this bill. \nHowever, the administration continues to raise concerns about whether a \nnational missile defense system fits within the framework of the 1972 \nABM Treaty with the old Soviet Union--the imploded Soviet Union, a \ncountry that no longer exists.\n  Much has been made by the opponents of this bill on how Russia would \nperceive our development of a national missile defense. I visited \nRussia in December. I spent 10 days in Russia and met with leaders \nthroughout Russia. I was in Siberia. I asked about this question. This \nquestion is about the relevancy of our national interest, as all \nquestions of national security are about the relevancy of our national \ninterest, as Russia's questions are about their national interest. The \nForeign Relations Committee will hold a hearing on the ABM Treaty in \nApril, and a continued set of hearings on into May, leading up to the \nJune 1 deadline by which Chairman Helms has asked the administration to \nsubmit the ABM Treaty amendments.\n  It is completely inconsistent for the administration to raise \nconcerns about building a national missile defense system under this \ncurrent 1972 treaty and then not submit the ABM Treaty amendments to \nthe Senate. This administration has yet to send amendments to the ABM \nTreaty, nor has it given any indication that it will. The President \nshould submit amendments and allow the Senate to debate this issue. We \nneed to determine whether this 1972 treaty is still relevant to \nAmerica's security in the 21st century. The security of our people \ncannot be held hostage to an outdated treaty with a country that no \nlonger exists. The most fundamental responsibility of this Government, \nof each of us who have the privilege to serve in this body, is to \nassure the freedom and security of this Nation; to do less not only \nabrogates our responsibility, but makes us less than worthy of serving \nthe people of this country.\n  As Secretary Rumsfeld stated:\n\n       The new reality makes threats such as terrorism, ballistic \n     missiles, and cruise missiles more attractive to dictators. \n     They are cheaper than armies and air forces and navies. They \n     are attainable. And ballistic missiles have the advantage of \n     being able to arrive at their destination undefended.\n\n  We need an effective missile defense system, and we need to get at it \nnow.\n  I conclude with what President Reagan said in 1983. He said:\n\n       If history teaches anything, it teaches simple-minded \n     appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is \n     folly--it means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of \n     our future, and the squandering of our freedom.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the National Missile \nDefense Act, S. 257.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 75\n\n(Purpose: To require a comparative study of relevant national security \n                               threats.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I will offer and \nthen I will engage in a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 75.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 4. COMPARATIVE STUDY OF RELEVANT NATIONAL SECURITY \n                   THREATS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Study.--Not later than January 1, 2001, \n     the President shall submit to Congress the comparative study \n     described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Content of Study.--(1) The study required under \n     subsection (a) is a study that provides a quantitative \n     analysis of the relevant risks and likelihood of the full \n     range of current and emerging national security threats to \n     the territory of the United States. The study shall be \n     carried out in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and \n     the heads of all other departments and agencies of the \n     Federal Government that have responsibilities, expertise, and \n     interests that the President considers relevant to the \n     comparison.\n       (2) The threats compared in the study shall include threats \n     by the following means:\n       (A) Long-range ballistic missiles.\n       (B) Bombers and other aircraft.\n       (C) Cruise missiles.\n       (D) Submarines.\n       (E) Surface ships.\n       (F) Biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons.\n       (G) Any other weapons of mass destruction that are \n     delivered by means other than missiles, including covert \n     means and commercial methods such as cargo aircraft, cargo \n     ships, and trucks.\n       (H) Deliberate contamination or poisoning of food and water \n     supplies.\n       (I) Any other means.\n       (3) In addition to the comparison of the threats, the \n     report shall include the following:\n       (A) The status of the developed and deployed responses and \n     preparations to meet the threats.\n       (B) A comparison of the costs of developing and deploying \n     responses and preparations to meet the threats.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, for the information of Senators, I \nintend to withdraw this amendment after talking about it and engaging \nin somewhat of a colloquy with Senator Cochran, and I think Senator \nLevin also wanted to speak on this.\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\n  Basically, let me describe what the amendment does. It requires that \nnot later than January 1 of 2001, the President will submit to Congress \na comparative study. It is a study that would provide a quantitative \nanalysis of the relevant risks and the likelihood of the full range of \ncurrent and emerging national security threats to the territory of the \nUnited States.\n  This says:\n\n       It shall be carried out in consultation with the Secretary \n     of Defense and the heads of all other departments and \n     agencies of the Federal Government that have \n     responsibilities, expertise, and interests that the President \n     considers relevant to the comparison.\n\n  Then I listed a number of items, including long-range ballistic \nmissiles; bombers and other aircraft; cruise missiles; submarines; \nsurface ships; biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons; and any other \nweapons of mass destruction that are delivered by means other than \nmissiles, including covert means and commercial methods, such as cargo \naircraft, cargo ships, trucks, and any other means.\n  I would like to describe what I am getting at here. As we look at the \nbill before us, S. 257, which is kind of narrowly drawn in terms of \nballistic missile defense, we seem to be getting kind of overfocus on \nthis, a focus that if only we build some kind of a ballistic missile \ndefense system, it will secure us from the weapons of mass destruction \nthat threaten us. But I am not so certain that is really the major \nthreat that we face, and whether or not all of the money put into that, \nall of our eggs into that basket, so to speak, really would protect us \nfrom what I consider to be more viable and determinable threats to our \nnational security.\n  For example, what about some of the key threats we hear about every \nday? Well, I have a chart that lists some of the typical types of \nnational security threats facing our Nation today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the chart in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE: NO SOLUTION TO KEY THREATS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Theater missile    Theater missile\n                                     defense solution   defense solution\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTruck bomb attack on U.S..........  Ineffective......  Ineffective.\nChemical weapons attack in U.S....  ......do.........    Do.\nBiological weapons attack in U.S..  ......do.........    Do.\nCruise missile attack on U.S......  ......do.........    Do.\nBomber attack on U.S..............  ......do.........    Do.\nLoose nukes in former Soviet Union  ......do.........    Do.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. For example, a national missile defense system would be \nineffective against a truck-bomb attack on the United States. Of \ncourse, we have had some experience, regrettably, in that area. It \nwould not be effective against a chemical weapons attack in the United \nStates. Now, we haven't had that, but Japan has. What about biological \nweapons that would be delivered by a terrorist? No small threat. It \nseems like there is an anthrax incident every week here in the country. \nAgain, if there is an anthrax scare, the first line of defense is going \nto be the local police and firefighters struggling to deal with the \nthreat, and our State and local public health officials, and other \nhealth care people.\n  However, a national missile defense system is no solution to combat \nthis very viable threat. The list goes on with a cruise missile attack. \nIt is much cheaper for a country to engage in; it would be launched \noffshore. Yet, a national missile defense would be ineffective. Even a \nbomber attack, coming in under our radar screens, would be ineffective \nfor missile defense; and even some of the ``loose nukes'' in the former \nSoviet Union, if in fact there were to be warheads smuggled out of the \nSoviet Union and enter the country by boat, plane, or truck across our \nborders. A missile defense is totally ineffective. Also listed is the \ntheater missile defense, which would also be ineffective against those \nthreats.\n  General Shelton of the Joint Chiefs of Staff agrees and has said:\n\n       There are other serious threats out there in addition to \n     that posed by ballistic missiles. We know, for example, that \n     there are adversaries with chemical and biological weapons \n     that can attack the United States today. They could do it \n     with a briefcase--by infiltrating our territory across our \n     shores or through our airports.\n\n  I am just concerned that we are focusing so much on this national \nballistic missile defense that we are forgetting about these other more \ndeterminable and viable threats.\n  My amendment seeks to provide for a study, sort of a comparative \nstudy, and a quantitative analysis of these risks: What is the risk of \na ballistic missile attack on the United States? What is that? And what \nis the risk of, say, a biological weapons attack on the United States? \nWhat do we have, either deployed or in development, to protect against \neach one of those?--thinking about the relative risk. I wanted this \nstudy to be done by January 1, 2001, before we go rushing down the road \ninvesting more billions of dollars into a ballistic missile defense \nthat would prove absolutely defenseless against these other viable \nthreats.\n  That is what I was seeking to do with this amendment.\n  I have had some conversations with the Senator from Mississippi about \nthis. I yield for any colloquy that we might engage in on this.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with respect to the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa, I thank him for discussing the amendment with \nmanagers before offering it. As I understand the amendment, it calls \nfor a report on a wide variety of threats facing the United States. S. \n257, the pending legislation, is intended to address one of these \nthreats--a limited ballistic missile attack against us for which we \nhave no defense.\n  While these other threats are important, they are not the subject of \nthis bill. We have tried to keep this bill focused on a specific policy \nquestion--whether the United States will defend itself against \nballistic missile attack. We have tried not to entangle this question \nin the details of other defense issues, however important they may be.\n  If a report on the many other threats from weapons of mass \ndestruction would be useful, the defense authorization or \nappropriations bills would be appropriate vehicles for directing such \nreporting requirements. As a matter of fact, it is our understanding \nthat a similar requirement for a study is being conducted and is being \ncomplied with in response to a directive in the intelligence \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1999.\n  In conclusion, just because there are some threats that we cannot \ndefend against perfectly doesn't mean we should not defend against \nothers.\n  So, while being sympathetic with the suggestion that the Senator is \nmaking, we think this can be accomplished; the goal can be accomplished \nthat he has pointed out by using the vehicles of the Intelligence \nCommittee authorization, as is now being done to some extent, and the \nauthorization and appropriations bills that will later be considered by \nthe Senate this year.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from \nMississippi. I understand that in the intelligence community that they \nonly look at possible threats but they don't make a comparative \nanalysis, nor do they deal with the status of how the United States \ncounters the threats.\n  Again, I am saying we need also to engage those agencies on the front \nline, not just the Pentagon. But I am talking about the Department of \nJustice, FBI, and HHS--all of these agencies that handle biological, \nchemical threats. We need to engage them in this comparative \nquantitative analysis.\n  Again, I want to make it clear to my friend from Mississippi that I \nbasically was not going to support the bill because I felt that the \nwords ``technologically feasible'' in the bill and saying that we \nshould deploy as soon as technologically possible--that that was kind \nof putting the cart before the horse.\n  I was also concerned a little bit about what this might mean for \nfurther negotiations on arms control, our START II and possibly the \nSTART III, and the ABM Treaty. But with the adoption of the Landrieu \namendment last night, I think that puts a balance here. I don't mind \nthe research and stuff that goes into looking at a possible ballistic \nmissile defense. I think we have to examine all of these. But it has to \nbe done in a balanced way and in a way that sort of takes into account \nwhat those threats are to our national security on kind of a \nquantitative basis without putting everything in just sort of one \nbasket, so to speak.\n\n[[Page S2803]]\n\n  But I think with the adoption of the Landrieu amendment that it is \nmuch more balanced. And I therefore support the bill. I wanted to offer \nthis amendment to try to again put that balance in the bill while \nlooking at these other possible threats. I understand what the Senator \nsays--that perhaps this is more amenable, or a more likely prospect for \nthe armed services authorization bill. I take that in good faith.\n  I spoke with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nWarner, and also ranking member, Senator Levin, about this. I think I \ncan represent that Senator Warner was open to the idea, without knowing \nmore about it and without having had an opportunity to really fully \nlook at it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly make a statement \nbefore asking the question, so he doesn't lose his right to the floor.\n  The Senator has put his finger on a very significant issue--and it is \none that all of us should struggle with, and many of us have struggled \nwith. His effort here is to focus the attention of this body on a range \nof threats that we face. And to attempt to see if we can't get a better \nhandle on the likelihood of those threats actually emerging is a very \nimportant action on his part. The chart he has used demonstrates what \nthe problem is. There are many threats which are much more likely than \na ballistic missile attack against us for which we have no defense. \nPerhaps we should devote resources to those, and then what would be the \nrelationship between the costs of defending against those more likely \nthreats compared to the cost of defending against a missile attack of \nthe kind that could come from North Korea, theoretically.\n  General Shelton phrased the issue this way. This was on January 5. He \nsaid:\n       there are two aspects of the National Missile Defense \n     [issue] that we have to be concerned with. Number one is: is \n     the technology that allows us to deploy one that is an \n     effective system, and within the means of this country money-\n     wise?\n\n  This is General Shelton, Chairman of our Joint Chiefs saying this.\n\n       Secondly is the threat and whether or not the threat, when \n     measured against all the other threats that we face, \n     justifies the expenditure of that type of money for that \n     particular system at the time when the technology will allow \n     us to field it?\n\n  Those are the factors that the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs wants to \nconsider, and those are some of the issues which the good Senator from \nIowa is addressing our attention to.\n  I asked General Shelton to give us what we call a ``threat spectrum'' \nand asked him to try to give us a continuum of threats in terms of the \nmost likely and less likely.\n  The least likely is in the upper right-hand corner, strategic missile \nattack, 6,000 Russian warheads. The next least likely is the rogue \nmissile. The next least likely, major theater wars, such as in Korea. \nThe next least likely is information wars, attacks on our satellites, \nor our power systems, or similar assets. The next least likely, but now \nbecoming more and more likely, are terrorist attacks in the United \nStates, some of which for instance the Senator from Iowa is talking \nabout, and then terror attacks abroad, regional conflicts, and so \nforth.\n  This is the issue which the Senator from Iowa is really focusing our \nattention on today. But his amendment goes significantly beyond this \nchart, which, by the way, was prepared by General Shelton. The \namendment of the Senator from Iowa would get us into a greater element \nof comparative risk in terms of trying to get a range of likelihood of \nthe risks, not just whether one risk is more likely than another. But \nhis amendment, the way it is drafted, would consider how much more or \nhow much less likely is one threat than another.\n\n  That is very valuable information, and General Shelton is attempting \nto work on that issue now. But the amendment of the Senator from Iowa \nputs it in a very precise and useful form.\n  In addition, it would be very helpful for us to know what would the \nrange of costs be to defend against the various threats, if we can do \nso. And all I can do is assure my good friend from Iowa that we on the \nArmed Services Committee will take a good look at his amendment. It has \nmy very strong support, and as he mentioned, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee said he would be open to such an amendment on the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  I think that is a very appropriate place for the amendment to go, and \nI think he would find, hopefully, bipartisan support on the committee \nfor this kind of a study, because it really addresses an issue which I \nthink every Member of this body would like to see addressed.\n  I thank him for his effort and assure him of my support on the armed \nservices bill. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I would \nsupport an expansion of what we are doing to include the kind of \nfactual analyses for which his amendment would call.\n  I thank him for the amendment and just assure him, if he does not \noffer it here, there will be a major effort to get it or something very \nclose to it on the authorization bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan, the \nranking member on the Armed Services Committee, a leader in this area \nand, obviously, way ahead of me on this topic, who has done a lot of \nresearch and work on this. I appreciate that and the kind of \ninformation he has given out with this chart he has developed. In \ntaking that assurance, I would withdraw my amendment.\n  How much more time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will just take about 5 more minutes.\n  I cannot resist the opportunity to talk a little bit about this \nconcept of the ballistic missile defense system. I was just reading the \nhistory of what happened in France prior to World War II. I got to \nthinking; someone described this ballistic missile defense as sort of \nour new Maginot Line, so I said I want to find out about the Maginot \nLine, really what it was.\n  Louis Snyder wrote the ``Historical Guide to World War II.'' It is a \nbasic reference work for anyone studying the history of World War II. I \nrecommend that my colleagues read through this volume of history, \nespecially the story of the Maginot Line.\n  In the late 1920s and 1930s, France constructed a huge series of \nfortifications on its border with Germany. It was named after Andre \nMaginot, French minister of war who started the project. A huge \nworkforce constructed the fortifications that were considered \nimpregnable by the French military. More than 26 million cubic feet of \ncement was used to build a series of giant pillboxes, gun turrets, and \ndragons teeth. Elevators led to underground passages that included \nliving quarters, hospitals, cafeterias, and storehouses. It sounds like \nour missile silo bunkers.\n  More than $1 billion was spent by the French military. That is in \n1930s dollars. Factored today that would be $12 billion they spent to \nbuild the Maginot Line, and from a nation much smaller than the United \nStates. It was truly an awesome endeavor intended to thwart a great \nthreat to France; that is, an invasion by Germany.\n  Of course, there was just one problem. The German military high \ncommand were no fools. They developed an adequate counter. They simply \nwent around the Maginot Line. By going through Belgium, the Maginot \nLine proved almost useless in defending the French homeland, and it did \nnothing to counter the blitzkrieg tactics used by the Germans to \ncounter static defenses.\n\n  I might also add here that Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who I believe was \nnot a general at that time but a colonel, opposed the Maginot Line, but \nthe French Government, I am sure, probably in sort of a working \nrelationship with concrete people and builders and those who wanted to \nmake a lot of money building this huge fortification, decided to go \ndown that road. Charles de Gaulle warned of the blitzkrieg coming and \nthat the Maginot Line would do nothing to protect them against it.\n  I think the analogy of the Maginot Line to ballistic missile defense \nis startling. Are we going to spend tens of billions of dollars on a \ndefense against a single threat? Will our enemies simply go around the \nballistic missile defense, our Maginot Line? Of course, they will. The \ncounter is simple. Truck bombs, weapons of mass destruction slipped\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\ninto our country by plane, boat, or truck would all go around the \nballistic missile defense.\n  Perhaps some of my colleagues want a simple answer to real and \npotential threats from around the world. We want a simple silver bullet \ndefense against a dangerous world. We may spend billions of dollars for \nthis new Maginot Line, but the result will be the same as it was for \nthe French 60 years ago. Life is just more complicated than what a \nnational missile defense could counter.\n  In fact, the Maginot Line analogy applies, I think, to the psychology \nof missile defense. As Louis Snyder wrote, ``The French public, too, \nhad an almost mystical faith in the Maginot Line and believed its \ndefense to be absolute and total.''\n  Mr. President, I hope we don't fall in the same trap, but ever since \nstar wars started under the Reagan administration, we have had this \nsort of concept that we could build some kind of a dome over the United \nStates that would be impregnable, that would totally and fully protect \nall of our citizens. That is mythical. There is no such dome. A truck \nbomb, a terrorist attack by boat, a suitcase, anthrax poisoning, that \nmissile shield would never protect us from anything such as that.\n  So I hope and trust that the authorizing committee will take a look \nat all these other threats, I think much more real, much more \ndeterminable, and I believe much more effectively countered other \nsystems than a national ballistic missile defense system.\n  So that, again, was the purpose of my amendment. It was to try to \nbring balance. I appreciate the fact that this bill is focused on one \narea. But I still believe that this is the way we ought to go if we are \ngoing to make any rational decisions around here on how we spend our \ntaxpayers' dollars on defense.\n  I think we need this kind of study, and I appreciate what Senator \nLevin has said. I appreciate his leadership. In my conversation with \nSenator Warner from Virginia, the chairman, he was open to this, and I \nhope and trust that the Armed Services Committee will proceed down that \nline and provide us with the kind of balanced information we need on \nthe Appropriations Committee before we go down this road of spending \nbillions of dollars on a ballistic missile defense.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 75 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, with that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 75) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I start out by extending my appreciation \nand praise to the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran, who has \ndone an incredible job on this legislation. He has, for years, \nadvocated a capability of this Nation to defend itself against missile \nattack. Without his dedication and hard work we would not be here \ntoday. The Senator from Mississippi has performed a signal service, not \nonly for the people of Mississippi but the people of this Nation, \nincluding all 50 States rather than just 48. I thank him for the \nmarvelous job he has done.\n  I also think it is worthy of note that the persuasiveness of his \narguments have caused the administration to significantly shift their \nposition on this very important issue. So, again, my congratulations to \nthe Senator from Mississippi and my sincere appreciation.\n  Mr. President, the question of whether to deploy defenses against \nballistic missiles has been a contentious and unresolved issue for over \n40 years. As a result, Americans today are vulnerable to destruction by \na missile attack on our soil. The bill before us today, the National \nMissile Defense Act of 1999, resolves this national policy debate by \ncalling for the deployment of an effective missile defense system when \ntechnologically possible to protect our citizens from the threat of a \nballistic missile attack on the U.S.\n  Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen announced in January that the Clinton \nAdministration, after years of discounting the existence of a missile \nthreat to the U.S., will now support and provide the necessary funding \nfor development and deployment of a ballistic missile defense system. \nOn the surface, this appears to be one of the President's more \npropitious policy reversals. Yet, the Clinton Administration threatened \nto veto this bill, which establishes in law the missile defense policy \nthe Administration now claims to support.\n  While I am pleased that the Administration has lifted its veto \nthreat, I question the interpretation of the passage of yesterday's \namendment that reportedly provided the basis for this latest reversal \nof position. The United States should proceed with deployment of a \nmissile defense system irrespective of whether Russia agrees to reduce \nits nuclear force levels in accordance with the START II agreement. How \nmany times do we have to point out that the requirement for missile \ndefenses is predicated upon a much broader threat that the \nAdministration apparently still doesn't fully comprehend.\n  Mr. President, since its inauguration, the Clinton Administration has \ndemonstrated an approach to national defense that can only be described \nas disengaged and minimalist. Administration officials have sought not \nto maximize our military strength within reasonable fiscal constraints, \nbut to find ways to minimize defense spending at the expense of \nmilitary capability and readiness, and in so doing, they have \nendangered our future security.\n  Our late colleague and a man I greatly admired, Senator John Tower, \nstressed time and again that the size and composition of our Armed \nForces, and thus the amount of our budgetary resources that are devoted \nto defense, must be determined by the level and nature of the threat. \nThe Clinton Administration's long-standing opposition to missile \ndefenses, as well as its continued refusal to provide adequate levels \nof defense spending, are the complete antithesis of Senator Tower's \nsound advice. Consequently, our nation is vulnerable right now to the \nthreat of an accidental or unauthorized missile launch from Russia or \nChina, and will be vulnerable to additional threats in the near future \nfrom North Korea and other rogue nations implacably hostile to America \nand governed by unpredictable leaders.\n  Mr. President, one of the principal reasons for our country's \nvulnerability to ballistic missile attack is not lack of money or \ntechnology. It is the 1972 ABM Treaty.\n  In the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, then-Secretary of \nDefense Robert McNamara developed the theory of Mutual Assured \nDestruction as a means of deterring nuclear war between the U.S. and \nthe Soviet Union. This concept relied on the assumption that, so long \nas both the U.S. and the Soviet Union were confident of their ability \nto retaliate against each other with assurance of enormous destruction, \nnuclear war would be averted and there would be no incentive to build \nmore offensive nuclear weapons.\n\n  The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was an essential component of \nthis ``balance of terror'' concept. It prohibits the deployment of \neffective defensive systems which were perceived as undermining the \nconcept of mutually assured destruction. In effect, the ABM Treaty was \ndesigned to keep the citizenry of both the U.S. and the former Soviet \nUnion equally vulnerable to destruction in a nuclear exchange.\n  The ten years following ratification of the ABM Treaty, however, \nwitnessed the greatest expansion of Soviet offensive strategic nuclear \nforces in history, destroying the basic premise of the MAD doctrine, \nand the ABM Treaty as well. Yet, the Treaty's proponents cling to it \nwith an almost theological reverence.\n  It was President Reagan who finally called into question the wisdom \nof continuing to deprive ourselves of missile defenses in the face of \noverwhelming evidence that the Soviet Union was pursuing the capability \nof launching a debilitating strike against the U.S. His March 1983 \nspeech set the stage for the first serious discussion of defensive \nsystems in over a decade. If his vision of a global system was \ntechnologically and financially unrealistic, his dream of protecting \nthe American public from the threat of foreign missiles was prescient, \nand the Strategic Defense Initiative--the butt of many a joke by\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\narms control theorists--was instrumental in bringing down the Soviet \nUnion without firing a shot.\n  Since work began in earnest in the Reagan Administration to develop \nmissile defenses for our nation, the threat has changed. The end of the \nCold War and the emergent threat of ballistic missile proliferation \nhave fundamentally altered the approach this country must take to the \nissue of missile defenses. In fact, the imperative to deploy effective \nsystems is greater now because of the unpredictability of the potential \nthreats.\n  Throughout the Bush Administration, as our overall defense strategy \nand budget were being adjusted to reflect the changes in the world, so \ntoo was our plan for ballistic missile defenses revised to address the \nchanged threat.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has retained allegiance to \nthe outmoded ABM Treaty and, over the years, has significantly cut the \nfunding and restricted the objectives of the ballistic missile defense \nprogram.\n  Remember, back in 1994, when the President evoked considerable \nlaughter from his audience at a campaign rally when he said:\n\n       Here's what they [the Republicans] promise . . . we're \n     going to increase defense and we're going to bring back Star \n     Wars. And then we're going to balance the budget.\n\n  The Clinton Administration's attitude for the past six years has been \nto ridicule efforts to develop and deploy a system to effectively \ndefend our nation against a ballistic missile strike. The result has \nbeen a significant and dangerous delay in ending the ``terror'' of a \nnuclear strike.\n  Now, the President has belatedly agreed, at least rhetorically, to \nthe agenda he formerly ridiculed. While I applaud the President's \nwords, I remain more than mildly skeptical about his true commitment to \nprotecting our nation from the clear threat of missile attack.\n  The President's budget proposal, which was submitted to the Congress \non February 1, proves skeptics correct.\n  While the President was pledging more funding for development of a \nnational missile defense system on one hand, his other hand was taking \n$250 million out of the program to pay for the Wye River Agreement. At \nthe same time, the Administration decided to push back the deployment \ndate for missile defenses from 2003 to 2005, with no justifiable reason \nfor doing so.\n  If the President is truly getting serious about missile defense, why \nwould he show us the money, and then snatch it back and slip the \ndeployment date two additional years beyond its already much-delayed \ntimetable?\n  Another indication of the Administration's disingenuous embrace of \nmissile defenses are the qualifications attached to its support in two \nareas: questions about the nature of the threat, and continued \ndeference to the restrictions of the ABM Treaty.\n  No fewer than 30 times over the last several years, President Clinton \nhas gone before the public and boasted that, thanks to his policies, \nthe American people, for the first time since the dawn of the Cold War, \ncan go to sleep at night without the threat of missiles targeted \nagainst their country. Clearly, the Administration has been existing in \na virtual state of denial about the expanding and diverse threat of \nballistic missiles.\n  I urge the President to take another look at the report of the \nCommission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, \nknown as the Rumsfeld Commission. It is a completely nonpartisan and \nvery sobering look at the threats we face. The Commission concluded \nthat the threat is here now, and that traditional methods of \ndetermining the nature and scale of the threat need to be examined.\n  The Rumsfeld Commission's meticulous examination of the growing \nthreat to the U.S. of ballistic missiles, with its emphasis on the \ndifficulties inherent in determining when serious threats will appear \nand the tendency of such threats to materialize sooner than \nanticipated, should have shaken the White House out of its fatuous \ncomplacency. Apparently, that is not the case.\n  A recent article in Inside the Pentagon pointed out that, even after \nthe Rumsfeld Commission report was released in July 1998, the \nAdministration predicted the absence of a rogue nation threat, \nexcepting North Korea, before 2010. And in a February 3 letter to the \nChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the President's \nNational Security Advisor, Sandy Berger, wrote that, prior to a \ndecision to deploy a national missile defense system, ``the President \nand his senior advisers will need to confirm whether the rogue state \nballistic missile threat to the United States has developed as quickly \nas we now expect. . . .''\n\n  Apparently North Korea's launch last August of an intercontinental \nballistic missile over Japan, Iran's ongoing efforts with Russian \nassistance to develop such a missile, and Iraq's continuing efforts in \nthat regard do not constitute a threat.\n  Equally disturbing is the Administration's view of the ABM Treaty. In \nhis February 3 letter, Mr. Berger reiterated that ``the ABM Treaty \nremains a cornerstone of strategic stability''--a reminder that we are \ndealing with an Administration that is imbued with an unquestioned \nadherence to an outdated treaty. While I am mindful of arguments that \ndeployment of national missile defenses may be perceived by some \nnations as a potentially hostile act, theories of nuclear deterrence \nthat were of questionable value during the Cold War clearly do not \napply today or in the foreseeable future and should not be permitted to \nstand in the way of going forward.\n  If the Administration supports deployment of an effective national \nmissile defense system, it cannot remain wedded to the ABM Treaty. Make \nno mistake, the ABM Treaty was intended to and does preclude our \nability to deploy nation-wide missile defenses. Construction of a \nmissile defense facility at the one treaty-permissible site cannot be \nexpanded for national coverage without violating the terms of the \ntreaty. While the original 1972 treaty permitted each country two \nsites, it stipulated that they had to be deployed so as to preclude \neven regional coverage.\n  Deploying a national missile defense system, therefore, requires \neither unilateral abrogation of the ABM Treaty or an expeditiously \nnegotiated revision of it. As the treaty clearly prohibits us from \nproviding for the common defense--our most fundamental constitutional \nresponsibility--I urge the Administration to proceed without delay to \nachieve the needed changes to the treaty, or move for its abrogation.\n  Questionable in its utility even at the time it was negotiated, the \nABM Treaty was signed with a totalitarian regime that no longer exists \nand which violated the treaty at every opportunity. Its day is past. If \nRussia will not agree to negotiate changes to the treaty that will \npermit deployment of national missile defenses, then we must exercise \nour authority to withdraw from the treaty to protect our national \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to talk about the larger problem, \nof which the Administration's refusal to recognize the clear threat \nposed by proliferating ballistic missile development is but one aspect.\n  I have long been critical of many aspects of the Clinton \nAdministration's national security policies. This is an Administration \nthat has never been comfortable with the conduct of foreign policy, and \nso has little grasp of the role of military force in guaranteeing our \nplace in world affairs. Both our policies and the force structure \nneeded to support them seem to be decided in this Administration on the \nbasis of what we can afford after taking care of all other priorities, \ninstead of what is necessary to protect our interests.\n  We can honestly debate the merits of the numerous contingencies to \nwhich the Administration has deployed military force, but no one can \ndeny that the combination of over 10 years of declining defense budgets \nand longer and more frequent force deployments has stretched the \nServices perilously close to the breaking point. What is at risk, \nwithout exaggeration, are the lives of our military personnel and the \nsecurity of the United States.\n  After years of denying the obvious, in the face of compelling \ntestimony before Congress from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nAdministration has finally begun to concede that we have serious \nreadiness problems in our Armed Forces. Those of us who have been \ncriticized for sounding alarm bells about military readiness now have \nthe\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\nempty satisfaction of seeing the Administration admit there is more to \nmaintaining a strong defense than their history of falsely promising to \ndo so.\n  After six years of short-changing the Armed Forces, the President \nproposed adding money to the defense budget--another stunning policy \nreversal--for readiness, modernization, and even national missile \ndefense. Once again, though, his rhetoric far exceeds his actions.\n  Last fall, the President asked for $1 billion in immediate, emergency \nfunding to redress readiness problems--a mere drop in the bucket \ncompared to what the Service Chiefs said was required. Congress added \nanother $8 billion, but then wasted most of that on pork-barrel \nspending. The result--a band-aid solution to a serious readiness \ncrisis.\n  The same minimal approach is reflected in the President's budget \nsubmission for Fiscal Year 2000. After promising a budget increase of \n$12.6 billion, the President only asked for $4.1 billion in his budget \nrequest, and most of that will be needed to pay for ongoing \ncontingencies in Bosnia and southwest Asia and desperately needed \nmilitary pay raises and benefits. The rest of the so-called increase \ncomes from ``smoke and mirrors'', like anticipated lower inflation and \nfuel costs, cuts in previously funded programs, and an economically \nunsound incremental funding plan for military construction projects. \nAnd even if everything works as planned, the Administration budget \nshort-changes the military next year and every year thereafter.\n  There is a pattern here, Mr. President, of promising everything and \ndelivering very little. Whether it's protecting our citizens from a \nballistic missile attack, or maintaining modern, prepared armed forces, \nthis President seems incapable of following through on his commitments.\n  Mr. President, I am uncomfortable with a conclusion that the \nPresident does not care about the common defense. I must assume, \ninstead, that he simply fails to understand the imperative of \nestablishing policies and providing needed resources to protect our \nnation's interests and our citizens.\n  The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 establishes a national \npolicy that we must protect Americans from a clear and present danger--\nthe threat of ballistic missile attack. The President was correct to \nwithdraw his veto threat and join with the Congress to put in place \nboth the policy and the resources that will make our citizens safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 257. Although this \nbill is not as comprehensive or detailed as I would prefer, I have come \nto the conclusion that S. 257, as amended, sends an important signal of \nour country's commitment to defending itself from ballistic missile \nattack from a rogue state.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I am an advocate for national missile \ndefense, and have authored legislation that has advanced the NMD \nprogram. I urge the Administration to include funding in the budget \nthat would allow for NMD deployment, and am pleased that $6.6 billion \nwas added to the future years defense plan for this purpose.\n  Increasingly, I am convinced that we need NMD sooner rather than \nlater. Last July, the Rumsfeld Commission reported that several rogue \nstates could develop an ICBM capable of threatening our country before \nwe expect it. Recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran have \nconfirmed the essence of the Rumsfeld panel's findings. I was disturbed \nby these developments, but have long said that we should be prepared \nbefore we are surprised.\n  Our country needs to move forward aggressively with NMD. But because \nour NMD program does not exist in a vacuum, it needs to be guided by \nwhat I call three common sense criteria: compatibility with arms \ncontrol, affordability, and use of proven, tested technology.\n  As introduced last year S. 257 did not address these concerns, and \nits authors were refusing to entertain amendments. For these reasons, \nin 1998 I opposed this measure.\n  I am pleased that the bill's authors decided to support improving S. \n257 through the amendment process. With the addition of the amendments \noffered by Senators Cochran and Landrieu, today I am prepared to \nsupport S. 257. Allow me to briefly discuss the impact of these \namendments.\n  Yesterday the Senate, on a 99-0 vote, approved an amendment offered \nby Senator Cochran that will ensure that considerations of \naffordability and use of proven technology will not be neglected. By \nstating that funding the NMD will be subject to Congressional \nauthorization and appropriations, the Cochran amendment indicates that \nno final decisions about deployment, funding levels, or the system's \ntechnological maturity have been made. I thank my esteemed colleague \nfrom Mississippi for his comments on this point during his colloquy \nwith Senator Bingaman earlier today. Let me repeat: as amended, S. 257 \nis not the final word on NMD cost and use of proven technology.\n  Even more significant was the amendment offered by the distinguished \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee's Strategic Forces \nSubcommittee, Senator Landrieu. In affirming that it is our nation's \npolicy to pursue continued negotiated reductions to Russian nuclear \nforces, the Landrieu amendment makes unmistakably clear that as our NMD \nprogram moves forward we will take into account our arms control \nagreements and objectives. Because there can be little hope of Russian \nagreement to further nuclear reductions in the absence of continued \nUnited States support for the ABM Treaty, following through on the \nLandrieu amendment will require continued adherence to the ABM Treaty.\n  I would also like to note that I have been assured by the President's \nadvisors that in no way will S. 257 by interpreted by our nation's arms \ncontrol negotiators as a repudiation of the ABM Treaty. Administration \nofficials continue to make it clear that the ABM Treaty remains the \n``cornerstone of strategic stability,'' and that the Administration has \na ``strong commitment to the ABM Treaty.''\n  I cannot understate the importance of these amendments. Without them, \nI would again vote against S. 257.\n  It is true that I would have preferred that the Senate would today be \npassing a more comprehensive NMD bill, one that is more explicit about \nthe importance of our arms control agreements and offers specific \nguidance on affordability, system component selection, and technology \ndevelopment and deployment. It is my intention to introduce legislation \nwhich will describe in more detail how the NMD program should proceed.\n  For the time being, however, I regard S. 257 as a constructive \ncontribution to our NMD program. It will do no harm to our nation's \nsecurity, and will put our nation's potential enemies on notice that we \nare working aggressively to establish a defense against ICBMs. As \namended, S. 257 will also help ensure that concerns of arms control, \ncost, and use of proven technology will be carefully considered. This \nis a good bill, and will have my support.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during the Cold War, the United States co-\nexisted with the Soviet Union in a strategic environment characterized \nby high-risk but low-probability of a ballistic missile exchange \nbetween the two countries involving nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons.\n  Today, however, with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end \nof the cold war, the opposite is the case--we live in a lower-risk but \nhigher-probability environment with respect to ballistic missile \nexchanges. In other words, even as the probability of a large-scale \nnuclear exchange between the United States and Russia has mercifully \ndeclined, the probability that one or several weapons of mass \ndestruction might be used to attack the American homeland or American \nforces at home or abroad has increased.\n  Indeed, absent a U.S. response to the proliferation of ballistic \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction that is as focused, serious, \nand vigorous as America's cold war deterrent strategy to protect the \nAmerican homeland and the West, Americans can anticipate the threatened \nas well as the actual use of diverse weapons delivery systems to attack \nthe U.S. homeland in the future.\n  Missile defense must be a part of that response. For that reason, I \nam pleased to be an original cosponsor of the legislation before us and \ncommend Senator Cochran for his leadership on this issue.\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\n  Let me explain my strong support for this bill.\n  Missile defense is not a silver bullet that, by itself, can \nadequately protect the United States from the enhanced threats posed by \nballistic missile proliferation and the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction. But it is an important component that gives added \ncredibility to the other elements of our strategy.\n  I approach the response to these threats to American security through \nthe prism of ``defense in depth.'' There are three main lines of \ndefense against emerging ballistic missile threats and weapons of mass \ndestruction. Together, they help form the policy fabric of an \nintegrated defense in depth.\n  The first line of defense is preventing proliferation at potential \nsources abroad. The second is deterring and interdicting the flow of \nillicit trade in these weapons and materials. The third line of defense \nis ``homeland defense'' and involves programs that run the gamut from \npreparing domestically for WMD crises to protection against limited \nballistic missile attacks.\n  With respect to the initial line of defense, the United States is \nimplementing programs that address the threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction at the greatest distance possible from our borders and at \nthe most prevalent source, the former Soviet Union. While much more \nremains to be done, the Nunn-Lugar Scorecard is impressive. Nunn-Lugar \nhas facilitated the destruction of 344 ballistic missiles, 286 \nballistic missile launchers, 37 bombers, 96 submarine missile \nlaunchers, and 30 submarine launched ballistic missiles. It also has \nsealed 191 nuclear test tunnels. Most notably, 4,838 warheads that were \non strategic systems aimed at the United States have been deactivated. \nAll at a cost of less than one-third of one percent of the Department \nof Defense's annual budget. Without Nunn-Lugar, Ukraine, Kazakstan, and \nBelarus would still have thousands of nuclear weapons. Instead, all \nthree countries are nuclear weapons-free.\n  The second line of defense against these threats involves efforts to \ndeter and interdict the transfer of such weapons and materials at far-\naway borders. Nunn-Lugar and the U.S. Customs Service is working at the \nborders of former Soviet states to assist with the establishment of \nexport control systems and customs services. In many cases these \nnations have borders that are thousands of miles long, but local \ngovernments do not have the infrastructure or ability to monitor, \npatrol, or secure them. These borders are particularly permeable, \nincluding points of entry into Iran on the Caspian Sea and other rogue \nnations.\n  We must continue to plug these porous borders abroad. These nations \nare seeking our help and it is in our interests to supply it. Secure \nborders in this region of the world would strengthen our second line of \ndefense and serve as another proliferation choke-point.\n  The third line of defense involves the United States preparing \ndomestically to respond to these threats. That is the purpose of the \n1996 Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction \nAct. This law directs professionals from the Department of Defense, \nFederal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Health and Human \nServices, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and others to join \ninto partnerships with local emergency professionals in cities across \nthe country. The Pentagon intends to supply training and equipment to \n120 cities across the country over the next four years. To date, 52 \nmetropolitan areas have received training to deal with these potential \nthreats.\n  We must take those steps necessary to protect the American people \nfrom these threats and Nunn-Lugar and Nunn-Lugar-Domenici make powerful \ncontributions to our efforts. We have made significant progress in \nreducing these threats and constructing a defense-in-depth. But a \ncomplete defense-in-depth must include protection from missile attack.\n  I was pleased to see this common-sense, bipartisan approach to the \nmissile defense issue embodied in the Cochran bill. The bill states: \n``It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \ntechnologically possible a national missile defense system capable of \ndefending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic \nmissile attack.''\n  This bill offers a new approach to the missile defense policy debate. \nIt does not specify a specific system architecture or deployment dates \nwhich have bogged down previous legislative proposals.\n  The national missile defense system promoted both in this legislation \nwould not be capable of defending against thousands of warheads being \nlaunched against the United States. Rather, we are planning a system \ncapable of defending against the much smaller and relatively \nunsophisticated ICBM threat that a rogue nation or terrorist group \ncould mount as well as one capable of shooting down an unauthorized or \naccidentally launched missile.\n  At minimum, the recent revelations over Chinese nuclear espionage \nsuggests that China is intent on building its military capabilities to \na point that exceeds the projections and assessments of the U.S. \nmilitary and intelligence community. The Cox committee findings have \ndone for American appreciation of the potential Chinese nuclear threat \nwhat the Rumsfeld Commission did for our knowledge of North Korean and \nIranian capabilities. And like the latter, the former may highlight the \nneed to review the impact of such enhanced nuclear capabilities on our \nexisting assumptions and requirements with respect to a limited \nballistic missile defense system. Illicit acquisition and testing of \nthe design for the W-88 nuclear warhead strongly suggests that the \nChinese are modernizing their strategic force and using such tests to \ndevelop mobile missiles to possibly penetrate missile defense.\n  Acquisition of United States nuclear warhead technology will give \nChina a major boost in its strategic capability when added to other \nrecent improvements to its long-range missiles. Indeed, possession of \nthe design of the W-88 would have helped China advance toward key \nstrategic goals. Equally important, China's possession of the design of \nadvanced United States warheads poses a proliferation risk. Such \nwarheads have features that could prove useful to aspiring nuclear \nweapons states. In brief, if China shared W-88 warhead design \ninformation with nations like North Korea, Pakistan, or Iran, they \ncould develop and deploy a more potent nuclear force in a shorter \nperiod of time.\n  Lastly, lighter, smaller warheads in the Chinese nuclear arsenal will \nincrease the range of Chinese missiles and make it easier for \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles to hit the United States. And \nthis, in turn, could make a strategic difference if the United States \nand China were once again to come to odds over Taiwan. Certainly, it \ncould have an impact on the efficacy of any American plans to include \nTaiwan--or Japan for that matter--in any regional missile defense \nsystem.\n  In short, these recent revelations should force us to reconsider a \nnumber of the assumptions and resulting requirements that underlie our \nthinking both on theater as well as national missile defense. The \nrecent report by the Rumsfeld Commission raised serious doubts about \nthe core assumptions that undergird administration policy for \ndeveloping a national missile defense systems and for considering \namendments to the ABM Treaty. The Cox committee report not only called \ninto question other core assumptions but also the requirements for an \neffective, if limited, national missile defense system.\n\n  The Rumsfeld Commission took an independent look at the critical \nquestion of warning time and not only dissented from the intelligence \ncommunity's estimates but struck at the core of the administration's \n``3+3'' policy by finding that a ballistic missile threat to the United \nStates could emerge with little or no warning over the next 5 years.\n  Even before the Rumsfeld Commission issued its report, Senator \nCochran, along with Senator Inouye, introduced the legislation before \nus. It directs the deployment of effective anti-missile defenses of the \nterritory of the United States as soon as ``technologically feasible.'' \nBy making a missile defense deployment decision dependent on technical \nreadiness as opposed to intelligence estimates about emerging threats \nand warning time, this legislation appeared to many to take an approach \nto missile defense that is fundamentally different from\n\n[[Page S2808]]\n\nthe administration's policy. Indeed, critics of the Cochran bill have \ngone out of their way to try and paint major differences with the \nadministration's policy.\n  The Cochran bill attempts to determine whether and how our current \npolicy on national missile defense should be changed in light of the \ngrowing disutility of warning time and intelligence estimates as \ntriggers for deployment decisions. While critics may argue that the \nCochran bill neither provides a clear answer to that question or a \nclear policy alternative to that of the administration, it does propose \nthat a deployment decision rest on more than whether a national missile \ndefense system simply is ``technologically feasible''. The Cochran bill \nalso sensibly insists that the national missile defense system be \neffective ``against limited ballistic missile attacks (whether \naccidental, unauthorized, or deliberate)'' before it is deployed.\n  The Cochran bill is a statement of intentions, not a policy map, and \nit represents not an escape from but rather a recognition of the \ndifficult intelligence and policy problems with respect to the kinds of \nemerging ballistic missile threats, the time-frame for their emergence, \nand what we should do about them.\n  So the Cochran bill recognizes that there will remain the tough \npolicy and intelligence questions that cannot be ducked. The 1972 ABM \nTreaty was intended to preclude the kind of nationwide missile defenses \nthat could undermine the credibility of a large second strike \ndeterrent, using measures based on technology over 25 years ago. In \n1999, both the threats and the technology have changed. The threat \nposed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles is clearest, ant the \nABM Treaty should not be allowed to interfere with programs to deploy \neffective defenses.\n  Equally important, there is nothing in the Cochran bill that would \nprevent us from engaging the Russians in discussions about modifying \nthe ABM Treaty to permit effective national defenses against the kinds \nof missile attacks that should constitute the post-cold-war threat of \nconcern to both countries. If these exchanges are not successful, then \nconsideration can be given to withdrawing from the agreement.\n  Finally, critics of the Cochran bill complain both about the timing \nof the bill as well as the message its sends to the Russians. Three \npoints are worth making. First, for the critics there is never a good \ntime to take up missile defense and in this they are joined by the \nRussians. And to the great surprise of absolutely no one, the Russians \nhave announced that the Duma might be prepared to take up START II \nagain. With Russian Prime Minister Primakov on his way to Washington, I \nwould say that the timing is just about right.\n  The administration must be more forthcoming with Russia on the issue \nof missile defense. It must explain to Moscow that this defense is not \nmeant as a threat or an attempt to neutralize Russia. Rather, we are \nattempting to protect ourselves from the machinations of rogue states \nand terrorist groups. In my trips to Russia and in visits with Russian \nlegislators and members of the Yeltsin Government, I have continued to \ninform them of a simple fact: America will protect itself.\n  The Russians--and the world--need to understand that we will proceed \nwith non-proliferation, domestic preparedness, and missile defense to \nprotect the American people against an attack from a rogue state or \nterrorist group or an accidental or unauthorized attack by another \nnation.\n  Secondly, Russian nuclear reductions and eliminations are continuing \nand even accelerating with American help despite the absence of START \nII ratification. To the extent that those eliminations become \nconstrained, it will be for reasons of resources, not lack of Duma \napproval of START II.\n  Thirdly, critics of the Cochran bill would argue that the \ncongressional expression of intent embodied in the legislation \nregarding deployment of a limited missile defense system will prejudice \nany chances of negotiating appropriate adjustments in the ABM Treaty \nwith the Russians to accommodate such defenses. There I disagree! It is \nprecisely because many Russians have doubted the serious intent of the \nClinton administration in actually proceeding with a limited deployment \nunder the ``3+3'' plan that we have been treated to dire predictions \nout of Moscow about the ``end of arms control'' were the United States \nto ultimately proceed with missile defense.\n  Rather than prejudicing any opportunity to negotiate changes in the \nABM Treaty, I believe that the statement of intent embodied in this \nlegislation to ultimately defend ourselves against limited ballistic \nmissile attacks is a prerequisite to successful ABM modification \nnegotiations. It has never been our technological prowess nor our \nability to amass and apply resources to a problem that the Russians \nhave doubted; it has been our political will that has been suspect in \nRussian eyes when the choices to be made were difficult ones.\n  In conclusion, the ballistic missile threat to our security interests \nis real. But it is also complex. The Cochran bill recognizes these \nrealities. But the bill also recognizes that it is not the only threat \nwe face nor can it be addressed in isolation from other major security \nissues and policies.\n  As Senator Cochran said, this legislation represents not the end of \nthe missile defense policy and program debate but rather the beginning. \nIf I recall correctly where the two parties stood on the issue of \nmissile defense even a year or two ago, I am struck by the efforts of a \nfew dedicated Members on both sides to bridge the gap in our \nlegislative approaches in the interest of addressing the growing \nvulnerability of the American homeland to ballistic missile attacks. We \nhave come a considerable distance in the last year in narrowing our \ndifferences. Senate passage by a strong majority of this expression of \npolicy intent with regard to the ultimate deployment of an effective \nlimited missile defense system is a measured but essential first step.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the security of this nation in an \nincreasingly insecure world remains the highest priority of the United \nStates government. To that end, we support and finance the most \npowerful military in the world. Our troops have the most advanced \nweapons available. We have gifted and dedicated military strategists at \nthe helm.\n  And yet we remain vulnerable, in some ways perhaps more so today than \nwe were at the height of the Cold War. The increased sophistication, \nradicalization, and financial acumen of terrorist organizations have \nescalated the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. The increased \ninterdependence and complexity of computer networks has intensified the \nthreat of potentially devastating cyber attacks on critical defense and \ndomestic communications systems. And despite the end of the Cold War, \nthe proliferation of nuclear weapons technology, particularly among \nrogue states, has brought with it a renewed threat of nuclear attack on \nour homeland.\n  North Korea, Iraq, and Iran are all working furiously to produce \nnuclear weapons systems that could threaten the sovereign territory of \nthe United States. To our dismay, we have discovered that North Korea, \none of the most belligerent outlaw nations in the world, is much \nfurther along than previously thought in its efforts to produce a \nnuclear warhead capable of reaching our shores. The threat from North \nKorea is sooner rather than later; here rather than there. China, with \nwhom our relations are increasingly strained, has boasted of its \npossession of a ballistic missile that could reach Los Angeles. Russia, \nwith an arsenal of thousands of nuclear weapons left over from the Cold \nWar, is faced with a crumbling military infrastructure and increasingly \nempty assurances regarding the security of its nuclear stockpile.\n  In short, we are living in dangerous times. The Administration has \ntaken a number of steps in recent months to accelerate its efforts to \nprotect the U.S. mainland from attack. As part of that effort, the \nPresident has budgeted an additional $6.6 billion dollars to develop a \nNational Missile Defense, or NMD. The legislation that we are \nconsidering today, S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, \nputs the United States Senate firmly on record as endorsing the urgency \nof that program. As a result of several carefully crafted amendments \nthat have been overwhelmingly adopted, this bill has gained strong \nbipartisan support. Senators Cochran, Levin, Landrieu, and\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nthe many others who have worked to reach consensus on this bill are to \nbe commended.\n  I support the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 as amended. But, \nfrom the vantage point of many years of experience, I also offer a few \nwords of caution. Let us not allow the determination to press for a \nballistic missile shield to blind us to other, perhaps greater, threats \nof sabotage. The technology exists, and is available to those same \nrogue nations, to develop and deploy chemical and biological weapons \nwithout the need for a ballistic missile delivery system. A few vials \nof anthrax, a test tube full of the smallpox virus, some innocuous \ncanisters of sarin gas, could wreak chaos of unimaginable proportion in \nthe United States. These threats are as real as the threat of a \nballistic missile attack, and, if anything, more urgent.\n\n  A second cautionary note: let us not allow our eagerness to develop a \nmissile defense system blind us to the cost of developing such a \nsystem. In our zeal to erect a national missile shield, the danger \nexists of committing such a vast array of resources--money, people, \nresearch priorities--that we could shortchange other necessary \ninitiatives to protect our national security. We need a balanced \nnational security program, of which a missile defense is but one \nelement.\n  We have gone down the road of throwing money at this threat before, \nwith the ABM system in the 1970's and SDI in the 1980's. Both efforts \ncost us billions of dollars, oceans of ink, years of wasted effort. \nNeither, in the end, made one iota of difference to our national \nsecurity. Technological feasibility should be the starting point, not \nthe defining element, of a missile defense system. Let us learn from \nthe past. Invest wisely. Test carefully. Assess constantly. This is not \nthe arena in which to allow partisan politics or political one-\nupmanship to hold sway. This is a matter of far too great consequence \nto this and future generations. The bipartisan negotiations and the \nspirit of compromise that have marked the Senate debate over this bill \ngive me cause to hope that this time, we will do it right. Let us \ncontinue to work together toward an effective, realistic, and prudent \nnational defense system.\n  Finally, let us not for a moment forget the importance of working \nactively and diligently to reduce the number of existing nuclear \nwarheads and curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons. A national \nmissile defense system that precipitates a global arms race is in no \none's best interest.\n  We cannot safely assume that today's geopolitical alliances will be \nthe same tomorrow. A weak and politically chaotic Russia may be not \nseen as much of a threat to our security today--at least not \nintentionally--but as it has done before, the situation in Russia could \nchange in the blink of an eye. We have at hand the means and the will \nand the opportunity to work with Russia to reduce nuclear warheads. \nYes, we must take all necessary precautions to protect our security, \nbut we must not be so shortsighted as to let this opportunity for \nmeaningful arms control be muscled aside through misguided \nbelligerence.\n  With care and planning, we can make progress in both arms control and \nmissile defense. How well we will succeed on both fronts remains to be \nseen, but S. 257 as amended is a good first step.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is little doubt that the moment of \ntruth regarding a missile defense of U.S. territory is fast \napproaching.\n  The need for it was not unseen. Since 1983, there has been a steady \nflow of evidence that the post-cold-war era would not be the single \nsuperpower cakewalk that many expected. In place of the single \nadversary nuclear threat, we see a fragmented threat environment \npopulated by mentalities more given to terrorism than the mass attack, \ndirect confrontational strategies of the cold war.\n  The cloudy grasp that we have of the true threat is not helped by the \nClinton administration. They lack a strategic approach to a threat that \nthey don't really know or understand.\n  They rely on the prevention policies. Arms control and non-\nproliferation agreements are of questionable value. Disarmament \nassistance to the former Soviet Union has not kept nuclear, missile, or \nwarhead technology from slipping abroad and has had its most adverse \nimpact on our own U.S. steel workers and the United States rocket \nlaunch industry. United States industry has been encouraged to purchase \nRussian launch vehicles, technologies, and services to keep them from \nslipping out of the country. The administration is reluctant to squelch \nillegal Russian steel imports into the United States for fear of \ncausing civil strife among Russian steel workers. Multilateral export \ncontrols are not multilaterally enforced, and the framework agreement \nwith North Korea is neither a framework for cooperation nor an \nagreement.\n  Second, there is deterrence. However, there is sufficient doubt in \nthe world today about this administration's resolve to use force.\n  This leaves us with the third element of administration missile \ndefense policy: the missile defense force itself. Supposedly, that is \nour fall back position when prevention and deterrence fail. But when \nthe force structure depends on a strategy that does not address a \nthreat because the threat is unknown, one seems forced toward the very \ndisturbing conclusion that the easiest way to avoid the messier aspects \nof the problem, like tampering with the ABM Treaty, is simply to \npoliticize the threat. For too long it has appeared that this \nadministration underestimates the threat in order to preserve the \nsanctity of a treaty increasingly irrelevant to the contemporary threat \nenvironment.\n  Let me say more about this last issue. In starker terms this means \ndenial, even wishing the real threat away. One would think that it was \nembarrassing enough for the Clinton threat team to make the sudden and \nvery recent admission that there is a missile threat to U.S. territory. \nAnd, by the way, this now includes Alaska and Hawaii, which the \nadministration had chosen to place outside of U.S. territorial \nboundaries to give academic weight to its anti-development and \ndeployment arguments. If they are seriously seeking the truth, they do \nnot demonstrate it by re-examining the ABM Treaty restraints. Here the \nadministration has a rare opportunity for leadership on a badly \nunderstood and very divisive issue. The President acknowledged just \nthis January that, with the long-range missile threat to U.S. territory \nbetter understood, progress on developing our defenses would be pursued \nby renegotiating rather than abandoning the ABM\nTreaty.\n  I do not intend to await the outcome of administration negotiations \non ABM modifications and amendments, which will take some time given \ntraditional Russian Duma management of the treaty ratification process. \nIn the meantime, I will urge the strongest possible pursuit of \nconceptual strategies, like the sea-based missile defense force, as \nwell as land-force and space-based missile defense components.\n  Inaction is eclipsing administration options. Since I join many \ncolleagues as well as other experts outside of official circles in \nbelieving China, Russia, Iraq, Iran, India, Pakistan, and South Africa, \namong others, have real threat capabilities, I want something done by \nway of creating a viable defense of U.S. territory. For this very \nreason, I have joined my good friends, Senators Cochran and Inouye as a \ncosponsor of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on balance, I believe this legislation \ndeserves bipartisan support. There is a clear need to do more to \nprotect our country from the threat of missile attacks. This bill \navoids most of the problems of previous versions and is consistent with \nour responsibility to continue working with Russia to reduce the \nimmense threat from their nuclear arsenal.\n  The bill declares that it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy a limited national missile defense system as soon as it is \ntechnologically possible, but it also stresses that it is the policy of \nthe United States to continue to negotiate with Russia to reduce our \nnuclear arsenals.\n  There is no doubt that the United States is facing a growing threat \nto our country and our interests from rogue nations that possess \nincreasingly advanced missile technology. We must prepare for these \nthreats more effectively by making greater investments in research and \ndevelopment to produce a missile defense system able to defeat these \nthreats.\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\n  But, before we decide to actually deploy such a system, we must ask \nourselves the following questions:\n  What is the specific threat we are countering with this system?\n  Will the system be effective?\n  What impact will the deployment of the system have on the nuclear \narms reduction and arms control agreements we currently have with the \nRussians?\n  What will be the cost of the system?\n  The Rumsfeld Report in 1998 clearly demonstrated the growing missile \nthreat from rogue nations. In spite of international agreements to \ncontrol the spread of missile technology, these nations are resorting \nto whatever means it takes to acquire this capability. Because of this \ngrowing threat, we must do more to decide whether a defense is \npractical and can deliver the protection it promises.\n  Many of us continue to be concerned that the step we are about to \ntake could undermine the very successful nuclear arms reduction \ntreaties and other arms control agreements that we have with Russia. \nOur purpose in developing a limited national missile defense system is \nnot directed at Russia. It is intended to protect our country against \nthe growing missile threat from rogue nations.\n  Russia's strategic nuclear force would easily overpower the limited \nmissile defense system that is currently proposed. But the fact remains \nthat the United States and Russia are parties to the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty. Without changes to that treaty, our ability to fully \ntest and deploy this defense system cannot occur.\n  The ABM Treaty is also the foundation for the SALT I and SALT II \nnuclear arms reduction treaties, which paved the way for the START I \nand START II treaties. The Russian Duma is again preparing to debate \nthe ratification of the START II treaty, and will do so when Russian \nPrime Minister Primakov returns from his visit to the United States. \nPresident Clinton has already sent a delegation to Russia to discuss \nchanges in this treaty. We must work closely with the Russians to make \nmutually acceptable changes to the ABM Treaty in order to accommodate a \nmissile defense system. The ABM Treaty is simply too important to \nabandon.\n  We also need to work with Russia to develop a joint early warning \nsystem, so that false launch alarms can be avoided. We need to \nstrengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs at the Department \nof Defense. We need to strengthen the Nuclear Cities programs and the \nInitiaitve for Proliferation Prevention program at the Department of \nEnergy so that we can reduce the danger that nuclear material will end \nup on the hands of rogue nations or terrorists.\n  Finally, we must continue to strengthen other counter-terrorism \nprograms. It is far more likely that if terrorists use nuclear, \nchemical, or biological weapons against Americans at home or abroad, \nthey will be delivered by conventional mathods rather than by a \nballistic missile launch from another country. These threats must weigh \nat least equally--if not more heavily--in our defense decisions.\n  These are very important defense decisions that go to the heart of \nour national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure that we counter these threats in the most effective ways in the \nyears ahead.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my support for \nS. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. As an original \ncosponsor, I want to impress upon the Members of the Senate that now is \nthe time for passage of this bill.\n  For over 200 years, the United States has been fortunate to enjoy a \nhigh level of security provided by, among other things, our geographic \nlocation. In the past, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans have served well \nin preventing a direct attack on the United States. However, as we \napproach the twenty-first century and new technology, we find that the \nproliferation of missile technology has taken this geographic sanctuary \naway from us.\n  S. 257 will establish that it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective national \nmissile defense system capable of defending the territory of the United \nStates against limited ballistic missile attack.\n  This bill focuses on one important factor for conditioning \ndeployment: technological capability. Other important factors exist \nincluding cost, threat, and treaty commitments. These factors, while \nimportant, should not be the final determining factor in deciding on \nnational policy to deploy a missile defense.\n  I am concerned about the cost of such a weapon system and will \ncontinue to carefully monitor the costs of a NMD system. However, with \nthis bill, we are not just addressing concerns about protecting \nAmerica's interests around the globe, but about protecting the American \nhomeland itself. We are not talking about foreign lands and obscure \ninterests, or about some distant, remote, or highly unlikely threat. We \nare talking about preventing ballistic missiles from shattering the \ncommunities in which we all live--we are talking about protecting our \nfamilies, our cities, and our nation from potential destruction at the \nhands of a rogue regime anywhere around the world.\n  The threat of a ballistic missile attack on the United States is \nreal. We face a growing threat from rogue nations which have increased \ntheir capabilities due to increased access to missile technology; as \ndemonstrated by the recent successful flight test demonstrations of \nNorth Korea, and the flow of technology from Russia to Iran. These \ncountries are making investments to do one thing--intimidate their \nneighboring states, the U.S. and our allies.\n  For example, North Korea is working hard on the Taepo Dong 2 (TD-2) \nballistic missile. Our national technical experts have determined this \nmissile can reach major cities and military bases in Alaska. They \nfurther state that lightweight variations of this missile could reach \n6,200 miles; placing at risk western U.S. territory in an arc extending \nfrom Phoenix, Arizona, to Madison, Wisconsin. This includes my home \nstate of Kansas.\n  As if that weren't enough, North Korea poses an additionally even \ngreater threat to the United States, because it is a major seller of \nballistic missile technology to other countries of concern, such as \nIran and Iraq, Syria and others.\n  These countries have regional ambitions and do not welcome the U.S. \npresence or influence in their region. Acquisition of missile weapon \nsystems is the most effective way of challenging the United States.\n  Mr. President, we should not and must not wait for these weapons to \nbe used against us, the stakes are too high. We must move forward with \nthe development and deployment of a national missile defense to protect \nour shores from hostile attack.\n  The bill will send a clear message that we are determined to defend \nourselves and will not be deterred from our national and international \ncommitments. An effective and dependable system must be in place before \nsuch a threat can be used against us, or the results could be \ndisastrous. We will not get a second change.\n  The Department of Defense has requested funding to develop a viable \nmissile defense system. I encourage the administration not to back away \nfrom this critical defense issue. The world has changed; we must move \nahead and change the way we think about the defense of our nation.\n  It has been argued on this floor that the adoption of S. 257 will \nmake reductions in nuclear weapons more difficult and would place the \nUnited States in breach of the ABM Treaty. I too am concerned about \nhonoring our treaty commitments. However, this bill states our intent \nto protect our homeland. We will have ample time to continue to work \nwith Russia on these treaty issues, and I am confident we will reach an \nequable position. We must be clear, the threat goes beyond our \nagreements with other countries.\n  America has a leadership role in the world. We represent the hope for \npeace and opportunity. I believe this is one of the most important \ndefense issues facing the United States. To vote against this bill \nwould be to ignore the number one responsibility of the Federal \ngovernment--the defense of our nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the spectrum of emerging missile threats \nto our national security cannot be ignored. I am very concerned about \nthe implications of the North Korean missile recently launched over \nJapan. Research and testing on similar missile\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\nsystems likely continue in Iran, Iraq, China, and other countries. \nThese circumstances suggest that the Senate should carefully consider \nour ability to appropriately counter these threats.\n  I am concerned, however, that the existing national missile defense \n(NMD) technology has not yet proven to be effective, could be very \nexpensive to deploy and has the potential to adversely affect Anti-\nBallistic Missile treaty negotiations with Russia. These concerns \nshould serve to caution us against premature deployment of NMD systems. \nHowever, I am now satisfied that amendments to the bill address these \nconcerns. One amendment makes funding for deployment subject to the \nannual appropriations process and therefore up to Congress to set the \nappropriate level each year. Another amendment provides that the United \nStates will continue to seek reductions in Russian nuclear forces, and \nthe Administration now states that it can move cautiously on deployment \nso as to stay within our commitments to the ABM treaty. The bill has \nconsequently become a policy guiding deployment, rather than a decision \nto deploy.\n  I have long supported a full program of research, testing and \ndevelopment and resisted a premature decision to deploy. I hope that \nresearch will lead to some technological breakthroughs or ways to \ncounter ballistic missiles. Their proliferation, especially in the \nhands of irresponsible leaders such as North Korea's Kim Jung II, \nrequires that we actively investigate possible defenses, but we must \nnot rush to build, at great cost, the first system that passes a flight \ntest. There is still a great deal of research and development work to \nbe done.\n  The fledgling NMD systems now being contemplated for deployment \nsimply do not compare in priority to many of our other military needs, \nsuch as our need to immediately recruit, train and retain quality men \nand women for our military. This is why the Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights, the military pay, education and \nbenefits bill, was the first major legislation considered this session, \nand it swiftly passed the Senate with overwhelming support. Well-\neducated Americans in uniform comprise the foundation upon which we \nmaintain the strong defense of this country. While the Senate \nunanimously agreed on the urgency of enacting this legislation, it \nstill has found no way to pay for it. In my mind this takes priority \nover deployment of expensive and unproven NMD technology.\n  Given the competing demands on our finite budget and the high costs \nto deploy a NMD system, we cannot afford to get it wrong. I hope that \nthis vote will not be seen as endorsement of a rush to deployment, but \nrather a set of policy guidelines governing an eventual decision to \ndeploy. I will do what I can to ensure this ultimate decision is not \nmade in haste.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to express my views on the National \nMissile Defense bill as it was amended yesterday. I am glad that \nSenator Cochran and Senator Levin were able to agree to changes in this \nbill. The unanimous votes on the amendments and nearly unanimous vote \non final passage are tributes to Senator Cochran's and Senator Levin's \nresolve to seek common ground on this important issue that has long \ndivided this body along party lines. Thankfully, instead of a partisan \nbattle, the Senate produced a strong statement of this nation's resolve \nto develop and deploy a national missile defense system in the context \nof other budget priorities, national security concerns, and the U.S.-\nRussian arms control process.\n  The initial bill stated that the United States would deploy a \nnational missile defense system as soon as technologically possible. I \nstood with the administration and this nation's military leaders in \nopposing that legislation because it did not consider other important \nfactors such as cost, the specific missile threat, effectiveness of the \nsystem, and the impact on the arms control process.\n  The amendments that were added address some of those other issues. \nThe first amendment explicitly requires that the national missile \ndefense program be subject to the annual authorization and \nappropriations process despite the bill's requirement to deploy a \nsystem ``as soon as technologically possible.'' The amendment stresses \nthe fact that this nation is not committed to giving the missile \ndefense program a blank check. In other words, notwithstanding the \nSenate's commitment to protect this nation against rogue state \nmissiles, this body will balance the importance of national missile \ndefense with other national security priorities. For example, we have \nan attack submarine fleet that continues to shrink as the result of a \nlow build rate. That issue and many others need to be considered by our \nnational defense leadership. Furthermore, the first amendment \nhighlights the fact that this body will balance the need for a national \nmissile defense system with the need to provide our citizens with \nstrong and effective domestic programs.\n  The second amendment, sponsored by Senator Landrieu, was absolutely \nnecessary for the passage of this legislation. The amendment reminds us \nthat the United States remains wholly committed to nuclear arms \ncontrol. The ABM Treaty and START Treaties are basic elements of \nnuclear arms control, and this bill is not meant to impinge on the \neffectiveness of those treaties. This nation will not ignore, but \ninstead seek modifications to, the ABM Treaty to allow for a limited \nnational missile defense system. Also, this nation awaits ratification \nof START II by the Russian Duma and looks forward to agreement on the \nprovisions of START III.\n  In sum, this legislation does not alter the administration's present \npolicy with respect to national missile defense. This nation will \ndevelop and deploy a national missile defense system, but the costs of \nthe system, the specific rouge nation missile threat, the impact on \narms control, and our technological ability to field such a system will \nall be carefully considered. For those reasons, I have decided to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President: I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nS. 257, The National Missile Defense Act.\n  S. 257 will establish that it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy as soon as it is technologically possible an effective National \nMissile Defense (NMD) system capable of defending the territory of the \nUnited States against limited ballistic missile attack whether \naccidental, unauthorized, or deliberate.\n  Many have asked why would we want to do this as soon as \ntechnologically feasible. The answer finally came earlier this year \nwhen the Administration finally admitted that the Threat is here and \nnow, not some indefinite number of years down the road.\n  The Threat, is upon us. According to CIA Director George Tenet's \ntestimony on February 2, page 6, ``theater-range missiles with \nincreasing range pose an immediate and growing threat to US interests, \nmilitary forces, and allies--and the threat is increasing. This threat \nis here and now.''\n  If we look at what the Iraqi's have or will have in the near future, \nwhy would we delay given that we are conducting an aggressive air \ncampaign against Iraqi air defense targets daily?\n  If we look at the improvements the Chinese have made in their missile \nprogram at our expense, why would we delay waiting for the Chinese to \nprove in some scenario yet undefined that they have the capability to \ndestroy an American city or two?\n  If we look at the proliferation of technology leaving Russia to rogue \nstates because they provide the hard currency to Russian scientists \nthat the West cannot, why then would we wait?\n  There are some who say that we should wait and work the ABM problem \nout with the Russians. They say that if we move forward with a \ndeployment this will make the Russians angry. Mr. President, the \nRussians have strongly objected to any US deployment to Kosovo, yet I \ndo not see the Administration holding back on its desire to send \nupwards of 4000 troops to the region. Isn't protection of the United \nStates more important that Kosovo?\n  Our goal in the effort to deploy a National Missile defense System \nhas two crucial impacts on our security:\n\n  First, it will signal to nations that aspire to possess ballistic \nmissiles with which to coerce or attack the United States that pursuit \nof such capabilities is a waste of both time and resources.\n\n  Second, if some aspiring states are not deterred, a commitment to \ndeploy an NMD system will ensure that American citizens and their \nproperty are protected from a limited attack.\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n  The Rumsfeld Commission report stated that, ``the warning times the \nUS can expect are being reduced. Under some plausible scenarios the US \nmight have little or no warning before operational deployment.'' This \nis a statement from a very creditable commission. It suggests that \nAmerica ought to move quickly to defend itself. A NMD system deployed \nnow is the step in the right direction. We cannot afford to debate the \n``what could be's or should be's any longer.'' This Congress must act, \nand act now. I doubt if the American public would forgive this Congress \nif a situation arises for which we are not prepared.\n  Lastly, I have a comment about the Chinese spying incident. I have \nbeen in two meetings with Secretary Richardson in the last two days. My \nfeeling on this issue is:\n  We have now learned of improved Chinese Missile guidance system \ncapability due to US computers--sold to the Chinese by two US firms.\n  Chinese spying has provided that nation with the instructions on how \nto fabricate compact warheads (MIRV's)\n  Both of these acts should never have happened.\n  Mr. President, America cannot tolerate continued slackness in \nsecurity and we need to press forward with protecting our nation--not \ntomorrow, not next month, not five years from now. We need to move the \nNMD program forward as soon as technically feasible.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I support a national missile defense. I have \nvoted--repeatedly--to fund research and development that would make \nsuch a defense not just a theoretical hope but a reality. In the past, \nhowever, I have also opposed legislation identical to S. 257, the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999 as it was introduced. I voted \nagainst it when it was reported from the Armed Services Committee. I \ndid so, even though I unequivocally support providing our nation a real \ndefense against missile attack, because I believed that as introduced \nthe bill would not advance that objective and could possibly move us in \nthe opposite direction. While it is imperative for the United States to \ndeploy a defense against missile attacks by North Korea and other rogue \nnations, it is equally imperative that we consider affordability, \noperational effectiveness, and treaty implications when determining how \nbest to proceed on such a major acquisition program.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense, in testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee, has made it very clear that we can't \naccelerate the national missile defense program beyond what we're doing \nright now even if we spend significantly more money on it. Yet the \noriginal legislation implied that money is no object, that we should \nforgo our basic responsibility of getting the best defense possible for \nthe taxpayer's dollar. I am concerned--as are many of our colleagues--\nabout numerous, severe problems our military faces today, that can be \nresolved with proven technologies. Our forces are operating at OPTEMPOS \nunheard of even during the Cold War. Their equipment is often older \nthan the operators, and spare parts are regularly in short supply. It \nis no wonder that we are facing one of the most pressing recruiting and \nretention challenges since the hollow force of the seventies. Passing \nblank check legislation is not, in my view, responsible, and not in the \nbest interest of our military.\n  Fortunately, changes were made to the original legislation that \naddressed some of my concerns. The Cochran amendment subjects national \nmissile defense deployment to the normal authorizing and appropriating \nprocess, allowing us to retain fiscal control over the program. This \nreinforces the need to ensure that any system we approve be affordable \nand operationally effective before deployment.\n  Mr. President, the bill in its original form was silent on arms \ncontrols. It is clear from hearing the comments of several Senators in \nsupport of this bill that they believe the ABM Treaty is of marginal \nconsequence when compared to deploying a missile defense capability. \nThe virtual certainty that the Russians will retain thousands of \nnuclear warheads if we undermine the ABM Treaty has been brushed aside \nas a minor annoyance. No matter that the existence of these thousands \nof additional weapons greatly increases the likelihood of the kind of \naccidental launch that a national missile defense would defend against. \nNo matter that, by undermining the strategic arms control process, we \nprompt China and other nations--including so-called rogue regimes--to \ndevelop or expand their nuclear arsenals and create the very kind of \nthreat that our limited missile defense is supposed to protect against.\n  The Landrieu amendment, by reinforcing the need for continued arms \nreduction efforts with the Russians, addressed this short-coming in the \noriginal legislation.\n\n  As a result of these modifications, I am now willing to support this \nbill. I caution, however, that this legislation really accomplishes \nnothing that will have a meaningful, positive impact on the pace and \nquality of our missile defense development efforts. While it is \nappealing to declare a policy, such a declaration doesn't move us \ncloser to the goal, and may in fact cause the American people to gain a \nfalse sense of security. We should acknowledge the risk that we could \nbe giving the American people the false impression that by passing this \nlegislation we are somehow approving deployment of a protective shield \nto safeguard them from nuclear missile attack. At best we'll get a very \nlimited defensive capability. At worst, we will have spent tens of \nbillions on top of the $40 to $80 billion already spent on missile \ndefense since 1983, our troops will continue to struggle with a high \nOPTEMPO and inadequate equipment due to inadequate funding, the \nRussians will not honor START II limits--even after ratification of the \ntreaty, and we will have a system that is not operationally effective.\n  Regardless of the outcome of the vote on this legislation, we will \ncontinue to develop a missile defense to protect our nation. The issue \nsurrounding missile defense is not that we don't want such a system--\nthe problem is we don't yet know how to build one we can afford. I \nremind my colleagues of the Pentagon's dramatic claims of success by \nour Patriot missile batteries during the Gulf War. It was only after \nthe war that we learned that there were very few if any effective \nintercepts of the Iraqi Scuds. The technology wasn't here then and it \nhas a long way to go today--especially when it comes to ICBMs.\n  And we should not let our focus on providing such a defense divert \nour attention away from the other crucial element in protecting America \nfrom missile attack: reducing the number of missiles aimed at our \nnation. A number of colleagues shared my concern about the effect of \nthis legislation on our efforts to reduce the Russian arsenal through \nthe START II process.\n  Mr. President, I will support this legislation because we have \naddressed the largest potential down-sides and because I support the \nobjective of providing our nation with an effective missile defense, \nbut we still have a long way to go before we actually solve the \nchallenges we face and we ought to be up front with the American people \nin describing where we are in this process.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, none of us who sit here in the Senate today \nis unaware of the potential dangers that face this country from rogue \nnations with ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction. \nThere are many nations around the world that are eagerly pursuing \nweapons that can reach the United States and deliver devastating \ndamage. I, like many of my colleagues, was stunned when I heard the \nnews that North Korea had launched a three stage rocket with technology \nthat many in the intelligence community had said the North Koreans \nwould not possess for many years. All this evidence leads me to agree \nwith Secretary Cohen when he says that the threat to the United States \nis ``real and growing.'' Because of the danger we face, and our solemn \nvow to protect this nation, I will vote to support Senator Cochran's \nbill, S. 257, to deploy a missile defense as soon as technologically \npossible.\n  With threats looming on the horizon it would be irresponsible not to \npursue the development and deployment of a national missile defense. \nThe Administration has responded to the threat by expanding the \nprogram. The President has increased funding by $6 billion over five \nyears. They will make a decision next year whether an effective \nnational missile defense can be deployed by 2005.\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\nNegotiations with the Russians have already begun in an effort to reach \nagreement on amendments to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The \nPresident has now reversed his previous opposition to this bill by \nwithdrawing his veto threat. The United States is moving forward on \nmissile defense, and this legislation will add momentum.\n  However, I do have reservations about this bill. A national missile \ndefense system is not a sure thing. Currently there is no technology \ncapable of destroying an ICBM, and we don't know when the technology \nwill be developed. But we do know that developing this technology will \nbe costly. To date we have spent almost sixty-seven billion dollars on \ndeveloping missile defenses since the early 1980's without anything to \nshow for it. I am concerned that by making a decision to build a system \nas soon as technologically possible the Congress may commit itself to \nan expensive project that the General Accounting Office has deemed \n``high risk.'' The Pentagon is infamous for underestimating the cost of \nweapons systems. Right now the Administration plans on spending ten \nbillion dollars over six years on NMD, but I expect that as the project \nmoves forward the cost will rise. We must be careful not to let our \ncommitment to missile defense blind us from our duty to oversee this \nprogram and guard against waste and profligate spending so common in \nthe Department of Defense.\n  While I am very concerned about the costs of the program and the \nimpact on our relations with Russia, I believe we should build a \nnational missile defense to protect our nation in this dangerous and \nuncertain time. The United States should move swiftly, but with \nprudence, to safeguard our citizens from the threats of rogue nations \nand the fear of accidental launches.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, was there a unanimous consent agreement \nthat the Senator from Mississippi wanted to propound?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, we were trying \nto nail down a time for a vote on final passage at 2. Why don't you go \nahead and use whatever time you want to use.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto express my opposition to this resolution that is before us.\n  I may be standing alone on this vote. I hope not. I appreciate the \nefforts of my colleague from Louisiana to offer an amendment that would \nensure that this bill states, or this resolution, because that is \nreally what it is, that it is still the policy of the United States to \npursue arms reduction negotiations. I think that was an important \nstatement. I do not honestly and truthfully believe that that amendment \nis enough. It does not directly tie a decision to deploy a national \nmissile defense directly to its impact on arms reduction agreements. \nThat is what I am worried about.\n  I think my good friend, the Senator from Michigan, had it right in \nhis substitute amendment--before a decision to deploy, the \nadministration and the Congress should review the impact of that \ndecision on nuclear arms reductions and on arms control agreements.\n  I think this is right. The decision to deploy--and that is what this \nresolution instructs us to do--should be made carefully, at the right \ntime, after we are sure of its impact on important arms control and \narms reduction decisions. I know my colleague from Michigan, who I \nthink is one of the truly great Senators, has concluded that the \nLandrieu language is sufficient, but I have to respectfully disagree.\n  This resolution talks about deploying missile defense. I have \nsupported in the past efforts to develop such a system to at least do \nresearch, but I have never voted for a resolution that says we go \nforward with deployment.\n  I would not oppose, again, the research and the focus on the \npossibility of needing a missile defense system if this was done hand \nin hand with an emphasis on the importance of arms reduction \nagreements. But I do not believe that this resolution before us is at \nall evenhanded in this respect.\n  Our colleague from Mississippi, a colleague for whom I also have a \ngreat deal of respect, Senator Cochran, was quoted in the Washington \nTimes today saying that the Landrieu amendment was an important step--\nand he meant this in very good faith; he means everything in good \nfaith--of an important national security goal. But the inclusion of the \nnational missile defense policy and arms reduction policy in the same \nbill ``does not imply that one is contingent on the other.''\n  I think they should be, and that is why I do not think the language \nis sufficient. That is why I will vote against this bill.\n  Actually, I do not know whether to call it a bill or a resolution. \nThere is no money. It is just a statement. We say this will be the \npolicy. It is a declaration by the Senate.\n  We ought to be focusing on the reduction of existing missiles. We \nought to be focusing on nonproliferation efforts to stop the spread of \nexisting technology of weapons of mass destruction. We should not be \nsaying that it is the policy of the United States to spend billions of \ndollars on unproven systems to defend ourselves against phantom \nmissiles from hypothetical rogue states.\n  We have spent already $120 billion on this antimissile defense \nsystem. I heard my colleague from Arizona, who is a colleague for whom \nI have tremendous respect, talking about some of the ways in which he \nthinks the administration has been a bit disingenuous about how we can \nbalance the budget and spend money here or do this, that, and the \nother. I understand what my colleague was saying. In all due respect, I \nhave to raise questions about this.\n  First of all, I have to say that I believe that this vote today is a \nprofound mistake. I think the vote today, if it is an overwhelmingly \nstrong vote for this resolution, jeopardizes years of work toward \nachieving nuclear arms control and arms reduction, and that will not \nincrease our security. That will not increase the security of my \nchildren or my grandchildren.\n  I am very concerned about our national defense. I am very concerned \nabout our security. I am very concerned about the security of my \nchildren and my grandchildren. I believe the best single thing we can \ndo to assure that security is to maintain a commitment to arms control \nagreements.\n  Some of my colleagues do not agree with what we did with the ABM \nTreaty. They are not so focused on where we need to go with the START \nagreements. I argue that these arms control agreements and everything \nand anything we can do to stop the proliferation of these weapons and \nto engage the former Soviet Union--Russia today--in arms control \nagreements, reducing the nuclear arsenals, less missiles, less \nwarheads, less of a possibility of a launching of these weapons is what \nis most in our national security. I do not believe that this resolution \ntakes us in that direction at all.\n\n  There is a distinction between talking about the development of a \nmissile defense system and actually the language in this resolution \nwhich talks about deploying. There is a distinction between saying we \nonly go forward, but before a decision to deploy, the administration \nand the Congress should review the impact of this decision on nuclear \narms reductions and arms control agreements.\n  There is a distinction between such language, and I believe what the \namendment that my colleague from Louisiana offered yesterday, which \nsays that it is our policy to pursue arms reduction negotiations--oh, \nhow I would like to see a connection. Oh, how I want to see a nexus. \nYou cannot imagine how much I want to vote for a resolution like this, \nwhich is going to have such overwhelming support, and I would if I did \nnot believe that what is only a resolution will be used next year when \nwe come to authorization and appropriations to say that there was \nunanimous--no, there won't be unanimous support; there will be at least \none vote against it--near unanimous support to go forward with missile \ndefense. And then the request will come in for the money.\n  What will the cost be? This resolution, or this piece of legislation, \nshould be called the ``Blank Check Act,'' because that is what we are \ndoing. We are authorizing a blank check for tens of\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\nbillions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars for all I know, for a \nmissile defense system in the future. At what cost?\n  Mr. President, $120 billion already, tens of billions of dollars a \nyear, I don't know how long in the future, is going to go for a missile \ndefense system, and this vote is going to be used as the rationale for \ndoing so. Maybe not with this administration, because I think the \nadministration has made it clear it is committed to an arms control \nagreement. But what about the next administration? I hope it will be a \nDemocratic administration, but I do not know and I do not want to vote \nfor a blank check for tens of billions of dollars for such a system \nwhich I think puts into jeopardy arms control negotiations and arms \ncontrol reductions.\n  Mr. President, for a senior citizen in the State of Minnesota who \ncannot afford to pay for a drug that has been prescribed by her \ndoctor--this is a huge problem for elderly people in our country, many \nof whom are paying up to 30 percent of their annual monthly budget just \nfor prescription drugs--for that senior citizen to not be able to \nafford a prescription drug that her doctor prescribes for her health is \na lot bigger threat to her than that some missile is going to hit her \nin the near future or in the distant future.\n  Yet, we are being told that we cannot afford to make sure we have \nprescription drug costs for elderly citizens in this country. But now \nwhat we are going to do, I fear, is adopt a resolution that will be \nused later on as a rationalization and justification for spending tens \nof billions of dollars on top of $120 billion for unproven systems to \ndefend us against phantom missiles from hypothetical rogue states.\n  Our focus should be on the arsenal of nuclear weapons that Russia has \nnow and how we can have arms control agreements with Russia. We ought \nnot to be putting ABM and START in jeopardy. We ought not to be putting \narms control in jeopardy. We ought not to be putting our efforts at \nstopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in jeopardy, \nand I believe that is what this resolution does. That is my honestly \nheld view. The administration has apparently changed its position. I \nwish they had not.\n\n  My colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, has a different \ninterpretation. I think he believes that this resolution puts the \nemphasis that needs to be there on arms control reductions. I hope and \npray he is right. I think he believes this resolution has language, \nthrough the annual review process in appropriations bills, that makes \nit clear that this has to be technologically feasible to go forward. I \nhope he is right. But, quite frankly, I do not think that is really \nwhat this resolution says.\n  I am not going to err on the side of voting for a resolution that now \ngives credibility to spending tens of billions of dollars, over the \nyears to come, on a questionable missile defense system that puts arms \ncontrol agreements in jeopardy and does not speak to the very real \nnational security that we have in our own country.\n  I would like to finish this way, Mr. President. Since I heard some of \nmy colleagues on the other side talk about the President's budget, I \nwould like to ask my colleagues, What exactly do you propose to do with \nyour budget caps, your tax cuts, and wanting to increase the Pentagon \nbudget $140 billion over the next 6 years?\n  And that goes for far more than just increasing the salaries of our \nmen and women in the armed services, who should have their salaries \nincreased; and that is much more far-reaching than just dealing with \nquality-of-life issues for men and women in the armed services, who \ndeserve all our support in that respect. Now we are talking about \nlaying the groundwork, on top of $120 billion that has already been \nspent, for tens of billions of dollars. This could end up being $40 \nbillion-plus just for this missile defense system.\n  So my question is, After we do this, what do you say to senior \ncitizens in your State who say, ``Can't you make sure that we can \nafford prescription drug costs?'' I know what you are going to say. \n``We can't afford it.'' What are you going to say to people who say, \n``Can't you invest more in our children in education?'' We are going to \nsay, ``We can't afford it.''\n  What do you say to people in the disabilities community who were in \nmy office yesterday, saying, ``Can't you invest in home-based health \ncare so that we can live at home in as near as normal circumstances as \npossible with dignity?'' We are going to say, ``We can't afford it.'' \nWhat are we going to say to people who say, ``We can't afford \naffordable housing''? We are going to say, ``We can't afford it.''\n  I will tell you something; the real national security of our country \nis not to vote for this resolution that could very well put arms \ncontrol agreements in jeopardy. And I am not willing to err on that \nside. If we do that, it will be a tragic mistake. It will be a tragic \nmistake for all of our children.\n  The real national security for our country is to not spend billions \nof dollars on unproven systems to defend us against phantom missiles \nfrom hypothetical rogue states. The real national security for our \ncountry will be the security of local communities, where there is \naffordable child care, there is affordable health care, there is \naffordable housing, people find jobs at decent wages, and we make a \ncommitment to education second to none so that every boy and every girl \ncan grow up dreaming to be President of the United States of America. \nThat is the real national security of our country.\n  Mr. President, I think this resolution is a profound mistake. And if \nI am the only vote against it, so be it, but I will not vote for the \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Stevens, had made the request he \nbe able to speak right after I finished. I do not see him right now, \nbut could I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to speak next? I \nknow he was anxious to do so. He should be here in a moment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I think \nSenator Stevens is planning to speak. I was going to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum. Here is our colleague from Michigan. He may want \nto use some time on the bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I support the passage of this bill with the two amendments \nwe have adopted. We have made a number of very important changes in the \nbill which now cause me to support the bill because, very specifically, \nwe now have two policies that are set forth in the bill, no longer just \none.\n  The first amendment that we have adopted, which was an amendment \nsaying that the funding for national missile defense is subject to the \nannual authorization and appropriation of funds for this system, makes \nit clear explicitly, specifically, that this bill does not authorize \nanything. This is not an authorization of anything. It is not an \nappropriation of funds.\n  Perhaps somebody could argue before that amendment was adopted that \nthis bill did authorize or did commit us to appropriate funds. But \nafter the adoption of that first amendment yesterday, it cannot be \nargued that this authorizes anything or appropriates funds for any \nsystem.\n  This bill now states two policies of the United States. That is very \ndifferent from a bill which commits us to authorize funds or to \nappropriate funds for a particular system.\n  So the first amendment made an important difference. It is an \namendment which the Senator from Mississippi offered with a number of \ncosponsors on both sides of the aisle. It seems to me it made it very \nclear that we are not committing to deploy a national missile defense \nsystem in this bill. We are stating now two policies in this bill. The \nfirst amendment I referred to makes it clear that the authorization to \ndeploy a national missile defense system would come only if and when we \nact on funding to deploy such a system through the normal authorization \nand appropriation process. We are not doing that in this bill.\n  One of the things this bill says is, before a deployment decision is \nmade, there must be an effective system. That word ``effective'' \nclearly means, in the view of the military--and I think reasonably--an \noperationally effective system. That is one of the clear meanings of \nthe word ``effective'' in this bill. And there was a colloquy earlier \ntoday between the Senators from Mississippi and New Mexico relating to \nthat issue. An effective national missile defense system means, among\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\nother elements of ``effectiveness,'' an operationally effective system.\n  The second amendment that has made a major change and a major \nimprovement in this bill is the Landrieu amendment. Until Senator \nLandrieu's amendment was adopted, this bill ignored the crucial \nimportance to our national security of continuing reductions in Russian \nnuclear weapons. Without the Landrieu amendment, this bill would have \nput nuclear reductions at risk--reductions that have been negotiated \nbefore and are now being implemented, reductions that have been \nnegotiated before and are hopefully about to be ratified in the Duma.\n\n  Without the Landrieu amendment, this bill ignored those reductions. \nIt would have put such reductions at risk and increased the threat of \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That greater threat would \nhave resulted from the larger number of nuclear weapons being on \nRussian soil, with the greater likelihood, in turn, that there would be \nleakage of such weapons to a terrorist state or a terrorist group.\n  The Landrieu amendment adds a second policy to this bill. It is a \nmost crucial policy statement, that it is our policy to seek continued \nnegotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces. This critically \nimportant change in the bill states that we understand the value of \ncontinuing the nuclear arms reductions which have been negotiated \nbefore and that, hopefully, will continue to be negotiated in START \nIII, and that those reductions improve our security by reducing the \nnumbers of nuclear weapons on Russian soil.\n  Mr. President, without those two amendments, I would not have \nsupported this bill. As I stated in my opening statement, it is \ncritically important, in my opinion, that we continue to see reductions \nin nuclear weapons in this world, and most specifically, reductions in \nnuclear weapons in Russia.\n  I think many of our colleagues, if not all of us, see the importance \nof those reductions. Now we have a specific policy statement equal to \nthe policy statement relative to deploying an effective limited \nnational missile defense subject to authorization and appropriations. \nThe second policy statement which is critically important says that it \nis the policy of the United States to continue to negotiate reductions \nin the number of nuclear weapons on Russian soil.\n  Because of these amendments, the President's senior national security \nadvisers will now recommend that the President not veto the bill if it \ncomes to him in this form. That is an important measure of the \nsignificance of these changes in this bill. The White House has not \nchanged its position on national missile defense anymore than I have.\n  The bill has been changed in two significant ways. I think the bill \nhas been vastly improved. It has been improved because of the efforts \nof many people. I want to thank the Senator from Mississippi, the \nauthor of this bill, for his cooperation in including both the Cochran \namendment and the Landrieu amendment. And I particularly want to \ncommend and thank the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, who is \nnow the ranking member on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee, for her hard work and her dedication in \nbringing about the adoption of an amendment which made such an \nimportant difference in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am here today to join two of my closest \nfriends, Senators Cochran and Inouye, to support this bill that is \nbefore the Senate. I believe that Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye \nhave championed this measure for some time now in the face of very \nstrong opposition. I am pleased to see that opposition is now fading \naway.\n  I cannot fathom anyone being opposed to deploying the defenses that \nare necessary to protect this Nation. Recent events clearly warn that \nour Nation must prepare for the worst possible scenario. We have \nwatched reports that India and Pakistan have detonated nuclear devices. \nEach of these countries have very solid, demonstrated capabilities in \nbuilding ballistic missiles. Our U.S. intelligence community admitted \nsurprise after those demonstrations.\n  Unrest in Indonesia and turmoil in other Pacific nation economies \ndemand the attention of the United States and the world. Those nations \nincreasingly look to develop or acquire a range of ballistic missiles. \nThe threat that troubles me the most is North Korea. North Korea's \nmissiles can already reach parts of Alaska and Hawaii, and perhaps \nbeyond.\n  When I visited North Korea 2 years ago, I was struck by the contrast \nthere. Their people live a life of sacrifice, but many of their limited \nresources are diverted to military investments. The United States \nshould not underestimate the determination of the North Koreans nor the \nrisks the threats pose to the United States and our Pacific allies.\n  Now, new reports indicate that North Korea may launch another rocket, \npossibly a satellite or possibly a longer-range ballistic missile. The \nworld's ability to monitor North Korea now is limited. We all know \nthat. Certainly almost no one in the intelligence community anticipated \nthe recent launch of the multistage booster that we saw.\n  Just as in World War II, the first to be threatened in the Pacific \nwill be the States of Hawaii and Alaska. My constituents, the residents \nof Alaska, ask me, Why should it not be the policy of the United States \nto deploy a national missile defense system as soon as it is \ntechnically feasible? I can state categorically that after my recent \ntrip home I know Alaskans want these defenses now.\n  Indeed, the Alaska Legislature has already passed a joint resolution \ncalling on the President of the United States to deploy a national \nmissile defense system. I know, as more Americans recognize that this \nthreat is here today--and I believe the whole country will wonder what \nis wrong with us; I believe they are going to even wonder why we have \nto have this debate this long on this issue.\n  I am confident that Members of the Senate should be familiar with the \ncongressionally established commission of evaluating the ballistic \nmissile threat to the United States, known as the Rumsfeld Commission, \nwhich completed a thorough review of the missile technologies existing \nin other countries. More importantly, that Commission recognizes the \nfact that missile technologies are increasingly available to any nation \nwith money and determination to use them.\n  Protecting our Nation requires building a national missile defense \nsystem that will protect every square inch of every State, including \nAlaska and Hawaii, and the 48 contiguous States. When this issue first \ncame before the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, the administration \nprojected a system that would defend almost all of the 48 States but \ndid not include Alaska and Hawaii and the tips of Maine and Florida. At \nthat time, I expressed concern about that. I am pleased to see we all \nare now considering a truly national missile defense system.\n\n  In recent weeks, I was fully briefed on the Defense Department's \nefforts to develop a national missile defense, a defense which would \nprovide our Nation's only capability against these missiles. I have \nbeen reassured of the commitment to protect all 50 States by Lieutenant \nGeneral Lyles, the Director of the Ballistic Missile Organization. I \ncan also tell the Senate that some of the best engineers in this Nation \nare working on the current national missile defense program under the \ndirection of Brigadier General Nance, a very capable officer and \nknowledgeable program manager.\n  I believe this team, and any of the ballistic missile defense \norganization program managers, would tell the Senate that building this \ndefense system is technically feasible today. That is good news. We \nhave it within our reach and our means to build a missile defense \nsystem to protect our entire Nation from ballistic missiles.\n  Last year, we added $1 billion as emergency funds for the development \nof the missile defenses to protect the United States as well as its \ndeployed forces. This Cochran-Inouye bill makes clear that these funds \nare available only for enhanced testing, accelerated development, \nconstruction, integration, and infrastructure efforts in support of \nballistic missile defense systems.\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\n  The taxpayers' money being made available on an emergency basis was \nput up for the purpose of encouraging the availability of this system \nand to reward success in the efforts. I believe we have to have the \nability to defeat the threat that is posed by ballistic missiles as \nsoon as possible. Many Senators will recall the criticisms made last \nyear of our ballistic missile defense programs--too little testing, \nschedules that didn't ask for the dollars available, and many other \nconcerns expressed.\n  I am pleased to report to the Senate that the $1 billion emergency \nincrease has become a catalyst for the national missile defense \nprogram--allowing this program to add testing, fully fund development, \nand to rebut the critics who say it is not possible for such a system \nto be deployed.\n  The administration has stated that it will match these funds and \nbudget the necessary additional funds to develop and deploy a national \nmissile defense system. I am still concerned that the funds budgeted by \nthe administration, however, will allow a missile defense system to be \ndeployed about 2005.\n  On March 14, 1995, Defense Secretary Perry testified before our \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee that:\n\n       On the national missile defense system, that system would \n     be ready for deployment in 3 years on the basis of this \n     program projection, and then 3 years later than that it would \n     be operational.\n\n  He said it would be operational in 3 years.\n\n       So we are about 6 years away from deployment of national \n     missile defense systems.\n\n  That was 1995. In responding to my question during a hearing in June \nof 1995, Lt. Gen. Malcolm O'Neill noted Secretary Perry's promise and \nwent on to add:\n\n       I think the timeframe (Secretary Perry) talked about was 3 \n     years of development and then 3 years to deploy. So that \n     would mean a 2001 scenario, and that would get a system in \n     position before the Taepo Dong 2.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the Korean missile that we are all so worried \nabout now. The Taepo Dong 2 is ready now but we are still developing a \nsystem. The national missile defense system that should be in place by \n2001 will not be there in 2001, and we were promised an operational \nnational missile defense system as early as 2001. As one who has \nwatched this system now develop over a period of years, I have been \nfrustrated that it has slipped now, apparently, to 2005. The track \nrecord is one of continual delays and slips as far as the deployment \ndate is concerned.\n  I believe that this Nation must get ahead of the threats. The risks \nare too great.\n  Again, I basically come here to commend these two Senators for their \nvery hard work on this bill.\n  Senator Cochran and Senator Inouye deserve the entire support of the \nSenate. I am pleased that these matters which had previously looked \nlike they might delay this bill might be resolved. I congratulate the \nmanagers of this bill and its author for their wisdom and \ndetermination. I hope the Senate will proceed rapidly to approve it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 257, the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999. This is an extremely important \ninitiative, which really goes to the heart of our national security \npolicy. The bill simply declares that it is the policy of the United \nStates to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a national \nmissile defense system which is capable of protecting the entire \nterritory of the United States from a limited ballistic missile attack.\n  Why is this important? For one, because most Americans mistakenly \nbelieve that we already have a system in place which can intercept and \nshoot down incoming missiles. We do not. While we can, in some \ninstances, tell in advance if an adversary is likely to launch a \nballistic missile strike at the United States, our ability to thwart \nthe attack is limited to diplomatic efforts or, alternatively, to a \nquick strike military capability of our own.\n  In the case of an unauthorized or accidental missile strike, we have \nno deterrent capability. Imagine the horror, Mr. President, of knowing \na missile strike against an American city was underway and there was \nnothing we could do to stop it.\n  This is the same bill that Senate Democrats filibustered twice during \nthe 105th Congress. So, why the change of heart? I think that the main \nreason is that they can no longer sustain the argument that we do not \nface a threat credible enough to justify deployment of a national \nmissile defense system. They now acknowledge that we face a number of \nreal threats from many different parts of the globe. Most of these \nthreats are the byproduct of 6 years of flawed administration foreign \npolicy initiatives which have actually increased, not decreased, the \nlikelihood of the post-cold-war threat.\n  What are the threats that we currently face? China comes to mind. \nWhile I for one do not consider China an adversary, I am particularly \nconcerned by the wide range of espionage allegations connected to \nChina. First, our military experts believe that China's missile \nguidance capabilities were enhanced significantly by the Loral/Hughes \nincidents. And more recently, there are chilling allegations that China \nhas stolen some of our most closely held secrets on miniaturizing \nwarhead technology, thereby exponentially increasing the threat that \nChina poses to the United States and many of our key allies in the \nAsia/Pacific theater.\n  Last summer, it was widely reported that 13 of China's 18 long-range \nstrategic missiles are armed with nuclear warheads and targeted at \nAmerican cities. What's more Chinese officials have suggested that we \nwould never support Taiwan in a crisis ``because the United States \ncares more about Los Angeles than it does Taipei.'' If this type of \ndeclaration, on its own, is not justification for deploying a national \nmissile defense system, Mr. President, than nothing is.\n  Let's examine the case of North Korea. This is a country which \ncontinues to defy rational behavior, and which seems to be encouraged \nby this administration's bankrupt North Korea policy. Just yesterday, \nSecretary Albright announced that the United States would pay North \nKorea hundreds of millions in food aid to gain access to an underground \nfacility north of Pyong Yong which we believe is connected to their \nnuclear regime. Plain and simple bribery at it's best.\n  Last year, North Korea fired a multi-stage missile over Japan. No \nwarning and unprovoked. Why? Presumably to show that they have the \ncapability.\n  Iran and Iraq speak for themselves. Additional concerns are the \ninability of the former Soviet Republics to keep good track of the \nICBM's which they inherited from the breakup of the Soviet Union. Be it \naccidental or deliberate, if these weapons fall into the wrong hands, \nwe will have new foreign policy concerns the likes which none of us \nhave ever seen or will care to address.\n  We are vulnerable, Mr. President, and we need to act to prevent a \ncatastrophe of horrific proportions. The best way to do this is to do \nwhat should have been done long ago--deploy a national missile defense \nsystem.\n  There are a number of ballistic missile defense programs at various \nstages of development. Ideally, the United States would pursue a dual \ntrack system, namely a sea-based system which could be deployed to \nvarious theaters as the need arises. The aim here being to protect our \ntroops and allies which may be at the front line of a confrontation. \nAnd a ground based system based in Alaska, which is the only place in \nall the United States from which true, 100 percent protection of all \nthe United States and her territories can be achieved.\n  By basing a system in Alaska, we will have the added advantage of \nbeing close to both the Asian and European theaters. Our aim should be \nnot only to intercept a launched missile, but in being able to \nintercept it in the still early stages--preferably while it is still \nover the territory of the aggressor country.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, we have 80,000 American troops in \nthe Asia/Pacific theater alone. Many of these troops are already well \nwithin the range of current North Korean missile capability. As their \nmissile development program advances, we can expect American lives and \nAmerican soil to be exponentially at risk. We simply cannot stand idly \nby and wait. We need to be prepared, so that we can protect the \nAmerican people from such a strike, be it deliberate, unauthorized or \naccidental.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there are those who argue that S. 257 should \nbe\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\nrejected because it sends the wrong signal to Russia and raises flags \nabout the future of the ABM Treaty. Let me say unequivocally that this \nis not about Russia, and the Russians know it! The ABM Treaty was a \nproduct of a different era, an age when the United States and the \nSoviet Union were alone in their ability to launch intercontinental \nballistic missiles. This age passed quickly with the breakup of the \nSoviet Union, and a much more unsettling world has been left in her \nplace. Today, there are many, many threats and ignoring them will not \nmake them go away.\n  This is not about Russia. This is about the United States and our \nconstitutional and moral duty to protect the people whom we have been \nelected to represent. Mr. President, I strongly support this measure \nand commend Senators Cochran and Inouye for their untiring efforts to \nsee that this bill becomes law.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the bill. Could \nthe Chair inform me of the time limitations, if any on, debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no time limits on debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I can recall this concept when it was \nfirst suggested by President Reagan. It was a concept that was \nalluring. The notion that we could somehow put a protective umbrella of \ndefense over the United States against nuclear missiles would certainly \nbe an effort that would allay the fears of many that a missile might be \nlaunched from some nation like Russia. This idea of a strategic defense \ninitiative, Star Wars, or whatever you might characterize it as, has \nalways had a certain appeal to me and I am sure to anyone who hears it. \nI have been skeptical from the start as to whether or not this was \nfeasible. Now I think there are more fundamental policies that should \nbe addressed.\n  First, let us take a look at the history of the early part of the \ncentury.\n  After World War I, the French--determined never to let the Germans \ninvade their country again--set up a series of ``impregnable'' \nfortifications along their border from Switzerland to Belgium called \nthe Maginot Line. When Hitler decided to invade France he passed north \nof the Maginot Line via Belgium, swept behind the line, and captured it \nfrom behind. France was totally defeated in 6 weeks.\n  The national missile defense plan is our Maginot Line. It would give \nus a false sense of security and be completely ineffective in \ncountering threats that simply go around it--like the terrorist with \nchemical, biological or nuclear weapons in his suitcase. It could be \ntotally overwhelmed by intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) held \nby Russia, and its existence would encourage nuclear countries to \ndefeat it with devastating force. The star wars Strategic Defense \nInitiative in the 1980's faced these same problems. The current plan is \n``star wars lite,'' a shrunken relic of the cold war.\n\n\n                            the rogue states\n\n  No one is underestimating the capacity for so-called rogue nations to \nact in ways that seem irrational to us. However, in deciding that we \nmust spend billions of dollars to build a missile defense system to \nprotect ourselves against these third-rate powers, we are making one of \ntwo assumptions. Either we are tacitly admitting that we would not \nrespond to an attack by one of them against us with overwhelming \nforce--whether nuclear or conventional--or else we are assuming that \nthese leaders are so crazy that they would risk the destruction of \ntheir nations and the loss of their own power or lives for one shot at \nthe United States.\n  The leaders of the rogue nations, like Iraq and North Korea, may be \nisolated and seem irrational to us, but survival, not suicide, has been \ntheir overarching goal. It is much more likely that terrorists would do \nthese nations' dirty work for them in a way that is difficult to link \nto a particular nation, to avoid a retaliatory strike. National missile \ndefense would not help against terrorist attacks, which are far more \nlikely to be delivered by truck than by missile.\n  The danger of missile attacks from rogue nations is much more acute \nagainst our military forces in the Persian Gulf and Asia than against \nU.S. cities.\n  During the gulf war we made it quite clear that if Saddam Hussein \nused his weapons of mass destruction against our forces, he would \nsuffer an overwhelming response. He did not use those weapons. We have \nmade it clear to the whole world that we will respond to any use of \nweapons of mass destruction against us, while leaving the type of \nweapon, nuclear or convention, ambiguous.\n  Our massive arsenal should be as capable of deterring a rogue nation \nas it was to deter the Soviet Union for 50 years. Are thousands of \nweapons now ineffective against one or two or three or four or five \nmissiles in North Korea or some other country?\n  Nonetheless, the enormous cost in lives of even one missile strike \nagainst one U.S. city, no matter how unlikely, could lead us to decide \nto deploy a national missile defense system at some point in the \nfuture--if that would mean that our country would be more secure. That \nis why Congress has consistently supported research into missile \ndefense technology for theater and national applications. We should \ncontinue to research with deliberate speed and reasonable funding, but \nwe must not make the decision to deploy prematurely. We must not make \nthe leap which this resolution would lead us to.\n\n\n                       arms control implications\n\n  Deciding to deploy a missile defense system without getting Russian \nagreement to changes in the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty not \nonly would in effect abrogate that treaty, it would also be the end of \nthe Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START) process that is the basis \nfor the strategic stability between the United States and Russia. \nStrategic stability means that neither side is willing to engage in a \nfirst strike against the other.\n  If a missile defense system is deployed without regard to its effect \non strategic stability with Russia, our own security will be imperiled. \nThe United States and Russia still have thousands of nuclear warheads \npoised to launch at each other with just a few minutes between \ntargeting and launch. If arms control breaks down because of our \ndeployment of a missile defense system, we would be encouraging nuclear \ncountries to use multi-warhead ICBMs to defeat it. It would seem a \nfairly irrational decision on our part to trade away a strategic \nbalance that has kept the peace for 50 years in order to protect us \nagainst a hypothetical threat. The threat of 6,000 Russian and some 400 \nChinese missiles is not hypothetical.\n  We are at peace with Russia and the cold war is over. A first strike \nseems quite unlikely at this time. The danger today is from an \nunauthorized launch from Russia, or, because parts of Russia's early \nwarning system do not work, that Russian leaders could falsely think \nthe United States had started a first strike and would launch a \nretaliatory strike. A national missile defense system could not stop \nthose missiles.\n  Since Russia is having difficulty maintaining its nuclear arsenal \nnow, it is in our vital national interest to see reductions in the \nnumber of missiles on both sides--rather than pursuing a policy that \nwould put the START process on ice and could lead to redeploying \nmultiple warheads instead.\n  Our broader nuclear nonproliferation goals could also be undermined \nby the demise of arms control. The grand bargain forged when the \nNuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) was negotiated was that the \nnuclear countries would work toward nuclear disarmament, in return for \nthe non-nuclear countries foregoing them.\n  If we take a unilateral action that undermines the START process, \nthere will be no grand bargain, and we will have no argument against \nany country, including the rogue states, acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  The Maginot Line of national missile defense will not only encourage \ncountries to go around it, or to overwhelm it, it could also become the \nTrojan Horse that lets our enemies into the nuclear club.\n\n\n                                 costs\n\n  While we must make this decision on its merits, we cannot ignore the \ncosts of making it. We have spent over $40 billion on national missile \ndefense since 1983 with virtually nothing to show for it. That figure \ndoes not include the $52 billion spent before 1983\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\non various missile defense systems, like the Nike and Safeguard systems \nof the 1960's and 1970's. Estimates vary greatly on how much a limited \nmissile defense system would cost, and these estimates depend greatly \non what system would be chosen. I think it is safe to say that no one \nreally knows yet how much a system would cost.\n  I listened to the debate earlier today from some of my colleagues. \nOne of them raised the specter of vulnerability of nations on the west \ncoast as well as Hawaii in terms of attack from new members of the \nmissile nuclear club. One of the people speaking said if we know that \nthreat is out there, and we know the damage that could take place, \nisn't it a given that we would spend any amount of money to protect our \ncoast? Isn't that a responsibility? That is an interesting argument, \nand it certainly is one that would suggest that we would spend any \namount of money on this national missile defense system, that there are \nno limits to spending.\n  In fact, as I read it, the only limitation in this bill is that it \nhas to be somehow technologically possible to have a national missile \ndefense system. I would like to suggest that it is interesting that \nthis would be the standard which we would use to determine defense \nspending.\n  I wonder if I introduced a resolution into the Senate which asks if \nit would be the policy of the United States to spend as much money as \nnecessary if we found that it was technologically possible to cure \ncancer, how many votes we would get on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We \nhave made more progress in the war against cancer than we have on any \nnational missile defense system. Yet, when it comes to that kind of \ncourage with respect to virtually every American family, that is not \nconsidered really food for thought or even an issue for debate. The \nsame question could be asked when it comes to education. If it is \ntechnologically possible to educate children in America better, should \nwe make it our policy to spend whatever is necessary to achieve that? I \ndoubt that I could muster a majority vote in the Senate for that \nsuggestion. Or the elimination of drugs in America, if it is \ntechnologically possible to end the scourge of drugs in our country, \nshould we spend whatever is necessary?\n  I have given you three examples which come to mind, and many more \ncould be produced. But it is interesting to me that when it comes to \ndefense spending we apply standards which are totally different than \nthe priorities which many Americans would identify as important to us \nand important to all families.\n  In May 1996 the Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would \ncost $31-60 billion through 2010 to acquire a system outlined in the \nDefend America Act of 1996, plus an additional $2-4 billion per year to \noperate and maintain it. The National Security Council estimated that a \ntwo-site, ground-based system would cost $23 billion to deploy. The \nGeneral Accounting Office reported that the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOffice estimated that limited deployments in North Dakota and Alaska \nwould cost between $18-28 billion. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that it would cost $60 billion to build a ``high end \nsystem,'' including space-based lasers. Given the history of defense \ncost over-runs, it is quite likely that these figures are the floor, \nnot the ceiling of what these costs may be.\n  No matter how many amendments are adopted--and some I have supported, \nand some are very good--the bottom line is the U.S. Senate with this \nvote is virtually giving a blank check to this project. There are no \nlimitations on cost. As long as it meets the threshold requirement of \nbeing technologically possible, it can go forward.\n  We must not forget that, if we push ahead with deploying a national \nmissile defense system without seeking Russian agreement with changes \nto the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the nuclear arms reduction \nprocess will be moribund.\n  Let me salute my colleagues in the House.\n  Senator Landrieu offered an important amendment that at least \nreiterates America's commitment to negotiating some type of \ndisarmament. I support it. Virtually every Member did. I think that is \na positive step. But to simply adopt that amendment and ignore the bill \nthat is before us, I think, is folly. We have to be consistent. We have \nbuilt into this bill an inconsistency. On the one hand, we are going to \nmove forward with the national missile defense system, even if it \nviolates existing treaties, and then an amendment which says we are \ngoing to continue to negotiate these START treaties. I don't know what \nthe negotiating partner would believe, if they read this bill after \nthis debate.\n  That means we would also be bearing the costs of maintaining our \ncurrent level of 6,000 nuclear weapons, instead of being able to reduce \nto START II levels of 3,500 warheads, or START III levels of 2,500 \nwarheads, or even 1,000 warheads. We now spend about $22 billion on \nmaintaining and supporting our current nuclear force levels, including \n$8 billion per year maintaining nuclear warheads.\n  Would it not be in the best interests of the United States of America \nand its future to continue the arms control negotiations to reduce the \nnuclear warheads not only in the United States but around the world? I \nthink that is the best course of action. I am afraid this bill is \ninconsistent with that strategy.\n  In March 1998, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \nreducing warheads to START II levels by the end of 2007 would save $700 \nmillion per year through 2008 and about $800 million a year in the long \nrun (in constant dollars). Making these reductions by 2003 would yield \nan additional $700 million through 2008.\n  Reducing warheads to START III levels would save $1.5 billion per \nyear in the long run, provided weapons platforms are also retired. If \nwarheads were reduced to 1,000, savings would increase to $2 billion \nper year in the long run. Talk about a peace dividend. This $2 billion \nper year savings--25 percent of the current costs of maintaining \nnuclear warheads--does not include huge savings that would result if \nnuclear platforms, such as submarines, were retired to reflect the \nreduced number of warheads.\n  Thus, in considering the costs of deciding to deploy a national \nmissile defense system, we must add not only the $35-60 billion or more \nthat it would cost to deploy it, but also the opportunity cost of \nbillions of dollars every year of foregone savings from not being able \nto reduce our nuclear arsenal.\n  If Russia reverts to deploying multiple warhead missiles in response \nto our decision to deploy a national missile defense system, we may \nthen feel that we must do the same--potentially creating a new arms \nrace. The cost fighting the proliferation of nuclear weapons that could \noccur if the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is undermined is \nincalculable.\n  Deciding today that it is our policy to deploy a national missile \ndefense system is an expensive and bad idea that will lower, not \nimprove our national security.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 257, the \nNational Missile Defense Act of 1999. I am also honored to serve as an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill since it makes a straightforward but \nvital statement of policy regarding the core mission of the Defense \nDepartment to protect the United States from an accidental or \ndeliberate ballistic missile attack.\n  Our bill this year, introduced on a bipartisan basis once again by \nthe distinguished Senators from Mississippi and Hawaii, establishes a \nguideline without dictating its implementation. The so-called Cochran-\nInouye measure simply urges the United States to deploy ``as soon as it \nis technologically possible'' a national missile defense system.\n  Why should Congress pass a sentence-long policy endorsing the \ndeployment of national missile defenses? We float in an ocean of \nevidence that documents the emerging threat of a multistage ballistic \nmissile attack against the United States.\n  Last summer, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld led a \ndistinguished bipartisan panel in finding that North Korea and Iran, \nthanks to the support of Chinese and Russian technicians, could hit the \nfar western territories of the United States with a multistage rocket \nby 2003. Iraq, the commission also informed us, could obtain this \ncapability in a decade.\n  Several months before the completion of the Rumsfeld Report, the Air\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\nForce released an updated ballistic missile threat assessment noting \nthat the number of countries producing land-attack cruise missiles will \nincrease from two to nine early in the next decade.\n  A 1995 National Intelligence Estimate cautioned that about 25 \ncountries could threaten U.S. territory in less than 14 years if they \nacquired launch and satellite capabilities from the sky or seas.\n  Two years later, the CIA Director testified that Iran could have a \nmedium-range ballistic missile by 2007. The following year, India and \nPakistan exploded more powerful nuclear devices, and a North Korean \nmultistage rocket soared over Japan.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service informs us that 21 \ncountries overall possess or have ready access to chemical warheads. \nAnother 10 nations harbor or seek inventories of biological weapons.\n  And among all of these states, only four lack the ballistic missiles \nto fire these terrifying munitions. Several more countries without \nweapons of mass destruction, such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Belarus, \nBulgaria, Ukraine, and Yemen, nevertheless have the launchers to \ndeliver them far beyond their borders.\n  Senators Cochran and Inouye wisely recognize this real and expanding \nsecurity threat while leaving the scientific and budgetary issues \ninvolved with the deployment of missile defensive hardware to the \ntechnicians of the Pentagon who have devoted their careers to this \ncause.\n  But the Congress as a whole must take responsibility for framing \npriorities of policy, and no priority could loom larger than the \nprotection of our homeland. And on this fundamental front, supporters \nof the Cochran-Inouye bill have extensive reinforcements.\n  The first reinforcement comes from the President of the United \nStates. A 1994 Executive order declared that nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons proliferation poses an ``unusual and extraordinary \nthreat'' to our national security.\n  Another reinforcement comes from the President's deputies. Echoing \nthe main theme of a bill still opposed by the administration, General \nJoseph Ralston told the Senate Armed Services Committee last summer \nthat the Pentagon would field a national missile defense system as soon \nas ``technologically practical.''\n  In this fiscal year 2000 budget submission statement increasing \nmissile defense accounts by $6.6 billion over 5 years, Secretary Cohen \nconcluded that such programs remained ``critical to a broader strategy \nseeking to prevent, reduce, deter, and defend against weapons of mass \ndestruction.''\n  If the Secretary of Defense tells Congress that curbing the capacity \nof rogue governments to assault the United States is a ``broad'' \nsecurity ``strategy,'' who can doubt that the administration already \nhas a policy of making a missile defense system operational sooner \nrather than later?\n  While this evidence of proliferation mounts by the month, our \ncolleagues from the minority have blocked the Senate from exercising \nits majority will on the pending legislation because they believe that \nit would undermine the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty between \nthe United States and the Soviet Union.\n  But this bill addresses the prospect of a destructive weapons attack \nat any time of any intensity from any source. It primarily reflects the \nSecond and Third World missile launch capabilities of tomorrow, not \njust the cold war arsenals of yesterday.\n  These capabilities also do not always discriminate on the basis of \nnationality. Russia, just as unpredictably as America, could one day \nfall under the threat of attack from a rogue state.\n  So instead of rejecting a fundamental statement of national defense, \nwe should modernize the ABM Treaty in partnership with Moscow to ensure \nthat both countries enjoy adequate protection against an accidental or \ndeliberate ballistic missile strike.\n  As the President's Acting Under Secretary of State for Arms Control \ntold a Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee nearly 2 years ago, \n``the determinant of our national missile defense program . . . is \ngoing to be what the threat requires.'' And the Threat, Mr. President, \nrequires both the United States and Russia to prepare workable \ndefensive networks.\n  At the same time that we build safeguards against attack, we must \nsupport the thirty-year negotiating process, pursued by administrations \nof both parties, of reducing and eliminating the prime agents of \nattack: long-range nuclear weapons.\n  For this reason, I was pleased to join Senator Landrieu in sponsoring \nan amendment to S. 257 reinforcing the United States arms control \nprocess with Russia. Despite Moscow's economic difficulties, a \ndemoralized Russian Strategic Rocket Forces Command still maintains \nthousands of nuclear warheads subject to an accidental launch and the \nblack markets of the Third World.\n  Our amendment, endorsed on a rollcall vote by 99 Senators, simply \nreaffirms the ``policy of the United States to seek continued \nnegotiated reductions in Russian nuclear forces.''\n  As a result, S. 257 now provides America with the best defense: a \ntwin policy to deflect a short-notice missile strike against our \nhomeland and to redouble our efforts at reducing the size and lethality \nof the world's two largest nuclear arms inventories.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to highlight the relationship between \nan affordable and robust national missile defense system and our \nmilitary modernization agenda.\n  We pursue modernization to harmonize technology development with \nanticipated security threats. Missile defense programs embody this \nprocess since the president and his experts have diagnosed an evolving \nbut real threat in ballistic arms proliferation.\n  Modernization objectives require us to build new systems against a \nnew ballistic missile threat that is less graphic than the one posed by \nthe Soviet Union, but just as menacing to our strategic interests and \neconomic vitality.\n  In this light, Mr. President, a national missile defense system will \nbring the United States to the threshold of defense modernization. The \nCochran-Inouye bill fully acknowledges that the architecture, \ncomponents, and the budget for this program, like any other one \nscrutinized by Congress, must pass the test of practicality without \njeopardizing other important priorities such as the Pentagon's planned \nincrease in procurement spending to $60 billion by 2001.\n  Beyond this responsibility, however, we have the obligation to \nreconcile public policy with the evidence of arms proliferation.\n  Let's listen to the president, his analysts, his Defense Secretary, \nand his scientists.\n  Let's awaken to an uncertain world rumbling with launchers, warheads, \nand satellites whose range and power grow by the year.\n  And let's understand that the treaties of yesterday fail to help us \nshield the country against the potential attacks of tomorrow.\n  The statement of policy proposed by the Cochran-Inouye bill would \nrepresent a compelling step by Congress to counter the growing \nballistic missile threat to America's most precious assets: her land \nand her people. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the National Missile Defense Act of 1999.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the need for a national missile defense \nsystem is real. The North Korean Taepo Dong tests, the Iranian Shahab \nIII project and the uncertainty resulting from unexpected nuclear tests \nin India and Pakistan underscore the palpable threat that we now \nconfront. Today, we signify that the United States has no intention to \nallow its foreign and national security policies to be held hostage to \nweapons of terror. In this sense, this bill will provide a real \nincentive against nuclear proliferation. By embracing a system of \ncounter-measures that will grow progressively stronger in the next \ncentury, we tell the North Koreans, the Iranians and any other country \nthinking of threatening this nation with ballistic missiles, that those \nefforts will fail. They may as well spend their modest resources on \nsomething constructive for their people, because the United States \nintends to commit whatever resources necessary to ensure our security. \nThat we will be able to send this message with bipartisan resolve, \nmakes it that much stronger.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues Senators Levin and Cochran \nfor providing their leadership, guidance and wisdom on this issue. It \nwas their flexibility and negotiation that made yesterday's amendment \npossible. The amendment that we adopted by a vote of 99 to nothing \nshows the consensus that this body shares regarding the importance of \nnuclear arms control. By setting deployment of a limited national \nmissile defense and future reductions of nuclear stockpiles on equal \nfooting, this legislation emphasizes the complimentary nature of those \ntwo key national security concerns. They are equally important, and we \ncannot lose site of one for the other.\n  Finally, I think the compromise we have reached will signal to our \nRussian partners that we are serious about maintaining the progress \nthat we have achieved. A limited national missile defense is not a \nthreat to Russia, I would not support such an act. Instead this bill \nhelps move both countries beyond cold war thinking. It should hearten \nthe Russian Government to know that we will deploy a missile defense \nsystem which preserves the Russian nuclear deterrent. Again, it \ndemonstrates how far our countries have come. It is concrete evidence \nthat we have moved beyond a national security policy centered on \ncontaining Russian influence and countering every Russian capability.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of this legislation and proud of this \ninstitution. I hope that we will use the momentum gained here for \nfurther bipartisan efforts to address serious threats to our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I thank my ranking member, Senator Levin, and our \nsponsor, Senator Cochran, and my colleague, Senator Snowe for working \nthrough this important piece of legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand from both sides that those \nwho are listed under the order to permit them to offer amendments do \nnot intend to offer the amendments, and I know of no other Senators who \nare seeking recognition. I would suggest that we have come to the time \nwhen we could have third reading of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk to the \ntitle of the bill and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n       Amend the title to read as follows: ``The Cochran-Inouye \n     National Missile Defense Act of 1999''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment to amend the title.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nthat kind gesture and express again my appreciation for his assistance \nin the development of the legislation and the passage of this bill.\n  By this vote, the Senate has done what has never been done before. It \nhas passed legislation making it the policy of the United States to \ndeploy a national missile defense system capable against rogue-state \nthreats as soon as the technology to do so is ready.\n  By this action, the Senate has sent an unmistakable message around \nthe world:\n  To rogue states, that America will marshal its technological \nresources and refuse to be vulnerable to their ballistic missile \nthreats of coercion;\n  To our allies, that the United States will continue to be a reliable \nalliance partner;\n  To other nations, that no country will have any form of veto over \nAmerica protecting its security interests;\n  To those working on the development of a national missile defense, \nthat their work is valued and the system will be deployed just as soon \nas it is ready to protect America;\n  And most of all, to the American people, who will no longer have \ncause to wonder if their Government intends to fulfill its most \nfundamental responsibility.\n  In my opening statement I said we have heard many statements that \nhave been made to reassure us about the willingness of the United \nStates to defend itself. But there is always an ``if'' attached--if the \nthreat appears, if we can afford it, if other nations give us their \npermission. By our actions today, we have removed what Winston \nChurchill called ``the terrible ifs.''\n  Without doubt, there will be other challenges ahead for national \nmissile defense. There will be test failures as well as successes, but \nwe will not be deterred from continuing to test until we develop a \nsystem that works.\n  There will be discussions with other nations on arms control issues. \nBut now these discussions will not begin with the question of whether \nAmerica will protect itself. By this vote we have taken the necessary \nfirst step to protecting the United States from long-range ballistic \nmissile attack.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, the \nranking minority member on the Armed Services Committee, for his \ncooperation as floor manager for the minority. I also thank all \nSenators who came to the floor to speak on the bill, and especially \nthose Senators who cosponsored the bill. And finally, I thank my staff \nmembers, Mitch Kugler and Dennis Ward, whose excellent assistance to me\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\nand other supporters of this legislation has been very helpful indeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak out \nof order for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2821-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO SENATOR DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today we celebrate the life of the patron \nsaint of Ireland known popularly as Saint Patrick. Saint Patrick's \ngiven name was actually Maewyn and he was born in Wales about 385 A.D. \nMany of us, whether we have a drop of bonafide Irish blood or not, will \nhave donned something green today, in honor of the great spirit and \nrich traditions of the Irish people, and of their substantial \ncontributions in all walks of life to this, their adopted homeland.\n  Right here in the Senate we can see the brilliant legacy of the Irish \ngene pool personified in the physical presence of some of our most \noutstanding Members.\n  I note that one of these sons of Ireland celebrated his 72nd birthday \non yesterday--merely a young lad in my eyes. That illustrious son of \nIreland is none other than the Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan. \nAlthough I am honored to wish this amazing gentleman the happiest of \nbirthdays, my heart hangs heavy with the knowledge that all too soon \nthis incredible man will be leaving this body. He has announced his \nretirement from the United States Senate, commencing with the end of \nthis Congress.\n  In this coming year, we will celebrate his life and his achievements, \nbut I cannot emphasize enough what a loss this body will have suffered \nwhen the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, no longer graces \nthis Chamber. He is, quite literally, irreplaceable.\n  Pat Moynihan is, in every sense of the word, a giant. He has written \nmore books than most of us have read. Often his observations have been \nastoundingly prophetic. From his towering intellect, to his wry wit, to \nthe breadth of his experience in governing, to his contributions to his \ncountry, and to the world, Senator Moynihan is almost without parallel \nin our times. He is that rare commodity to which superlatives may be \napplied without hesitation, and in complete honesty. Time will only \nenhance his legacy and his reputation.\n  When my own time comes to leave this august body or even to leave \nthis beautiful blue sphere we call the great, good earth, I will count \namong my proudest, most important and enjoyable experiences, that of \nhaving served with the gentleman from New York.\n  So today, on St. Patrick's Day, I thank his ancestral nation for \nsending this phenomenal gentleman to us, and I congratulate Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan for a life of excellence. What pride we have in him as \none of our own, what pride, indeed.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2821-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2821-S2825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      INTERIM FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are seeking a UC, which I expect to get \nsometime relatively soon--at least I hope so. If not, we will have just \nhad a good discussion. But I think we are fairly near to making sure \nthat it is agreeable to all Senators.\n  In the meantime, the Senator from Virginia is missing a very \nimportant hearing that concerns some China issues. I would like to have \nhim recognized at this time since he has to leave the floor.\n  The issue is a short-term extension of 60 days of the FAA \nauthorization, with two amendments. We are awaiting approval from the \nother side of the aisle before we proceed.\n  I yield the floor so that the Senator from Virginia can speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, Senator McCain and I met with the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, in the past day or so to discuss the bills relating to \nthe Nation's airports. I specifically in each of these meetings raised \nthose pieces of legislation that pertain specifically to National and \nDulles Airports. The Senator and I have worked together for decades. We \nare old shipmates in some respects; slight difference in time, but, \nnevertheless, shipmates. We have our differences.\n  The purpose of this legislation today is to enable, at the request of \nthe majority leader, a short-term, 60-day measure to go forth to extend \nexisting legislation. But I have filed two bills with the Senate. I am \ngoing to ask now that the second bill be made a part of this extension \nof 60 days.\n  There are approximately some $200 million currently in escrow for the \ncombined reconstruction programs at National and Dulles Airports. That \nsum is yet to be disbursed. I am working to get it disbursed.\n  So, for the moment, Senator McCain and I have agreed, together with \nSenator Lott, that $30 million of that fund can now be released subject \nto adoption by the Senate of this legislation, and, of course, with the \nconcurrence in the House; but can be released to begin some very needed \nprojects at these airports.\n  Mr. President, I am going to depart the floor. I have to go to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. Senator McCain will put this amendment \nin on my behalf. I think he is going to be a cosponsor on it. But \nessentially we are making some progress towards the release of these \nfunds.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and my good friend.\n  I will enter no objection to the 60-day legislation going forward.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Virginia leaves the \nfloor, I will support his amendment, which allows the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority to collection $30 million of the PFC \ncharge and Airport Improvement Funding Program to complete projects at \nthe Reagan National and Dulles Airports. Full funding for those \nprojects has been delayed until we are able to put in place our \ncorresponding agreement on the reauthorization of the FAA.\n  Mr. President, I have no desire to hold up progress at either \nairport. I will be proposing, if we get agreement from the other side, \nthe amendment on behalf of Senator Warner. We have reached an \nagreement.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I think it would be wise, I say to our distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, to advise the Senate with regard to the discussions \nhe has had with me and others as to the future timing of the major \npiece of legislation in which I have another very specific interest.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe that we should be able to pass \nthis FAA reauthorization in its entirety very quickly through the floor \nof the Senate. We spent 2 weeks on it last year. This bill is \nfundamentally the same as it was last year. I am hopeful that the \nmajority leader will seize the time after the recess to spend a day or \nso on it.\n  I would like to remind my colleague from Virginia that we reached an \nagreement on flights from Reagan National, Chicago O'Hare, Kennedy, and \nLaGuardia, the slot-controlled airports last year. And also we had \nagreement on the perimeter rule.\n  It is not that we can't reach agreement, because we already did. It \nappears to me that, with the agreement of the majority leader, sometime \nwell within the next 30 days we should get this passed, because we \nwould have to go to conference with the House. As you know, the House \nbill may contain some rather controversial provisions, including taking \nthe entire aviation trust fund off budget, which is an issue which will \nbe addressed, frankly, by the majority leader, and the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and others, because it is one that transcends aviation \nitself.\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, when the major piece of \nlegislation comes up, as I advised the majority leader himself, I will \nlikely have further amendments to that piece of legislation. We \ndiscussed that the other day.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I want to support this proposal to reauthorize the \naviation improvement fund for 2 additional months. The Aviation \nImprovement Program is the Federal program that provides much-needed \ngrants to airports throughout the country. This program will expire on \nMarch 31, unless Congress takes some type of action to keep the program \ngoing.\n  I remind my colleagues that the majority leader has scheduled to take \nup the budget all of next week, and it is my understanding that there \nis a recess after that. So I think we would be well to get this 2-month \nextension passed today, if we could, since the other body will have to \npass it as well. The only change that would be made would be, as we \njust discussed with the Senator from Virginia, that some of the money \nthat is not being used at this time would proceed with projects at the \nReagan National and Dulles Airports.\n  This two-month extension will give the Congress enough time to \ncomplete work on comprehensive aviation proposals that are working \ntheir way through each chamber. As my colleagues are aware, the \nCommerce Committee recently reported out S. 82, the Air Transportation \nImprovement Act. That bill includes numerous provisions that would help \nthe federal government to maintain and improve the safety, security, \nand capacity of our nation's airports and airways. Furthermore, S. 82 \nwould make great strides in enhancing competition in the airline \nindustry--something that is much needed.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out again that one of the reasons why \nwe should not have a lengthy extension reauthorization is that there \nare several provisions in the bill that directly affect airline safety. \nIt is not in our interest not to have those provisions enacted into \nlaw, not to mention the compelling need that we have to modernize our \nair traffic control system.\n  I would prefer to have the Senate take up consideration of S. 82 \nrather than this short-term extension. But I understand that there is \nother important business pending before the Senate that prevents us \nfrom debating it at this time. Given these existing time constraints \nand the looming expiration of the AIP, there simply may not be enough \ntime for both chambers to pass comprehensive aviation legislation. \nTherefore, this extension has become necessary.\n  Nevertheless, I look forward to bringing the complete reauthorization \nbill to the Senate floor for a full debate as soon as possible. Because \nS. 82 is very similar to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \nreauthorization bill that passed the Senate last year by a vote of 92 \nto 1, I am confident that we will be able to move it swiftly soon after \nthe Easter-Passover recess.\n  Despite the immediate need for this extension, the Senate and House \nare close to meeting our mutually shared goals of enacting significant \nlegislation to improve the state of aviation in this country. A few \nweeks should give everyone more than enough time to complete this \neffort.\n  I would now like to outline what is contained in this short-term \nextension of the AIP. Most important, it would allow the FAA to \ncontinue supporting important safety and capacity projects at hundreds \nof airports around the nation. It also includes several technical \namendments requested by the FAA to ensure that the program can be \nproperly managed until we have the opportunity to reauthorize it on a \nmulti-year basis. Authorizations would also be provided for the FAA's \nOperations account and its Facilities and Equipment programs through \nthe end of this fiscal year.\n  In addition, this proposal would extend the Aviation Insurance \nProgram, which is commonly known as war risk insurance. This program \nprovides insurance for commercial aircraft that are operating in high \nrisk areas, such as countries at war or on the verge of war. Commercial \ninsurers usually will not provide coverage for such operation, which \nare often required to further U.S. foreign policy or national security \npolicy.\n  This short-term extension would also correct a technical oversight \nrelated to the Military Airport Program, which provides grants for the \nconversion of military aviation facilities to civilian use. When the \nAIP was extended for six months in last year's omnibus appropriations \nbill, the MAP was not specifically reauthorized. Consequently, the \nprogram is not currently eligible to receive funds. This extension \nwould remedy the situation.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Majority Leader Lott and \nthe leadership of the Appropriations Committee for allowing this AIP \nextension to move through the Senate so quickly.\n  I know the Senate schedule is quite full. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this 2-month extension of the AIP. It will give \nus sufficient time to fulfill our larger responsibility to enact \nsubstantive aviation legislation. I think we owe it to the American \npeople to keep aviation policy high on our list of national priorities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address the amendment that I will \noffer on behalf of Senator Warner, if we get agreement to move forward \non this legislation.\n  I support his amendment, which is $30 million for the passenger, use \nof the passenger facility charge for the Airport Improvement program \nfunding that is applied to complete projects at Reagan National and \nDulles Airports. Full Federal funding for these projects will be \ndelayed until we are able to put in place our corresponding agreement \non new flights at Reagan National.\n  To his credit, my colleague from Virginia has demonstrated that \ncertain capacity-related, perhaps safety-related projects at National \nand Dulles should not remain unfunded. I agree we should not allow our \nnegotiations to get in the way of these improvements.\n  Mr. President, my new colleague from Illinois, Senator Fitzgerald, \nhas been involved in this issue for some time. Senator Fitzgerald has \npreviously represented a district in the Illinois State Legislature, \nthe residents of which had a significant involvement in this issue. \nThere are some complicated issues out in the State of Illinois \nconcerning the need for or not the need for an additional airport in \nIllinois. That has somewhat complicated this issue as regards to \nChicago O'Hare Airport.\n  I have had several meetings with Senator Fitzgerald.\n  Senator Fitzgerald is doing his utmost to see if we can't arrive at a \nreasonable resolution of this issue. I appreciate his immediate \nattention to this issue, and I am impressed with his in-depth knowledge \nof this important situation.\n  I look forward to working with him during the period, if we are able \nto pass it, of this 2-month extension.\n  I note that my friend from Virginia, Senator Robb, is here. He and I \nhave had a great deal of friendly combat on this issue, and I hope that \nSenator Robb would agree to this 2-month extension so that we can \ncontinue this friendly but very spirited discussion that he and I have \nbeen having for several years. Since Senator Robb has arrived in the \nChamber, I will reserve the remainder of my remarks and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Arizona. And he \nis, indeed, my friend. On most issues we are as one, particularly as it \nrelates to our Nation's defense, and many other areas, sometimes taking \non some tough issues.\n  This is one of those areas where we disagree. We have a fundamental \ndisagreement with respect to the scope of the legislation that we \npassed some 13 years ago, and whether or not Congress should still have \nits hands in and control of the local regional airport authority. But I \nthank my friend from Arizona for not offering an amendment that I was \ntold about an hour ago he was going to offer which would in effect have \ntold the local airport authority not only that they could not have \ntheir nominees approved, that they had to have additional slots and \nchange the perimeter, but tell them exactly how\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nto spend the money that they were going to get.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona for not doing that because that, \nfrankly, would be an additional insult to the authority that Congress \ngranted to the local authority some 13 years ago. We are going to have \na significant discussion about the wisdom of Congress meddling in the \nlocal airport authority's jurisdiction to determine its own fate and \nmake its own decisions with respect to the number of flights, the \nimpact that the number of flights has on noise pollution, on safety, on \nthe convenience of customers, and a number of other factors that are \ninvolved, and whether or not we ought to allow the two airports, \nworking together, to work out a plan that helps both of them grow and \nboth of them to serve the greater Metropolitan Washington area.\n  But for now, recognizing that there is a longstanding, legitimate \nneed to release some of the airport improvement funds, I thank my \nfriend from Arizona for at least allowing us to get what I understand--\nand I haven't still read the entire amendment--is about $30 million, \nwhich is $10 million more than we had a little while ago and with less \nstrings attached. For increasing the number--it is not the $200 million \nthat the airports are owed, but it is $30 million that will allow them \nto get started on much delayed, very important projects, particularly \nout at Dulles International--I thank my friend from Arizona for this \nmodified amendment.\n  I join not only my friend from Arizona, but the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia and urge its passage as soon as it is the will of \nthe Senate to do so. With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and, \nagain, I thank my friend from Arizona. We will have more opportunity to \ndiscuss the full merits of this legislation at a later time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to say to my friend, Senator \nRobb, that it shows I am just an easy mark and pushover; whatever the \nSenator from Virginia and the good folks out at the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority want, I always try to do. I am sure the \nSenator is aware of that.\n  Seriously, I do look forward to this debate with Senator Robb. We may \nnever agree on it, because I know how strongly held his views are, and \nI believe he is reflecting the views of many of his constituents. But I \ndo want to emphasize that the respectful level of debate, the \nfriendship that exists between us, I think, has been important to me \nbecause this has been very emotional. My motives have been probably \nimpugned more than in some years about why I support this legislation.\n  My friend from Virginia has never alleged anything but that we just \nhave different views, and I am very appreciative of that. And I know \nthat the other aspect of the approach of the Senator from Virginia is \nthat he is willing, and has shown in the past an eagerness to debate \nthe issue openly and fairly, taking whatever time is necessary, and \nthen we put it to a vote of the Senate.\n  That is the way we should work around here, and that is the way, to \nmy knowledge, the Senator from Virginia has always operated. So I thank \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  I yield for the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, if I might respond to the Senator from \nArizona, I thank him for his compliments. I do have enormous personal \nrespect for him. It has not been personal. I disagree with him not on \nthe basis of whatever motivation he has, but on the impact that it has \non the regional authority that this institution authorized some 13 \nyears ago and on which I worked during the end of my term as Governor \nwith then former Governor Holton, then-Secretary of Transportation \nElizabeth Dole, then-Senator Warner, then other members of the local \ndelegation, and others. But it is a merit-based discussion, and I do \nlook forward to having that with Senator McCain at the appropriate \ntime. But for right now it is important to have the $30 million \navailable to us.\n\n  Again, I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      unanimous consent agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that it now be in order to \nproceed to the consideration of S. 643, which is at the desk. I further \nask that it be considered under the following limitations: 30 minutes \nfor debate on the bill equally divided in the usual form; the only \nfirst-degree amendment in order to the bill be an amendment by Senator \nWarner regarding airport funding, and the debate on that amendment be \nlimited to 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form; no other \namendments or motions be in order to the bill. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that following the disposition of the above-listed amendment, \nthe bill be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 643) to authorize the Airport Improvement \n     Program for 2 months, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 76\n\n    (Purpose: To release $30 million of the funds available to the \n Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority for passenger facility fee/\n                     airport development projects)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I made my remarks already about the \nnecessity for this bill, so I would like to now send to the desk the \namendment offered by Senator Warner, for himself, and Mr. Robb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Warner, for \n     himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Robb proposes an amendment \n     numbered 76.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RELEASE OF 10 PERCENT OF MWAA FUNDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding sections 49106(c)(6)(C) \n     and 49108 of title 49, United States Code, the Secretary of \n     Transportation may approve an application of the Metropolitan \n     Washington Airports Authority (an application that is pending \n     at the Department of transportation on March 17, 1999) for \n     expenditure or obligation of up to $30,000,000 of the amount \n     that otherwise would have been available to the Authority for \n     passenger facility fee/airport development project grants \n     under subchapter I of chapter 471 of such title.\n       (b) Limitation.--The Authority may not execute contracts, \n     for applications approved under subsection (a), that obligate \n     or expend amounts totalling more than the amount for which \n     the Secretary may approve applications under that subsection, \n     except to the extent that funding for amounts in excess of \n     that amount are from other authority or sources.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, rather than take up the time of the Senate \non this amendment, I have described it, both Senators from Virginia \nhave described it, so I note there is no further debate on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the remainder of my time; on behalf of the other \nside, I yield the remainder of their time.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 76) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, finally, I look forward to bringing \nforward the complete reauthorization bill to the Senate as soon as \npossible for debate. It is very similar to the FAA reauthorization bill \nthat passed the Senate last year by a vote of 92 to 1. I am confident \nwe will be able to move it soon after the Easter/Passover recess.\n  Mr. President, we are committed to getting this done. I will not \nreopen the debate with Senator Robb, as I mentioned. But it was a \nFederal law that caused a situation where, according to the Department \nof Transportation, the General Accounting Office, and every other \noutside organization in this Nation that has observed this situation, \nthey all agree that in the present situation, where the perimeter rule \nis in place and the slot rule is in place, there is a decrease in \ncompetition and higher air fares. That is indisputable. That is\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nindisputable: higher air fares, less competition.\n  We have had a tremendous increase in complaints by people from all \nover the country about the air service in America today. Many of those \ncomplaints are a direct result of a lack of competition, because the \none thing we know, no matter where a service is provided, in what area \nof the public sector, if there is not competition, there is a \ncommensurate decrease of service. That happens to prevail whether it be \nselling hamburgers or whether it be department stores or whether it be \npublic transportation or the cable industry or any other. And when we \nhave the deplorable conditions which have provoked an outcry all over \nAmerica, which has then motivated Senator Hollings, Senator Wyden and \nme, with almost unanimous agreement from the entire Commerce Committee, \nto introduce a bill called the Passengers Protection Act, then it is \nclear there is something badly wrong with the service that is provided \nin America today.\n\n  You can trace it back to lack of competition. When you are the only \ngame in town, you can give about whatever service you want to give. \nThat is the case at National Airport, because there is no fear that \nthere will be additional flights to compete with those that are flying \nout of National Airport. So I believe very strongly we need to lift \nthis congressionally approved perimeter rule.\n  I will say, without referring to anything that has happened in the \npast, it is more than coincidental that it happens to reach the western \nedge of the runway at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. But I will not go \ninto that debate and discussion at this time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, to complete the unanimous-consent \nagreement, I ask consent that following the disposition of the \namendment, that the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to \na vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action or debate.\n  I finally ask consent that following that vote, the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 15, H.R. 99, and all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 643, as amended, be \ninserted in lieu thereof, and the bill be read a third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote take \nplace at 4:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, and I \nyield the remainder of Senator Hollings' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in the couple of moments remaining \nbefore the 4:15 vote, I rise in strong support of the 2-month extension \nof the Federal Aviation Administration's Airport Improvement Program. \nThe AIP, as it is known, Airport Improvement Program, is absolutely \nbasic to virtually all of our Nation's airports, and in rural States it \nis particularly important.\n  We were unable to complete our work on this last year for a variety \nof reasons that I am not going to dwell on, but I do want to emphasize \nhow important it is that we pass this 2-month reauthorization \nextension.\n  Airports in West Virginia, South Dakota, I would presume Wyoming, and \nall other places are going to need this money in the planning of runway \nprojects, in terms of resurfacing and repairing runways, \ninfrastructure. And all of that is tremendously important.\n  I think people often tend to underestimate the power of the growth of \nthe aviation industry and the enormous consequences that go along with \nthat. We tend to think that it is a large industry, but we do not \nreally know whether it is growing or not that much. It is one of the \nmost dynamic. It is not up there quite with the Internet in its growth, \nbut it is not that far behind. Americans are flying in absolute record \nnumbers, and the growth in air traffic alone will be just under 4 \npercent for each of the next 12 years. People are getting on airplanes; \n600 million people this year in this country. That is going to go up to \n820 million in several years. When you get that kind of growth, you \ncannot just leave what you have been using in place unchanged and \nunrenovated. It has to be modern. It has to work. It has to be safe.\n  This year the FAA, and in particular its Airport Improvement Program, \nis being forced to do this kind of improvement work in a very piecemeal \nfashion. That is not good. That is not safe. It is not modern and, when \nyou are playing around with the world of aviation, it is very, very \nunwise. The short-term extension is what we are doing, frankly, because \nthat is the best we can do. It doesn't mean it is the best that we \ncould do; it is the best that we can do. In Congress, sometimes, you \nhave to do that.\n\n  I am very committed, as I know Chairman McCain is, Senator Hollings, \nand Senator Gorton, to enacting a full and comprehensive \nreauthorization of the FAA and airport improvement bill this year. That \nwill come. There will be discussions and controversy, but that will \ncome. We passed a bill out of the Commerce Committee, so we are on our \nway on that.\n  We have other things we have to look at. We have to look at the \nmodernization of the FAA system itself, our air traffic control system. \nWe happen to have an absolutely superb individual, Mr. President, \nrunning the FAA in the person of Jane Garvey--absolutely superb. In \nworking with her, you can just see all kinds of good things happening. \nBut we have to reauthorize so that we can get on to modernizing our air \ntraffic control system, modernizing certain parts of the FAA itself, \nits institutional structure, and dealing with the whole question of how \nwe allocate aviation dollars.\n  For the moment, what we need is what we have at hand, the pending \nmeasure, a 2-month extension of the reauthorization. I hope soon my \ncolleagues will go along with that.\n  I thank my friend, the distinguished Presiding Officer. I yield the \nfloor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the question is, Shall the bill, S. 643, as \namended, pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 52 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The bill (S. 643), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President I rise to offer some thoughts on our \nrelations with China, and in particular the prospects of China's WTO \nmembership, as the visit of Premier Zhu Rongji to the United States \nnext month approaches.\n\n\n                        context of relationship\n\n  Let me begin, however, with some context.\n  During this decade, the Senate and the country as a whole has had an \nintense debate on China policy. Participants in this debate have taken \nradically different views on the prospects of our relationship, and on \nthe trade, security and human rights policies we should adopt in it.\n  But virtually all participants have held one basic assumption: that \nis, that economic growth in China will inevitably continue at a very \nrapid rate for many years to come, and that consequently, China is a \n``rising'' regional power which is likely to become a superpower \neconomy and military power on a par with ourselves.\n  For some time I have been skeptical of this assumption. In the past \nyear, as the Asian financial crisis has affected China more and more \ndeeply, another possibility has become quite clear: China's immediate \nfuture may be one of protracted economic difficulties and social \ninstability rather than unbroken ascendance.\n  Within the past year, China's growth appears to have dropped \nsignificantly. Foreign investment commitments have dropped. Signs of \nfinancial crisis have emerged in Guangdong Province. China's exports \noverall seem to have dropped due to the contraction of Asian economies.\n  And unemployment in cities has risen sharply.\n  This has coincided with growing strains in our relationship. A number \nof Chinese actions--notably arrests of a number of people associated \nwith the Chinese Democracy Party, and a series of statements by Chinese \nofficials about American research on theater missile defense--have \nraised a great deal of concern, and rightly so.\n  These have been combined with inflammatory reports in the press on \nclandestine Chinese efforts to gain access to American military \ntechnology, including nuclear weapons design.\n\n\n                             u.s. response\n\n  How do we respond?\n  First of all, we should not simply set these issues aside and we \nshould not be intimidated. In our bilateral relationship, I do not, for \nexample, agreed with those who say that spying--especially in areas as \nsensitive as nuclear technology--is a natural and tolerable activity by \nforeign governments and that the only fitting response is better \nsecurity in the U.S. Spying is intolerable and a breech of national \nsecurity of this magnitude deserves the most serious attention and \nswiftest of action.\n  And I do not agree with Chinese contentions that policies to defend \nAmerican troops abroad, our treaty allies and our homeland from missile \nattack are destabilizing and provocative.\n  And with respect to Taiwan, our goal must always be prevention of \nconflict in the Strait, and the more China threatens Taiwan with \nmissiles, the more Taiwan will need to provide for security against \nmissiles.\n  Likewise, we should continue to develop our relationship with our \nAsian allies and the Pacific region generally.\n  Special priorities this year should be ratification of the newly \ndeveloped defense guidelines in our alliance with Japan; passage of the \nlegislation allowing joint military exercises with the Philippine \nSenate; conclusion of the negotiations toward a commercial\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nagreement and normal trade relations with Vietnam; and broader efforts \ntoward economic recovery in Asia.\n  At the same time, however, we should avoid seeing the present strains \nin relations with China as signs of inevitable confrontation. They \nlikely reflect growing fears of domestic unrest and loss of confidence \nin China's future strength, rather than an arrogance born of security \nand success.\n  And while we should be firm, we must also avoid being wilfully \nprovocative or unwilling to seek out common interests.\n\n\n                    u.s. interests in wto accession\n\n  That brings me to the largest single item of common interest on our \nagenda: China's potential accession to the WTO.\n  Such an accession would have immense potential benefits for both \nAmerica and China.\n  From our perspective, it can create a more reciprocal trade \nrelationship; promote the rule of law in China; and accelerate the \nlong-term trend toward China's integration into the world economy and \nthe Pacific region.\n  This integration is, we should always remember, immensely important \nto our long-term security interests.\n  To choose one example, twenty-five years ago China would likely have \nseen the Asian financial crisis as an opportunity to destabilize the \ngovernments of Southeast Asia, South Korea and perhaps even Japan. \nToday it sees the crisis as a threat to its own investment and export \nprospects and has thus contributed to IMF recovery packages and \nmaintained currency stability.\n  Thus China's policy has paralleled and complemented our own; and as a \nresult, the Asian financial crisis remains an economic and humanitarian \nissue rather than a political and security crisis.\n  From China's perspective, WTO entry has the long-term benefits of \nstrengthening guarantees of Chinese access to foreign markets and \npromoting competition and reform in the domestic economy; and the \nshort-term benefit of creating a new source of domestic and foreign \ninvestor confidence at a time of immense economic difficulty.\n\n\n              commercially meaningful accession essential\n\n  Neither of us, however, will win the full benefits of WTO accession \nunless the accession agreement is of commercially meaningful quality.\n  Thus Congress should be vigilant about the details of such an \nagreement. Broadly speaking, this means:\n  Significant tariff reductions and other measures to liberalize trade \nin goods;\n  Market access for agriculture, including the elimination of phony \nhealth barriers of Pacific Northwest wheat, citrus, meats and other \nproducts.\n  Liberalization of service sectors including distribution, \ntelecommunications, finance, audiovisual and others;\n  This requires a lot from China. It is not entirely clear that China \nwill make a commercially meaningful offer to us. and if they do not, we \nshould be willing to wait rather than push forward with this accession.\n\n\n            accession must be judged on trade policy merits\n\n  However, if they are ready to make such an offer, the United States \nshould clearly be willing to say yes. That should include the permanent \nnormal trade relations we offer virtually all WTO members.\n  Congress would, of course, have to vote on permanent normal trade \nrelations. Because Congress already holds all the cards with respect to \nthe Normal Trade Relations vote, I am concerned about proposals to \ncreate a second vote, which would delay accession by requiring a prior \nvote on admission. This raises a number of troubling questions.\n  First, I think we need to be prepared to move quickly if and when we \nget the desired commercially acceptable accession package--simply put, \nwe must be prepared to strike when the iron is hot. Such an important \nstep should not be hamstrung by requiring a separate vote by Congress.\n  Second, the proposal raises constitutional and precedential \nquestions. Congress has not voted on any of the previous 100 GATT and \nWTP accessions since 1948, since WTO accessions are executive \nagreements which generally require no U.S. concessions.\n  But most important, a vote on WTO accession would more likely be a \njudgment on the immediate state of our overall relationship with China \nthan on the trade policy details of the accession.\n  China's accession to the WTO is about whether China is ready to trade \nopenly and fairly with the United States. Whether China will accept \nrule of law and abide by that rule of law.\n  In effect, we would likely hold a set of unilateral trade concessions \nby China to the United States hostage to every other concern we have \nabout China--from human rights to security, environment, labor policies \nand much more. The likely result would be an immense loss to the United \nStates. Therefore, I do not favor such a proposal and will oppose it on \nthe floor.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, China policy must not be considered \nsimply in isolation.\n  Premier Zhu's visit offers us an immensely important opportunity, \nboth to right the overall course of our relationship and to conclude \nthe specific talks over WTO membership for China on the right, \ncommercially meaningful basis. I welcome this and hope our colleagues \nwill do the same.\n  But this relationship is only one piece--important, but only one \npiece--in our broader relationship with the Pacific region and our \nAsian allies.\n  If we are to develop these other relationships carefully; if we are \nfirm with China when necessary but also willing to seek out areas of \ncommon interest; if we react to difficult periods with confidence in \nour own strength and commitment to our own interests, we can expect a \nvery good future.\n  I am fully confident that this is what we will do because we have \nsome very important opportunities here to be sure to secure that \nrelationship.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2826-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 544\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of that agreement, there will be no further votes \nthis evening. However, Senators will be reminded that the next vote \nwill occur at 11 a.m. on Thursday.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee, the managers of the bill, and \nthe Senator from West Virginia for being ready to go, on relatively \nshort notice, on this important matter.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2826-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2826-S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is the supplemental bill before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 544) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations and rescissions for recovery from natural \n     disasters, and foreign assistance, for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate will consider a \nsupplemental appropriations bill that includes both emergency and \nnonemergency spending for the fiscal year.\n  Over the past 3 months, the Office of Management and Budget has \ntransmitted to Congress several supplemental budget requests, totaling \n$2 billion.\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\n  These requests seek funding for agricultural relief, implementation \nof the Wye River Accords and recovery in Central America from the \ndamage caused by Hurricane Mitch.\n  Each of the subcommittees has examined the requests under their \njurisdiction, and closely reviewed other emergent agency needs.\n  In addition, the administration proposed deep cuts in defense funds \nto offset additional foreign assistance sought for Jordan, Israel and \nthe Palestinian Authority.\n  This proposed offset re-opened issues settled in the omnibus bill in \nOctober, and violated the spirit of the firewalls that govern \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1999.\n  In total, the bill reported by the committee provides $1.538 billion \nin emergency appropriations and $332 million in non-emergency \nappropriations.\n  These new appropriations are matched by $1.87 billion in rescissions \nand program deferrals.\n  The recommendations made by the committee nearly double the \nadministration's request for agricultural relief, providing a total of \n$285 million.\n  That bill proposes $100 million in funding this year for Jordan, to \nprovide additional support for a vital ally during a period of \ntransition and tension in the region.\n  The deferral of the remaining $800 million in funding to implement \nthe Wye agreements does not reflect opposition to that request.\n  After consultation with the administration, it was determined that \nthose amounts can await consideration later this year. This committee \nhas a long record of support for the Middle East Peace Process--our \nfriends in the region know they can count on us.\n  The amounts requested for Hurricane Mitch relief respond to the truly \ndesperate conditions facing our neighbors in Central America.\n  The Department of Defense, and the U.S. Southern Command, led by Gen. \nCharles Wilhelm, deserve great credit for their efforts to respond to \nthe immediate crisis late last year.\n  We must backfill the amounts spent by the Department to ensure our \nability to respond to future crises is not diminished--especially in \nrespect to drawdown authorities and overseas humanitarian assistance.\n  In addition, we must address the needs of our friends in Honduras, \nGuatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic to \nrebuild from this disaster. These funds provide a good first step in \nthat effort.\n  Recognizing the considerable amount of emergency spending provided in \nthe omnibus bill in October, I recommended that all new appropriations \nin this bill be offset by rescissions of other available funds.\n  These rescissions include defense and non-defense discretionary \nappropriations, mandatory appropriations, emergency appropriations and \nfunding deferrals.\n  There were very few good choices to consider. I'm sure every Member \nhere might have assembled a different mix of offsets.\n  These rescissions, totaling $1.868 billion, reflect an effort to \nbalance competing needs.\n  Only defense funds were rescinded to offset defense spending, and \nonly non-defense amounts to balance the non-defense spending.\n  Some of these will be controversial, but our intention is to reduce \nonly funds that are not likely to be obligated this year, or are of a \nlow priority.\n  We are at or over the budget caps for 1999. We have no headroom or \nflexibility to make any non-emergency appropriation unless it is fully \noffset in both budget authority and outlays.\n  For that reason, any amendment to this bill must be accompanied by \noffsets. I must insist that even emergency spending amendments be \naccompanied by budget authority offsets.\n  Finally, many Members have raised various legislative amendments this \nweek.\n  I hope that controversial amendments can again be deferred. Every \nMember has a right to propose amendments, but this is a supplemental \nappropriations bill, and deals with some very real emergency needs.\n  In my judgment, we need to complete final action and try to send this \nbill to the President before the Easter recess which commences a week \nfrom tomorrow. I believe we must pass the bill in the Senate this week \nto meet that schedule.\n  Mr. President, compared to previous emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills presented to this body, this bill does not respond \nto the kind of domestic disasters we faced in 1997 or 1998.\n  This is a modest bill, that is fully offset in terms of new budget \nauthority.\n  It extends an important hand of friendship and support to our \nneighbors in Central America, and a closer partner in the Middle East \nPeace Process, Jordan.\n  Mr. President, it is our goal to complete this bill by Friday, no \nlater than 11 a.m.\n  I yield for my good friend from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations and Rescissions Bill for Fiscal Year 1999, as reported \nby the committee, recommends appropriations which total some $1.9 \nbillion, of which approximately $1.6 billion is designated as emergency \nspending pursuant to Section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n  Very importantly, in Title I of the bill, the Committee unanimously \napproved provisions that I included to establish the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program. This initiative is designed to respond to \nrecord levels of foreign steel imports that have been illegally dumped \nin U.S. markets. As a result of these imports, more than 10,000 \nAmerican jobs have been lost, and the United Steelworkers of America \nestimates that another 100,000 jobs are in peril nationwide. In my home \nstate of West Virginia, nearly 800 men and women have been laid off \nfrom Weirton Steel. Three domestic producers have already filed for \nbankruptcy, and others are in dire financial straits.\n  If the U.S. steel industry goes under, not only will there be lost \njobs, but there will also be lost communities; the domestic industrial \nbase that underpins our security will be irreparably weakened; and the \nnation's defense readiness will be diminished.\n  This initiative, cosponsored in Committee by Senators Specter, \nDurbin, Shelby, and Hollings, would create a revolving fund to give \ndomestic steelmakers a sorely needed infusion of capital. The program, \nwhich is fully compliant with international trade laws, would give \ncash-strapped companies access to the funding they may need to keep \ntheir furnaces burning and keep workers on the job until proper trade \nmechanisms can be implemented to end this crisis. The loan guarantees \nwould help to bolster the financial security of a threatened industry \nthat is critical to this nation's economic base and domestic security.\n  Specifically, the guaranteed loan program would provide qualified \nU.S. steel producers with access to a two-year, $1 billion revolving \nguaranteed loan fund. The minimum loan that would be guaranteed for a \nsingle company at any one time would be $25 million, and the aggregate \namount of loans that would be guaranteed for a single company over the \nduration of the program would be $250 million. A board, to be chaired \nby the Secretary of Commerce, would oversee the program and would have \nflexibility to determine the specific requirements for awarding the \nguaranteed loans. The Act protects taxpayers by requiring that a \nreasonable assurance for the repayment of the loans exists, and that \nthe loans would bear market interest rates.\n\n  Finally, in Title I, the committee increased FEMA's emergency \ndisaster assistance funding by $313.6 million, while at the same time \nreducing a like amount from HUD's Community Development Block Grant \nemergency funding. The VA/HUD Subcommittee was concerned over HUD's \nfailure to implement an effective emergency disaster relief program. \nThe committee felt that FEMA could more appropriately respond to unmet \ndisaster needs throughout the nation.\n  Title II of the bill contains a number of appropriations for regular \nsupplemental budget requests of the administration, including: NOAA \noperations research and facilities activities, $3,900,000; Salaries and \nExpenses of the\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nSupreme Court, $921,000; Bureau of Indian Affairs, $1,136,000; Office \nof the Special Trustee for American Indians, $6,800,000; Corporation \nfor Public Broadcasting, $18,000,000; and Military Construction for the \nArmy National Guard, $11,300,000.\n  For each of these regular supplementals, offsets have been included \nin the bill.\n  Title II also provides non-emergency supplemental appropriations of \n$210 million for the Department of Defense to reimburse the DOD for its \nassistance in Central America, as well as $80 million in non-emergency \nappropriations for the salaries and expenses of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to cover increased costs of handling the large \ninflux of aliens from Central American countries. Both of these items \nhave been requested by the administration as emergency spending, but \nthe Defense and Commerce/Justice/State Subcommittees chose to fully \noffset these appropriations and to include them in Title II as non-\nemergency spending.\n  I note that Title II also contains a number of general provisions, \none of which, Section 2008, extends the Airport Improvement Program \nwhich under present law, would expire on March 31, 1999. Additionally, \nsection 2011, is a general provision which prohibits the Federal \nGovernment from recouping any of the savings to the Medicaid program \nachieved by the States as a result of their tobacco settlements.\n  Title III of the bill contains rescissions sufficient to offset all \nof the emergency appropriations contained in the bill. It is my \npersonal view that emergency spending for natural disasters and for \nunanticipated military spending, such as the operations in Desert Fox \nand Kosovo, as well as the military's assistance to the disaster \nvictims in Central America need not be offset. In fact, I participated \nin the creation of the provisions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency \nDeficit Control Act, which allow emergency spending to be provided in \norder to respond to natural disasters and other types of emergencies \nwithout having to come up with offsets to pay for those unpredictable \nevents. The emergency designation was negotiated as part of the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990, in large part because the discretionary budget \ncaps established there, and which have remained in place each year \nsince, are very tight. I have never felt that the American people \nshould be required to pay for spending which appropriately qualifies as \nemergency relief under that Budget Enforcement Act. If that is to be \nthe case, we need not have gone to the trouble of adopting the \nemergency provisions I have just described.\n\n  Regarding the specific rescissions proposed in Title III of the bill \nnow before the Senate, I know that a number of Senators have concerns \nabout one or the other of those rescissions. I am certain that the \nconcerns of those Senators will be expressed as the Senate progresses \nwith this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to help the managers of the bill, the \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Stevens, and myself, in expediting \ncompletion of Senate action in time to meet with the other body and \ncomplete conference action on the bill prior to the upcoming Easter \nrecess.\n  I especially commend the work of the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens. For many years, I have worked \nwith the Senator from Alaska. I have always found him to be evenhanded, \ncourteous, congenial, cooperative, and very able in handling the \ndifficult legislation on the floor, in committee and in conference. He \nis my friend, has been my friend through the years, and will always be \nmy friend. I consider it a great privilege and a honor, indeed, to be \nable to stand by his side and express support for this legislation. I \ncount it a privilege to work with him. He is one of the finest Senators \nwith whom I have ever had the pleasure of serving. I have served with \nalmost 300 Senators in my time here. I say that without any \nreservations. I salute him, believe in him, trust him, and can count \nhim not only as my friend but as a very fine Senator. The people of \nAlaska are to be commended for sending him here and sending him back \nrepeatedly.\n  The assistance provided in this bill to the people of this country, \nas well as those in Central America, is desperately needed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I was looking around \nto see who he was talking about when he was talking about that kind, \nbenevolent and calm fellow, but I do thank you for your courtesy and \nkindness. It is a pleasure to work with you. Mr. President, I studied \nunder Senator Byrd so long I think I imitate his ways. I have tried to \nanyway.\n  Mr. President, it is now time to have an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. It is my hope, and I want to \nannounce to the Senate it is my hope, we will get an agreement tomorrow \nthat will require amendments to this bill to be filed no later than 5 \no'clock. We don't have that agreement yet. It has not been cleared. But \nif we are to finish this bill and get it ready to go immediately to the \nHouse after the House passes their bill on Monday, it will be necessary \nto complete this bill on Friday. I am hopeful we will complete it in \ntime to allow those people who have to catch planes to go West, so they \ncan make their schedules.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania. There is a time agreement \nfor tomorrow on this amendment, is my understanding, but there is no \ntime limit this evening. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 77\n\n(Purpose: To permit the Secretary of Health and Human Services to waive \n  recoupment of Federal government medicaid claims to tobacco-related \nState settlements if a State uses a portion of those funds for programs \n to reduce the use of tobacco products, to improve the public health, \n   and to assist in the economic diversification of tobacco farming \n                              communities)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Harkin, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 77.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 35, strike line 13 and all that follows \n     through line 24 on page 36 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 2011. Waiver of Recoupment of Medicaid Tobacco-Related \n     Recoveries If Recoveries Used To Reduce Smoking and Assist in \n     Economic Diversification of Tobacco Farming Communities. (a) \n     Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tobacco products are the foremost preventable health \n     problem facing America today. More than 400,000 individuals \n     die each year as a result of tobacco-induced illness and \n     conditions.\n       (2) Each day 3,000 young individuals become regular \n     smokers. Of these children, 1,000 will die prematurely from a \n     tobacco-related disease.\n       (3) Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership designed \n     to provide to provide health care to citizens with low-\n     income.\n       (4) On average, the Federal Government pays 57 percent of \n     the costs of the medicaid program and no State must pay more \n     than 50 percent of the cost of the program in that State.\n       (5) The comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between \n     manufacturers of tobacco products and States, and the \n     individual State settlements reached with such manufacturers, \n     include claims arising out of the medicaid program.\n       (6) As a matter of law, the Federal Government is not \n     permitted to act as a plaintiff in medicaid recoupment cases.\n       (7) Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396b(d)) specifically requires that the State reimburse the \n     Federal Government for its pro rata share of medicaid-related \n     expenses that are recovered from liability cases involving \n     third parties.\n       (8) In the comprehensive tobacco settlement, the tobacco \n     companies were released from all relevant claims that can be \n     made against them subsequently by the States, thereby \n     effectively precluding the Federal Government from recovering \n     its share of medicaid claims in the future through the \n     established statutory mechanism.\n       (9) The Federal Government has both the right and \n     responsibility to ensure that the Federal share of the \n     comprehensive tobacco settlement is used to reduce youth \n     smoking, to improve the public health, and to assist in the \n     economic diversification of tobacco farming communities.\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\n       (b) Amendment to Social Security Act.--Section 1903(d)(3) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(d)(3)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply \n     to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the \n     comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between \n     manufacturers of tobacco products (as defined in section \n     5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and States, or \n     as part of any individual State settlement or judgment \n     reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against \n     one or more such manufacturers, if (and to the extent that) \n     the Secretary finds that following conditions are met:\n       ``(i) The Governor or Chief Executive Officer of the State \n     has filed with the Secretary a plan which specifically \n     outlines how--\n       ``(I) at least 20 percent of such amounts recovered or paid \n     in any fiscal year will be spent on programs to reduce the \n     use of tobacco products using methods that have been shown to \n     be effective, such as tobacco use cessation programs, \n     enforcement of laws relating to tobacco products, community-\n     based programs to discourage the use of tobacco products, \n     school-based and child-oriented education programs to \n     discourage the use of tobacco products, and State-wide \n     awareness and counter-marketing advertising efforts to \n     educate people about the dangers of using tobacco products, \n     and for ongoing evaluations of these programs; and\n       ``(II) at least 30 percent of such amounts recovered or \n     paid in any fiscal year will be spent--\n       ``(aa) on Federally or State funded health or public health \n     programs; or\n       ``(bb) to assist in economic development efforts designed \n     to aid tobacco farmers and tobacco-producing communities as \n     they transition to a more broadly diversified economy.\n       ``(ii) All programs conducted under clause (i) take into \n     account the needs of minority populations and other high risk \n     groups who have a greater threat of exposure to tobacco \n     products and advertising.\n       ``(iii) All amounts spent under clause (i) are spent only \n     in a manner that supplements (and does not supplant) funds \n     previously being spent by the State (or local governments in \n     the State) for such or similar programs or activities.\n       ``(iv) Before the beginning of each fiscal year, the \n     Governor or Chief Executive Officer of the State files with \n     the Secretary a report which details how the amounts so \n     recovered or paid have been spent consistent with the plan \n     described in clause (i) and the requirements of clauses (ii) \n     and (iii).''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     apply to amounts recovered or paid to a State before, on, or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. It is my \nunderstanding that the unanimous consent agreement provides for \nargument, debate this afternoon, and then 90 minutes equally divided \ntomorrow morning, between 9:30 and 11?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So, whatever time is used this afternoon does not count \nagainst the 90 minutes which will be equally divided tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 90 minutes tomorrow.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to require that the \nStates allocate a portion of the funds recovered under the tobacco \nsettlement for purposes relating to tobacco--smoking cessation \neducation for children, 20 percent; and some 30 percent to be allocated \nfor public health matters.\n  The origin of this issue arose when there was a settlement in \nNovember of last year where 46 States agreed to accept $206 billion \nover 25 years. The settlement grew out of lawsuits that primarily \nsought the recovery of Medicaid costs, although there is a contention \nthat there were some other allegations in the cause of action. The \ncurrent law requires the States to share Medicaid recoveries from third \nparties with the Federal Government. The Federal Government's share of \nMedicaid costs is generally 57 percent, but varies from State to State.\n  Under the existing law, only the States have the authority to bring \nsuits for the recoveries. During the course of the litigation, the \nStates, as I understand the legal documents, released all of the claims \nwhich the Federal Government would have for these Medicaid funds. An \namendment to the appropriations bill was offered by the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, to provide that all of the funds \nwould be paid over to the States, specifically prohibiting the Federal \nGovernment's recoupment of funds recovered by States from the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  At the appropriations markup, some concerns were expressed by this \nSenator and by others. On Monday of this week, March 15, we held a \nhearing, participated in by Senator Hutchison and myself, where we \nheard from the Governor of Kentucky and the attorneys general of \nPennsylvania, Texas, and Iowa. At that time, the assertion was made by \nthe Governor and the three attorneys general that all of these funds \nshould be retained by the States, and a representation made that there \nwere other claims involved in the settlement besides Medicaid funds.\n  Senator Harkin and I worked together to craft the amendment which is \nnow before the Senate, joined, as I noted, by Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy; Senator Harkin and I taking the lead because of our \npositions as chairman and ranking member of the appropriations \nsubcommittee having jurisdiction over the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  It is a fact that we are very limited in the funding which is \navailable for health care. Our subcommittee has a budget which has to \nbe divided among education matters and also the Department of Labor, \nwhich implicates many issues of worker safety, so that every dollar is \nof vital importance and we must make an application to purposes of \nhealth care.\n  The problem of tobacco in America is well recognized and the \nstatistics are really very, very stark. Some 400,000 people die each \nyear from tobacco-related illnesses. Approximately 5 million Americans \nunder 18 are projected to die from smoking if the current trend \ncontinues. Some $72 billion a year constitute the health care \nexpenditures in the United States on tobacco-related illnesses; some \n$7.3 billion annually total Medicaid payments directly related to \ntobacco, and between $1.4 and $4 billion constitute expenditures for \ninfant health and developmental problems caused by mothers who smoke. \nIt is a matter of overwhelming importance.\n  There is a very pervasive mantra in America today that the Federal \nGovernment should not dictate to the States how the funds are to be \nused. In accordance with the principles of federalism, I believe in \nleaving as much control as is possible to the State governments and \nalso to local governments, as they carry out their responsibilities.\n  But when you have a very major settlement involving $206 billion and \nwhere the Federal Government has a very strong claim to 57 percent of \nthose monies and the existing law provides that an allocation shall be \ndetermined by the discretion of the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, it is my view that it is preeminently reasonable to ask \nStates to make a commitment to spend at least a portion of these \nfunds--50 percent, I think, would be a reasonable sum--on matters which \nare related to tobacco. The cause of the damages involves tobacco, and \nthat is why we are asking that 50 percent be allocated, as we have \nsaid--20 percent for smokers cessation and education; and 30 percent \nfor public health programs.\n  We do not propose an elaborate series of regulations, we do not \npropose micromanaging in any way what the States will be doing, but \nrequire only a certification from the States. We have already seen \nannouncements from officials in a number of States on plans to spend \nthese monies for other purposes; for example, for highways. Highways \nare very important. States would have latitude to spend part of the \nmoney for highways, but certainly should not have unfettered discretion \nto spend the total sum of the money on highways. Other funds are \nproposed to be spent for mental health services--here again, a very, \nvery important item. Perhaps some of the mental health services are \nreasonably related to tobacco causes. That contention can be made and \nmay well be honored.\n  Another State official is talking about eliminating the State debt, \nwhich is certainly a worthwhile matter. Again, 100 percent of the funds \nought not be used for that purpose, nonrelated to tobacco. Other \nproposals are to increase teacher pay. Perhaps some of that is \nallocable for drug education. In another State, the officials propose \nusing the funds to finance tax relief. That, again, is a worthwhile \nobjective, but there ought to be some assurance that on a matter like \nthis, some of the funds ought to be used for tobacco-related purposes.\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\n  Other States propose scholarships, which may be related, if the \neducational portion is to be assigned to tobacco-related education. We \nsee that in the very short term, there are a great many purposes where \nthe States have a need for funds where they would like to have \nunfettered discretion. In a perfect world, we would like to see them \nhave $206 billion. But with a very, very substantial Federal claim, \nthere ought to be at least some allocation for public health, which we \nare proposing in this amendment.\n  If this legislation is not enacted, it is possible that there could \nbe very bitter, protracted, and expensive litigation, with the Federal \nGovernment asserting its claim under existing law, which could take a \ngreat deal of time. The Governor of Kentucky and three attorneys \ngeneral who testified on Monday at the hearing and I agreed that we \nought to try to resolve the matter so they would know what is going to \nhappen and their planning would be firm. This, we think, is a \npreeminently reasonable approach to a very, very difficult issue.\n  I am joining with my colleagues, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Jim \nJeffords, and Senator Kennedy in introducing an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1999 supplemental appropriations bill concerning the State tobacco \nsettlements. In November 1998, 46 States agreed to a settlement with \nthe tobacco industry that totals $206 billion over 25 years. If focused \nin the right direction, these settlement funds could serve as a \nsignificant resource for improving the quality of life in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Each year, the total health care expenditures in the USA directly \nrelated to smoking is $72 billion. $7.3 billion is spent by Medicaid \nfor smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases claim an \nestimated 430,700 American lives each year. Despite all of what we know \nabout the consequences of smoking, it is estimated that every day 3,000 \nyoung people become regular smokers and it is believed that \napproximately 89 percent of smokers begin to smoke by or at the age of \n18. And finally, it is reported that cigarette smoking kills more \nAmericans than AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, violence, illegal drug \nuse, and fires combined.\n  On March 15, 1999, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing to discuss the \nState tobacco settlements. We heard from the National Governors' \nAssociation, States' Attorneys General, a teen smoking prevention \nadvocacy group, and the Deputy Administrator of the Health Care \nFinancing Administration to review the policy implications of how the \ntobacco settlement funds will be used and whether the Federal \nGovernment should receive a share of these funds for programs to reduce \nthe use of tobacco products as well as programs for the public health.\n  Michael Hash, Deputy Director of the HCFA, testified that the \ncomprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of \ntobacco products and States, and the individual State settlements \nreached with these manufacturers, included claims arising out of the \nMedicaid program. Mr. Hash explained that as a matter of law, the \nFederal Government is not permitted to act as a plaintiff in Medicaid \nrecoupment cases. 42 U.S.C. section 1396a provides that ``the State or \nlocal agency administering such plan will take all responsible measures \nto ascertain the legal liability of third parties . . . to pay for care \nand services available under the plan. . . .'' The statute further \ngives the State the authority to ``pursue claims against such third \nparties.'' The Department of Justice, in interpreting this statute, has \ndetermined that the State has the sole power to take action against \nthird parties, and that the Federal Government has no authority to take \nthis action. During his testimony, Deputy Director Hash further \nexplained that Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act specifically \nrequires that the State reimburse the Federal Government for its pro \nrata share of Medicaid-related expenses that is recovered from \nliability cases involving third parties.\n  In a letter addressed to me dated March 15, 1999, Secretary Shalala \nexpressed the Administration's strong opposition to the provision \napproved by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the FY 1999 \nsupplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from recouping its share of the Medicaid funds from the \nsettlement with the tobacco companies. She noted that ``by releasing \nthe tobacco companies from all relevant claims that can be made against \nthem subsequently by the states, the settlement effectively precludes \nthe federal government from recovering its share of Medicaid claims in \nthe future through the established statutory mechanism.'' Specifically, \nin section XII of the Master Settlement Agreement, the States and \ntobacco companies agreed to the following:\n\n       Under the occurrence of State-Specific Finality in a \n     Settling State, such Settling State shall absolutely and \n     unconditionally release and forever discharge all Released \n     Parties from all Released Claims that the Releasing Parties \n     directly, indirectly, derivatively or in any other capacity \n     ever had, now have, or hereafter can, shall or may have.\n\n  During the hearing, we also heard from representatives of the states. \nGovernor Paul Patton of Kentucky and Attorney Generals' Mike Fisher of \nPennsylvania, John Cornyn of Texas and Tom Miller of Iowa argued that \nbecause the states took the risk and burden of the tobacco lawsuits on \ntheir own, they are entitled to all of the tobacco funds.\n  While I agree with the Governor and Attorney Generals' that the \nFederal Government should not micromanage the use of the funds, I am \nnot prepared to turn all of this money over to the states carte blanche \nto use on matters unrelated to tobacco. Several of my colleagues have \nproposed creating a bureaucratic system that would strictly dictate how \nthe states must spend the tobacco funds. I do not think this is a wise \napproach. However, I think it is entirely appropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to set general standards to ensure that the federal share of \nthe tobacco funds is spent to advance the public health.\n  Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership designed to provide \nhealth care to citizens with low-income. On average, the Federal \nGovernment pays 57 percent of the costs of the Medicaid program, and no \nState must pay more than 50 percent of the cost of the program in that \nState. The Federal government has both the right and the responsibility \nto ensure that the federal share of the comprehensive tobacco \nsettlement is used to reduce youth smoking, to improve the public \nhealth and to assist in the economic diversification of tobacco farming \ncommunities.\n  The amendment that I am introducing today would require states to use \nat least 20% of the total funds received in the settlement for tobacco \nreduction and education programs. Further, my amendment would require \nstates to use at least 30% of the total funds received in the \nsettlement for public health programs or to assist tobacco farmers. The \namendment contains a provision that these funds must supplement and not \nsupplant funds already being spent on similar activities in the State. \nFinally, in order to ensure that we do not create an unnecessary \nbureaucracy to implement this program, each Governor would merely have \nto certify to the Secretary of HHS each year how the funds have been \nused.\n  It is vital that we act now to ensure that these funds are used to \nprotect public health. During the discussion which is currently \noccurring in the states on how to use the tobacco funds, a wide variety \nof uses have been proposed. Specifically, I understand that states have \nplans to spend funds on roads, mental health services, to assist \ntobacco farmers, and to eliminate the State debt, increase teacher pay, \nother proposed uses include financing tax relief, and using these \nrevenues to fund a new Merit Award Trust Fund. While all of these goals \nmay be noble, I am convinced that states, who sued tobacco companies to \nreimburse state health costs as a result of smoking, have a fiduciary \nduty to use these funds to reduce smoking and to support public health.\n  The Federal Government has both the right and the responsibility to \nensure that the federal share of the comprehensive tobacco settlement \nis used to reduce youth smoking, to improve the public health and to \nassist in the economic diversification of tobacco farming communities. \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a March 15, 1999, letter from \nSecretary Shalala.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Secretary of Health\n\n\n                                           And Human Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, \n         Education and Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's strong opposition to the provision approved \n     by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the FY 1999 \n     supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit the \n     federal government from recouping its share of Medicaid funds \n     included in the states' recent settlement with the tobacco \n     companies. The Administration is eager to work with the \n     Congress and the states on an alternative approach that \n     ensures that these funds are used to reduce youth smoking and \n     for other shared state and national priorities.\n       Under the amendment approved by the committee, states would \n     not have to spend a single penny of tobacco settlement funds \n     to reduce youth smoking. The amendment also would have the \n     practical effect of foreclosing any effort by the federal \n     government to recoup tobacco-related Medicaid expenditures in \n     the future, without any significant review and scrutiny of \n     this important matter by the appropriate congressional \n     authorizing committees.\n       Section 1903 (d) of the Social Security Act specifically \n     requires that the states reimburse the federal government for \n     its pro-rata share of Medicaid-related expenses that are \n     recovered from liability cases involving third parties. The \n     federal share of Medicaid expenses ranges from 50 percent to \n     77 percent, depending on the state. States routinely report \n     third-party liability recoveries as required by law. In 1998, \n     for example, states recovered some $642 million from third-\n     party claims; the federal share of these recoveries was $400 \n     million. Over the last five years, federal taxpayers recouped \n     over $1.5 billion from such third-party recoveries.\n       Despite recent arguments by those who would cede the \n     federal share, there is considerable evidence that the state \n     suits and their recoveries were very much based in Medicaid. \n     In fact, in 1997, the states of Florida, Louisiana and \n     Massachusetts reported the settlement with the Liggett \n     Corporation as a third-party Medicaid recovery, and a portion \n     of that settlement was recouped as the federal share.\n       Some also have argued that the states are entitled to reap \n     all the rewards of their litigation against the tobacco \n     industry and that the federal government can always sue in \n     the future to recover its share of Medicaid claims. This \n     argument contradicts the law and the terms of the recent \n     state settlement. As a matter of law, the federal government \n     is not permitted to act as a plaintiff in Medicaid recoupment \n     cases and was bound by law to await the states' recovery of \n     both the state and federal shares of Medicaid claims. \n     Further, by releasing the tobacco companies from all relevant \n     claims that can be made against them subsequently by the \n     states, the settlement effectively precludes the federal \n     government from recovering its share of Medicaid claims in \n     the future through the established statutory mechanism. The \n     amendment included in the Senate supplemental appropriations \n     bill will foreclose the one opportunity we have under current \n     law to recover a portion of the billions of dollars that \n     federal taxpayers have paid to treat tobacco-related illness \n     through the Medicaid program.\n       The President has made very clear the Administration's \n     desire to work with Congress and the states to enact \n     legislation that resolves the federal claim in exchange for a \n     commitment by the states to use that portion of the \n     settlement for shared priorities which reduce youth smoking, \n     protect tobacco farmers, assist children and promote public \n     health. I would urge you to oppose efforts to relinquish the \n     legitimate federal claim to settlement funds until this \n     important goal has been achieved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I note the presence of my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, on the floor. I yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I want to commend and \ncongratulate Senator Specter, my chairman, for taking the lead on this \nissue, for holding the hearings, doing all the work that is necessary \nto get the information that we need to come up with this amendment. \nSenator Specter has certainly been the lead in addressing this very \nvital issue of health in the United States, medical research, and all \nthat goes along with making our people healthier citizens.\n  He has always taken a lead on this one issue of how we get tobacco \nuse down among teenagers, which is one of the most serious health risks \nin our society today. I want to thank Senator Specter for taking the \nlead on this amendment. It is a very, very, very important amendment. \nThe repercussions of this single amendment alone could do more to \nenhance the health of our young people in the future than perhaps \nanything we are going to do this year. I will get into more about that \nlater, but this single amendment, if adopted, I maintain, will do more \nto enhance the well-being and health of our future citizens--the kids \ntoday--10, 15, 20 years from now, 30 years from now, than anything that \nwe will do this year.\n  Why do I say that? Look at this chart. This really illustrates what \nis happening today and continuing to happen with the consumption of \ntobacco. Tobacco kills more Americans than alcohol, car accidents, \nsuicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs and fires, all combined. I use \nthis chart a lot because I think it just spells it out in stark detail. \nAdd up everything from alcohol to homicides to AIDS and illegal drugs. \nHow much money do we spend every year fighting illegal drugs? Compare \nit to how many people die of tobacco-related illnesses. It is minute.\n  This is what we are going after--cutting down the illnesses and \ndeaths caused by tobacco uses in this country. It is an epidemic. \nTobacco also imposes a heavy financial cost, $50 billion a year \nestimated in health costs alone. And a big portion of that is borne by \nFederal taxpayers, who, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, \npay over half the cost of Medicaid. The average, as he said, is 57 \npercent. Sometimes it goes as high as 77 percent. In no case is it less \nthan 50 percent of the Federal taxes used to fund the Medicaid programs \nin the States.\n  I want to commend the States for their efforts to recover the costs \nthat they and the Federal Government have borne related to tobacco. \nWhat our amendment does, as the Senator from Pennsylvania very \ncorrectly pointed out, is simply require the States to use 20 percent \nof the total settlement on reducing tobacco use, mainly going after \nteen smoking, because if we know we can get it there, we solve the \nproblem, but just to use 20 percent of that and 30 percent for public \nhealth programs--again, public health broadly; we did not spell it out, \nwe did not try to micromanage--or for tobacco farmer assistance, to \nhelp some of the tobacco farmers in some of our States in their \ntransition away from growing tobacco to doing something else.\n\n  Again, our amendment did not in any way dictate specific programs the \nstates can spend the money on. It did not require the Federal \nGovernment have a role in designing any initiative the states \nundertake. This amendment simply sets broad, commonsense parameters on \na portion of the funds.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Federal share \nof the State's tobacco settlement would total $14 billion over the next \n5 years. That is a lot of money, $14 billion.\n  I know there are some who are saying that the Federal Government had \nno role in these lawsuits; therefore, no right to these funds. I heard \nthat argument made in the committee when the amendment was adopted. \nThat is not true. If it were true, we would not be here today.\n  Keep in mind that Medicaid is a Federal-State partnership. The \nFederal Government pays over 50 percent of the cost of each State's \nMedicaid Program. But here is the real clincher. Under the Social \nSecurity Act, it is the responsibility of the States to recover any \ncosts caused by third parties. In fact, the law says that only the \nStates can file such suits.\n  It is really kind of, I think, shading the truth a little bit to say \nthe Federal Government was not involved in the lawsuits. The Federal \nGovernment could not be involved in the lawsuits. By law, only the \nStates can file such suits. Then the Medicaid law requires a State to \nturn back to the Federal Government its share of any money the State \nrecovers. That is the law.\n  A, the Social Security Act says it is the responsibility of the \nStates to recover any costs caused by third parties.\n  B, the law says only the States can file such lawsuits.\n  C, Medicaid law says the States then have to turn back to the Federal \nGovernment its share of any Federal money that they recover.\n  All right. What happened? The States settled this case with the \ntobacco companies, and in November of 1998, when\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\nthe States settled this case, even those that did not include a \nMedicaid claim in their suit, waived their right to any future claims \nunder Medicaid.\n  Think about that. If the States, in conjunction with the tobacco \ncompanies--and I have to hand it to the tobacco companies, they have \ngreat lawyers; they have the best--they negotiated with the States that \nif you settle for $206 billion over 25 years, we will agree to that if \nyou waive your right to any future claims under Medicaid.\n  The States said, ``We waive our rights.'' By waiving their rights, \nthey waive our rights, the Federal Government's rights, to go out and \nreclaim any of those Federal tax dollars that went out. So the States \nhave, by using the law, precluded us on the Federal end from reclaiming \nany of these moneys.\n  It is just not right. Federal taxpayers have provided over 50 percent \nof those Medicaid payments to those States. As I said, the law requires \nthe States to file those lawsuits and only the States can file those \nlawsuits. The States then must, under the law, return those funds to \nthe Federal Government. Yet, they made an agreement with the tobacco \ncompanies to waive all of their rights and, thus, waiving our rights.\n  Turning over all of the Federal share of the tobacco settlement to \nthe States without any requirement that a penny of the funds be used to \nreduce teen smoking defies common sense. The whole purpose of this \neffort was to protect our kids and to cut down on smoking. Now that the \nStates have settled with the tobacco companies, it only makes sense to \nuse some of those moneys to strengthen the public health system and to \nfight tobacco use.\n  As the Senator from Pennsylvania said, I have to ask the questions: \nDid the States file their lawsuits against the tobacco companies \nbecause the tobacco companies were not building highways in their \nStates?\n\n  Did the States file a lawsuit against the tobacco companies because \nthey were not building enough prisons in their States?\n  Did the States file the lawsuit against the tobacco companies because \nyou, tobacco companies, were not building a sports arena in our State?\n  Did they file the lawsuit because you, tobacco companies, were not \nbuilding enough highways in our State?\n  No, that was not the basis of the lawsuit. The basis of the lawsuit \nwas the health impact on its citizens from smoking.\n  Now we hear from the States, oh, now they want to use the money for \nhighways, they want to use the money to build some prisons, they want \nto use the money to build a sports arena, they want to use the money \nfor tax relief, and on and on and on and on. That was not the basis for \nthe lawsuits.\n  The basis for the lawsuits were to recoup the costs that Medicaid \nspent taking care of the health impacts of smoking on our people. It \nhad nothing to do with paving a highway or building a prison or \nanything else.\n  Again, we are not even saying that the States have to use their money \nfor that. If the States want to use their share of the money to build a \nprison, that is their business. I can tell you, if I were a citizen of \na State, and our State legislature and Governor were spending money \nthat way, I would be vocal about it in my State, and I assume other \npeople would be in their States. But that is not for us here at the \nFederal level. It is for us at the Federal level to say how about the \nFederal portion. What should you do with that? Should we be allowed to \nbuild highways with it when the basis of the lawsuit had to do with the \nhealth impact and the deaths of people that we paid for on Medicaid to \ntake care of them because they got hooked on tobacco, because they were \nlied to by the tobacco companies?\n  All we are saying is that the Federal share be used to attack tobacco \nuse and to protect the public health. How much are we saying? Fifty \npercent: 20 percent to reduce teen smoking, 30 percent for a broad \nvariety of public health programs to reduce smoking or to assist \nfarmers, to assist the tobacco farmers.\n  No State receives less than 50 percent of its Medicaid money from the \nFederal Government. Some States receive as high as 77 percent. The \naverage is 57 percent. So actually we are being somewhat generous in \nthis amendment. We are not saying you have to spend even all of your \nFederal moneys.\n  Some States are going to get a windfall. Those States that are \ngetting 70 percent of their Medicaid moneys paid for by the Federal \nGovernment, if our amendment is adopted, will have at least 20 percent \nof that Federal money that they can use as they see fit. Rather than \ntrying to draw the line in each State, we just settled on the 50 \npercent and said that is fair for everybody. It gives some States, I \nwill admit, a bit of a windfall. Again, it does not take away from any \nState any more than the Federal shares that they already get.\n  Mr. President, this is a bipartisan, commonsense amendment. I hope \nall of our colleagues can support it. It will be a dramatic step \nforward in saving lives and protecting children and saving billions of \ndollars in future health care costs.\n  I know you are going to hear talk about how all the Governors support \nthe Hutchison amendment that was added in committee. By the way, it \nshould not even be on this bill. It should be in the Finance Committee. \nAll the Governors support it. I said to myself, ``If I was Governor, I \nprobably would support it, too.'' But I am not a Governor.\n  I represent my State, but we all have to represent the national \ninterest here. More than that, we have to represent the interest of \nthose people who are getting hooked on tobacco and what this tobacco \nlawsuit was all about. So I think we ought to keep that in mind as the \ndebate goes forward. I know we will hear some more this evening, but \ntomorrow morning we will have more debate on the amendment and we will \nhave more to say at that time.\n\n  Again, what we have to keep in mind is the basic underlying fact: Why \nwas the lawsuit brought? On what basis? On the health basis, Medicare \nexpenditures to pay for the sickness and illness and death of people. \nWho put the money into Medicaid? The Federal Government, 57 percent \naverage; States, 43 percent average.\n  Law requires the States to file the lawsuits. Law requires the States \nto return to the Federal Government the Federal Government share of \nthose lawsuits.\n  Law--only the States can file those lawsuits.\n  Settlement facts--States settle with the tobacco companies and strike \na sweetheart deal, where they waive all of our rights to ever sue again \nunder Medicaid to recoup those costs--waive our rights. Think about \nthat. That is why this amendment is so important, Mr. President. If \nthis amendment is adopted, it will have a big impact on cutting down on \nhealth care costs in the future. That is what it is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the plan of the \nSenator from Iowa to mandate to the States how they will spend the \nmoney they won in litigation against tobacco companies. It went on for \nquite a number of years. The State attorneys general gradually, through \nvarious different theories of law--and there were lots of different \ntheories--won those lawsuits and achieved a tremendous settlement. \nBasically, the tobacco companies, at some point, just capitulated and \nagreed to pay billions of dollars.\n\n  At this point, the Federal Government may or may not have a claim \nupon that money. Senator Hutchison of Texas has introduced legislation, \nwhich I intend to support, which would say that that money would stay \nwith the States. They won it in the litigation. It is part of their \nsettlements. They should keep it. And the Federal Government is not \nclaiming it.\n  I understand the Senator's idea--and I know he has the highest \nmotives behind it--is to tell the States how they should spend portions \nof that money, primarily under the theory that it was Medicaid money, \nand the Federal Government put money into Medicaid, a big chunk of the \nmoney is paid by the Federal Government for Medicaid. But let me just \nsay why I think we would be better off not doing that.\n  First of all, in all the settlements, as I understand it, only one \nsettlement, Florida's, mentions Medicaid. A large number of the cases \nmentioned Medicaid in their lawsuits, but a lot of\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nthem were based on other causes of action against the tobacco \ncompanies: RICO, the racketeering charges; antitrust violations--unjust \nenrichment was the one in Mississippi, which I thought was astounding, \nto win several billion dollars on the old common law theory, equity \ntheory, of unjust enrichment. In fact, they filed it in an equity court \nand did not even have a jury trial. They eventually settled it without \neven a trial occurring.\n  But at any rate, that money goes to the States, and it is their \nmoney. I suggest that the States already are planning how to spend it. \nI understand in Texas, according to Senator Hutchison, who will be back \non the floor shortly, they have antismoking educational campaigns \nplanned.\n  Alabama has, I believe, a good program. It is called Children First. \nIt is a program to deal with dropouts, to deal with teen smoking and \ndrinking and drug abuse and problem kids, preschool programs, a \ncomprehensive plan to deal with juvenile crime and violence and \ndelinquency, and to help place children first. The funding for it will \ncome from the settlement of this lawsuit. They are counting on doing \nthat.\n  To mandate them to spend it on entirely a new set of proposals they \nhave never given any thought to would complicate Alabama's freedom to \nspend the money they won the way they want to spend it. I really \nbelieve it would be a terrible burden on the State of Alabama. I think \nthat is going to be true in every State where these settlements have \ntaken place.\n  So what we have is the Federal Government saying, ``If we can't have \nthe money, and if we're going to lose on this amendment''--and Senator \nHutchison has bipartisan support for it, and I am confident it will \npass--``if we're going to lose on this amendment, if we don't get to \nbring it into our Treasury so we can spend it and do what we want to do \nwith it, we'll just declare how the States have to spend it. By the \nway, if you don't satisfy us, the Secretary of HHS, Secretary Shalala, \ncan cut off your Medicaid funding or deny you benefits under these \nsettlements in the future.''\n  So I just believe that that isn't what we need to be doing here. I do \nnot think that is good public policy. I believe that these States are \nalready at this moment planning how to spend it.\n  And, by the way, these mandates are not easily \nachievable. Presumably, a State, to get money under it, would have to \ncall a special session of their legislature--have to call a special \nsession. And what if they did not want to vote to do that? What if good \nand decent State legislators said: We don't want to do these \npercentages that the Senator has just proposed. We don't want to spend \nour money just like that. We would like to spend it on Children First. \nWe would like to spend it on delinquency camps or alternative schools. \nWe want to do it on various other projects that are not precisely what \nis mandated here. Maybe they are already spending money on programs \nmandated here.\n\n  I salute the Senator from Texas. I believe she has the right \napproach. We need to let this money go, give it up. We did not file the \nlawsuits; the States filed the lawsuits. We did not win the lawsuits; \nthe States won the lawsuits. The tobacco companies agreed to pay the \nmoney to the States. And they are going to spend it for what they \nbelieve is best for their people. I think we ought to follow that.\n  I want to mention one other thing. I am uncomfortable with this deal \nin which the Secretary of HHS would be able to review the allocation of \nthe funds by the States and given the power to cut off funds to the \nStates if they did not precisely allocate it as this proposal would \nallocate it. I do not think that is the kind of power we need to have \nover the States.\n  I think this is good legislation. The Senator from Texas, I know, \nwill be returning to the floor in just a moment, and she will be making \nfurther comments on it. I thank the Chair for his attention and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator withhold that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have not gone into this argument \nbefore. In the committee, in dealing with this supplemental, I did vote \nfor the Hutchison amendment. I voted for it because I do believe that, \nbecause of the circumstances of this series of settlements coming after \nthe failure of the Congress to pass the tobacco legislation, we should \nnot force the States to turn the money over to the Federal Government \nas required by law.\n  The Social Security Act does provide that--I ask unanimous consent \nthat this section 1903(d)(3) be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Section 1903(D)(3)\n\n       (3) The pro rata share to which the United States is \n     equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the \n     net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any \n     political subdivision thereof with respect to medical \n     assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered \n     an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This section states:\n\n       (3) The pro rata share to which the United States is \n     equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the \n     net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any \n     political subdivision thereof with respect to medical \n     assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered \n     an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.\n\n  Clearly, that has required other States to make payments to the \nFederal Government to restore the amounts of money that were paid under \nthe Federal plans and recovered by State litigation.\n  The difficulty with the position that I understand the Senator has \njust taken, Senator Sessions, is that the States did file their cases, \nbut Section 1902(a)(9)(A) of the Social Security Act says:\n\n     . . . the State or local agency administering such plan will \n     take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability \n     of third parties (including health insurers, group health \n     plans (as defined in section 607(1) of the Employee \n     Retirement Income Security Act. . . .\n\n  And it sets forth the duty of the State to take that action, and \nsince we have assigned that duty to the State, the Federal Government \ncannot take that action.\n  As a consequence, while I believe that Senator Hutchison's amendment \nis correct, that we should not take this money from the States at this \ntime, I do believe that the requirement that the States show that they \nwill spend the money in the way envisioned by the Social Security Act \nis a fair compromise, and it is my intention to support the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Pennsylvania in order to try to see to it \nthat we have that consideration.\n  Failure to do so will exacerbate the future bills that we will \npresent to the Senate which will have to seek money to make the \npayments for the programs that the State will not undertake unless that \nrequirement is there. That money, incidentally, is projected in both \nthe President's budget and in past budgets adopted by the Senate.\n  So if this money stays in the hands of the State, and there is no \nobligation to comply with existing law, we will be in the position \nwhere we will have to come up and find more money--in effect, break the \ncaps on the Health and Human Services bill, which is the bill that is \nnow the largest bill that we will prepare for the Congress this year; \nthe largest bill is no longer Defense, it is the Health and Human \nServices bill.\n  That bill is under severe stress for the future and cannot afford to \nsee this money stay in the State hands and the money be spent in the \nway envisioned by the recovery; really, a recovery for moneys spent by \nthe States using Federal taxpayer's funds in the past. If the State \ndiverts those funds to other endeavors, we will have to make that up in \nfuture appropriations bills, in my judgment.\n  I intend to support the amendment of Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin to require the States to show that they will, in fact, make \nthose payments. As I understand it, it will not take a great deal of \ntrouble on behalf of the States to show that they are doing that. I \nthink many States are doing that.\n  I understand my State has taken the position that they don't like \nSenator Specter's amendment. I sometimes have duties here that are \ncontrary to that of the Governors in terms of trying to see to it that \nfairness is provided as far as the use of funds from the recovery that \ncomes about because of actions such as the States have taken,\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nand my State was one of them--to pursue those who have brought about \nthe great expenditures for health care that we had to face because of \nthe scourge of excessive smoking.\n  I do believe that this amendment is on the right track. I intend to \nvote for it. I put my friends on notice that I do not believe that it \nis inconsistent with the position of supporting the Hutchison amendment \nin the first place, because I think the States should retain the money \nand the States should make the plan of how the money should be spent. \nThe power of the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to approve \nthat plan, not to dictate how it is to be spent.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we will have time tomorrow to speak on \nthe amendment by Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, but I think it is \nimportant that we understand what we are talking about. The Federal \nGovernment had nothing to do with the lawsuits that were brought by the \nStates. In fact, the States asked for Federal help. They asked for \nFederal guidance, and they got none.\n  It was only after the States had settled with the tobacco companies \nand all States were covered that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration decided that these suits were based on Medicaid and, \ntherefore, the Federal Government should be able to take the average of \nthe Medicaid expenditures from the States from these tobacco \nsettlements. It came up with a figure of 57 percent. They are relying \non the part of the law that says the States are responsible for \nrecovering Medicaid overpayments or mistakes in billing; or if a person \nis covered with private insurance and they get Medicaid coverage, the \nStates would go after the private insurance companies to pay these \nMedicaid costs.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration is using that law to say \nthat the tobacco settlement should be covered for Medicaid, and they \nare coming in and saying to the States that the tobacco settlement that \nwas made should not be allowed to be kept by the States and, in fact, \nthey want to withhold 57 percent.\n  The amendment that is before the Senate today would take 50 percent \nand tell the States how to spend this money. It doesn't even tell the \nStates that they have to spend it on Medicaid. We are not even now \ntalking about what the Health Care Financing Administration had hoped \nto get in the first place, and that is help on Medicaid payments. They \nare just saying that big brother Federal Government is going to tell \nthe States that they must spend the money on health care or tobacco \ncessation programs or helping tobacco farmers, and they are going to \nallocate 50 percent of the State's money for these purposes.\n  Let's take the State of Ohio as an example. Say that the State of \nOhio has a legislature that meets every other year. They are not in \nsession. All of a sudden we have a Federal mandate that the States \nspend 50 percent of their hard-earned money on these specific program \npurposes and the Secretary of HHS says to the State of Ohio, ``I'm very \nsorry, but your program doesn't meet my standard so I'm going to \nwithhold your Medicaid money.'' The legislature is not in session, the \nprograms are in place. Is the legislature going to have to come into \nspecial session to try to determine how they are going to change the \nprogram to meet this test? They are going to have to because no State \ncan absorb the loss of their Medicaid money, and, most certainly, they \nare not going to leave people on the streets unserved by Medicaid.\n  This is going to be duplicated all over America if this amendment \npasses. Nobody is thinking about what happens after the Federal \nGovernment says, ``This is simple, this is simple. We will say you have \nto spend 20 percent on tobacco cessation and 30 percent on the health-\nrelated or tobacco farmer aid programs.'' They don't say what happens \nafter we pass this broad general guideline. But what happens is, we are \ngoing to have standards, we are going to have regulations, we are going \nto have certifications, and all of a sudden they have what always \nhappens in Washington, and that is we are going to have the Federal \nGovernment encroaching on the States rights with the States' money, \nearned by the States; and we are going to have costly regulations and \nbureaucracy, and then we are going to have crisis after crisis after \ncrisis in States that are not going to meet the test of Health and \nHuman Services Secretaries for 25 years to come, who will be able to \nhold on to the Medicaid money if we don't keep the underlying bill \nintact.\n\n  The underlying bill is very simple. It just says that the Federal \nGovernment will not encroach on the States at all. The States are using \nthis money for very different purposes. Most of the States--in fact, \nalmost all of the States--did not sue on Medicaid, and if your purpose \nis to help Medicaid, this amendment doesn't do it.\n  So I hope that we can keep it simple. I hope that we can allow the \nStates to do what they have sued to recover and achieve their purposes. \nSome States sued on health care. Some States sued on consumer fraud. \nSome States sued for RICO. There were a myriad of causes of action. But \nthe fact of the matter is, it is the States that sued.\n  So I say to the distinguished chairman of the committee, if he wants \nto help Medicaid, this amendment doesn't do it. If he wants to help \nMedicaid, what he needs to do is add another amendment that requires \nthe money go to Medicaid. He thinks that if we pass this amendment, it \nwill keep the State budgets from growing. It won't keep the States' \nbudgets from growing at all in Medicaid costs. What we are talking \nabout here is 20 percent going for tobacco cessation programs and 30 \npercent going for health care or tobacco farmers.\n  So I hope, if the purpose is to give Medicaid money, that we will \nhave a different amendment. The amendment that is before us today will \nbe costly, it will cause more bureaucracy, more regulation, and it will \ncause crises in States if they don't meet the Secretary's test of what \nthe program should be. And this Secretary of Health and Human Services \nwill have a different interpretation, perhaps, than the next Secretary \nof Health and Human Services. So the States are going to fashion a \nprogram that meets Secretary Shalala's needs today, and 2 years from \nnow they are going to have to fashion a new set of programs in order \nnot to have the money jerked out from under their noses when they have \ncounted on this money because their tobacco settlement was made by the \nStates.\n  We have time to talk about this tomorrow. I hope Members will \nconsider the havoc that this would wreak on the States and the fact \nthat it will not help the Federal Government. It is putting a strain on \nthat which has no relationship to the problem that is being alleged. If \nthe problem is that we aren't going to share Medicaid, how are we going \nto help tobacco farmers and meet the Medicaid needs? It is not going to \nwork.\n  This is not an amendment that has been thought through, and we have \nnot thought of what is going to happen 2 years from now, and 4 years \nfrom now, and 6 years from now. I hope that Senators will understand \nthat this will wreak havoc on our States. It is an encroachment on \nStates rights, and it will not help the Federal coffers at all.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that is \nto be offered by Senators Specter and Harkin relative to the tobacco \nsettlement funds and the question of Federal recoupment.\n  First, let me say that I have been involved in the tobacco issue on \nCapitol Hill for almost as long as I have been here. As a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives, I introduced legislation\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nto ban smoking on airplanes, and I have addressed this issue from so \nmany different angles that I believe I have some knowledge on the \nsubject.\n  Having said that, I have to tell you that I stand here in admiration \nof the 42 State attorneys general who had the political courage and \nforesight to file these lawsuits against the tobacco giants in an \neffort to recoup some of the money that had been spent on tobacco-\nrelated disease and death in their States. In my own home State, our \nattorney general, Jim Ryan, was one of those. I have saluted him \nprivately and I do it publicly. I am happy they did this. The money \nthey have recouped is going to be an important resource for the State \nof Illinois and all of the other States.\n  In addition, they have forced the tobacco companies to make some \nmajor changes in the way they sell the product. Perhaps, we will see--I \nhope in the not-too-distant future--a decline in the number of young \npeople who have become addicted to tobacco products. It is truly a \nfrightening statistic to consider the impact on America's public health \nwhen you consider the percentage of high school students, and even \nyounger, who are taking up smoking. But now that we have recovered \nmoney from the tobacco companies, the debate now is how it should be \nspent. I have tried to come up with a reasonable approach to it. I \nsalute my colleagues, Senators Specter and Harkin, for what I consider \nto be a reasonable approach as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be shown as a cosponsor of \nthe Specter-Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Having said that, Mr. President, let me try to explain, \nif I can, the predicament we face. Many of the States that filed \nlawsuits against tobacco companies tried to recover in those lawsuits \nmoneys that had been spent for Medicaid. Medicaid is, of course, health \ninsurance for the poor and disabled. Across the United States, on \naverage, out of every dollar spent on the Medicaid health insurance \nprogram, 57 cents of it comes from Washington, and 43 cents comes from \nthe local State.\n  In my State of Illinois, it is a 50/50 split. But including all \nStates, it is an average of 57 percent coming from the Federal \nGovernment. Now, we send the money to the States and ask them to \nadminister the Medicaid funds. We also say to the States that if there \nare lawsuits to be filed relative to Medicaid, it is your \nresponsibility as a State to do it. They are obligated to recoup any \ncost that they recover in these lawsuits against third parties back to \nthe Federal Government, proportionately based on the Federal \nGovernment's contribution.\n\n  So the suggestion that a State would file a lawsuit against the \ntobacco company claiming expenditures for Medicaid funds and recover, \nand then be asked to send some of that money back to Washington is not \na novice suggestion. It is not radical. It is what happens by normal \ncourse. That is what has happened in the past.\n  But there have been some who have argued that when it comes to the \ntobacco settlement we should suspend that and say that the moneys \nrecovered by the States against the tobacco companies for Medicaid \nexpenditures should belong entirely to the States and not come back to \nthe Federal Government at all. I have a problem with that inasmuch as I \nam concerned about how the money will be spent by the States.\n  Some Senators have come to the floor and said it is really none of \nour business. The States filed the lawsuit; let them spend the money \nthe way they want. I think that is the wrong way to approach this. The \nlawsuits were filed because of a public health problem with tobacco. \nThe money that was recovered--at least a portion of it--is Federal in \nnature. I think it is reasonable for us to say that the money recouped \nfrom these tobacco companies should at least be spent for the public \nhealth purposes of the lawsuit. That is what the Specter-Harkin, and \nnow Durbin, amendment seeks to achieve.\n  I am also concerned, because, as part of their settlement, many of \nthe States relinquished their right to file claims in the future \nagainst tobacco companies for Medicaid expenditures. In other words, \nthey said they would give up the right of the Federal Government to \nrecover funds under Medicaid against tobacco companies in the future. \nThey have, in fact, surrendered a right of the Federal Government. I \nthink that is noteworthy, because it means that, basically having \nsettled these future claims, we have no opportunity to pursue them if \nwe wanted to. The Federal Government has paid, and will continue to \npay, one-half or more of Medicaid costs associated with treating \ntobacco-caused diseases, even though the States have now waived the \nFederal Government's right to any further tobacco-related Medicaid \nrecovery. This further underscores the Federal right to have, if not a \nshare of the settlement proceeds, at least a voice in how they are \nspent.\n  Let me say that the States routinely follow the requirements of the \nMedicaid statutes when it comes to money that they collect.\n  For those who argue that the tobacco suits should be treated somewhat \ndifferently, let me give them some evidence to consider.\n  In March 1996, five States--Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, \nMichigan, and West Virginia--settled a lawsuit with the Liggett tobacco \ncompany. In fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997, the total reported \nto HCFA, the Federal agency, as the Federal share, was $465,359. This \nis the precedent for a Federal claim for the tobacco proceeds.\n  It is important to keep in mind that if we don't recoup this money \nfrom the State in some form, we also create a budget problem on our \nown.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates, for scoring purposes, that \nwe would recover from State tobacco suits $2.9 billion over 5 years and \n$6.8 billion over 10 years. Any legislation that allows the States to \nkeep all the funds is going to require some more on our part to offset \nthis budget priority, this budget assumption.\n\n  Having said that, let me try to address my point of view on what I \nbelieve the Specter-Harkin amendment will achieve.\n  It is less important to me who spends the money from the Tobacco \ncompanies than how it is spent. It is not as important to me that a \nFederal agency achieve the results so much as the results are achieved. \nAnd the results I am seeking are several.\n  First, it reduces the number of young people who are taking up \ntobacco and becoming addicted to it. Ultimately, one out of three die. \nIf we can bring that percentage down by innovative, creative, and \nforceful State programs, that is all the better as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  But I worry about suggestions in the underlying Hutchison amendment \nthat we not be specific in terms of what we ask of the States. I am \nhappy to see that the amendment that has been proposed by Senators \nSpecter and Harkin will try to address this by putting 20 percent of \nthe proceeds into tobacco control to reduce the number of young people \nwho are addicted to the product. I think that is sensible.\n  Second, I think it is reasonable to ask that a portion of the money \nrecovered go toward public health purposes, particularly children's \nhealth programs. And it is my understanding that the Specter-Harkin \namendment does that. It says that another 30 percent will go for those \npurposes.\n  This is consistent with the National Governors' Association, which I \nalready identified, as their priorities at their 1999 winter meeting \nfor the tobacco settlement money. Let me quote from the statement that \nthey released:\n\n       The Nation's Governors are committed to spending a \n     significant portion of the settlement funds on smoking \n     cessation programs, health care education and programs \n     benefiting children.\n\n  The Specter-Harkin-Durbin amendment seeks to follow the \nrecommendations of the National Governors' Association--to say the \nFederal Government will not claim a share of these proceeds so long as \nthey are spent for this purpose, and then to make certain that we are \ndoing something with the money that is consistent with the goals of the \ninitial litigation.\n  It would be troubling to me, and to many others who have been \ninvolved in this battle for a long time, if the net result of the \ntobacco lawsuits by the States should result in a windfall to the State \ntreasuries and are spent on other things that really forget these \nimportant elements, important priorities of smoking cessation, as well \nas children's health care.\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\n  So I will be supporting the amendment being offered by Senators \nSpecter and Harkin.\n  I can tell you that when the American people were asked through a \npoll conducted by the American Heart Association last November, that 74 \npercent of the voters supported at least half of the Medicaid dollars \nto go to tobacco addiction treatment and to efforts to educate teens \nabout the dangers of tobacco.\n  I am hoping that Members on both sides of the aisle will join us in \nthis bipartisan amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  At this point, I yield my time on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2836-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 64, introduced earlier today by \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 64) recognizing the historic \n     significance of the first anniversary of the Good Friday \n     Peace Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Kansas has noted--and, \nMr. President, your tie notes--today is St. Patrick's Day, and it is a \nfitting time to remember not only the Irish heritage, which so many \nAmericans--over 40 million--claim, but also as equally important is the \nsignificant progress that has been made in this island nation over the \nlast several months to finally bring peace. Tributes, of course, could \nbe given to so many different people.\n  Today, we were meeting with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, as well as \nPresident Clinton, and the leaders from Northern Ireland, as well as \nthe Republic of Ireland, celebrating their courage and the fact that \nthey have received the Nobel Peace Prize for their endeavors, and \nreally making certain that we double our resolve so that peace can come \nto that land.\n  The Good Friday Peace Agreement that was entered into and initiated \nabout a year ago outlined the political settlement to three decades of \npolitical and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland. It also reminds \nus, too, that there is a lot of hard work to be done to complete this \nagreement.\n\n  Over the last 30 years, more than 3,200 people have died in Northern \nIreland and thousands more were injured. In 1997, the British and Irish \nGovernments sponsored peace talks, chaired by our former colleague, \nSenator George Mitchell, and attended by eight political parties.\n  Senator Mitchell will be receiving an award this evening at the White \nHouse from the President and representatives of Ireland for his amazing \nrole in bringing about this peace process. It is a much-deserved \naccolade.\n  An agreement was reached on April 10, 1998, that includes the \nformation of a Northern Ireland Assembly, a North/South Ministerial \nCouncil, and a British-Irish Council. The agreement also contains \nprovisions on human rights, decommissioning of weapons, policing, and \nprisoners. Voters in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland \napproved the agreement on May 22. Elections to the new assembly were \nheld on June 25. Enabling legislation has been passed by the Irish and \nBritish Parliaments, the necessary international agreements have been \nsigned, and many prisoners have been released.\n  However, some contentious issues still remain before the agreement is \nimplemented. In addition to former Senator George Mitchell, the Clinton \nadministration and many Members of Congress and Senators have played a \npositive role in the peace process. Again, the parties have turned to \nthe United States for leadership and mediation. Many party leaders from \nNorthern Ireland will be at the White House this evening. Let me also \nsay I attended last night a special tribute to one of our colleagues, \nSenator Ted Kennedy. The American-Ireland Fund presented him with their \nMan of the Year Award for his extraordinary contribution toward this \npeace process throughout his career in the U.S. Senate.\n  This resolution which we are considering today is cosponsored by 34 \nof my colleagues. It recognizes the historic first anniversary of the \nGood Friday peace agreement, encourages the parties to move forward to \nimplement it, and congratulates the people of the Republic of Ireland \nand Northern Ireland for their courageous commitment to work together \nfor peace. I appreciate my colleagues' support of this resolution, and \nI hope it will add another constructive measure of support for the \nmeetings going on at the White House today.\n  I am glad the Senate, when it enacts this resolution, will be on \nrecord this year to not only celebrate the legacy of Ireland and the \nlegacy of St. Patrick, but to look to the future of that great country, \na future in peace, a future as one people.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this timely resolution \nand its tribute to the courage and vision of the political leaders of \nNorthern Ireland who have given that land an extraodinary opportunity \nfor peace.\n  By signing the historic Good Friday Peace Agreement last April, \nleaders such as John Hume, David Trimble, Gerry Adams, and others \nlaunched a new era of peace and reconciliation for all the people of \nNorthern Ireland. And I commend as well the indispensable contributions \nto the peace process by President Clinton, our former Senate colleague \nGeorge Mitchell, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Prime \nMinister Tony Blair of Great Britain.\n  The goal of the peace process is to end thirty years of violence and \nbloodshed in Northern Ireland, reduce divisions between Unionists and \nNationalists, and build new bridges of opportunity between the two \ncommunities. Through this process, they have committed themselves to \nfinding the needle of peace in the haystack of violence--and they are \nfinding it. When those of lesser vision urged a lesser course, the \nleaders in Northern Ireland acted boldly. They tirelessly dedicated \nthemselves to the pursuit of peace, and they made difficult political \nchoices to bring their noble vision of a peace agreement to reality.\n  As we all know, there are still miles to go before the victory of \nlasting peace is finally won. But because of what they accomplished, \nthere is better hope for the future. They have made an enormous \ndifference, perhaps all the difference, for peace. Their achievement in \nthe Good Friday Peace Agreement has changed the course of history for \nall the people in Northern Ireland.\n  The task now facing all of us who care about this process is to build \ngreater momentum for full implementation of the Agreement. There has \nbeen welcome recent progress. Last month, the Northern Ireland Assembly \napproved the designation of the Northern Ireland Departments and the \ngroup of cross-border bodies. Last week, Britain and Ireland signed \nhistoric treaties for closer ties. Prisoners have been released. The \nBritish have reduced their troop levels to the lowest point in twenty \nyears. We are also heartened by the establishment of the Human Rights \nCommissions.\n  Full implementation of the Agreement offers the best way forward and \nthe best yardstick to judge the policies and actions of all involved. \nThe goal of peace is best served by prompt action on the Agreement. \nThose who take risks for peace can be assured of timely support by \nPresident Clinton, Congress, and the American people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent the \nresolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid\n\n[[Page S2837]]\n\nupon the table, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 64) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 64\n\n       Whereas Ireland has a long and tragic history of civil \n     conflict that has left a deep and profound legacy of \n     suffering;\n       Whereas since 1969 more than 3,200 people have died and \n     thousands more have been injured as a result of political \n     violence in Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas a series of efforts by the Governments of the \n     Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom to facilitate \n     peace and an announced cessation of hostilities created an \n     historic opportunity for a negotiated peace;\n       Whereas in June 1996, for the first time since the \n     partition of Ireland in 1922, representatives elected from \n     political parties in Northern Ireland pledged to adhere to \n     the principles of nonviolence and commenced talks regarding \n     the future of Northern Ireland;\n       Whereas the talks greatly intensified in the spring of 1998 \n     under the chairmanship of former United States Senator George \n     Mitchell;\n       Whereas the active participation of British Prime Minister \n     Tony Blair and Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern was critical to \n     the success of the talks;\n       Whereas on Good Friday, April 10, 1998, the parties to the \n     negotiations each made honorable compromises to conclude a \n     peace agreement for Northern Ireland, which has become known \n     as the Good Friday Peace Agreement;\n       Whereas on Friday, May 22, 1998, an overwhelming majority \n     of voters in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of \n     Ireland approved by referendum the Good Friday Peace \n     Agreement;\n       Whereas the United States must remain involved politically \n     and economically to ensure the long-term success of the Good \n     Friday Peace Agreement; and\n       Whereas April 10, 1999, marks the first anniversary of the \n     Good Friday Peace Agreement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historic significance of the first \n     anniversary of the Good Friday Peace Agreement;\n       (2) salutes British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish \n     Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and the elected representatives of the \n     political parties in Northern Ireland for creating the \n     opportunity for a negotiated peace;\n       (3) commends former Senator George Mitchell for his \n     leadership on behalf of the United States in guiding the \n     parties toward peace;\n       (4) congratulates the people of the Republic of Ireland and \n     Northern Ireland for their courageous commitment to work \n     together in peace;\n       (5) reaffirms the bonds of friendship and cooperation that \n     exist between the United States and the Governments of the \n     Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, which ensure that \n     the United States and those Governments will continue as \n     partners in peace; and\n       (6) encourages all parties to move forward to implement the \n     Good Friday Peace Agreement.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have a series of items I need to go \nthrough and a discussion I want to have, but I understand the Senator \nfrom Michigan has some comments to make, so I yield the floor to the \nSenator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2837-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2837-S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TOBACCO RECOUPMENT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I wanted \nto just briefly speak in relationship to the Harkin-Specter amendment \nwith regard to the tobacco recoupment issue and the issue of exactly \nwhat should happen to the funds that the States are now entitled to \nreceive as a result of the legal settlement that was achieved between \n46 States and the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. President, this, to me, should be a pretty clear-cut result. The \nStates entered into this litigation. They did all the work. They made \nthe case persuasively. They were finally able to prevail on the merits, \nin terms of convincing the other side to engage in a settlement. So, \nfor those reasons, it does not seem to me to be particularly difficult \nto conclude that the benefits, the proceeds, the settlement moneys \nought to go to the States. I believe, since the States did this on \ntheir own and since the States are certainly quite knowledgeable about \nthe needs of their constituents, that we should allow them not only to \nbe the recipients of those funds but we should give them the discretion \nto make the decisions that are necessary as to what priorities to set \nin spending those dollars.\n  Let me just begin briefly with the basic case itself. The States \njoined together. The Federal Government did not play a role in the \ntechnical sense, or as a party to the proceedings. Indeed, in his State \nof the Union Address the President even indicated he was directing the \nDepartment of Justice and the Attorney General to bring a separate \nlitigation on behalf of the people of the United States against the \ntobacco companies. Presumably, one would not bring that case if one did \nnot think that the States' decisions were separate from any kind of \nFederal component.\n  Once the States won, of course, money became available. \nUnfortunately, at that point the Federal Government, through the Health \nCare Finance Administration, is attempting to intercede in the \nPresident's budget to a very substantial degree, trying to wrest \ncontrol of a substantial portion of those dollars. As I recall, roughly \n60 percent of the first 5 years' revenues to the States which, under \nthe President's budget, would, instead, be diverted to Washington. The \nbasis for their claim is, in my judgment, a weak one, predicated on the \nargument that Medicaid overpayments are to be returned to the States. \nThis is not a Medicaid overpayment from the Federal Government. This is \na settlement between the States and these tobacco companies, a \nsettlement fairly reached and a settlement based on the States' belief \nthat their citizens had been in some ways the victims of the illnesses \nrelating to tobacco.\n  That said, we have now moved to a slightly different stage. In the \ncontent of this supplemental appropriation bill is language which would \nmake it absolutely and explicitly clear that the States will receive \nthese dollars. Now, we have before us an amendment that says: OK, if \nthe States are going to get the money they still have to spend it on \nthe priorities set by bureaucrats in Washington. Indeed, it is my \nunderstanding that the proposed amendment would essentially place the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services in a position to determine what \nprograms qualify for, and whether States are in compliance with, these \nFederal mandates for 25 years. Basically, what this amendment says is \napproximately 50 percent, 50 percent of the settlement moneys have to \nbe spent the way Washington dictates, and that the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services will decide not only what that dictation means but \nwhether the States have done it. The States will be required to engage \nin extensive recordkeeping and an annual process of appealing for \napproval, the same kind of bureaucratic redtape that costs money and \ncomplicates, in my judgment, far too many things we do already.\n  If the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it's not just this \nSecretary but any Secretary over the next quarter of a century, doesn't \nagree with the States, they can then veto, in effect, the States' \nexpenditures costing the States as much as approximately $123 billion \nduring that time.\n  The bottom line is, I think, a fairly simple one. Who knows best what \nthe needs of the States are, the States themselves or bureaucrats in \nthe Department of Health and Human Services? I believe the States do. I \nthink we can trust the States to make the right decisions as to how to \nspend the moneys derived from the tobacco settlements. That is \nassuming, of course, that we have any right to tell them in the first \nplace. I do not even acknowledge that. But assuming there even was a \nright of the Federal Government in some respect, I just cannot imagine \nwhy anybody here in Washington is going to do a better job than people \nat the State level in making these judgments.\n  The priorities that have been set which relate to such things as \ncounteradvertising or youth awareness or public health priorities, are \npriorities virtually every State has already set for themselves. Many \nof the States, including I believe my own, have done great things along \nthe way to try to discourage smoking by young people and to address \npublic health needs. If they have done that well, the notion that they \nnow have to spend new moneys recouped through this settlement on these \nprograms at least in my judgment would be a grievous error.\n  So it comes back to something we talk about a lot around here: Who\n\n[[Page S2838]]\n\nshould set priorities and who knows best? In my view, the people at the \nlocal and State level, on issues and problems like this, do know best. \nThey ought to make the decisions as to how the money, which was \nrightfully won by them in these lawsuits, ought to be spent. And we in \nWashington ought to be happy that there is going to be an abundance of \nresources going to the States to address the top priorities of those \nStates.\n  The notion that we have to dictate how 50 percent or even 30 percent \nor 10 percent of these dollars have to be spent, I think both, A, \nincorrectly presumes that somehow we had a stake in the lawsuit and, B, \nthat, somehow we know better. I believe it has been proven time after \ntime that we do not know better, particularly in these types of matters \nwhich obviously have peculiarities that differ from State to State.\n  So, for those reasons I rise in opposition to the amendment. I look \nforward to working with the Senator from Texas and with a variety of \nother Senators who have been working together as cosponsors of the \nlegislation that is included in the supplemental appropriation bill, to \nmake sure that first and foremost the States get access to all the \nmoney won in the settlements and that, second, the States have the \nright to make the decisions as to how to spend those dollars.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we will be successful in preventing \nagreement to this amendment. I look forward to working on this until it \nis completed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2838-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMISSION ON MILITARY TRAINING AND GENDER-\n                             RELATED ISSUES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to make note of a report that \ncame out today that is one, I think, we are going to be seeing and \nhearing quite a bit more about in the U.S. Senate. It was a report of \nthe Congressional Commission on Military Training and Gender-Related \nIssues.\n  I rise today to briefly comment on the status of the report and the \ntestimony that was submitted today by the members of the Congressional \nCommission on Military Training and Gender-Related Issues, a hearing \nthat took place in the House Armed Services Committee. While not the \nfinal report of this commission, the initial report does give \nindications as to their findings and, I think, warrants some discussion \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  A number of Members will recall, last year we had a spirited \ndiscussion about gender-integrated barracks during basic training. The \ndiscussion was centered around issues of, is this the most effective \nway to train our young men and women in the services, to have gender-\nintegrated barracks? These are young men and women just entering into \nthe military. They are going through basic training. There are a lot of \ndifficult issues that they are facing, as they are being trained into a \nfighting force. Then on top of that, we put them in the same barracks \ntogether at night, after they have been side by side during the day. \nAsk yourself, are you going to be asking for problems if you have got \nyoung men and women who are put into the same barracks, right after a \nlong day, next to each other with not a lot of other diversions at \nnight?\n  We have had, unfortunately, a report of many instances of sexual \nharassment that have taken place, and worse, in these gender-integrated \nbarracks. I am not speaking about basic training. I am talking about \nthe barracks.\n  The report that came out today notes some progress in improving that \nsexual harassment and other problems that we have experienced with \ngender-integrated barracks during basic training, but it still invites \nthe question of, why do we even ask for any problems at all? They are \nsaying, the problem level is down, but why are we asking for problems \nat all by having these integrated barracks during basic training? Why \ndon't we separate the genders during basic training? That was the point \nthat a number of us made last year. A lot of people thought, let's put \nit off until this report. The report notes we have some progress, but \nwe still have problems.\n  I think this hearing that was held today and the preliminary report \nthat was issued merit a full hearing taking place in the U.S. Senate \nArmed Services Committee to review this very issue. Is this the best \nway? Is this the right way, and is this the way that is leading to more \nproblems than we need to confront of the current policy of integrating \nthe sexes in their barracks during basic training?\n  I think not. We will continue to have problems we just do not need to \ninvite. I hope that the Senate will take this on as a serious problem \nas we start to deal with the report that comes out today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2838-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMTRAK ``CITY OF NEW ORLEANS'' DERAILMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, millions of Americans awoke yesterday to the \ntragic news of the derailment of the Amtrak ``City of New Orleans'' \npassenger train in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Late Monday night, the train, \nbound for New Orleans from Chicago, struck a tractor trailer at a \nhighway/railroad crossing, throwing the two locomotives and 11 of the \n14 cars off the tracks. More than 100 of the 196 passengers, 18 crew \nmembers, and two off-duty Amtrak employees were injured. At least \neleven passengers were killed, including three Mississippians.\n  Both Tricia and I are keeping the families of the victims of this \nterrible tragedy in our prayers, especially the Bonnin and Lipscomb \nfamilies of DeSoto County, Mississippi. June Bonnin of Nesbit, \nMississippi was diagnosed with what doctors described as incurable \ncancer five years ago. However, her strong faith in God kept her going \nand inspired others around her. She and her granddaughter, Jessica \nTickle of Memphis, Tennessee, are in God's hands now, and her daughter \nAshley was severely injured. Rainey and Lacey Lipscomb, two young \nsisters from Lake Cormorant, Mississippi, also perished in this crash. \nWe grieve with these families for their loss.\n  Mr. President, a group of students and adults from Clinton High \nSchool and Covenant Christian School in Clinton, Mississippi riding \nthat train were returning to Mississippi after a spring-break ski trip. \nThese young teenagers were jolted into a nightmare situation as some of \nthe train's locomotives and cars overturned, split open, and caught \nfire.\n  I want to recognize the reactions of two of those students during \nthis catastrophe. Clinton High School students Michael Freeman and \nCaleb McNair quickly recovered from the initial shock of this crash and \nwent to the aid of their fellow students and passengers. The Jackson, \nMississippi newspaper reported today that Michael located an escape \nroute through a side window, which was now at the top of their \noverturned passenger coach, built a ladder from broken seats, climbed \nout, and pulled his fellow students out to safety. Meanwhile, Caleb \nsearched the coach for his fellow students. They had rescued more than \na dozen students by the time emergency personnel arrived on scene. \nMichael then assisted one of the injured students to a telephone so she \ncould notify her parents.\n  Mr. President, the actions of these two young men may have prevented \nthe other students from suffering additional injury or even death. \nTheir reaction during this unexpected and disorienting event was truly \ncommendable, as was the response by local, state, and Federal emergency \npersonnel, Amtrak, and the Red Cross.\n  It is unfortunate that the Nation's awareness of the dangers of road/\nrailway crossings tends to be raised by tragedies such as this, only to \nfade as time passes. Drivers who fail to heed rail intersection \nwarnings place not only themselves at risk, but others as well. More \nneeds to be done to prevent such accidents. I intend to work with my \ncolleagues this year to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2838-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2838-S2839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 774.

A bill to establish a pilot program to promote the \nreplication of recent successful juvenile crime reduction strategies; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   safer communities partnership act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce three measures \nthat are linked together by a common theme--the desire to create a \nsafer environment for young people to grow up in.\n  Two of these bills are designed to help communities better combat \njuvenile crime and the related problem of truancy. The third proposal \nwill help better protect students from violence in the school building \nthrough the use of technology.\n  It's clear that in order to create a safer environment for young \npeople, we must not only reduce the number of children who commit \ncrimes, but also the number of children who are victims of crime.\n  Before I outline these specific bills, I'd like to put them in a \nlarger context. Mr. President, I'd like to spend just a minute \ndiscussing the broader question of what children need--in addition to \nsafe surroundings--in order to grow into healthy, productive adults.\n  Let me start by describing my own childhood. I grew up in a small \nmining town in southwestern New Mexico called Silver City. Both my \nparents were teachers, so naturally a top concern was that I got a \nsolid education. Fortunately, the local schools were good, and when I \ngraduated with my classmates from what is now Silver High, we felt we \ncould compete with just about any other student in the country.\n  Silver City was also relatively safe. People tended to know their \nneighbors and while no town is completely crime-free, we felt secure in \nour homes, around town, and in school.\n  Finally, Silver City was by no means a wealthy town. But I'm sure I'm \nnot the only one who grew up optimistic that a person could work hard, \nachieve a decent standard of living, and support their family without \nfear that one turn of bad luck would put them out on the streets.\n  In short, Mr. President, Silver City was a pretty good place to grow \nup. In fact, we used to feel sorry for people in neighboring states \nwhere the quality of life was not so good.\n  Even today, New Mexico is blessed with rich cultural diversity, \ntremendous natural beauty, strong families and a sense of tradition. \nAll of these things make New Mexico a wonderful place to live. Each \ntime I go home I'm astonished at the number of new people who are \nmoving there, no doubt for some of these very reasons.\n  And yet, Mr. President, some things seem to have changed since I was \na kid in New Mexico. I seem to hear more and more frequently from \nparents who tell me how hard it is to raise a child in a state where \ncrime and unemployment rates are high, yet family income and school \ngraduation rates are low. Where alcohol and drug abuse are widespread, \nbut health insurance and treatment options are scarce.\n  Those of us from New Mexico know that a Washington-based study \nranking our state as the worst place to raise children can not be taken \nat face-value. And yet, there is a troubling reality we must face. In \nmany ways, our state is failing to provide what is needed to ensure all \nof our young people have the necessary foundation to grow into healthy, \nproductive adults. In several key respects, New Mexico has fallen \nbehind the other states we used to feel sorry for.\n  So, Mr. President, as we stand on the brink of a new century, I rise \ntoday to urge that we recommit ourselves--as elected officials, as \ncommunity leaders, as parents, and as citizens-- to better meeting the \nneeds of people growing up in our state and to setting higher goals for \nNew Mexico's future.\n  I began by saying that a child needs to grow up safe from harm. That \nmeans safe from family violence, safe from gang warfare, and safe in \nschool. But a child has other needs that must be met as well. I'd like \nto mention three other areas that I believe are cornerstones to strong \nfoundation for any child.\n  The first of these is economic security. If a child is living in \npoverty, or on the edge of poverty, it is very difficult for anything \nelse to fall into place.\n  A child should grow up in a family whose economic circumstances are \nstable. This stability comes first and foremost from parents with \ndecent job opportunities. It also comes from a family's ability to \nsuccessfully juggle numerous economic demands--and to adapt to change, \nthe only certainty in today's global economy. Our efforts in this area \nshould center on creating more high-wage jobs and on giving families \nthe tools to manage the unpredictable forces that can throw them into \nfinancial turmoil.\n  The second cornerstone is education. In America, a quality public \neducation has long been the great leveler between the haves and the \nhave-nots. Children need access to a quality education that will give \nthem the skills to achieve a good standard of living.\n  A quality education system is one characterized by accountability and \nflexibility. Accountability means that clear goals are set for things \nlike student achievement and teacher quality, information is readily \navailable on student progress toward these goals, and schools are held \naccountable for this progress. Flexibility means that schools have the \nresources and the ability to adapt to meet the needs of students--\nparticularly students at risk of dropping out.\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\n  Third, children must have access to affordable, quality health care. \nA child who is sick cannot go to school--cannot be expected to learn. \nAnd yet according to the Children's Defense Fund, no state has a \ngreater percentage of uninsured children than New Mexico.\n  We have to ensure that this health care is not only promised, but \ndelivered--and that it is just as available to rural areas as it is to \nurban ones.\n  In the coming weeks, I intend to introduce legislation and pursue \nstrategies in each of these remaining three areas--that I hope will \nbegin to help parents provide a strong foundation for their children. \nAll of us who grew up in New Mexico have fond memories of those days, \nand we want to assure that feeling for future generations of New \nMexicans so that they can grow up, raise their families, and build a \nfuture in our state.\n  Mr. President, I'd now like to describe the three bills I am \nintroducing today.\n  While adult crime rates are declining in many areas, the juvenile \ncrime rate continues to rise--especially drug-related crime. But there \nis some hope, and there are good solutions out there. Not too long ago, \nI heard about the success the City of Boston had in getting control of \ntheir serious juvenile crime problem. In 1992, Boston had 152 \nhomicides--a horrendous statistic. Realizing the community had to come \ntogether to work on a common solution, the City of Boston developed and \nimplemented a collaborative strategy to address their crime problem. \nBoston's strategy was very successful, and between 1995 and 1997, their \nhomicide rate dropped significantly. Most notably, they went two years \nwithout a single juvenile homicide.\n  Boston got law enforcement, community organizations, health \nproviders, prosecutors, and even religious leaders working together to \ntackle different aspects of juvenile crime.\n  The Boston strategy worked because it got people from different \norganizations working together on a specific set of goals--like taking \nguns away from felons, using probation officers to help identify and \napprehend probation violators, and providing alternatives to children \nto keep them from getting into trouble in the first place.\n  Boston recognized that juvenile crime affects the entire community, \nand a community that pulls together to address it will have a better \nchance of success.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, called the Safer Communities \nPartnership Act, is patterned after a bill authored by Senator Kennedy. \nIt provides funding for communities that want to implement this \n``Boston'' strategy. And because there is no one-size-fits-all approach \nthat works for every community, this bill provides the flexibility to \nintegrate this strategy into the crime-fighting efforts already \noccurring at the local level.\n  The next two proposals have two goals: (1) to keep kids in school, \nand (2) to keep kids in school safe.\n  Although truancy is often the first sign of trouble in the life of a \nyoung person, this problem has long been overlooked. Truancy not only \nindicates a young person's disinterest in school, it often indicates \nthat a young person is headed for a life of crime, drugs and other \nserious problems.\n  It is clear that truancy and crime go hand-in-hand--44 percent of \nviolent juvenile crime takes place during school hours and 57 percent \nof violent crimes committed by juveniles occur on school days. Most of \nthese crimes take place at a time when we expect young people to be in \nschool.\n  In most cases, parents are not aware that their children are truant. \nWe all have to do a better job of notifying parents when kids skip \nschool. In fact, most studies indicate that when parents, educators, \nlaw enforcement and community leaders all work together to prevent \ntruancy at an early stage, school attendance increases and daytime \ncrime decreases.\n  The Truancy Prevention and Juvenile Crime Reduction Act I am \nintroducing today authorizes $25 million per year for local \npartnerships to address truancy. The funds can be used for a variety of \npurposes. They can be used to create penalties for truants and parents \nwhen truancy becomes a chronic problem. They can be used by schools to \nacquire the technology needed to automatically notify parents when \ntheir children are absent without an excuse.\n  Not only do we need to keep our young people in school, we need to \nkeep our students in school safe! Most of us understand the importance \nof protecting our assets, yet we have neglected to protect our biggest \ninvestment of all: our school children. The third and final bill I am \nintroducing today is intended to do just that.\n  We all remember the horrible tragedies that struck Jonesboro, \nArkansas, Paducah, Kentucky, and other communities within the last \nyear. At a time when violent crime in the nation is decreasing, one in \nten public schools reported at least one serious violent crime during \nthe 1996-97 school year. The school yard fist fight is no longer a \nchild's worst fear: 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry \nabout being shot or stabbed. A violent environment is not a good \nlearning environment.\n  Educators and law enforcement know that one way to prevent crime in \nour schools is through the use of technology. The Safe School Security \nAct would establish the School Security Technology Center at Sandia \nNational Laboratories and provide grant money for local school \ndistricts to access the technology. Because Sandia is one of our \nnation's premier labs when it comes to providing physical security for \nour nation's most important assets, it is fitting that they would be \nchosen to provide security to school districts throughout our nation.\n  The latest technology was recently tested in a pilot project \ninvolving Sandia Labs and Belen High School in Belen, New Mexico and \nthe results were astounding. After two years, Belen High School \nreported a 75 percent reduction in school violence, a 30 percent \nreduction in truancy, an 80 percent reduction in vehicle break-ins and \na 75 percent reduction in vandalism. Moreover, insurance claims due to \ntheft or vandalism at Belen High School dropped from $50,000 to $5,000 \nafter the pilot project went into effect. Clearly, the cost of making \nour schools safer and more secure is a good investment for our nation.\n  Mr. President, these three bills represent only a small fraction of \nwhat should be done to ensure that children grow up safe. There is much \nmore I hope we can do this year. For instance, no discussion of the \nsafety of children would be complete without acknowledging the problem \nof drug and alcohol abuse, which is not only a problem for many young \npeople, but is often a source of family violence committed by addicted \nparents.\n  In recent weeks, we have seen the community of Espanola in northern \nNew Mexico begin to come to terms with a very serious heroin problem. \nIn other parts of the state, federal, state and local officials are \ncombating an increase in production and trafficking of \nmethamphetamines, or meth. And of course, the problem of alcohol abuse \ncontinues to plague communities big and small, urban and rural.\n  All of these problems must be approached on two fronts--from the law \nenforcement side, and from the treatment side. Last year we obtained an \nincrease of over one million dollars for New Mexico-based efforts to \nstop the drug trade along the Mexican border, and I recently joined in \nintroducing a measure that will help local law enforcement crack down \non the production and distribution of methamphetamines.\n  On the treatment side, Congress this year will update the budget for \nall federally-funded drug and alcohol treatment programs through the \nreauthorization of SAMHSA. I have already secured a commitment from the \nhead of this agency to travel to northern New Mexico, and I plan to \nplay a leading role in ensuring adequate funding for treatment \nfacilities in underserved areas like our state.\n  Mr. President, in closing I'd like to say that I am not the only \nperson interested in working to make New Mexico a better place to grow \nup. There are valiant efforts underway all across the state, and I \ncommend those who are striving to make a difference. But this is not \nsomething that can occur overnight. This is a long term effort that \nrequires cooperation between all levels of government, community \nleaders, average citizens, and of course, parents.\n  As we prepare to close the book on the 20th century, I'd like to \nsuggest a\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\nnew horizon for our state that will give us the time to make the \nprogress we all want to make. We are a little more than 12 years away \nfrom New Mexico's 100th anniversary as a state of these United States. \nThis anniversary will occur on January 6, 2012. I say we set our sights \nbeyond the turn of the century and focus on that year--2012. Then we \ncan set high goals for New Mexico and the future of our children, \nknowing we have 12 more years to do all we can to meet them. New Mexico \ncan still be a great place to grow up, if we all work together toward \nthat goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truancy Prevention and \n     Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Truancy is often the first sign of trouble--the first \n     indicator that a young person is giving up and losing his or \n     her way.\n       (2) Many students who become truant eventually drop out of \n     school, and high school drop outs are two and a half times \n     more likely to be on welfare than high school graduates, \n     twice as likely to be unemployed, or if employed, earn lower \n     salaries.\n       (3) Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of \n     criminals--more common than such factors as coming from \n     single-parent families and being abused as children.\n       (4) High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime \n     burglary rates and high vandalism.\n       (5) As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes \n     place during school hours.\n       (6) As many as 75 percent of children ages 13 to 16 who are \n     arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants.\n       (7) Some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily \n     student absences are unexcused, and the total number of \n     absences in a single city can reach 4,000 per day.\n       (8) Society pays a significant social and economic cost due \n     to truancy: only 34 percent of inmates have completed high \n     school education; 17 percent of youth under age 18 entering \n     adult prisons have not completed grade school (8th grade or \n     less), 25 percent completed 10th grade, and 2 percent \n     completed high school.\n       (9) Truants and later high school drop outs cost the Nation \n     $240,000,000,000 in lost earnings and foregone taxes over \n     their lifetimes, and the cost of crime control is staggering.\n       (10) In many instances, parents are unaware a child is \n     truant.\n       (11) Effective truancy prevention, early intervention, and \n     accountability programs can improve school attendance and \n     reduce daytime crime rates.\n       (12) There is a lack of targeted funding for effective \n     truancy prevention programs in current law.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide for \nenhanced information regarding credit card balance payment terms and \nconditions, and to provide for enhanced reporting of credit card \nsolicitations to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \nand to Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\n                    enhanced credit card disclosures\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation on a subject that was the focus of considerable discussion \nlast fall, during the Senate's consideration of bankruptcy reform \nlegislation.\n  During that debate, the Senate examined whether the increased rate of \nconsumer bankruptcies in the Nation resulted solely from consumers' \naccess to an excessively permissive bankruptcy process, or whether \nother factors also contributed to this increase. Ultimately it \nconcluded that the record increase in bankruptcy filings across the \nnation is due not only to the ease with which one can enter the \nbankruptcy system, but also to the unparalleled levels of consumer \ndebt--especially credit card debt--being run up across the country. As \nSenator Durbin noted in his opening statement on the bankruptcy reform \nbill last fall, and as the CBO, FDIC, and numerous economists have \nfound, the rate of increase in bankruptcy filings is virtually \nidentical to the rate of increase in consumer debt.\n  This is not a coincidence. Rather, increased bankruptcies proceed \ndirectly from the fact that Americans are bombarded daily by credit \ncard solicitations that promise easy access to credit without informing \ntheir targets of the implications of signing up for such credit.\n  During last fall's debate, the Senate also concluded that \nirresponsible borrowing could be reduced, and many bankruptcies \naverted, if Americans were provided with some basic information in \ntheir credit card materials regarding the consequences of assuming \ngreater debt. A consensus emerged that credit card companies have some \naffirmative obligation to provide such information to consumers in \ntheir solicitations, monthly statements, and purchasing materials, in \nlight of their aggressive pursuit of less and less knowledgeable \nborrowers.\n  As a result of this emerging consensus, last year's Senate bankruptcy \nbill--S. 1301--contained several provisions in the Manager's Amendment \naddressing credit card debt, and requiring specific disclosures by \ncredit card companies in their payment and solicitation materials. \nThese provisions, which I sponsored along with Senators Dodd and \nDurbin, were vital to the Senate's success in adopting balanced \nbankruptcy reform legislation that placed responsibility for the surge \nin consumer bankruptcies on debtors and creditors alike, and enabled \nthe Senate to pass its bankruptcy bill by the overwhelming margin of \n97-1.\n  Unfortunately, the House-Senate conference committee struck these \ndisclosure provisions from its final conference report, leaving the \nbankruptcy bill again a one-sided document that failed to account for \nthe role credit card companies play in the accumulation of credit card \ndebt and in increased consumer bankruptcy rates. As a result of the \nconference committee's actions, the conference report died in the \nwaning days of the 105th Congress, amid pledges by the majority to \nresurrect it in the early days of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, if we are indeed going to enter again into a debate on \nbankruptcy legislation in the 106th Congress, it remains my firm belief \nthat Congress must address both sides of the consumer bankruptcy \nequation--both the flaws in the bankruptcy system that make it easy for \npeople to declare bankruptcy even if they have the ability to pay their \ndebts, and the lending practices that encourage people on the economic \nmargins to accumulate debts that are beyond their ability to repay.\n  I therefore rise today to introduce legislation that is similar, \nthough not identical, to the language included in last year's Senate \nbankruptcy bill. It is my hope that this bill will stimulate discussion \nabout the responsibilities of lenders in the bankruptcy equation, and \nthat, when the time comes to debate bankruptcy reform, the nature and \nextent of these responsibilities will be a large part of the \ndiscussion.\n  In short, this legislation amends the Truth in Lending Act to require \ncredit card companies to disclose the following basic information in \neach monthly statement:\n  (1) The required minimum payment on a consumer's monthly balance;\n  (2) The number of months it will take to pay off that balance if the \nconsumer makes minimum monthly payments;\n  (3) The total cost, with interest, of paying off that balance if the \nconsumer continues to make only minimum monthly payments; and\n  (4) The monthly payment amount if the consumer seeks to pay off the \nbalance in 36 months.\n  The legislation also requires that when a debtor purchases property \nunder a credit card plan, the retailer must disclose to the debtor, if \napplicable:\n  (1) That the creditor now has a security interest in the property;\n  (2) The nature of the security interest;\n  (3) How the security interest may be enforced in the event of non-\npayment of the credit card balance; and\n  (4) That the debtor must not dispose of the secured property until \nthe balance on that account is fully paid.\n  My bill calls for the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate model forms \nfor these disclosures and, finally, requires credit card companies to \nprovide to the Fed, and the Fed to Congress, data regarding credit card \nsolicitations.\n  This bill is not about restricting access to credit. Rather, it is \nabout providing consumers with the information they need to make \nintelligent choices about whether to assume more debt. It advances the \ngoal of consumer responsibility that should be at the heart of any \nefforts at bankruptcy reform by Congress, and I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to review this legislation carefully and to draw upon it \nwhen--if--the issue of consumer bankruptcy reemerges in the 106th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Burns, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n        McConnell, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Craig, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Allard, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Murray, and \n        Mr. Grams):\n  S. 642. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   farm and ranch risk management act\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Baucus \nand others, I am introducing the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of \n1999. This bill gives farmers a necessary tool to manage the risk of \nprice and income fluctuations inherent in agriculture. It does this by \nencouraging farmers to save some of their income during good years and \nallowing the funds to supplement income during bad years. This new tool \nwill more fully equip family farmers to deal with the vagaries of the \nmarketplace.\n  Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Agriculture \nrepresents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product. It consists of \nhundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation, many of whom \noperate small, family farms. These farms often support entire families, \nand even several generations of a family. They work hard every day to \nproduce the food consumed by this country and by much of the world.\n  Yet, farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. \nThe income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside \nits control. Weather is one of those factors. In 1997, for instance, \nthe income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% due to flooding. Weather \ncan completely wipe out a farmer. At best, weather can cause a farmer's \nincome to fluctuate wildly.\n  Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa \nfarmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens, for \nexample, when European countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork \nand genetically-modified feed grain? And what happens when Asian \ngovernments devalue their currencies? Exports fall and farm income \ndeclines through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made \nin foreign countries.\n  Today, farm families face their most severe crisis since the 1980's. \nForces beyond the control of the individual farmer have led to record \nlow prices for grain and livestock. The outlook for these families is \ndismal. Above normal production in 1998 led to nearly unprecedented \ngrain surpluses. In fact, the USDA predicts soybean carry-over stocks \nwill be 95% higher for the 1998-\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\n99 marketing season than for the same period last year--the largest \nsince 1986. With this much grain in the bins, a quick recovery in grain \nprices is highly unlikely.\n  At present, the only help for these farmers is a reactionary policy \nof government intervention. The USDA recently committed $50 million in \ndirect aid to hog producers to help them combat the current crisis. In \nhis State of the Union Address, the President pledged additional \nsupport for farmers. While we must do all we can to help farmers pull \nthrough the current crisis, we must also realize that this aid is \nmerely a short-term solution. Why must farm families wait for a crisis \nbefore getting the help they need?\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is a proactive measure \nthat will help farmers prevent future crises on their own. It equips \nthem with the ability to offset cyclical downturns that are inherent in \ntheir profession without government intervention. In that way, this \nbill is complementary with the philosophy of the new farm program. Many \nfarmers I have talked to are pleased with the new program, which \nreturned business decisions to the farmers, not bureaucrats at the \nDepartment of Agriculture, and not elected officials. Under the new \nprogram, farmers determine for themselves what to plant according to \nthe demands of the market. Likewise, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management \nAct allows the farmer to decide whether to defer his income for later \nyears and when to withdraw funds to supplement his operation.\n  The volatile nature of commodity markets can make it difficult for \nfamily farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. When prices are \nhigh, farmers often pay so much of their income in taxes that they are \nunable to save anything. When prices drop again, farmers can be faced \nwith liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers to manage their \nincome, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets.\n  Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill \nworks. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-\ndeferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are \ntax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for \nthe year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-\nbearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is \nearned.\n  The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon \nwithdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not \nwithdrawn five years after they were invested, they are taxed as income \nand subject to an additional 10% penalty.\n  Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his \nmoney in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can \ncontribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account \nwhen his income is low.\n  This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government \nsubsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy \npurporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a \nfighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed \nwhen prices eventually increase.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 642\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nSenator Grassley in introducing the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act \nof 1999.\n  The American farm is the cornerstone of our rich cultural heritage. \nYet farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. A \nfamily farmer's income depends on good weather and strong international \nmarkets. When either of these two factors turn negative, farmers have \nfew tools at their disposal to cushion the blow.\n  Farm families are now suffering record low prices on grain and \nlivestock in the most severe farming crisis since the 1980's. Who could \nhave imagined back in 1996 when Congress passed the Freedom to Farm Act \nthat wheat prices would drop from $4.50 a bushel to $2.81 a bushel by \nSeptember 1998? As wheat and other agricultural commodity prices dipped \nto record lows, America's producers have been stranded without a safety \nnet, causing a severe financial crisis.\n  I sincerely hope that 1999 will be the ``Year of Recovery'' for our \nbattered farm economy. I believe we can make this happen by focusing on \nthree goals:\n  We must pry open foreign markets to agricultural products.\n  We must help agricultural producers at home.\n  We must install a permanent safety net to help producers weather \ntimes of crisis.\n  In two other bills I have introduced, I have proposed changes to the \ncrop insurance program in order to help re-build this safety net for \nfarmers. Today's introduction of the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act \nis another step in this re-building process. The FARRM Act is a pro-\nactive measure that would give farmers a five-year window to manage \ntheir money. It allows them to put aside up to 20% of their annual \nincome for up to 5 years in a tax-deferred FARRM account. They only pay \ntaxes on the amount set-aside when it is withdrawn from the account.\n  The FARRM bill allows the farmer to help himself. It allows farmers \nto manage their incomes, to smooth out the highs and lows of the \ncommodity markets. It is not a new subsidy, nor is it a new government \nprogram. It is simply a new tool farmers can use to cope with an \nuncertain world. It provides American farmers with a fighting chance to \nsurvive the down times with an opportunity to enjoy their success \nduring the good times.\n  I believe the FARRM Act is an essential strand in the safety net we \nmust weave to protect our nation's farm families. I urge my colleagues \nto support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 645. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to waive the oxygen content \nrequirement for reformulated gasoline that results in no greater \nemissions of air pollutants than reformulated gasoline meeting the \noxygen content requirement; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n                            eliminating mtbe\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill \nto enable the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate the \nadditive, MTBE, from gasoline. The goal in this bill, as in my previous \nthree bills (S. 266, S. 267 and S. 268) is to eliminate MTBE from \ndrinking water.\n  Under this bill, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could waive \nthe two percent reformulated gasoline oxygenate requirement of the \nClean Air Act in any state if gasoline with less than two percent or \nwith no oxygenates does not result in greater emissions than emissions \nfrom reformulated gasoline containing two percent oxygenates.\n  MTBE or methyl tertiary butyl ether is added to gasoline by some \nrefiners in response to federal Clean Air Act requirements that areas \nwith the most serious air pollution problems use reformulated or \ncleaner-burning gasoline. This federal law requires that this gasoline \ncontain two percent by weight oxygenates. MTBE has been the oxygenate \nof choice by some refiners.\n  The Clean Air Act's reformulated gas requirements have no doubt \nhelped reduce emissions throughout the United States, but the two \npercent oxygenate requirement has imposed limitations on the level of \nflexibility that U.S. EPA can grant to states and limited the \nflexibility of refiners in making clean gasoline.\n  I am very troubled to learn from a March 16 article in the Sacramento \nBee that the gasoline refiners were aware\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nof MTBE's dangers long before it was approved for use in California. \nResearchers in Maine pointed out MTBE's harms in 1986. The Bee \nreporter, after studying industry research documents, quotes a 1992 \nindustry scientific paper: ``MTBE plumes are expected to move faster \nand further than benzene plumes emanating from a gasoline spill. \nMoreover, the solubility of MTBE is nearly 25 times that of benzene and \nits concentration in gasoline will be approximately 10 times greater.''\n  A spokesman for the Oxygenated Fuels Association is also quoted as \nsaying that the chemical properties that make MTBE problematic in water \n``were widely known'' in the 1980s.\n  Bob Reeb, of the Association of California Water Agencies, is quoted \nas saying, had they known of MTBE's adverse effects, ``We would have \nfought like hell to keep it out of gasoline. It appears to be a classic \ncase of placing corporate profits above public health.''\n  The Sacramento Bee article is appended to my statement.\n  A number of authorities have called attention to MTBE's harm and have \ncalled for prompt action.\n  The American Medical Association House of Delegates and the American \nPublic Health Association approved resolutions calling for a moratorium \non the use of MTBE in 1994--1994!\n  The University of California released a five-volume study in November \n1998, and recommended phasing out MTBE. UC found that ``there are \nsignificant risks and costs associated with water contamination due to \nthe use of MTBE.'' The University of California study says: ``If MTBE \ncontinues to be used at current levels and more sources become \ncontaminated, the potential for regional degradation of water \nresources, especially groundwater basins, will increase. Severity of \nwater shortages during drought years will be exacerbated.''\n  The UC study says that oil companies can make cleaner-burning \ngasoline that meets federal air standards without MTBE and that they \nshould be given the flexibility to do that. The UC study found that \n``there is no significant additional air quality benefit to the use of \noxygenates such as MTBE in reformulated gasoline, relative to'' \nCalifornia's reformulated gasoline formula.\n  The California Environmental Protection Agency on February 19, 23, 24 \nheld two public hearings on the University of California report. A \ntotal of 109 people spoke at the hearings and 987 written comments \n(including mine) were submitted as of today, and the comment period is \nstill open. Of the 109 speakers, 12 supported continued use of MTBE. \nCal EPA is still reading the written comments.\n  A June 12, 1998 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory study \nconcluded that MTBE is a ``frequent and widespread contaminant'' in \ngroundwater throughout California and does not degrade significantly \nonce it is there. This study found that groundwater has been \ncontaminated at over 10,000 shallow monitoring sites. The Livermore \nstudy says that ``MTBE has the potential to impact regional groundwater \nresources and may present a cumulative contamination hazard.''\n  The Association of California Water Agencies has detected MTBE in \nshallow groundwater at over 10,000 sites in the state and in some \ndeeper drinking wells. Their December 1998 study documented MTBE \ncontamination in many of the state's surface water reservoirs, pointing \nto motorized recreation as a major source.\n  The environmental group, Communities for a Better Environment, issued \na report this month calling for a ban on MTBE in our state because it \nhas contamined groundwater, drinking water and land.\n  I have received letters and resolutions opposing MTBE from 56 \nCalifornia local governments, water districts, and air districts.\n  In higher concentrations, MTBE smells like turpentine and it tastes \nlike paint thinner. Relatively low levels of MTBE can make drinking \nwater simply undrinkable.\n  MTBE is a highly soluble organic compound which moves quickly through \nsoil and gravel. It, therefore, poses a more rapid threat to water \nsupplies than other constituents of gasoline when leaks occur. MTBE is \neasily traced, but it is very difficult and expensive to cleanup. \nCalifornia water agencies say it costs $1 million to cleanup per well \nand $5 million plus for reservoirs.\n  Contamination of drinking water MTBE continues to grow. A December \n14, 1998 San Francisco Chronicle headline calls MTBE a ``Ticking \nBomb.''\n  The Lawrence Livermore study says that ground water has been \ncontaminated at over 10,000 sites in my state.\n  South Lake Tahoe has closed 14 wells and is implementing a ban on \npersonal watercraft. Ten plumes of MTBE released by gas stations (some \nfrom a hose torn loose, some from spills, some from underground tanks) \nhave caused the shutdown of 35% of the districts' drinking water wells, \neliminating nearly one-fifth of its water supply since September 1997. \nThe levels of groundwater contamination there are as high as 1,200,000 \nparts per billion. The South Tahoe Public Utility District has spent \nnearly $1 million in non-budget funds on MTBE.\n  The February 5 Sacramento Bee reported that MTBE has been detected 30 \nmiles away from Lake Tahoe, that ``it apparently made its way to the \nreservoir through South Lake Tahoe's wastewater export system. . . Six \nservice stations working to clear MTBE from contaminated areas have \nbeen discharging water into the sewer system after a treatment \nprocess.'' The article quotes Dawn Forsythe, a Tahoe authority: ``It's \ngoing all the way through the sewer system, through the treatment \nsystem, through the export pipeline, across a stream and now it's in \nthe reservoir.''\n  MTBE has been detected in drinking water supplies in a number of \ncities including Santa Monica, Riverside, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, Sebastopol, Manteca, and San Diego. MTBE has also been \ndetected in numerous California reservoirs including Lake Shasta in \nRedding, San Pablo and Cherry reservoirs in the Bay Area, and Coyote \nand Anderson reservoirs in Santa Clara.\n  Drinking water wells in Santa Clara Valley (Great Oaks Water Company) \nand Sacramento (Fruitridge Vista Water Company) have been shut down \nbecause of MTBE contamination.\n  In addition, MTBE has been detected in the following surface water \nreservoirs: Lake Perris (Metropolitan Water District of Southern \nCalifornia), Anderson Reservoir (Santa Clara Valley Water District), \nCanyon Lake (Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District), Pardee \nReservoir and San Pablo Reservoir (East Bay Municipal Utility \nDistrict), Lake Berryessa (Solano County Water Agency).\n  The largest contamination occurred in the city of Santa Monica, which \nlost 75% of its ground water supply as a result of MTBE leaking out of \nshallow gas tanks beneath the surface. MTBE has been discovered in \npublicly owned wells approximately 100 feet from the City Council \nChamber in South Lake Tahoe. In Glennvile, California, near \nBakersfield, MTBE levels have been detected in groundwater as high as \n190,000 parts per billion--dramatically exceeding the California \nDepartment of Health advisory of 35 parts per billion.\n\n  While many scientists say we need more definitive research on the \nhuman health effects of MTBE, the U.S. EPA has indicated that ``MTBE is \nan animal carcinogen and has a human carcinogenic hazard potential.''\n  Dr. John Froines, a distinguished UCLA scientist, testified at the \nCalifornia EPA hearing on February 23 as follows:\n\n       We in our report have concluded the cancer evidence in \n     animals is relevant to humans.\n       There are ``acute effects in occupationally-exposed \n     workers, including headaches, dizziness, nausea, eye and \n     respiratory irritation, vomiting, sensation of spaciness or \n     disorientation and burning of the nose and throat.''\n       MTBE exposure was associated with excess cancers in rats \n     and mice, therefore, multi-species,'' citing multiple, \n     ``endpoints, lymphoma, leukemia, testicular cancer, liver and \n     kidney.\n       All four of the tumor sites observed in animals may be \n     predictive of human cancer risk.\n\n  He further testified:\n       The related question is whether there is evidence which \n     demonstrates the animal cancers are not relevant to humans. \n     The answer developed in detail in our report is no. There is \n     no convincing evidence that the data is specific to animals. \n     That is our conclusion. Nobody has come forward to tell us a \n     basis to change that point of view.\n\n  `These, to me, are troubling statements from a reputable authority.\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\n  While the data is incomplete, we do know that MTBE is showing up in \nother states. U.S. EPA funded a study by the University of \nMassachusetts last year, which was not able to collect data from every \nstate, but which reported that 25 states have reports of private \ndrinking water wells contaminated with MTBE. Nineteen states reported \npublic drinking water wells contaminated with MTBE. EPA experts \nconcluded, ``MTBE detections by most state programs is common'' and \n``MTBE may contaminate groundwater in unexpected locations and in \nunexpected ways, such as at diesel fuel sites or from surface dumping \nof small amounts of gasoline.'' (Soil and Groundwater Cleanup, August/\nSeptember 1998, ``Study Reports LUST Programs Are Felling Effects of \nMTBE Releases.'')\n  Here are some examples of problems in other states:\n\n       A Maine survey found that 15 percent of drinking wells had \n     detectable amounts of MTBE and 5,200 private wells may \n     contain MTBE above the state's drinking water standard.\n       MTBE has contaminated the well water for over 200 homes in \n     New York.\n       In Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, MTBE was detected in tap water, \n     suspected from a leak from a gas station tank.\n       Texas, with over 21,000 leaking underground fuel tanks, is \n     finding MTBE in drinking water.\n       MTBE has been detected in drinking water in Kansas and \n     Virginia.\n\n  Clearly, MTBE is a problem in many states.\n  The California Air Resources Board in 1994 adopted a clean gas \nformula that is called a ``predictive model,'' a performance-based \nprogram that allows refiners to use innovative fuel formulations to \nmeet clean air requirements.\n  The predictive model provides twice the clean air benefits required \nby the federal government. With this model, refiners can make cleaner \nburning gasoline with one percent oxygen or even no oxygen at all. The \nfederal two percent oxygenate requirement limits this kind of \ninnovation. In fact, Chevron, Tosco and Shell are already making MTBE-\nfree gasoline.\n  Since the introduction of the California Cleaner Burning Gasoline \nprogram, there has been a 300-ton-per-day decrease in ozone forming \ningredients found in the air. This is the emission reduction equivalent \nof taking 3.5 million automobiles off the road. California reformulated \ngasoline reduces smog-forming emissions from vehicles by 15 percent.\n  I have now offered to the Congress 4 approaches to getting MTBE out \nof our drinking water.\n  I introduced S. 266 on January 20, a bill to allow California to \napply its own clean or reformulated gasoline rules as long as emissions \nreductions are equivalent or greater. California's rules are stricter \nthan the federal rules and thus meet the air quality requirements of \nthe federal Clean Air Act. This bill is the companion to H.R. 11 \nintroduced by Rep. Bilbray on January 6, 1999.\n  S. 267, my second bill, requires the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency to make petroleum releases into drinking water the highest \npriority in the federal underground storage tank cleanup program. This \nbill is needed because underground storage tanks are the major source \nof MTBE into drinking water and federal law does not give EPA specific \nguidance on cleanup priorities.\n  The third bill, S. 268, will move from 2006 to 2001 full \nimplementation of EPA's current watercraft engine exhaust emissions \nrequirements. The California Air Resources Board on December 10, 1998, \nadopted watercraft engine regulations in effect making the federal EPA \nrules effective in 2001, so this bill will make the deadline in the \nfederal requirements consistent with California's deadlines. In \naddition, the bill will require an emissions label on these engines \nconsistent with California's requirements so the consumer can make an \ninformed purchasing choice. This bill is needed because watercraft \nengines have remained essentially unchanged since the 1930s and up to \n30 percent of the gas that goes into the motor goes into water \nunburned.\n  Dr. John Froines, testified that in California, ``. . . essentially \nevery citizen of California is breathing MTBE daily.''\n  MTBE is not needed to produce clean air. By allowing the companies \nthat supply our state's gasoline to use good science and sound \nenvironmental policy, we can achieve the goals set forth by the Clear \nAir Act, without sacrificing California's clean water. I believe U.S. \nEPA should give all states this flexibility.\n  MTBE is not needed. Refiners can make gasoline that is clean--\nChevron, Tosco and Shell are already doing that in my state.\n  MTBE is an animal carcinogen and a potential human carcinogen.\n  Let's end it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \narticle from the Sacramento Bee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 645\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. WAIVER OF OXYGEN CONTENT REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   REFORMULATED GASOLINE.\n\n       Section 211(k)(2)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n     7545(k)(2)(B)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The oxygen'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(i) Requirement.--The oxygen''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``The Administrator'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(ii) Waivers.--The Administrator'';\n       (B) by striking ``area upon a'' and inserting the \n     following: ``area--\n\n       ``(I) upon a'';\n\n       (C) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``(II) if the Administrator determines, by regulation, that \n     reformulated gasoline that contains less than 2.0 percent by \n     weight oxygen and meets all other requirements of this \n     subsection will result in total emissions of ozone forming \n     volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants, \n     respectively, that are not greater than the total emissions \n     of those compounds and pollutants resulting from reformulated \n     gasoline that contains at least 2.0 percent by weight oxygen \n     and meets all other requirements of this subsection.''.\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Mar. 16, 1999]\n\n            MTBE Risk to Drinking Water Was Known for Years\n\n                   (By Chris Bowman and Patrick Hoge)\n\n       America's fuel industry knew about the risk to drinking \n     water from MTBE years before domestic refineries more than \n     doubled the chemical's volume in gasoline, but manufacturers \n     marketed the product as an environmental improvement anyway.\n       In technical papers and conference presentations, \n     environmental engineers for refineries and government \n     regulators alike predicted that MTBE could become a lingering \n     groundwater menace as its usage increased.\n       Sixteen years before MTBE-rich gasoline was approved for \n     statewide use in California to combat air pollution, oil \n     companies knew from their first experience with the fuel \n     additive in New England how quickly methyl tertiary butyl \n     ether can migrate from leaking storage tanks to drinking \n     water wells, company records and technical journals show.\n       At the time, the pollution specialists stressed that MTBE \n     was in many ways more worrisome than gasoline's cancer-\n     causing benzene.\n       ``MTBE plumes are expected to move faster and further than \n     benzene plumes emanating from a gasoline spill,'' three Shell \n     researchers said in an internal 1992 paper. ``Moreover, the \n     solubility of MTBE is nearly 25 times that of benzene, and \n     its concentration in gasoline will be approximately 10 times \n     greater.''\n       These papers, recently obtained by The Bee, have renewed \n     importance today in California where the spotlight on the \n     fuel controversy is about to turn on industry.\n       Later this month, Gov. Gray Davis is expected to announce \n     that MTBE presents a public health threat and should be \n     phased out of California, sources in his administration say. \n     Such an action would not end the public debate, but rather \n     shift it to the question of who will pay to clean up MTBE and \n     how much cleanup should occur.\n       Even if the synthetic compound were banned overnight--a \n     highly unlikely prospect--California would still have to \n     defend its water supplies for many years against MTBE-laced \n     groundwater from past fuel leaks.\n       MTBE is a key component of a ``cleaner-burning gasoline'' \n     that has been used in most of California's 27 million \n     vehicles for the past three years. While the gasoline has \n     been credited for removing 300 hundred tons of tailpipe \n     poisons every day in the state, it also has created a \n     Pandora's box underground.\n       Increasingly, the compound has found its way into \n     underground reservoirs, in storm-water runoff, in \n     recreational lakes and in wells across the country. In \n     California, MTBE has contaminated 10,000 groundwater sites \n     and tainted Tahoe, Donner, Shasta and several other lakes. It \n     also has knocked out wells in several communities. In South \n     Lake Tahoe, more than a dozen wells have been shut down due \n     to MTBE contamination.\n       While scientists are still studying MTBE's health effects--\n     the federal government classifies it as a ``possible'' \n     cancer-causing agent\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\n     in humans--minute amounts of the pollutant can spoil wells by \n     imparting a bitter taste and solvent-like ordor.\n       Already some marina-related businesses have taken an \n     economical hit due to water utilities banning fuel-spitting \n     power craft from reservoirs tapped for drinking water. \n     Filtration plants can't remove MTBE without expensive \n     treatment upgrades.\n       But the biggest MTBE bill is yet to come, and, one way or \n     another, consumers will ultimately pay for it. That will be \n     in the cleanup of MTBE-laden fuel that has spilled and leaked \n     from pipelines and storage tanks. The restoration is expected \n     to take many years, at a cost of tens of millions to hundreds \n     of millions of dollars a year, a major University of \n     California study recently concluded.\n       Makers of gasoline and MTBE put the onus on tank owners and \n     the environmental officials who regulate the tanks and the \n     fuels.\n       Officials at Shell Oil Co. headquartered in Houston told \n     The Bee that its 1992 paper describing the environmental \n     downside of MTBE was hardly news.\n       ``(It) was in the public domain and already accessible to \n     regulators,'' the company said in a prepared statement. A \n     spokeswoman said it was based on information disseminated at \n     a 1986 pollution control conference co-sponsored by the \n     American Petroleum Institute.\n       In the 1980s, the chemical properties making MTBE \n     problematic in water ``were widely known,'' said Charlie \n     Drevna, chief spokesman for Oxygenated Fuels Association, \n     which represents makers of MTBE and other oxygen-bearing fuel \n     components. ``What wasn't known was that the (underground \n     storage tank) program in this country was in total \n     shambles.''\n       But the leaking tanks problem has been widely reported for \n     at least the past decade when the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency ordered the tanks replaced or upgraded. \n     Most major brand gasoline stations in California complied by \n     the federal deadline last December.\n       California motorists have been paying for a good part of \n     the cleanups from leaking tanks since 1992. They pay about \n     1.2 cents per gallon at the pump toward a $180 million-a-year \n     state cleanup fund that reimburses mostly small businesses.\n       The argument that industry should bear more responsibility \n     for the MTBE pollution is beginning to grow. In the past few \n     months, attorneys suing oil companies on behalf of \n     individuals and utilities over MTBE pollution in California, \n     South Carolina and Maine have joined forces. The common \n     allegation is that the oil companies knew or should have \n     known that adding more MTBE to gasoline posed a major threat \n     to drinking water sources.\n       ``It would have been astonishing for corporations of this \n     size and complexity not to have known the risk that an \n     additive to a product that would become so widespread would \n     pose to the environment and to the public,'' said Victor \n     Sher, a Sacramento attorney representing the South Tahoe \n     Public Utility District.\n       Sher said his lawsuit, filed in 1999, is the first in the \n     nation by a public water supplier that goes after fuel makers \n     on grounds of product liability.\n       While the environmentally troublesome properties of MTBE \n     were noted in technical papers from the oil industry and \n     federal regulators, Sher said he has yet to find evidence \n     that the oil industry ever raised those problems before \n     policy-makers as they deliberated the rules for the cleaner-\n     burning gasoline.\n       ``They should have been telling the regulators, and they \n     should have been looking for alternatives,'' Shea said.\n       Shell Oil officials say EPA regulators had plenty of notice \n     in the 1980s, well before 1992 when refiners began to \n     substantially increase the chemical's use to meet the new \n     federal cleaner-burning fuel rules.\n       ``The literature then available indicated to government \n     regulators, manufacturers of MTBE and to gasoline \n     manufacturers, including Shell, that the then perceived \n     benefits outweighed the then perceived risks,'' the company \n     statement said.\n       Liability aside, the knowledge of MTBE's downside could \n     have changed what ended up in the gas tanks of millions of \n     motorists. The gasoline additive is now the fourth top \n     selling chemical in the United States, with more than 9 \n     million tons of it sold annually.\n       Water suppliers say they certainly would have raised a \n     fuss.\n       ``We would have fought like hell to keep it out of \n     gasoline,'' said Bob Reeb, of the Association of California \n     Water Agencies. ``It appears to be a classic case of \n     placing corporate profits above public health.''\n       If that's the case, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, \n     D-Los Angeles, said, ``We can make the argument that this \n     industry has a very high level of responsibility to provide \n     the cleanup of this contamination.''\n       MTBE's critics point out that the trail of responsibility \n     can be traced back at least to 1986 when three researchers \n     from Maine laid out the basic characteristics of MTBE in \n     discussion today: that it moves farther and faster in \n     groundwater, last longer, and is much more difficult to \n     filter out than other gasoline compounds.\n       The presentation was at a Houston conference attended by \n     dozens of regulators and industry scientists on ground-water \n     pollutants. It was sponsored by the American Petroleum \n     Institute and the National Well Water Association.\n       Two of the Maine paper's authors said their presentation \n     didn't seem to make much of an impact on regulators and \n     industry.\n       ``There just seemed to be a feeling that there wasn't \n     anything that was necessary to do now, which puzzles me in \n     retrospect,'' said Peter Garrett, one of the authors. ``I \n     think it was because MTBE was hailed as being the chemical of \n     the future because of its potential to cut down on air \n     pollution.''\n       Co-author Marcel Moreau, now an expert on underground \n     tanks, said all of the technical information about the \n     chemical's characteristics was freely supplied by ARCO.\n       But as momentum was building on Capitol Hill toward \n     requiring oxygenated compounds like MTBE in gasoline to \n     combat smog, no such environmental concerns surfaced in the \n     public debate either from industry, environmentalists or \n     regulators, according to interviews with key participants.\n       MTBE's many critics express amazement that a chemical could \n     have been introduced into the environment on such a massive \n     scale with so little data on its toxicology or behavior in \n     the environment.\n       When first added to premium gasoline in 1979, scientists \n     had produced no studies on MTBE's long-term health effects.\n       ``It is astonishing that such a technological process could \n     have been started without sufficient technological \n     information that would have enabled us to expose possible \n     adverse health effects of the compound,'' wrote Fiorella \n     Belpoggi, lead researcher in a 1995 investigation of MTBE's \n     cancer-causing potential.\n       The recent study of MTBE done by the University of \n     California similarly found that regulators did not do enough \n     to assess MTBE's potential environmental impacts before \n     allowing its huge rise.\n       In California, health officials testified recently before \n     the state Legislature that they did not realize that MTBE \n     posed a major groundwater threat until 1995, when Santa \n     Monica reported contamination of one of its wells.\n       Ironically, companies like ARCO continued to spend lavishly \n     in 1996 to promote MTBE as an environmentally friendly \n     product that made gasoline burn cleaner.\n       The lack of toxicology data remains even today, more than \n     three years after MTBE's introduction in California on a \n     massive scale.\n       Industry representatives insist that expensive upgrades of \n     underground tanks already mandated under law will curtail the \n     MTBE problem.\n       But others say evidence shows too many other ways that MTBE \n     can get into water wells.\n       James Giannopoulos, principal engineer with the state Water \n     Resources Control Board, made a similar point during a recent \n     MTBE hearing in Sacramento.\n       ``Even a small failure rate of the more than 50,000 \n     upgraded tanks, we believe constitutes a good water quality \n     reason to eliminate MTBE from gasoline,'' he said.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 646. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nincreased retirement savings opportunities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               retirement savings opportunity act of 1999\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one question many Americans ask \nthemselves is this: Will I have enough to live on when I retire. \nAccording to a study published by the Employee Benefit Research \nInstitute, about one third of Americans are not confident that they \nwill have enough to live on in their retirement years. Social Security \nis an important component of an individual's retirement income, but \nsavings--whether through personal accounts or through employer-provided \nretirement plans--will help provide for a better life at retirement. \nAnother troubling factor is that if you are employed by a small \nbusiness you are far less likely to be eligible for a retirement plan. \nThere must be ways to get more Americans interested in providing for \ntheir retirement years and to get small businesses interested in \nproviding retirement benefits for their employees. This is a concern \nthat spreads across party lines; everyone knows that there must be \nincentives for promoting retirement savings.\n  Despite these concerns, we have a strong system of tax favored \nsavings plans in place. For savings through the workplace, there are \n401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and 457 plans, each of which can be \nsponsored by different types of employers. For individual savings, \nthere is either the traditional IRA or the Roth IRA. And all these \ndifferent savings vehicles have different limits on how much \nindividuals can save. However, our current system can do more and the \nlimitations that we placed on retirement savings in times of budgetary \nrestraints should be re-examined now. In addition, we should capitalize \non some of the successful savings incentives and use them to broaden \nour savings base.\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\n  Both Senator Baucus and I are pleased to introduce a new bill, the \nRetirement Savings Opportunity Act of 1999, which will build upon the \nstrengths of our current system, yet provide new opportunities for \npeople to save for retirement. In addition, this bill would also \nincrease the incentives that would help small businesses start and \nmaintain retirement plans for its employees. These are issues that \nSenator Baucus is very concerned about and I join him in providing \nthese important incentives for small businesses. The provisions of this \nbill are as follows:\n  Increase IRA dollar limit. The maximum contribution limit for IRAs \n(both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs) is $2,000. This limit, which has \nbeen in place since 1982, has never been indexed for inflation. If the \nIRA limit were indexed for inflation it would be close to $5,000. In \nthis bill, the limit for all IRAs (both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs) \nwill be increased to $5,000 per year. In addition, this limit will be \nadjusted annually for cost of living increases, in $100 increments, so \nthat the amount that taxpayers can save with an IRA will never again be \nreduced due to the impact of cost of living increases.\n\n  It is important to remember who makes IRA contributions. An estimated \n26 percent of American households how own a traditional IRA, according \nto a 1998 survey by the Investment Company Institute. In 1993 (the most \nrecent year for which comprehensive aggregate data is available) 52 \npercent of all IRA owners earned less than $50,000. This same group \nmade about 65 percent of all IRA contributions in 1985.\n  We know that people at all income levels are limited by the $2,000 \ncap on contributions. For example, IRS statistics show that the average \ncontribution level in 1993 for people with less than $20,000 in income \nwas $1,500. Clearly this means that there were lower income people who \nwanted to make contributions of more than the $2,000 limit.\n  In addition, IRAs are the only tax-favored savings vehicle for many \ntaxpayers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 48 percent \nof individuals who work in small business establishments were eligible \nfor any retirement plan in 1994. This is a problem that both Senator \nBaucus and I try to address elsewhere in this bill by providing greater \nincentives to business for establishing employer-sponsored retirement \nsavings plans. However, regardless of the incentives that we may \nprovide, not all employers will establish retirement plans for their \nemployees. Furthermore, not all employees will stay with one employer \nlong enough to receive a benefit. Under current law, the maximum amount \nthat an individual can save is too low to provide adequate savings for \nretirement. In order to spur an increase in savings, we believe that an \nincrease in the IRA limit is warranted.\n  Increase IRA income caps. There are different and confusing caps on \ncontributions to traditional and Roth IRAs. They are as follows:\n  Tax deductible contributions to traditional IRAs. If an individual is \nan active participant in an employer provided pension plan, the amount \nof a deductible contribution that an individual can make is confusing. \nFirst of all the $2,000 contribution amount is reduced if the adjusted \ngross income of the taxpayer is over $51,000, if the taxpayer is filing \na joint return. If the taxpayer is a single or head of household filer, \nthe $2,000 contribution amount is reduced if adjusted gross income \nexceeds $31,000. These income limits are scheduled to increase annually \nuntil the year 2007 when the joint filer limit will be $80,000 and the \nsingle and head of household filer limit will be $50,000. Married \ntaxpayers who file separately are precluded from making deductible \ncontributions if their adjusted gross income is above $10,000, unless \nthe couple has not lived together for the entire year. Finally, if an \nindividual is not an active participant in an employer's plan and the \nindividual's spouse is, an individual is not able to make a deductible \ncontribution to an IRA if the couple's income is $150,000 or above. \nThese are too many restrictions.\n  The bill will eliminate these conflicting and confusing income limits \nfor deductible IRAs. What this will mean is that all individuals who \nhave earned income can make full deductible contributions to a \ntraditional IRA. In addition, a homemaker without earnings will be able \nto make IRA contributions.\n  Contributions to Roth IRAs. A full $2,000 contribution can only be \nmade to a Roth IRA if a single taxpayer's adjusted gross income is less \nthan $95,000 and married taxpayer's adjusted gross income is less than \n$150,000. If a taxpayer is married and files separately from his or her \nspouse, the taxpayer cannot make a Roth IRA contribution if his or her \nadjusted gross income exceeds $10,000, unless they live apart for the \nentire year. The bill will eliminate these income limits for Roth IRA \ncontributions, so that all taxpayers can make a contribution to a Roth \nIRA. Remember, however, that a taxpayer cannot make a full contribution \nto a Roth IRA and also make a full contribution to a traditional IRA; \namounts contributed to one type of IRA reduce the amounts that can be \ncontributed to the other type of IRA.\n  Conversion to Roth IRAs. In order to convert to a Roth IRA, an \nindividual's adjusted gross income must not exceed $100,000 regardless \nof whether the individual is married filing jointly or single. Married \nindividuals who are filing separately cannot convert to a Roth IRA, \nunless they live apart for the entire year. The bill will raise the \nincome cap for conversions to $1 million.\n  The current income limitations relating to IRAs are needlessly \ncomplex and are confusing to taxpayers. As we heard at the recent \nSenate Finance Committee hearing on retirement savings, these limits \nare confusing to taxpayers with the result that taxpayers do not fully \nutilize these products. By eliminating these income limitations, which \naffect only a small percentage of taxpayers, we can increase the use of \nIRAs. When Congress restricted the deductibility of IRA contributions \nin 1986, the IRS reported that the level of IRA contributions fell from \n$38 billion to $14 billion in 1987.\n  Will taxpayers increase the amount of their savings to IRAs if the \nsavings opportunities were increased? According to a 1997 survey \nconducted on behalf of the Savings Coalition, increasing the IRA limits \nwould result in more savings for retirement. Sixty-four percent said \nthat they would increase the rate of their personal savings with IRAs.\n  Economic studies also have shown that increasing the tax incentives \nfor savings should result in substantial increases in savings due to \nincreases in the net return. See, for example, Lawrence H. Summers, \n``Capital Taxation and Accumulation in a Life Cycle Growth Model,'' \nAmerican Economic Review, 71, September 1981. The staff of the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation noted in its description of Present Law and \nBackground Relating to Tax Incentives for Savings prepared for the \nFinance Committee hearing (JCX-7-99), there are many reasons for this \nincrease in savings due to increased limits, including the \npsychological incentives to save and the increased advertising by banks \nand other financial institutions of tax-benefitted savings vehicles may \ninfluence people's savings decisions.\n  Increase other dollar-based benefit limitations. Currently, the \nmaximum pre-tax contribution to a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity is \n$10,000. In addition, the maximum contribution to a 457(b) plan (a \nsalary deferral plan for employees of government and tax exempt \norganizations) is $8,000. Finally, the maximum contribution to a SIMPLE \nplan (a simplified defined contribution plan available only to small \nemployers) is $6,000. These limits are indexed for cost of living \nincreases. There has traditionally been a differential in contribution \nlimits among the various types of plans: IRAs (which are individual \nplans) having the lowest limits; SIMPLE plans having a greater limit--\nbut not as much as a 401(k) plan; and 401(k) and 403(b) plans having \nthe highest limits, but the greatest number of regulations. Since the \nIRA limit will be raised to $5,000, the bill will increase limits for \n401(k) and 403(b) plans to $15,000 and for SIMPLE plans to $10,000; \nthereby continuing the differential. The limit for 457(b) plans for \ngovernment employees will increase to $12,000.\n  As stated before, there is a clear need to increase the IRA limit \nabove the current $2,000 contribution level. But increasing that level \nwithout increasing the savings opportunity levels for\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nemployer provided plans will result in some business owners eliminating \ntheir employer provided plans and saving only for themselves in an IRA. \nBy increasing the employer provided plan limits, business owners will \nstill have the incentive to maintain a plan for employees if only to \navail themselves of the higher plan limits for employer provided plans.\n  This does not mean that business executives can automatically take \nadvantage of these higher contribution limits. First, it is important \nto remember that contributions can only be made on the first $160,000 \nof compensation. In addition, in order for a business owner or other \nhighly compensated employee to take advantage of these limits, a number \nof non-highly compensated employees must also benefit under the plan. \nAn example should show how these non-discrimination rules work. In a \ncompany, there is one person--let's say the owner of the business--who \nmakes over $160,000 and that person wants to contribute the full \n$15,000 to the company 401(k) plan. He could only contribute the full \n$15,000 if (i) low paid employees as a group contribute 8% of their \ncompensation to the 401(k) plan, (ii) all low paid employees receive a \nfully vested contribution from the employer equal to 3% of their \ncompensation or (iii) all low paid employees would be eligible to \nreceive matching contributions of 100% of their contribution to the \n401(k) plan of their first 3% contribution and 50% of their next 2% of \ncompensation contribution. Clearly, business owners and high paid \nemployees cannot benefit with this new higher contribution limits \nunless the amount of savings that low paid people make--either on their \nown or with the help of the employer--increases.\n  Roth 401(k) or 403(b) plan. We have heard testimony before the \nFinance Committee that the results of the first year of the Roth IRA \nhas been successful. And we have all seen the television and print ads \ntouting the benefits of the Roth IRA. The opportunity for tax-free \ninvestment returns has clearly caught the fancy of the American people. \nIn less than five months after the Roth IRA became available, the \nInvestment Company Institute estimated that approximately 3 percent of \nAmerican households owned a Roth IRA. In addition, the survey found \nthat the typical Roth IRA owner was 37 years old, significantly younger \nthan the traditional IRA owner who is about 50 years old, and that 30 \npercent of Roth IRA owners indicated that the Roth IRA was the first \nIRA they had ever owned. This bill will harness the power of the Roth \nIRA and give it to participants in 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans.\n  Companies will have the opportunity to give participants in 401(k) \nplans and 403(b) plans the ability to contribute to these plans on an \nafter-tax basis, with the earnings on such contributions being tax-free \nwhen distributed, like the Roth IRA. More than the maximum Roth IRA \ncontribution amount can be contributed under this option; employees \nwould be limited to the maximum 401(k) or 403(b) contribution amount. \nThe regular non-discrimination rules that apply to 401(k) and 403(b) \nplans will also apply to these after-tax contributions. Consequently, \nin order for business owners and highly compensated employees to take \nfull advantage of these new savings opportunities, low paid employees \nmust also benefit.\n  The regular distribution rules (rather than the Roth IRA distribution \nrules) would apply to these types of plans. However, these after-tax \naccounts could be rolled into a Roth IRA when the individual retires. \nAnd unlike Roth IRAs, there would not be an opportunity for 401(k) or \n403(b) plan participant to convert their current 401(k) and 403(b) \naccount balances into the new non-taxable balances.\n  Catch-up contributions. This provision will provide an additional \nsavings opportunity to those individuals who are close to retirement. \nAccording to a study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, older \nworkers tend to have their contributions constrained by maximum limits \nwhich are either plan limits on how much can be contributed or legal \nlimits on how much can be contributed. EBRI believes that this is \nprobably due to the fact that they are more focused on retirement and \nare thus more likely to contribute at a higher level. We all know that \nthere can be other pressing financial needs earlier in life--school \nloans, home loans, taking time off to raise the kids--which limit the \namount that we may have available to save for retirement. The closer \nthat we get to retirement, the more we want to put away for those years \nwhen we are not working. However, the current law limitations on how \nmuch may be contributed to tax qualified savings vehicles may restrict \npeople's ability to save at this time in their lives.\n\n  The bill will give those who are near retirement--age 50--the \nopportunity to contribute an additional amount in excess of the annual \nlimits equal to an additional 50% of the annual limit. Catch-up \ncontributions will be allowed in 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, 457(b) \nplans and IRAs. For IRAs, this will mean that someone age 50 could \ncontribute $7,500 each year rather than $5,000.\n  For employer provided plans, the catch contribution will be available \nto anyone who is age 50 or above and who is limited in the amount that \nhe or she can contribute to the plan by a plan limit, the maximum \ncontribution limit or the nondiscrimination rules that apply to highly \npaid employees. This additional catch-up contributions to employer \nprovided plan will not be subject to the normal non-discrimination \nrules for other contributions. Consequently, if a highly paid employee \nis limited by the nondiscrimination rules to only contributing $9,000 \nto a 401(k) plan, the employee will be able to contribute an additional \n$7,500 annually in the years after he attains age 50. This way, an \nemployee is able to make contributions to provide for his or her \nretirement security when he or she is best able to afford to make these \ncontributions and not be limited because other younger employees do not \nmake contributions.\n  Small business incentives. According to the most recent Bureau of \nLabor Statistics figures, only 48 percent of employees in a small \nbusiness are likely to be covered by any retirement plan, while 78 \npercent of employees of large or medium size businesses are likely to \nbe covered. Since employees of small businesses are less likely to be \ncovered by a retirement plan, we needed to find incentives for small \nbusinesses to want to establish plans. This is an issue that Senator \nBaucus is particularly interested in and these small business \nincentives represent some of his ideas on how to expand the small \nbusiness market for retirement plans. The bill will assist small \nbusinesses in establishing retirement plans in the following ways:\n  Tax credit for start-up costs. A non-refundable tax credit of up to \n$500 would be available to small businesses with up to 100 employees to \ndefray the administrative costs of establishing a new retirement plan. \nThis credit would only be available for the first three years of \noperation of the plan. This credit could be carried back for one year \nor forward for 20 years (the general business credit carryover rules).\n\n  Tax credit for contributions. A non-refundable tax credit equal to \n50% of employer contributions made on behalf of non-highly compensated \nemployees would be available to small businesses with 50 or less \nemployees during the first 5 years of a plan's operation. Only \ncontributions of not more than 3% of compensation are eligible for the \ncredit. This credit could be carried back for one year or forward for \n20 years.\n  Small business defined benefit plan. This plan will provide employees \nof small businesses with a secure, fully portable, defined retirement \nbenefit without imposing the complex rules and regulations of normal \ndefined benefit plans. This plan, called the Savings Are For Everyone \n(SAFE) plan, will provide a fully vested benefit that is fully funded, \nusing conservative actuarial assumptions. The benefit will be based on \nan employee's salary and years of service and could be structured so \nthat years of service prior to the establishment of the plan can be \nused in determining the benefit--which helps older, long service \nemployees. The SAFE plan is meant to complement the successful SIMPLE \ndefined contribution plan that is available for small businesses.\n  Elimination of 25 percent of compensation limitation. Currently, the \nmaximum amount that can be contributed to a defined contribution plan \non behalf of an individual participant is the lesser of $30,000 or 25 \npercent of\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\ncompensation. This includes both employee contribution and any matching \ncontributions or profit sharing contributions made by the plan sponsor. \nThis bill will eliminate the 25 percent of compensation limit, so that \nthe maximum contribution that is made on behalf of any individual is \n$30,000. With the additional savings opportunities provided for all \nemployees under this bill, it would be much more likely for employees--\nespecially low paid employees--to exceed this 25 percent of \ncompensation limitation. This change will make sure that those \nemployees will not be limited in fully providing for their retirement \nsecurity, especially, if the employer also contributes toward the \nemployee's retirement plan.\n  Tax deduction for employee deferrals. Under current law, an employee \npre-tax deferral is treated as employer contribution and is subject to \nthe limits on how much an employer can take as a tax deduction on \nqualified plan contributions. With the increased amount of pre-tax \nsavings that we anticipate employees will make after enactment of this \nbill, there is a concern that the maximum limit on deductible \ncontributions will be reached. This bill will permit employer to fully \ndeduct any employee pre-tax deferrals, without regard to the maximum \nlimit on deductions. Other employer contributions to a plan, however, \nwill continue to be subject to this deduction limitation.\n  IRA contributions to an employer plan. The bill gives employers the \nopportunity to accept traditional IRA contributions as part of their \nregular employer plan. In addition, it gives employees the ability to \nhave IRA contributions made directly to the employer-sponsored IRA as a \npayroll deduction. One advantage of using an employer plan as an IRA \naccount is that the administrative costs in an employer plan are \nusually much less than the costs in a privately maintained plan. \nAnother advantage is that contributions to the IRA will be made on a \npayroll deduction basis, which makes it more likely that the \ncontributions will be made.\n  Full funding limit increase. Defined benefit pension plans are also \nan important source of retirement income. Currently, amounts that can \nbe deducted as contributions to a pension plan is limited to the lesser \nof the actuarial funding requirement amount or 150 percent of the \ncurrent liability amount of the plan. The current liability amount does \nnot take into account projected pension benefits. This 150 percent of \ncurrent liability limitation is eliminated in this bill. This will \nresult in better funded pension plans, since the articial limitation of \n150 percent of current liability no longer applies.\n  Both Senator Baucus and I hope that other Senators will join us in \nthis effort to increase savings opportunities for all working \nAmericans.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, \nSenator Roth, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and fellow \nMontanan, in introducing this important bill. Mr. President, I have \nagreed to join Chairman Roth in introducing this bill for one reason--I \nbelieve we must increase the level of personal savings in our country.\n  Personal savings have been on a precipitous decline during the last 2 \ndecades. Net personal savings have dropped from 9.3% of Gross Domestic \nProduct in the 1970's to one-half of one percent in 1999. This is the \nlowest rate of personal savings since 1933. If we are to reverse this \ndecline, and help Americans plan for their retirement years, we must \ncreate a culture of savings in our country.\n  The Retirement Savings Opportunity Act is one piece of a much broader \neffort to reverse this trend. Another important part of this puzzle is \nrepresented by the package of regulatory reforms I have been working on \nwith Senators Graham and Grassley, in a bill that will be introduced \nshortly. Yet another approach is represented by the President's \nproposal to create Universal Savings Accounts for all working \nAmericans. I support the President's commitment to dedicate a portion \nof our projected budget surpluses to helping Americans save for their \nretirement, though I am modifying his proposal to take advantage of our \nexisting pension system and enhance it. All of these proposals, when \ntaken together in a comprehensive package, will help Americans of all \nincome levels save for the future.\n  My particular concern is in pension coverage for small businesses and \ntheir employees. Less than one in every five Americans working for \nsmall businesses have access to pension plans through their workplace. \nThis represents 40 million working Americans who do not have pension \ncoverage. And since virtually all of the net new jobs being created in \nthis country are being created by small businesses, their retirement \nsecurity must not be neglected. We simply must make it easier for small \nbusinesses to start pension plans, and to provide pension coverage to \ntheir employees.\n  I am particularly pleased with the small business incentives included \nin the Retirement Savings Opportunity Act. This bill contains a tax \ncredit to help defray the administrative costs small businesses incur \nwhen they start up new pension plans. It also includes an additional \ntax credit as an incentive for small business owners who contribute \nmoney on behalf of their employees into new plans. Finally, the bill \nincludes a new, simplified defined benefit plan for small businesses. \nThese are not by any means the only ways we can help small businesses \nprovide pensions for their workers, but they are a good start down that \nroad. The increased limits that are included in the bill will also help \nthis process by making it easier for employers to save, thus making it \nmore likely they will also provide benefits to their lower paid \nworkers.\n  I am very excited that we are finally engaging in a public policy \ndebate about retirement security. Only by elevating this debate to the \nhighest levels will we be able to make the changes necessary to truly \nmake the American dream a reality for everyone. We must help Americans \nmake their Golden Years truly golden, so they can look forward to a \nsecure financial future. This bill, as part of a comprehensive solution \nthat includes other proposals directed toward lower-income workers, \nwill help make retirement security a reality for all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham)\n  S. 647. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict judges in the State of Florida, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE FLORIDA FEDERAL JUDGESHIP ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today with \nmy esteemed colleague and friend, Senator Graham, to introduce the \nFlorida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. I would not be here today if I \ndid not wholeheartedly believe that the problem facing the court system \nin the Middle and Southern Districts of Florida is one of the most \nacute judgeship problems in the nation. If judicial resources are not \nincreased in these two districts, the problem will become irreversible. \nMr. President, the situation that presently exists in Florida rises to \nthe level of an emergency and thus, the problem needs attention today.\n  The legislation that Senator Graham and I are introducing would \ncreate seven new judgeships for the state of Florida. The Middle \nDistrict would receive five new permanent judgeships, and the Southern \nDistrict would receive two new permanent judgeships. These numbers were \nofficially recommended by the United States Judicial Conference earlier \nthis week.\n  The Middle District of Florida is nearly 400 miles, spanning from the \nGeorgia border on the northeast side to the south of Naples on the \nsouthwest coast of Florida. This district includes, among others, the \ncities of Jacksonville, Orlando, and Tampa. The Southern District \nencompasses Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, along with other cities in the \nsouthern portion of the state.\n  Additional judgeship positions have not been created for these \ndistricts since 1990. Since this time, the Middle District alone has \nhad a 62 percent increase in the total number of cases filed. Moreover, \nFlorida's population has increased nearly twice as fast as the nation \nduring the 1990s. By 2025, the United States Census Bureau projects \nFlorida will surpass New York as the third largest state with 20.7 \nmillion residents.\n  Each year, Florida becomes a winter home to people from all over the \nUnited States and the world. In addition, the Middle and Southern \nDistricts\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nare home to major tourist attractions such as Disney World, Universal \nStudios, Sea World, Busch Gardens, and South Beach. The heavy flow of \nboth winter residents and tourism, along with Florida's growing number \nof permanent residents, causes the needs of these two judicial \ndistricts to be unique in this nation.\n  In addition, the Middle District contains the federal correctional \ncenter at Coleman. When the penitentiary is completed in Spring 2001, \nthis will be one of the largest prison complexes in the country and the \nlargest in the state of Florida. The capacity at Coleman will be \napproximately 4,700 inmates and all complaints filed by these prisoners \nregarding the facilities and their individual care will be sent to the \nMiddle District for resolution.\n  To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been \ndesignated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased \nthat Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against \ndrugs, we also must recognize that this law enforcement initiative is \nexpected to dramatically impact narcotic related arrests and therefore, \nprosecutions in the Middle District.\n  Thus, it is apparent that without the addition of new judges, access \nto justice will no longer be swift in the Middle and Southern \nDistricts. To provide Floridians with a safe environment and access to \njustice, a court system must be put in place which can handle the \ndemands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. Accordingly, I \nurge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and pass \nthis legislation expeditiously.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with \nmy distinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, in introducing \nthe Florida Federal Judgeship Act of 1999. This legislation will create \nseven additional U.S. District Court judgeships in Florida--two in the \nSouthern District and five--in the fast-growing Middle District of \nFlorida.\n  I want to thank Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, for his recognition of the overcrowding problem facing \nFlorida's federal district courts and for his good-faith pledge to work \nwith Senator Grassley to consider this issue early this year. I look \nforward to working with all my Senate colleagues in considering this \nimportant issue.\n  Because our number of judgeships is too small to meet the increasing \ndemand of Florida's rapidly growing population, judges face \noverwhelming caseloads. Prosecutors and law-enforcement personnel are \nstymied in their efforts to mete out swift justice. Civil litigants are \nforced to endure unreasonable waits to bring their cases to resolution.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake: Florida's federal courts are in the \nmidst of a full-blown crisis. Prominent legal and judicial officials \nall over Florida have told us that this is not a tenable situation. But \nFloridians are not alone in their concern about overcrowded court \ndockets in the Southern and Middle Districts of Florida. Yesterday, \nMarch 16th, the Judicial Conference of the United States--the principal \npolicy-making body of the federal judiciary, which is chaired by the \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court and composed of federal judges from \nthroughout the United States--asked Congress to create 33 permanent and \n25 temporary additional district judgeships. Senator Mack and I are \nintroducing our bill so that Congress can meet the needs of Florida by \nproviding the additional judicial resources needed for these two U.S. \nDistrict Courts to meet their increasing caseload.\n  On three previous occasions since 1976, Congress has authorized new \nFederal judgeships in numbers that each time exceeded the request of \nthe Judicial Conference thus recognizing the dire needs of our court \nsystems. The last recommendation, made in March of 1997, followed \nrecommendations that were unheeded in September of 1992 and September \nof 1994. There have simply been no new judgeships since December 1, \n1990. We cannot allow this new request to go unheeded again.\n  Mr. President, many states have justifiable concerns about \novercrowded federal district court dockets. However the urgent nature \nof Florida's judicial crisis makes our state a special case. Its \nSouthern and Middle Districts deserve immediate attention for three \nmain reasons.\n  First, Florida has one of the highest caseloads per judge in the \nnation, a condition that has continued to worsen over the last year. \nCurrently, the Judicial Conference has proposed all recommendations for \nincreased judgeship based on weighted filings--a number that takes into \naccount both the total number of cases filed per judge and the average \nlevel of case complexity. Currently the standard for each Federal \ndistrict judge is 430 weighted cases per year. When the caseload \nexceeds 430, that district is entitled to be reviewed for purposes of \nan additional judge.\n\n  As of September 30, 1998, the Southern District's weighted filings \nstood at 608 per judge. This is 41 percent above the standard and 18 \npercent above the national average of 516 weighted filing per judge. In \nthe Middle District, the story was even worse--805 weighted filings per \njudge, a figure that ranks sixth highest in the entire nation. Middle \nDistrict's weighted filings per judge from September 1996 to September \n1998, a two year period, jumped from 45 percent above the standard to \n87 percent above the standard and 56 percent above the national \naverage.\n  As of January 30, 1999, over 1,100 criminal defendants have cases \npending in the Middle District. The story is even worse on the civil \nside of the docket, where more than 5,900 cases have yet to receive \nfinal disposition. Florida's caseload isn't going to experience a \nslowdown in growth anytime soon, and the judicial backlog will get \nworse unless Congress takes preventative action for the long-term.\n  Second, this legislation recognizes that Florida's largest federal \njudicial districts are responsible for a massive area that includes \nnearly 80 percent of Florida residents. Last year the state's \npopulation reached 15 million, growing 15.9 percent since the 1990 \ncensus of 12.9 million. The Southern and Middle Districts combined \njurisdiction stretches from key West--the southernmost city in the \ncontinental United States--north to include Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West \nPalm Beach, Melbourne, Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa, St. Petersburg, \nOrlando, and Jacksonville.\n  Between 1980 and 1995, the Middle District grew by a whopping 52%. It \nis expected to increase by an addition 21% in the next decade. However, \nsince 1990, the last time the Judicial Conference recommended and \nCongress approved more judges for Florida, our U.S. District Courts \nhave not received any additional resources from the federal government \nto cope with that growth.\n  Third, this proposal will assist the work of law enforcement \nofficials and personnel. If we are committed to ensuring that criminals \nface punishment in a swift manner, we must be willing to provide \nresources to all aspects of the judicial system.\n  In both of these districts, drug prosecutions and other serious \ncriminal cases make up a large percentage of the overall caseload. For \nexample, both the Southern and Middle Districts contain High intensity \nDrug Trafficking Areas (HITDAs). These anti-drug zones generate a \nsubstantial number of lengthy, multi-defendant prosecutions, and the \nadditional of judges will help law enforcement officials and \nprosecutors in their fight against drug crimes.\n  In addition, federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials \nthroughout Florida, but especially in the Southern District, are being \nforced to spend more time combatting the cheats, fly-by-night \noperators, and other criminals who are engaged in a systematic campaign \nto defraud Medicare and other health care programs. It has been \nestimated that nearly twenty percent of all Medicare dollars spent in \nSouth Florida are lost to fraud. In fact, nearly 30 percent of all \nMedicare fraud nationwide takes place in Florida.\n\n  Mr. President, it is vital that we act quickly to resolve this \ncrisis. From 1990, in Middle District, and 1993, in Southern District, \nthe total number of filings have gone up 62 percent. With a state \npopulation growth rate predicted to exceed 300,000 residents per year, \nthese trends are unlikely to reverse. The addition of these judgeships \nwill still leave both districts well above the weighted filings per \njudgeship standard.\n  U.S. Federal District Courts are the first stop for all citizens \ninvolved in the federal judicial system. Most federal cases are \ndisposed at this level and\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nit is essential that these citizens have their claims heard in a timely \nmanner. Congress and the White House must be vigilant in their shared \nresponsibility for recommending, nominating, and confirming federal \njudicial nominees. Senator Hatch's leadership, and his determination to \naddress Florida's special needs, are very much appreciated by the \nresidents of our state.\n  Our legislation is simple, sound, and will serve the interests of all \nFloridians. I look forward to working with Senator Mack and members of \nthe Judiciary Committee on this matter. I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport the passage of this much needed legislation. Further delay in \nthis matter will only serve to deny timely justice for thousands of \ncrime victims and civil litigants in Florida's Southern and Middle \nJudicial Districts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I have received from Chief \nJudge Edward B. Davis of the Southern District of Florida be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     United States District Court,\n\n\n                                 Southern District of Florida,\n\n                                     Miami, FL, February 23, 1999.\n     Hon. D. Robert Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to reaffirm our need for \n     the two additional judgeships this court has been seeking \n     since 1995. The Judicial Conference approved that request in \n     1996 and reaffirmed it in 1998. It did so based on the \n     weighted filings per judgeship. During the last three years, \n     the weighted filings per judgeship have averaged 601 which is \n     171 filings above the standard of 430 per judgeship.\n       The Conference Committee on Judicial Statistics again \n     analyzed the Judiciary's judgeship needs last year and again \n     recommended to the Judicial Conference the two additional \n     judgeships. The following are the highlights of that \n     analysis:\n       Since 1993, filings have increased by more than 50%. Most \n     of the increase has been in civil cases which have risen 62 \n     percent;\n       Prisoner petitions have nearly doubled since 1993;\n       Criminal filings have fluctuated over the last five years, \n     growing to a high of 102 per judgeship in 1996 (this figure \n     will be even higher in the present statistical year based on \n     current trends);\n       The heavy criminal caseload is reflected in both the \n     weighted filings and the number of lengthy trials;\n       Over the last three years, the Court has averaged 34 trials \n     per year in excess of 10 days, with an average of 9 in excess \n     of 20 days (almost 10% of the Federal Judiciary's total);\n       With the addition of two judgeships, the Court's weighted \n     filings per judgeship would only fall to approximately 520, \n     still well above the standard of 430.\n       I also note that in the Southern District we: had 57% more \n     criminal trials than the next highest district (Central \n     California) in the federal system; and had more criminal \n     cases pending in 1998 in the Southern District than in 92 \n     other federal district courts and in the entire 1st and 7th \n     Circuits.\n       Despite your incredible assistance in filing our judicial \n     vacancies, we have not had a full complement of Judges since \n     October of 1988. I think the ongoing impact of the vacancies \n     and the above data continues to support this Court's need for \n     the two additional judgeships that were requested in 1995 as \n     part of the 1996 Biennial Judgeship Survey.\n       If you have any questions or need additional information, \n     please telephone me at (305) 523-5150.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Edward B. Davis,\n                                              Chief Judge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 648. A bill to provide for the protection of employees providing \nair safety information; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                     aviation safety protection act\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Aviation \nSafety Protection Act of 1999 with Senator Grassley to increase overall \nsafety of the airline industry by establishing whistleblower protection \nfor aviation workers. I am honored to work on this important issue with \nSenator Grassley, who has long been a leader on whistleblower \nlegislation.\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) properly protects both \nprivate and federal government employees who report health and safety \nviolations from reprisal by their employers. However, because of a \nloophole, aviation employees are not covered by these protections. \nFlight attendants and other airline employees are in the best position \nto recognize breaches in safety regulations and can be the critical \nlink in ensuring safer air travel. Currently, those employees who work \nfor unscrupulous airlines face the possibility of harassment, negative \ndisciplinary action, and even termination if they report violations.\n  Aviation employees perform an important public service when they \nchoose to report safety concerns. No employee should be put in the \nposition of having to choose between his or her job and reporting \nviolations that threaten the safety of passengers and crew. For that \nreason, we need a strong whistleblower law to protect aviation \nemployees from retaliation by their employers when reporting incidents \nto federal authorities. Americans who travel on commercial airlines \ndeserve the safeguards that exist when flight attendants and other \nairline employees can step forward to help federal authorities enforce \nsafety laws.\n  This bill would provide the necessary protections for aviation \nemployees who provide safety violation information to federal \nauthorities or testify about or assist in disclosure of safety \nviolations. This legislation provides a Department of Labor complaint \nprocedure for employees who experience employer reprisal for reporting \nsuch violations, and assures that there are strong enforcement and \njudicial review provisions for fair implementation of the protections.\n  I want to acknowledge the leadership of Representative Sherwood \nBoehlert, Republican from New York, and Representative James Clyburn, \nDemocrat from South Carolina, who have introduced the companion bill in \nthe House. I also want to thank the Administration for their support of \nthis legislation.\n  This bill will provide important protections to aviation workers and \nthe general public. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin Senator Grassley and me in supporting it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the test of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two \npieces of legislation that I believe would represent a giant step \nforward for working Americans. The first bill, which I am calling the \n``Safer Workplaces Act of 1999,'' contains four provisions that would \nextend health and safety protections for workers in the workplace. The \nsecond bill, the ``Right to Organize Act of 1999,'' would go a long way \ntoward correcting some of the flagrant abuses\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nof the law that have resulted in workers being denied their right to \norganize and bargain collectively.\n\n\n                    The Safer Workplaces Act of 1999\n\n  In recent years some of my colleagues have argued that the \nOccupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act already goes too far in \nprotecting the right of employees to work in a safe and healthy \nenvironment. I have a different view. I believe that, in several \nfundamental ways, the OSH Act does not go far enough.\n  There are still too many workers injured on the job in America today. \nThere are still too many tragic cases of workers losing their lives \nbecause their employers deliberately chose to break the law. When \nworkers go to work in the morning, they have every right to expect that \nthey'll come home at night in one piece--not maimed or killed on the \njob because of their employer's wrongdoing. I don't think that's a lot \nto ask.\n  Of course it's not. In fact, I know many of my Republican friends \ncouldn't agree more. This is not, and should not be, a partisan issue. \nThe four provisions of my ``Safer Workplaces Act,'' which I am also \nintroducing individually as separate legislation, have all enjoyed \nbipartisan support in the past. I don't see any reason why they \nshouldn't enjoy bipartisan support in this Congress, as well. I hope we \ncan sidestep some of the more bitter controversies surrounding the OSH \nAct and focus instead on meaningful changes that will make a real \ndifference in the lives of American workers.\n  The first provision in my Safer Workplaces Act, which I am \nintroducing separately as the ``Safety and Health Whistleblowers \nProtection Act,'' would encourage employees to step forward and \nidentify hazards in the workplace without fear of retaliation from \ntheir employers. In theory, workers are already protected from \nretaliation under Section 11(c) of the OSH Act, but we know that this \nprotection is all too often meaningless. As Assistant Secretary of \nLabor Charles Jeffress recently testified before the Employment, \nSafety, and Training Subcommittee, ``The provisions in place today in \nSection 11(c) of the Act are too weak and too cumbersome to discourage \nemployer retaliation or to provide an effective remedy for the victims \nof retaliation.''\n  Many, if not most, employees are simply afraid that they'll be \npunished or fired if they complain. And they have every reason to be \nafraid. In 1997 the Labor Department's Inspector General, Charles C. \nMasten, concluded that\n\n       Workers, particularly with small companies, are vulnerable\n       to reprisals by their employers for complaining about\n       unsafe, unhealthy work conditions. The severity of the\n       discrimination is highlighted by the fact that for 653 \n     cases\n       included in our sample, nearly 67 percent of the workers \n     who\n       filed complaints were terminated from their jobs.\n\nThe IG further found that workers who complain to their employer \nfirst--rather than to OSHA--are particularly vulnerable; that workers \nin small firms are the most vulnerable; that employer retaliation is \noften severe, most frequently in the form of firing; that OSHA \nprocedures to investigate complaints are inadequate; that there are \nsignificant delays in OSHA's decisionmaking in 11(c) cases; and that \nthe Department is failing to seek effective remedies for employees.\n  GAO reached similar conclusions. Of the Compliance Safety and Health \nOfficers (CSHOs) surveyed by GAO, 26 percent thought workers have \nlittle or no protection when they report violations to OSHA. According \nto almost 50 percent of these officers, workers themselves believe they \nhave little or no protection. But only 10 percent thought workers faced \nno real danger of retaliation.\n  When employees are too intimidated to identify workplace dangers, we \nend up with workplaces that are more dangerous than they should be. The \nLabor Department Inspector General concluded that, ``Based on the \nworker termination rates in the 11(c) cases, many employers are not \nreceptive to requests for abatement of workplace hazards and feel free \nto discipline workers who seek abatement.'' So hazards go unreported \nand more workers get injured or killed.\n  The problems with Section 11(c) are widely acknowledged. In the 103rd \nCongress, the House Education and Labor Committee issued a stinging \ncritique of current law, and many of its criticisms were echoed by OSHA \nitself in 1998. These are some of the shortcomings they identified. \nThere's too little time for workers to file a complaint, since many \ndon't even learn of their legal rights within 30 days of retaliation. \nThere's no protection for employees who refuse to work when they have \ngood reason to think they're in danger. Workers have to rely on the \nDepartment to take their cases to court, and there are no real time \nlimits for doing that. While their cases are pending, workers have no \njob and no paycheck. And there are no penalties for employers who \nretaliate against workers.\n  My legislation is designed to correct these flaws. It gives workers 6 \nmonths, rather than 30 days, to file a grievance for retaliation. It \nprotects not only workers who report unsafe conditions, but also \nemployees who refuse to work when they have good reason to think they \nmight be harmed or injured. To expedite the process, my bill provides \nfor prompt hearings before an administrative law judge. It would allow \ndissatisfied workers to then take their case to a federal appeals court \nthemselves, not having to rely on the Department. And it would provide \nfor reinstatement during these proceedings, as well as compensatory \ndamages and exemplary damages when the employer's behavior has been \nparticularly outrageous.\n  These common-sense improvements should not be contentious or \ncontroversial. In fact, a bipartisan consensus has already emerged in \nsupport of similar whistleblower reforms. In July 1988, Reagan \nAdministration Secretary of Labor Ann McLaughlin recommended \nlegislation allowing airline employees to refuse work when they have a \nreasonable belief that they might be injured or killed, as well as \nproviding a six month grievance filing period, hearings before an \nadministrative law judge, and a temporary reinstatement remedy. Labor \nSecretary Elizabeth Dole agreed that ``limitation periods shorter than \n180 days have proved too short for effective protection of \nwhistleblower rights.''\n  In 1989 President Bush said that reinstatement must be available for \nwhistleblowers in cases involving waste, fraud, and abuse because \n``Standard make-whole remedies * * * will be meaningless, in practice, \nif whistleblowers are crushed personally and financially while \nlegitimate complaints are caught in procedural limbo.'' In 1991, Gerard \nScannell, Assistant Secretary for OSHA under President Bush, testified \nthat ``we know there is a need to improve whistleblower protection and \nwe have been working closely with the Congress on this issue.''\n  In the 104th Congress, Republican Congressman Cass Ballenger \nintroduced an OSHA reform bill that would have strengthened \nwhistleblower protections by lengthening the grievance filing period \nfrom 30 to 60 days, and by giving employees the right to take their \ncases to court if the Labor Department refuses to act.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree that Section 11(c) is woefully \ninadequate and cries out for immediate reform. To ensure a safe and \nhealthy work environment for all workers, we must count on employees to \nactively participate in identifying and correcting workplace hazards. \nBut they're not going to do that if it means putting their jobs on the \nline. It's that simple. These courageous individuals need more \nprotection, not less, and that's what my legislation is all about.\n  The second provision of my Safer Workplaces Act, which I am \nintroducing separately as the ``Wrongful Death Accountability Act,'' \nwould make it a felony to commit willful violations of the OSH Act that \nresult in death of an employee. Unbelievably, these criminal violations \nare only a misdemeanor under current law. Under virtually every other \nfederal safety and health or environmental statute, by contrast, \ncriminal violations are a felony.\n  Because the penalty is so insignificant, the Justice Department \nrarely prosecutes. There are not a lot of cases where willful \nviolations lead to the death of an employee, but some of them involve \negregious behavior that needs to be prosecuted. We need to send\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\na message. Employers who cause the death of their employees by \ndeliberately violating the law should be held accountable with \nsomething more than a slap on the wrist.\n  Before a recent hearing of the Employment, Safety, and Training \nSubcommittee, Assistant Secretary of Labor Charles Jeffress testified, \n``We would urge that these violations not be classified as \nmisdemeanors, but felonies, which carry with them the possibility of \nincarceration for periods in excess of one year. Classifying willful \nworkplace safety and health violations that lead to an employee's death \nas misdemeanors is woefully inadequate to address the harm caused. \nClassifying such crimes as felonies would more justly reflect the \nseverity of the offense.''\n  This is another reform that has enjoyed bipartisan support in the \npast, and deserves bipartisan support in this Congress. In 1990 the \nBush Administration testified in support of making these criminal \nviolations felonies. Several Republicans on the Labor Committee--Brock \nAdams, Jim Jeffords, and David Durenberger--all supported such \nlegislation.\n  The third provision of the Safer Workplaces Act, which I am \nintroducing separately as the ``Federal Employees Safety Enhancement \nAct,'' would extend full OSHA protections to employees of the federal \ngovernment. Federal employees have been excluded from OSHA coverage for \nalmost 30 years. While a 1980 executive order required federal agencies \nto comply with OSHA standards, it provides no real enforcement \nauthority.\n  As Assistant Secretary of Labor Charles Jeffress recently testified \nbefore the Employment, Safety, and Training Subcommittee, ``the OSH Act \ncurrently does not adequately protect Federal employees. *  *  * OSHA \nhas little ability to require positive change on the part of public \nemployees. As a consequence, this limited authority hinders OSHA's \nsuccess in reducing illness, injuries, and fatalities on the job.''\n  Again, this is a common-sense reform that should be bipartisan and \nuncontroversial. In 1994, Republican Congressman Cass Ballenger \nproposed to cover federal employees in his OSHA reform legislation. \nLast year, under the leadership of Senator Enzi, the Senate voted \nunanimously to extend OSHA coverage to the U.S. Postal Service. On \nintroducing his Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act of 1998, \nRepublican Senator Enzi indicated that all federal employees should \nultimately be covered: ``This important legislation is an incremental \nstep in the effort to ensure that the `law of the land' applies equally \nto all branches of government as well as the private sector--and \neverything in-between.''\n  Finally, my Safer Workplace Act would also extend OSHA protections to \nemployees of state and local government. State and local public \nemployees are now covered only if their state happens to have a state \nplan. But in 27 states that do not have a state plan, 8.1 million state \nand local public employees are not protected by OSHA.\n  There's no reason why these employees should be treated as second-\nclass citizens. They face workplace hazards just like workers in the \nprivate sector, sometimes more. Their health and their lives are just \nas much at risk as those of private sector workers. In fact, in 1997, \n624 public sector workers were killed on the job. In several states, \nthe injury rate is higher for public employees than for private sector \nemployees.\n  At a recent hearing of the Employment, Safety, and Training \nSubcommittee, Assistant Secretary of Labor Charles Jeffress testified. \n``There are numerous examples of on-the-job tragedies that occurred \nprimarily because safety and health protections do not apply to public \nemployees. These tragedies could have been prevented by compliance with \nOSHA rules.''\n\n  Once again, this is a common-sense, bipartisan proposal. The Bush \nAdministration supported OSHA coverage for state and local public \nemployees in 1991. I understand there is interest on the other side of \nthe aisle in this particular provision, and I welcome it.\n  Taken together, the four provisions in this legislation would make a \nreal difference for American workers. Fewer of them would be exposed to \nworkplace hazards, fewer would be injured or harmed on the job, and \nfewer would be forced to pay with their lives. The Safer Workplaces Act \nwould encourage employees to be involved in identifying workplace \nhazards and correcting them before tragedy occurs. It would deter \nemployers from putting their employees lives' in danger through \ndeliberate violations of the law. And it would give federal employees \nand state and local public employees the same health and safety \nprotections that workers in the private sector have long enjoyed. This \nis a sensible package of bipartisan reforms, and I would encourage my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in passing this \nlegislation in the 106th Congress.\n\n\n                   The Right-to-Organize Act of 1999\n\n  As Ranking Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n(HELP) subcommittee with jurisdiction over the National Labor Relations \nAct (NLRA), I am also introducing legislation that would more fully \nrecognize the right of American working men and women to organize and \nbargain collectively.\n  Workers across America who want to organize a union and bargain \ncollectively with their employer are finding that the rules are stacked \nagainst them in crucial ways. This is clear to any labor organizer, and \nto many workers who have made the effort. To give workers a fair chance \nto organize and bargain collectively, we need fundamental labor law \nreform.\n  My ``Right-to-Organize Act of 1999'' will target some of the worst \nabuses of labor law that have become increasingly common in recent \nyears. First, employees are being subject to flagrant coercion, \nintimidation, and interference during certification election campaigns. \nSecond, employers are simply firing employees who attempt to organize a \nunion, and they're doing so with virtual impunity. In fact, despite the \nfact that the NLRA prohibits firing of employees for trying to organize \na union, as many as 10,000 Americans lose their jobs each year for \ndoing just that. The 1994 Dunlop Commission found that one in four \nemployers illegally fired union activists during organizing campaigns. \nAnd third, there is a growing problem of employers refusing to bargain \nwith their employees even after a union has been certified.\n  The Right-to-Organize Act of 1999 tackles these problems with the \nfollowing provisions:\n  First, it would help employees make fully informed, free decisions \nabout union representation by providing labor representatives and \nmanagement equal opportunity to disseminate information to employees.\n\n  Second, it would expand the remedies available for employees who are \nwrongfully discharged--for union organizing, for example. Specifically, \nit would expand the remedies available to the National Labor Relations \nBoard to include three times back pay, and it would allow employees to \nrecover punitive damages in district court when the Board has \ndetermined that they were wrongfully discharged.\n  Third, if protecting the right to join a union and bargain \ncollectively is to have any meaning, there must be safeguards to ensure \nthat newly certified unions have a reasonable opportunity to reach an \nagreement with their employer. My legislation would provide for \nmediation and arbitration when employers and employees fail to reach a \ncollective bargaining agreement on their own within 60 days of a \nunion's certification.\n  While these provisions are all much-needed to level the playing \nfield, I am the first to admit that much more still needs to be done. \nThis legislation is very much a work in progress. I will be considering \nadditional provisions to strengthen the authority of the National Labor \nRelations Board's (NLRB) to sanction willful violations of the law and \nto prevent abuses that too often string out election campaigns for \nmonths and months while worker representatives are thoroughly \nintimidated, organizers are fired, and the organizing campaign dies an \nearly death.\n  I believe very strongly that the Right to Organize is terribly \nimportant--not only for the workers who want to join together and \nbargain collectively, but for all Americans. One of the most important \nthings we can do to raise the standard of living and quality of life \nfor working Americans, raise wages and benefits, improve health and \nsafety in the workplace, and give average\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nAmericans more control over their lives is to enforce their right to \norganize, join, and belong to a union. We know that union workers are \nable to earn up to one-third more than non-union workers and are more \nlikely to have pensions and health benefits. That's why more than four \nin ten workers who are not currently in a union say they would join one \nif they had the chance.\n  When workers join together to fight for job security, for dignity, \nfor economic justice and for a fair share of America's prosperity, it \nis not a struggle merely for their own benefit. The gains of unionized \nworkers on basic bread-and-butter issues are key to the economic \nsecurity of all working families. Upholding the Right to Organize is a \nway to advance important social objectives--higher wages, better \nbenefits, more pension coverage, more worker training, more health \ninsurance coverage, and safer workplaces--without drawing on any \nadditional government resources.\n  I believe that the Right to Organize is one of the most important \ncivil rights and human rights causes of the 1990s. Unfortunately, this \ncause has received too little attention in this Congress. I hope I can \ndo something to remedy that situation, but this legislation is only a \nfirst step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Burns, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Frist, Mr. Mack, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Grams):\n  S. 655.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to combat \nthe growing and costly fraud of title washing. Title fraud is a \ndeceptive practice that costs consumers more than $4 billion dollars \nannually and places millions of structurally defective vehicles back on \nAmerica's roads and highways. These are millions of unsafe cars and \ntrucks sharing the roads with your loved ones.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act encourages \nstates to adopt uniform titling and registration standards to protect \nused car buyers from unknowingly purchasing totaled and subsequently \nrebuilt vehicles. It is a sound and reasonable measure that enhances \nconsumer disclosure and aids state motor vehicle administrators \nthroughout the nation by giving them identical points of reference to \ndescribe salvage vehicles.\n  Let us be very clear on this, there are no uniform definitions and \nstandards in place today and this leads to a hodgepodge of disclosure \napproaches throughout the country. Unscrupulous automobile rebuilders \ntake advantage of inconsistencies in state titling definitions and \nprocedures to purchase damaged vehicles at a low cost, rebuild them, \noftentimes by welding the front and back of two different cars \ntogether, and then retitling the vehicle in another state. The new \n``clean'' title bears no indication of the vehicle's previous damage \nrecord. As a result, consumers in your states are being sold previously \ntotaled cars and trucks without having any knowledge that the vehicle \nthey purchased, sometimes at a very high price, was severely damaged. A \nvehicle where only minor damage could cause it to fall apart. The \nunwitting purchasers of these vehicles experience significant economic \nloss. They and other motorists may also suffer bodily harm from these \nwrecks on wheels.\n  Mr. President, the title branding bill offered today will promote \ngreater disclosure to potential used car buyers than occurs today. It \nestablishes uniform definitions for salvage, rebuilt salvage, \nnonrepairable, and flood vehicles based upon the recommendations of the \nMotor Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee. \nThis congressionally mandated task force, overseen by the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, included the U.S. Attorney General's \nCriminal and Civil Justice Divisions, State motor vehicle officials, \nmotor vehicle manufactures, auto dealers, recyclers, insurers, salvage \nyard operators, scrap processors, the U.S. Treasury Department, police \nchiefs and municipal auto theft investigators, and other interested and \naffected parties. The uniform definitions and standards contained in \nthis bill are theirs, not mine. Their recommendations are based on a \nwealth of day-to-day experience dealing with consumer fraud, vehicle \ntitling, and automobile theft. The Salvage Advisory Committee's \nrecommendations struck an appropriate balance between consumers' \neconomic interests and their personal safety.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act requires \nrebuilt salvage vehicles to undergo a theft inspection in addition to \nany required state safety inspection. To further promote disclosure to \npotential used car buyers, the legislation also requires rebuilt \nsalvage vehicles to have a decal permanently fastened to the driver's \ndoorjamb and a sticker would be affixed to the windshield disclosing \nthe vehicle's status. Additionally, a written disclosure statement must \nbe provided to buyers and the vehicle's title would be branded with the \nstatement ``rebuilt salvage.''\n  The bill also requires that the brands included on state vehicle \ntitles be carried forward to each state where the vehicle is retitled.\n  So if your state wants to add additional requirements--they can. And \nthese items will be a permanent part of the title.\n  In an effort to take aim at automobile theft, the bill requires the \ntracking of Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) of irreparably damaged \nvehicles. This provision ensures that VINs are not simply swapped from \ndamaged cars to stolen cars to mask their identity.\n  Mr. President, Congress came very close to enacting title branding \nlegislation last year. The original Senate measure received the formal \nbipartisan support of 57 Senators, and a similar bill passed the House \nof Representatives by a vote of 333 to 72. Throughout the legislative \nprocess, a number of significant changes were made to the bill to \naddress the concerns expressed by consumer groups and some state \nattorneys general.\n  The title branding bill before you today retains all of the changes \napproved by the House of Representatives last October and it includes \nadditional pro-consumer, pro-states rights modifications received from \nstates and the Administration.\n  Under this revised bill, states are free to adopt disclosure \nstandards beyond those provided for in the bill. Let me say again that \nnothing in this bill prohibits states from providing unlimited \ndisclosure to their citizens. This important legislation merely creates \na basic minimum national standard while giving participating states the \nflexibility to adopt more stringent provisions and additional \ndisclosure requirements.\n  The bill also does not create a federal mandate on the states as some \nbig government advocates would have it. My colleagues are well aware \nthat the Supreme Court ruled in New York v. United States [505 U.S. 144 \n(1992)] that states cannot be forced by Congress to execute programs \nthat should be administered by the U.S. government. In the New York \ndecision, the Justices upheld ``access incentives'' which allow states \nto decide whether they want to use federal standards.\n  This legislation follows the Supreme Court's ruling by offering \nincentive grants, as proposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, \nto states that voluntarily choose to participate in the uniform titling \nregime for salvage vehicles. Thus, states that enact the bill's uniform \ntitling definitions and procedures will be eligible for conformance \nfunding. They can use the authorized funds to issue new titles, to \nestablish and administer vehicle theft or safety inspections, for \nenforcement activities, and for other related purposes. While I believe \nmost states will decide to participate in this completely voluntary \nprogram, rest assured no state will be penalized for choosing not to \nparticipate, or for adopting only some of the bill's provisions.\n  I would also like to point out that the revised bill no longer links \nstate adoption of uniform titling standards to the National Motor \nVehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) funding or participation. \nAgain, there is no penalty for nonparticipation.\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\n  The bill merely identifies and defines the minimum number of terms \nthat should be used by states to characterize damaged vehicles. The use \nof nationally and consistently recognized terms will help consumers \nmake informed decisions wherever they purchase a used vehicle. Whether \nin Mississippi, Utah, Florida, Montana, Texas, Virginia or any other \nparticipating state.\n  Mr. President, let me tell our colleagues this bill is about a \ncommission's recommendations. Quite frankly, I took the recommendations \nfrom a commission created by Congress and codified their ideas. The \nideas of the experts. The ideas of all the stakeholders. As we all \nknow, many commission reports gather dust. I do not want this one to \ngather dust because motorists could be driving used cars which are \nliterally wrecks. This is the commission's bill and I am proud to be \nassociated with its sponsorship.\n  The bill fully adopts the federal task force's ``salvage'' vehicle \ndefinition as a vehicle that sustains damage in excess of 75% of its \npre-accident value. This figure is lower than the House's proposal \nduring the 105th Congress which would have set the uniform salvage \nthreshold at 80%. The revised bill also gives states the flexibility to \nestablish an even lower threshold if they choose. A state may set its \nsalvage threshold at 70%, for example. The bill does not, however, set \nthe uniform standard at an arbitrarily low minimum salvage threshold, \nsuch as 65%, when no state in the union currently has such a standard. \nNo state. Not one.\n  The bill defines a flood vehicle as one that suffers water damage \nthat inhibits the electrical, computerized, or mechanical functions of \nthe vehicle. This definition expands upon the recommendation of the \nAdvisory Committee by taking into account real world experience. \nState's found that merely being exposed to water alone does not in and \nof itself threaten the structural integrity, safety, or value of a \nvehicle. A car or truck should not be branded a flood vehicle just \nbecause its carpeting and floor mats are wet. If it were the case, none \nof us would drive our cars through the rain or snow. It is only when \nwater damage impairs a vehicle's operating functions and the \nelectrical, mechanical or computerized components have not been \nrepaired or replaced, that the vehicle should be classified as a flood \nvehicle. The revised bill also goes beyond the task force's \nrecommendations by including any vehicle acquired by an insurer as part \nof a water damage settlement.\n  A nonrepairable vehicle is one that is incapable of being driven \nsafely and has no resale value except as a source for parts or scrap. \nThis is similar to the nonrepairable definition used by California, our \nnation's largest state. This is also the common sense definition the \nAdvisory Committee wisely chose in lieu of an arbitrary percentage \nbased definition that would force otherwise repairable vehicles into \nthe scrap heap. It should be noted that only five states have a \npercentage based nonrepairable definition. I find it troubling that \nthese same five states have been far less successful in reducing \nautomobile thefts than the nation as a whole and accident related \ndeaths higher than the forty five states that do not have a percentage \nbased nonrepairable definition. Coupled with the negative economic \neffects on consumers, these are additional reasons not to adopt a \npercentage based definition for nonrepairable vehicles.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues should also be aware that this \nlegislation allows states to use additional terms in their titling \nregimes such as ``reconstructed'', ``unrebuildable'', and ``junk \nvehicles'' in addition to the terms defined in this measure. If a state \nthat chooses to conform to the federal standard also wants to use a \npercentage based definition to describe a ``parts only'' vehicle, it \ncan use a term synonymous to nonrepairable.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act also \nallows states to cover any vehicle, regardless of age. It allows older \nvehicles to be designated as a ``older model salvage vehicle.'' This is \na change recommended by a state attorneys general representative to \nprovide states with even more flexibility. Again, the age of a vehicle \nis no longer an issue under this revised title branding bill.\n  This legislation even grants state attorneys general the ability to \nsue on behalf of consumers victimized by rebuilt salvage fraud and to \nrecover monetary judgments for damages that citizens may have suffered.\n  Two new prohibited acts are included in the bill--one related to \nfailure to make a flood disclosure and the other related to moving a \nvehicle or title across state lines for the purpose of avoiding the \nbill's requirements.\n  Mr. President, I have just gone over a number of changes that I \nincorporated into the bill. I have reached out to accommodate a number \nof issues, but there is a point where making changes defeats the \npurpose of the bill which is to promote consumer disclosure through \nuniformity.\n  Mr. President, this bill does nothing to inhibit a consumers ability \nto pursue private rights of actions available under state law. \nMoreover, states are free to continue or adopt new civil and criminal \npenalties against individuals or companies that defraud consumers. The \nbill does not, however, negatively impact the already overburdened \nFederal courts. This bill is about disclosure. If your son or daughter \nis buying a used car, you want them to know right up front whether the \nvehicle they are about to purchase has been severely damaged. Getting \nrelief after several years of litigating in a U.S. Court does not \nprotect consumers. It does not turn the clock back for someone who has \nbeen killed or seriously injured in a structurally unsafe vehicle.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to reiterate some key points \nconcerning The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act:\n  State participation is completely voluntary. V-O-L-U-N-T-A-R-Y.\n  There is no preemption of state law. None whatsoever. None. None. \nNone. State legislatures can fully enact the bill's provisions, enact \nonly some of the uniform definitions and standards, or take no action \nwhatsoever.\n  States that choose to participate in the minimal uniform definitions \nand standards identified in this bill will be entitled to conformance \nfunding.\n  There is no penalty for non-participation by a state. None \nwhatsoever. None. None. None. And, no linkage to state National Motor \nVehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS) funding or participation.\n  It mirrors recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration \nand Salvage Advisory Committee.\n  The bill's definitions and standards are the minimum necessary for a \nvoluntary uniform salvage titling framework. M-I-N-I-M-U-M.\n  This legislation does not force states to adopt standards or \ndefinitions that not even one state currently has in place.\n  The bill does not unnecessarily devalue vehicles or cause otherwise \nrepairable automobiles to be junked. This is key because some will talk \nabout greater protection, but these proposals threaten the car's value \nfor no good reason and this makes no sense\n  The revised bill includes many additional technical corrections \nprovided to me by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the National \nAssociation of Attorney's General, and others. I want to personally \nthank them for their time and effort in going over the bill with me--\nline by line. Their thoughts were invaluable and helpful. Throughout \nthe legislative process, I have made several good faith efforts to \nreach out to all groups interested in this legislation and where \npossible, I included reasonable changes in the bill.\n  It is widely supported by state motor vehicle administrators, law \nenforcement agencies, state legislators, consumers, and the automobile \nand insurance industries. Widely supported.\n  Experts on the front lines, those who deal with titling issues \neveryday, have described other proposals that have been floated \nrecently as confusing, or overly complex, or unworkable, or unwise, or \ncounter productive. In many instances, these proposals have been flatly \nrejected by state legislatures.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act represents \na fair, balanced, and workable approach to dealing with the issue of \ntitle fraud. It provides a voluntary framework for states to provide \nmuch needed disclosure to potential used-car purchasers. It would help \nclose the many loopholes that exist in state titling rules. This \nmeasure maintains a state's ability to provide more disclosure, to take \ndirect\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nand timely action against dishonest parties, and to adopt more \nstringent rules and procedures should they decide to do so. It is both \npro-consumer and pro-states rights. This bill protects the safety and \nwell-being of consumers and motorists across America.\n  I urge the more than fifty of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle who formally supported this title branding legislation during the \nlast Congress to cosponsor this important bill again. I ask the rest of \nmy colleagues also to protect their constituents by lending their \nsupport to this much needed consumer protection measure.\n  The time has come for Congressional action. Repeated hearings have \nbeen held on this issue in both chambers over several years. The record \nis clear. Title fraud is a significant problem across the country. It \ncontinues unabated. The solution is more consumer disclosure based on \nthe use of appropriate and rational national standards. This \nlegislation is a win-win solution for consumers, states, and industry.\n  You know the time has come for Congressional action when the \nDepartment of Transportation's crash test cars are rebuilt, title \nwashed, and back on America's roads and highways. Remember, these are \ndeliberately wrecked vehicles. Yes, the time has come for action.\n  Let us work together to move this measure forward. To keep dishonest \nrebuilders from taking advantage of even one more used car purchaser in \nyour state.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 655\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is with great honor and reverence that I \nrise today with my friend and colleague, Senator Cleland, to introduce \na bipartisan constitutional amendment to permit Congress to enact \nlegislation prohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag.\n  The American flag serves as a symbol of our great nation. The flag \nrepresents our country in a way nothing else can; it represents the \ncommon bond shared by an otherwise diverse people. Whatever our \ndifferences of party, race, religion, or socio-economic status, the \nflag reminds us that we are very much one people, united in a shared \ndestiny, bonded in a common faith in our nation.\n  Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens reminded us of the \nsignificance of our unique emblem when he wrote:\n\n       A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the\n       ideas that characterize the society that has chosen\n       that emblem as well as the special history that has\n       animated the growth and power of those ideas. . . . So it\n       is with the American flag. It is more than a proud\n       symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts\n       of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling colonies into\n       a world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal\n       opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill\n       for other peoples who share our aspirations.\n\n  Throughout our history, the flag has captured the hearts and minds of \nschool teachers, construction workers, police officers, grandmothers, \nand public servants. Who can forget the image of Neil Armstrong and \nBuzz Aldrin planting the American flag on the moon? At that moment, the \nflag stood not only for the triumph of American know-how and the \ncourage of Americans to explore the unknown, but also for freedom. It \nwas a statement that whatever Americans do, we do to promote liberty, \nequality, and justice.\n  And, what of those children who recite the ``Pledge of Allegiance'' \nevery morning in classrooms all across America? They are pledging to be \ngood citizens, honest and loyal and just. In pledging allegiance to the \nflag, they are affirming their belief in ``liberty and justice for \nall.''\n  And, throughout our history, men and women in uniform have drawn \ncourage from our flag and gave their lives for the values it \nsymbolizes. No matter the era, no matter the color of uniform--whether \nArmy green, Air Force blue, or Navy white--no matter the theater of \nbattle--whether at Gettysburg, San Juan Hill, Iwo Jima, Korea, Da Nang, \nor the Persian Gulf--our men and women had one common bond: the \nAmerican flag.\n  Consider the example of Army Corporal Joseph Quintero, a prisoner of \nthe Japanese during World War II. Quintero secretly led a group of POWs \nin obtaining red, white, and blue material to make an American flag. \nThe flag lifted the hearts of the Americans who were suffering from \nmalnutrition, overwork, and physical abuse. When American planes \nstarted to attack the prison camp, Quintero waived Old Glory and the \nplanes stopped the attack and saved numerous American lives. Even in \nthe worst of conditions, Joseph Quintero knew the value of the American \nflag.\n  From my home State of Utah, there is the courageous example of Lt. \nWilliam E. Hall, whose fearless actions in the Battle of the Coral Sea \nearned him the Congressional Medal of Honor. Lieutenant Hall attacked a \nJapanese aircraft carrier and then Japanese planes in a series of \nhighly dangerous engagements. Though seriously wounded, Lt. Hall guided \nhis plane back to a landing strip marked by the American flag.\n  General Schwarzkopf in a speech before Congress thanked the American \npeople for their support of our troops in Operation Desert Storm, \nstating: ``The profits of doom, the naysayers, the protesters and the \nflag-burners all said that you wouldn't stick by us, but we knew \nbetter. We knew you'd never let us down. By golly, you didn't.''\n  We respect the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform because we \nrespect what they died for. They did not give their lives for ground, \nprestige, wealth, or a monarch. They sacrificed their lives for \nfreedom, opportunity, and justice--all represented by our nation's flag \nof 50 stars and thirteen stripes. Through the American flags at \nArlington National Cemetery, on the Iwo Jima Memorial, and at every \nschool yard, we honor those sacrifices. But there are those who do not.\n  In 1984, Greg Johnson led a group of radicals in a protest march. He \ndoused an American flag with kerosene and set it on fire as his fellow \nprotestors chanted: ``America, the red, white, and blue, we spit on \nyou.'' While traditional First Amendment jurisprudence would protect \nJohnson's ability to speak and write about the flag, it did not protect \nhis ability to physically destroy the flag.\n  But, in 1989, the Supreme Court abandoned the history and intent of \nthe First Amendment by creating a new standard that made no distinction \nbetween oral and written speech about the flag and disrespectful \nconduct toward the flag. In Texas v. Johnson, five members of the \nCourt, for the first time ever, overturned a conviction based solely on \nphysical conduct toward the American flag. The majority argued that the \nFirst Amendment had somehow changed and that it now prevented a state \nfrom protecting the American flag from acts of physical desecration. \nWhen Congress responded with a federal flag protection statute, the \nSupreme Court, in United States v. Eichman, used its new and changed \ninterpretation of the First Amendment to strike it down by a 5-4 vote.\n  Under this new interpretation of the First Amendment, it is assumed \nthat the people, their elected legislators, and the courts can no \nlonger distinguish between speech and conduct. Because of this assumed \ninability to make such distinctions, there are those who argue that our \nfreedom to express political ideas is wholly dependent on treating Greg \nJohnson's burning of the American flag exactly like oral and written \nspeech.\n  This ill-advised argument fails because its basic premise--that \nlegislatures and courts cannot distinguish between oral and written \nexpression and disrespectful physical conduct--is so obviously false. \nIt is precisely this distinction that legislatures and courts did make \nfor almost 200 years. Just as judges have distinguished which laws and \nactions comply with the constitutional command to provide ``equal \nprotection of the laws'' and ``due process of law,'' so too have judges \ndistinguished between free speech and destructive conduct, and have \nlimited the latter.\n  Destructive conduct, such as breaking down the doors of the State \nDepartment, may be a way of expressing one's\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\ndissatisfaction with the nation's foreign policy objectives. Laws, \nhowever, can be enacted preventing such actions in large part because \nthere are alternatives that can be equally powerful. I should also note \nthat right here in the United States Senate, we prohibit speeches or \ndemonstrations of any kind, even the silent display of signs or \nbanners, in the public galleries.\n  Moreover, the people themselves did not elevate the act of flag \ndesecration to a constitutionally protected status, which the Supreme \nCourt did in Johnson and Eichman. Such an extreme view was never \ndrafted by the Congress or ratified by the people. Indeed, such a \nprotection is contradicted by the original and historic intent of the \nFirst Amendment. Thus, in this Senator's view, the Supreme Court erred \nin Johnson and in Eichman.\n  It has also been argued that another flag protection statute could \npass constitutional muster under the ``fighting words'' doctrine. In \nR.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, however, the Supreme Court expanded the \nnewly created, so-called ``right'' to burn the flag by stating that any \nstatute that specifically targeted the American flag for protection was \nunconstitutional, regardless of the ``fighting words'' doctrine. Thus, \na constitutional amendment is the only means left to protect the flag.\n  It has been argued that a constitutional amendment to protect the \nflag should be ``content neutral'' and prohibit not only disrespectful \ndestructions of the flag, but all destructions of the flag. Such an \namendment would sweep too broadly by prohibiting the ceremonial \ndisposal of a flag and the traditional printing of regimental names on \nthe flag. In short, a ``content neutral'' amendment misses the point. \nIt is the traditional constitutional protection for the dignity of the \nflag that must be restored, not a new broad ban on any conduct with a \nflag that should be created. Only a narrowly tailored amendment can \naccomplish this honorable purpose.\n  The amendment that Senator Cleland and I propose affects only the \nmost radical and disrespectful forms of conduct towards the American \nflag. The amendment will leave untouched the current constitutional \nprotections for Americans to speak their sentiments at a rally, to \nwrite their sentiments to their newspaper, and to vote their sentiments \nat the ballot box. The amendment simply restores the traditional and \nhistoric power of the people's elected representatives to prohibit the \ndisrespectful physical destruction of the flag.\n  Further, it is clear that restoring legal protection to the American \nflag will not place us on a slippery slope to limit other freedoms. No \nother symbol of our bipartisan national ideals has flown over so many \nof our battlefields, cemeteries, school yards, and homes. No other \nsymbol has been paid for with so much of our countrymen's blood. No \nother symbol has encouraged so many ordinary men and women to seek \nliberty and justice for all.\n  In recent months, my colleagues on both sides of the political aisle \nhave called for a new bipartisan spirit in Congress. This amendment \nfits the bill. Restoring legal protection to the American flag is not, \nnor should it be, a partisan issue. Including Senator Cleland and \nmyself, 57 senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have joined as \noriginal cosponsors of this amendment.\n  Over 70 percent of the American people want the opportunity to vote \nto protect their flag. Numerous organizations, including the Medal of \nHonor Recipients for the Flag, the American Legion, the American War \nMothers, the American G.I. Forum, and the African-American Women's \nClergy Association all support the flag protection amendment. Forty-\nnine state legislatures have passed resolutions calling for \nconstitutional protection for the flag. Last Congress, the House of \nRepresentatives overwhelmingly passed this amendment by a vote of 310-\n114, and will pass it again this year.\n  Mr. President, I am very honored to be a cosponsor with my dear \nfriend from Georgia, Senator Cleland. I appreciate the efforts he has \nput forth in this battle. Having served in the military as he has done \nwith such distinction and with courage, he has earned the right to \nspeak for the protection of the flag.\n  I am, therefore, proud to rise today and introduce a constitutional \namendment that will restore to the people's elected representatives the \nright to protect one unique national symbol, the American flag, from \nacts of physical desecration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the proposed \namendment be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 14\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     following article is proposed as an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to \n     all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when \n     ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several \n     States within 7 years after the date of its submission for \n     ratification:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.''.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to first thank my dear friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Hatch. His dedicated leadership on this important matter is \nunparalleled and, without it, we would not have been able to gain all \nof the support we have for this important legislation. I am proud to \nsay that the resolution regarding the flag protection amendment Senator \nHatch and I are introducing today has 57 original co-sponsors, and I am \nhopeful that we will be able to bring this important matter to a final \nvote in the Senate this year.\n  As I have stated many times before, I am a strong supporter of a \nConstitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nUnited States flag. The amendment we are proposing is simple. It simply \nvests Congress with the authority to protect the flag through statute. \nWe need not fear that the states will create a hodge-podge of flag \nprotection statutes. Instead, Congress can create one uniform statute \nfor the entire nation.\n  I understand the concerns that others have about the impact on the \nFirst Amendment that this bill might have, and as a veteran who risked \nhis life in Vietnam to protect the principles of freedoms that \nAmericans hold sacred, I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment. \nHowever, I believe that an amendment to protect the flag is an \nacceptable limitation in order to protect the most sacred of American \nsymbols. I strongly believe that the societal interest in preserving \nthe symbolic value of the flag outweighs the interest in an individual \nchoosing to physically desecrate the flag. The flag unites Americans as \nno symbol can. The flag is sacred. Those who would desecrate the flag \nwould desecrate America and the freedoms that we hold inviolate.\n  I cannot presume to know the importance of the American flag for each \nindividual American. But I can say without doubt, that it is the only \nunifying symbol that the vast diversity of this great nation has. No \nmatter one's age, religion, culture, ethnicity, race, or gender--every \nAmerican is represented by the United States flag and the flag \nundoubtedly bonds Americans together.\n  The tradition of the flag goes back to this country's birth. Indeed, \nit even inspired our national anthem. Until the Supreme Court struck \ndown a state flag protection law in Texas versus Johnson in 1989, there \nhave always been state and federal laws protecting the flag from acts \nof physical desecration. In fact, flag protection can be traced back to \nour founding fathers who strongly supported the government's protection \nof the flag. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who were instrumental \nin framing the Constitution, recognized that protecting the flag and \npreserving the First Amendment were consistent. They often spoke out \nagainst desecration of the flag and sought to protect the sovereignty \ninterest in the flag. Both Madison and Jefferson considered that a \ndefacement of the flag should be a violation of the law. In fact, \nJefferson believed that such a violation should invoke a ``systematic \nand severe'' course of punishment for persons who violated the flag.\n  I do not profess to be a constitutional scholar. But I, like many \nAmericans, do not agree with the Supreme Court's ruling in Texas v. \nJohnson, and United States v. Eichman which struck down\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nstatutes protecting the United States flag as unconstitutional \nviolations of the First Amendment right to free speech. I respect the \nwisdom of the Justices of the Supreme Court, yet I was saddened that we \nno longer were able to rely upon statutory authority to protect the \nflag.\n  I was especially saddened in light of the views expressed by some of \nthe most learned scholars in American jurisprudence. Several Supreme \nCourt Justices over the years have issued opinions recognizing the \nimportance of protection of the flag, including Justices Harlan, \nWarren, Fortas, Black, White, Rehnquist, Blackmun, Stevens, and \nO'Connor. These Justices have each supported the view that nothing in \nthe Constitution prohibits the states or the federal government from \nprotecting the flag. Perhaps Chief Justice Rehnquist explained it best \nin his dissent in Texas versus Johnson which was joined by Justices \nO'Connor and White, when he said:\n\n     [t]he American flag . . . throughout more than 200 years of \n     our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our \n     Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular \n     political party, and it does not represent any particular \n     political philosophy. The flag is not simply another `idea' \n     or `point of view' competing for recognition in the \n     marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans \n     regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of \n     what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they \n     may have. I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates \n     the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, \n     which make criminal the public burning of the flag.\n\n  Nonetheless, the current Supreme Court view stands. That is what \nbrings us here today. In an attempt to protect the flag, Congress has \nbeen forced to enact a constitutional amendment. The House has twice \noverwhelmingly passed resolutions that would begin the formal process \nof amending the Constitution to protect the flag. Unfortunately, it has \nbeen the Senate that has blocked these efforts. However, the vote has \nalways been close in the Senate and I am hopeful that we will succeed \nthis year.\n  The will of the people in this matter is clear. The polls continue to \nshow that more than 80 percent of the American people believe that \nCongress should act to protect the flag and that it is worth amending \nthe Constitution to do so. The Supreme Court decision in Texas versus \nJohnson in effect invalidated the laws in 48 states and the District of \nColumbia that prohibited flag desecration. Since the Supreme Court's \ndecision, 49 of the 50 State legislatures have adopted resolutions \nasking Congress to send the flag protection amendment to the States for \nratification. I believe we ought to let the American people decide. \nTherefore, I lend my full support to efforts to send this initiative \nback to the States and American people for ratification.\n  Although support for government action to protect the United States \nflag comes from all sectors of the American public, I have been \nparticularly moved by the voices of our veterans who have fought and \ndied to defend the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans in the \nConstitution. The U.S. flag is a manifestation of those freedoms and \nholds particular significance to those who have risked their lives to \nprotect this country and the flag which embodies them. In fact, in many \ncases the U.S. has presented the Medal of Honor to veterans for their \nuncommon valor in protecting the flag in times of war. As Justice \nStevens said in his dissenting opinion in Texas versus Johnson:\n\n       The freedom and ideals of liberty and ideals of liberty, \n     equality and tolerance that the flag symbolizes and embodies \n     have motivated our nation's leaders, soldiers, and activists \n     to pledge their lives, their liberty and their honor in \n     defense of their country. Because our history has \n     demonstrated that these values and ideals are worth fighting \n     for, the flag which uniquely symbolizes their power is itself \n     worthy of protection from physical desecration.\n\n  The military has always used the flag to honor those who fought and \ndied to protect our freedoms. We honor the members of our armed forces \nby draping a flag over the coffin of a slain soldier, placing a flag \nnear a soldier's grave, or displaying a flag on Memorial Day and \nVeterans' Day. To permit people to physically desecrate the flag \ndiminishes the honor we bestow upon them and tarnishes its value and \nthe brave service of those individuals who fought to defend it.\n  As Chief Justice Harlan once said, ``love both of the common country \nand of the State will diminish in proportion as respect for the flag is \nweakened.'' Perhaps my colleagues who do not agree with me upon this \nissue will believe that I have overly dramatized the meaning of the \nflag, but for me personally, who fought to defend the principles of \nfreedom we hold sacred, the protection of the flag which represents \nthem cannot be ignored. I believe we must use this opportunity to show \nthe world that we reaffirm our commitment to the ideals the flag stands \nfor and what so many Americans fought for.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the proposed \namendment to the United States Constitution to prevent desecration of \nour great national symbol. I want to thank Chairman Hatch for his \ncontinuing dedication to this issue, and I want to applaud him for \nreintroducing the flag amendment today. I believe that our nation's \nsymbol is a unique and important part of our heritage and culture, and \nworthy of respect and protection. In 1995, I was an original co-sponsor \nof an amendment to the Constitution designed to protect the symbol of \nour nation and its ideals. When that resolution was defeated narrowly, \nwe vowed that this issue would not go away and it has not. I stand \nhere, again, today to declare the necessity of protecting the Flag of \nthe United States of America and what it represents.\n  Throughout our history, the Flag has held a special place in the \nhearts and minds of Americans. As the appearance of the Flag has \nchanged with the addition of stars as the nation has grown, its core \nmeaning to the American people has remained constant. It symbolizes an \nideal, not just for Americans, but for all those who honor the great \nAmerican experiment. It represents a shared ideal of freedom, \nsacrifice, morality, history, unity, patriotism, loved ones lost, the \nAmerican way of life and even America itself. The Flag stands in this \nchamber and in our court rooms; it is draped over our honored dead; it \nflies at half-mast to mourn those we wish to respect; and it is the \nsubject of our National Anthem, our National March and our Pledge of \nAllegiance. America's inability to demand a modicum of respect for the \nflag leads not only to the desecration of our nation's symbol, but of \nthe important values upon which this nation was founded. As the Chief \nJustice noted in his dissent in Texas versus Johnson (1989), ``[t]he \nAmerican flag, then, throughout more than 200 years of our history, has \ncome to be the visible symbol embodying our nation. . . . Millions and \nmillions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence \nregardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs \nthey may have.''\n  There can be little doubt that the people of this country fully \nsupport preserving and protecting the American Flag. During a recent \nhearing that I chaired on ``The Tradition and Importance of Protecting \nthe United States Flag'' held by the Subcommittee on the Constitution, \nFederalism, and Property Rights, the witnesses noted that an \nunprecedented 80% of the American people supported a constitutional \namendment to protect the flag. The people's elected representatives \nreflected that vast public support by enacting Flag protection statues \nat both the State and Federal levels. In fact, 49 State Legislatures \nhave passed resolutions asking Congress to send a constitutional \namendment to the States for ratification. Regrettably, the Supreme \nCourt thwarted the people's will--and discarded the judgment of state \nlegislatures and the Congress that protecting the Flag is fully \nconsistent with our Constitution--by holding that, as far as the \nConstitution is concerned, the American Flag is just another piece of \ncloth for which no minimum of respect may be demanded. As a \nconsequence, that which represents the struggles of those who came \nbefore us, our current ideals, and our hopes for years to come, cannot \nbe recognized for what it truly is--a national treasure in need of \nprotection.\n\n  Further, the question must be asked, what is the legacy we are \nleaving our children? At a time when our nation's virtues are too \nrarely extolled by our national leaders, and national pride is \ndismissed by many as arrogance, America needs, more than ever, \nsomething to celebrate. At a time when our political leaders labor \nunder the taint of scandal, we need a national symbol\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nthat is beyond reproach. America needs its Flag unblemished, \nrepresenting more than any person or any partisan interest, but this \nextraordinary nation. The Flag, and the freedom for which it stands, \nhas a unique ability to unite us as Americans. Whatever our \ndisagreements, we are united in our respect for the Flag. We are in \nneed of healing. We should not allow the healing and unifying power of \nthe Flag to become a source of divisiveness.\n  The protection that the people seek for the Flag does not threaten \nthe sacred rights afforded by the First Amendment. I sincerely doubt \nthat the Framers intended the First Amendment of the Constitution to \nprevent state legislatures and Congress from protecting the Flag of the \nnation for which they shed their blood. At the time of the Supreme \nCourt's decision, the tradition of protecting the Flag was too firmly \nestablished to suggest that such laws are inconsistent with our \nconstitutional traditions. Many of the state laws were based on the \nUniform Flag Act of 1917. No one at that time, or for 70 years \nafterwards, felt that these laws ran afoul of the First Amendment. \nIndeed, the Supreme Court itself upheld a Nebraska statute preventing \ncommercial use of the Flag in 1907 in Halter versus Nebraska. As the \nChief Justice stated in his dissent, ``I cannot agree that the First \nAmendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 \nStates which make criminal the public burning of the flag.''\n  Nor do I accept the notion that amending the Constitution to overrule \nthe Supreme Court's decisions in the specific context of desecration of \nthe Flag will somehow undermine the First Amendment as it is applied in \nother contexts. This amendment does not create a slippery slope which \nwill lead to the erosion of Americans' right to free speech. The Flag \nis wholly unique. It has not rightful counterpart. An amendment \nprotecting the Flag from desecration will provide no aid or comfort in \nany future campaigns to restrict speech. Moreover, an amendment banning \nthe desecration of the Flag does not limit the content of any true \nspeech. As Justice Stevens noted in his dissent in Johnson versus \nTexas, ``[t]he concept of `desecration' does not turn on the substance \nof the message the actor intends to convey, but rather on whether those \nwho view the act will take serious offense.'' Likewise, the act of \ndesecrating the Flag does not have any content in and of itself. The \nact takes meaning and expresses conduct only in the context of the true \nspeech which accompanies the act. And that speech remains unregulated. \nAs the Chief Justice noted, ``flag burning is the equivalent of an \ninarticulate grunt or roar that, it seems fair to say, is most likely \nto be indulged in not to express any particular idea, but to antagonize \nothers.''\n  In sum, there is no principal or fear that should stand as an \nobstacle to our protection of the Flag. Unfortunately, at no other time \nin history has our country so needed such a symbol of sacrifice, honor, \nunity and freedom. It is my earnest hope that by amending the \nConstitution to prohibit its desecration, this body will protect the \nheritage, sacrifice, ideals, freedom and honor that the Flag uniquely \nrepresents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2868-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2868-S2869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 168\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Schumer) was added as a cosponsor of S. 168, a bill for the relief \nof Thomas J.

Mr. President, although Communism released its \noppressive grip on the people of Russia nearly ten years ago, its \nfingerprints of racism and ethnic intolerance persist. Today, I call \nthe attention of my colleagues to the troubling surge of anti-Semitic \nrhetoric by the Russian Duma's Communist Party leaders who have sought \nto place the blame of Russia's social and economic ills on its Jewish \ncommunity. As the new co-chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am \nsubmitting a resolution to help address this disturbing situation. This\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nresolution is a companion to H.Con.Res. 37 which was introduced by \nCongressman Chris Smith, Chairman of the Helsinki Commission.\n  In October of last year, General Albert Makashov, Communist Party \nmember of the Duma, insulted and threatened the Jewish community with \nphysical retribution for what he asserted as being a cause of Russia's \ncurrent instabilities. When other members of the Duma sought to censure \nGeneral Makashov for his comments, Communist party members blocked the \nmeasure on two different occasions and the Duma failed to condemn his \nstatements. Then in December, Viktor Ilyukhin, Communist Party member \nand Chairman of the Security Committee, asserted that the Jews were \ncommitting `genocide against the Russian people'. He further referenced \nthe influence of President Yeltsin's `Jewish entourage' and called for \nethnic quotas in these posts to counter Jewish influence.\n  It is imperative that the Russian Duma be sent a clear message that \nthese expressions of racism and ethnic hatred will not go unnoticed by \nthe U.S.\n  Today, I am joined by Senators Lautenberg, Abraham, Smith of Oregon, \nBrownback, Torricelli, Reid, Cleland, Burns, and Feingold in submitting \na resolution which condemns these anti-Semitic statements made by the \nRussian Duma. It likewise commends the actions taken by those in the \nDuma who sought to censure the Communist Party leaders and commends \nPresident Yeltsin for his forceful rejection of the statements. This \nresolution also reiterates the firm belief of the Congress that peace \nand justice cannot be achieved as long as governments and legislatures \npromote policies based upon anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia.\n  In light of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's upcoming visit to the \nU.S., this resolution is especially timely. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important resolution which underscores the U.S. commitment \nto religious freedom and human rights.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution condemning anti-Semitic statements by Russian political \nleaders and commending President Yeltsin and others for raising their \nvoices against such hateful speech.\n  Anti-Semitism in Russia is not a new phenomenon. Throughout Russia's \nhistory, Jews have often been singled out for persecution during times \nof crisis. It happened in the seventeenth century, when a reign of \nterror was unleashed against Jews in Eastern and Central Europe, and it \nhappened in the pogroms of World War I, when entire Jewish communities \nwere annihilated. In short, when there's trouble in Russia, Jews are \nusually the first to be blamed. Anti-Semitic comments coming from high-\nranking officials in Russia in recent months are particularly \nworrisome. They come at a time when Russia should be overcoming its \ntroubled past and rejoining the world community by honoring freedom of \nreligion, free speech and other human rights.\n  The anti-Semitic statements made by prominent Russian officials are \nwell known by now: Last November, retired General Albert Makashov \nblamed the country's economic crisis on ``yids.'' In an open letter, \nGennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party chief, voiced his belief of a \nZionist conspiracy to seize power in Russia. Another top Communist \nlawmaker, Viktor Ilyukhin, accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the \ncountry.\n  Officials in the Russian government have criticized these statements. \nYet not so long ago, Russian President Yeltsin went ahead with a summit \nwith his counterpart, Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, who \nhimself blamed Jewish financiers and political reformers ``for the \ncreation of the criminal economy.'' Alexander Lebed, a top contender \nfor the presidential post in the 2000 elections, has also made negative \nremarks about several religious groups.\n  We in Congress have asked senior Administration officials to lodge \nour protests against the anti-Semitic comments made by Russian leaders. \nDuring her recent trip to Moscow, Secretary Albright did exactly that \nand received assurances that anti-Semitism has no place in Russia. The \nAdministration will have another opportunity to voice our concern when \nVice President Gore receives Russia's Prime Minister Primakov next \nweek.\n  I will closely be watching events in Russia to ensure the government \nis in compliance with its international human rights commitments. There \nhas been concern that the country's religion law, passed in 1997, cedes \ntoo much authority to local officials. The omnibus appropriations bill \nfor 1999 directs a cutoff of Freedom Support Act aid to Russia unless \nthe President determines and certifies that Moscow hasn't implemented \nstatutes, regulations or executive orders that would discriminate \nagainst religious groups. That certification must be made by late \nApril. I hope certification, as well as the International Religious \nFreedom Act, passed last year, will be strong incentives for Russian \nleaders to reverse a troubling anti-democratic trend.\n  As you know, in 1989 I authored legislation making it easier for Jews \nand members of other persecuted religious groups in the former Soviet \nUnion to obtain refugee status in the United States. I introduced this \nlaw because I felt deeply that religious freedom was a basic human \nright, which was anathema under the Soviet system of government. Recent \nevents in Russia convince me my legislation remains very necessary and \nI will be asking my colleagues to support an extension again this year.\n  During a trip to Poland last year, President Kwasniewski and Prime \nMinister Buzek reached out to the Jewish community to help bridge the \ngap between Poles and Jews. This is a difficult and long-term process, \nbut at least leaders across the political spectrum are making a real \neffort to heal wounds and create a more welcome climate for Jews in \nPoland. I welcome President Yeltsin's rejections of anti-Semitism and I \nhope more members of the Duma will speak out in this manner.\n  I want also to pay tribute to Parliamentarian Galina Starovoitova, a \nsteadfast supporter of human rights and democracy, who was shot dead \nlast November in the entry way of her St. Petersburg apartment \nbuilding. Ms. Starovoitova, a non-Jew, was a leading voice in \ncondemning anti-Semitism in Russian society. Her courage will be sorely \nmissed.\n  Congress understands Russia cannot be a great democracy until it \nmakes progress in human rights, and doesn't revert to past practices. \nRussia's leaders must come to the same conclusion. We must all work \ntogether to reach a common goal--helping Russia integrate into the \ninternational community.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this timely \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2870-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2870-S2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 64--RECOGNIZING THE HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE OF THE \n          FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOOD FRIDAY PEACE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nDodd, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Reid, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Boxer, \nMr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Cleland, \nMr. Torricelli, Mr. Grams, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Daschle, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nKerrey, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Thurmond, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Burns, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lott, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Voinovich, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 68\n\n       Whereas more than 11,000,000 women and girls living under \n     Taliban rule in Afghanistan are denied their basic human \n     rights;\n       Whereas according to the Department of State and \n     international human rights organizations, the Taliban \n     continues to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in gross violation of internationally accepted \n     norms;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of State \n     Country Report on Human Rights Practices (hereafter ``1998 \n     State Department Human Rights Report''), violence against \n     women in Afghanistan occurs frequently, including beatings, \n     rapes, forced marriages, disappearances, kidnapings, and \n     killings;\n       Whereas women and girls in Afghanistan are barred from \n     working, going to school, leaving their homes without an \n     immediate male family member as chaperone, visiting doctors, \n     hospitals or clinics, and receiving humanitarian aid;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, gender restrictions by the Taliban continue to \n     interfere with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to \n     women and girls in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women in Afghanistan are forced to don a head-to-toe \n     garment known as a burqa, which has only a mesh screen for \n     vision, and women in Afghanistan found in public not wearing \n     a burqa, or wearing a burqa that does not properly cover the \n     ankles, are beaten by Taliban militiamen;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, some poor women in Afghanistan cannot afford the cost \n     of a burqa and thus are forced to remain at home or risk \n     beatings if they go outside the home without one;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, the lack of a burqa has resulted in the inability of \n     some women in Afghanistan to get necessary medical care \n     because they cannot leave home;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women in Afghanistan are reportedly beaten if their \n     shoe heels click when they walk;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women in homes in Afghanistan must not be visible \n     from the street, and houses with female occupants must have \n     their windows painted over;\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women in Afghanistan are not allowed to drive, and \n     taxi drivers reportedly are beaten if they take unescorted \n     women as passengers;\n       Whereas according to the 1998 State Department Human Rights \n     Report, women in Afghanistan are forbidden to enter mosques \n     or other places of worship;

Waiver of Recoupment of Medicaid Tobacco-Related \n     Recoveries If Recoveries Used To Reduce Smoking and Assist in \n     Economic Diversification of Tobacco Farming Communities. (a) \n     Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tobacco products are the foremost preventable health \n     problem facing America today. More than 400,000 individuals \n     die each year as a result of tobacco-induced illness and \n     conditions.\n       (2) Each day 3,000 young individuals become regular \n     smokers. Of these children, 1,000 will die prematurely from a \n     tobacco-related disease.\n       (3) Medicaid is a joint Federal-State partnership designed \n     to provide to provide health care to citizens with low-\n     income.\n       (4) On average, the Federal Government pays 57 percent of \n     the costs of the medicaid program and no State must pay more \n     than 50 percent of the cost of the program in that State.\n       (5) The comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between \n     manufacturers of tobacco products and States, and the \n     individual State settlements reached with such manufacturers, \n     include claims arising out of the medicaid program.\n       (6) As a matter of law, the Federal Government is not \n     permitted to act as a plaintiff in medicaid recoupment cases.\n       (7) Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396b(d)) specifically requires that the State reimburse the \n     Federal Government for its pro rata share of medicaid-related \n     expenses that are recovered from liability cases involving \n     third parties.\n       (8) In the comprehensive tobacco settlement, the tobacco \n     companies were released from all relevant claims that can be \n     made against them subsequently by the States, thereby \n     effectively precluding the Federal Government from recovering \n     its share of medicaid claims in the future through the \n     established statutory mechanism.\n       (9) The Federal Government has both the right and \n     responsibility to ensure that the Federal share of the \n     comprehensive tobacco settlement is used to reduce youth \n     smoking, to improve the public health, and to assist in the \n     economic diversification of tobacco farming communities.\n       (b) Amendment to Social Security Act.--Section 1903(d)(3) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b(d)(3)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply \n     to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the \n     comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between \n     manufacturers of tobacco products (as defined in section \n     5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) and States, or \n     as part of any individual State settlement or judgment \n     reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against \n     one or more such manufacturers, if (and to the extent that) \n     the Secretary finds that following conditions are met:\n       ``(i) The Governor or Chief Executive Officer of the State \n     has filed with the Secretary a plan which specifically \n     outlines how--\n       ``(I) at least 20 percent of such amounts recovered or paid \n     in any fiscal year will be spent on programs to reduce the \n     use of tobacco products using methods that have been\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\n     shown to be effective, such as tobacco use cessation \n     programs, enforcement of laws relating to tobacco products, \n     community-based programs to discourage the use of tobacco \n     products, school-based and child-oriented education programs \n     to discourage the use of tobacco products, and State-wide \n     awareness and counter-marketing advertising efforts to \n     educate people about the dangers of using tobacco products, \n     and for ongoing evaluations of these programs;

Mr. President, today I am addressing the Senate \nto express my view on the importance of maintaining a regulatory system \nthat has resulted in a renaissance of the nation's rail freight \nrailroads, which are so critical to the economic vitality of my state \nof Georgia.\n  In Georgia, we depend heavily on railroads to bring us raw materials \nand to carry our finished goods to market. Two major railroads, CSX and \nNorfolk Southern, operate more than 3,500 miles of rail line in \nGeorgia, and service is provided over more than 1,000 miles of track by \nregional and local railroads. More than 3 million carloads of such \ncommodities as coal, minerals, and pulp and paper are carried through \nGeorgia every year, and more than 6,000 Georgians are directly employed \nin the rail industry.\n  The importance of railroads in my state reaches much deeper than the \ncustomers they serve and the citizens they employ, however. As a member \nof the Small Business Committee, I am particularly aware of the \nnumerous small businesses throughout my state--including hundreds of \nlogging and sawmill operations that produce crossties--which depend for \ntheir livelihood on railroads having the financial resources to \nundertake infrastructure maintenance and improvements. If the railroads \ndo not have the resources for that investment, these small businesses--\nas well as rail shippers and employees--will suffer.\n  This financial strength has not always been there. Indeed, the rail \nindustry has undergone a remarkable resurgence from the late 1970s, \nwhen much of the industry was in bankruptcy and facing nationalization. \nThe foundation of this resurgence has been the statutory changes made \nunder the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. This bipartisan legislation lifted \nmuch of the regulatory burden that was stifling the industry, and \npermitted the railroads to compete in the marketplace for business, \nmake contracts with customers, and use differential pricing to support \nthe enormous capital investment they require for safe, efficient \noperations. These are basic activities engaged in by businesses across \nthe nation, activities which had been denied the railroads for nearly a \ncentury.\n  The results have been little short of amazing. A moribund industry \nhas come back to life, investing $225 billion in its infrastructure, \nand providing good jobs to a quarter of a million employees. And, while \nthe industry has had capacity constraints and other difficulties in \nsome areas in providing the high level of service customers deserve, I \nbelieve the industry is committed to making needed investments and \nworking with its customers to do better.\n  Despite the rail industry's gains, there are current efforts to turn \nback the clock and reimpose some of the destructive regulatory \ninterventions which in the past hindered the railroads' ability to \noperate efficiently and price their services competitively. If we do \nso, we will be heading right back from where we have come: inefficient, \npoorly-performing railroads that were not dependable carriers of goods. \nWe cannot afford that, if our nation's businesses are to grow and \nremain globally competitive.\n  Reauthorizing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which \nadministers the statute regulating the industry, is an important goal \nof the Senate Commerce Committee, and it is an objective that I \nendorse. Only by having a stable regulatory agency in place, can we \nensure the continued application of the law in a balanced manner that \ntakes into account the need to enable the railroads to earn enough to \nmaintain their infrastructure, while ensuring fair rates for shippers. \nIndeed, the railroads are one of the most capital intensive industries \nin our nation, and despite their increased viability, they still fall \nshort of the capital necessary to sustain and improve their plant and \nequipment. I support the current economic regulatory regime that has \nserved the nation well by sparking this rail rebirth. At the same time, \nI intend to carefully evaluate issues brought to the Committee's \nattention by rail labor organizations as this review goes forward.\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\n  We must ensure that our railroads can operate in ways that allow them \nto maximize their growth and earn a sufficient rate of return. Our \nshippers and the businesses that supply the rail industry need \ndependable, economically sound carriers to transport their goods and to \nbuy their products. Rail employees need a safe, fair and efficient \nsystem in which to work. These are mutually interdependent objectives, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve sound \npolicy determinations that satisfy these objectives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2875-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION HEALTH ADVOCATES OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dr. \nSamuel R. Dismond Jr. and HealthPlus of Michigan for their strong \ncommitment to health, education and the well-being of the Genesee \nValley area.\n  Dr. Dismond is the current chief of staff at Hurley Medical Center. \nThroughout his distinguished medical career, he has served on a number \nof influential boards. Dr. Dismond has also been recognized numerous \ntimes for his contributions to the medical profession. By supporting \nhis community and actively promoting research in health related fields, \nDr. Dismond has made a difference in a number of patient's and \nassociate's lives.\n  HealthPlus of Michigan has worked tirelessly to promote lung health \nwithin their organization and their community, including efforts to \nhelp any willing employee or patient quit smoking. This was \naccomplished by offering various smoking cessation and behavioral \nsupport programs. However, the biggest step HealthPlus has taken was \ninstituting guidelines requiring every physician affiliated with \nHealthPlus to inquire about his or her patient's smoking status during \neach visit and to track it within their permanent medical records. \nAlso, the physician must encourage every smoker to attempt to stop \nsmoking. HealthPlus has also donated money to the American Lung \nAssociation so that they might help to teach area children about \nasthma.\n  It is with great pleasure that I announce to the U.S. Senate Dr. \nSamuel R. Dismond as the recipient of this year's American Lung \nAssociation ``1998 Individual Health Advocate of the Year'' and \nHealthPlus as the ``1998 Corporate Health Advocate of the Year.'' These \nawards will be presented at the 16th annual Health Advocate of the Year \nAwards Dinner on March 18, 1999 in Grand Blanc, Michigan. I extend my \nsincerest congratulations to Dr. Dismond and HealthPlus of \nMichigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2875-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. This week marks the 10th anniversary of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, which elevated the Veterans \nAdministration (previously an independent federal agency) to cabinet-\nlevel status. This move capped the gradual evolution of a governmental \nresponse to the needs of veterans--beginning with the Plymouth colony's \nfirst pension law in 1636, and proceeding through a variety of federal \nbureaus with shared responsibility for ministering to veterans, before \nthose agencies were unified into one.\n  The creation of the Department of Veterans Affairs has both a real \nand a symbolic meaning. By raising the agency to cabinet level, the \nNation's chief veterans' advocate--the Secretary of Veterans Affairs--\nwas literally given a seat at the table with all other major executive \nagencies, and direct access to the President. Symbolically, veterans \nwere accorded ``a voice at the highest level of government,'' in the \nwords of former VA Secretary Jesse Brown. This is as it should be for \nthe second largest agency of the federal government, whose sole mission \nis to serve those whose sacrifices are the very backbone of the \nfreedoms we all enjoy.\n  As current VA Secretary Togo D. West, Jr., has said, ``Cabinet status \nhas brought many benefits; but is has also brought increased \nobligations.'' The VA plays a major role nationally in the fields of \nhealth care, education, insurance, and housing. As the Nation's budget \nis divided up, it is important that VA be on a level playing field with \nother federal departments to effectively safeguard our veterans' \ninterests.\n  I want to take this opportunity to salute the many talented, caring, \nand dedicated employees of the Department who are at the heart of its \noperations. I know they labor under a heavy workload, particularly in \nthis era of tightening budgets. We must ensure they have the resources \nthey need to carry out their mission.\n  The Department's 10th anniversary marks a happy milestone, a decade \nof growth and accomplishments. My warmest congratulations to all who \nshare in this achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2875-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GREAT LAKES CHAMBER MUSIC FESTIVAL TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nGreat Lakes Chamber Music Festival, a dynamic organization which has \nmade an incredible contribution to Michigan's culture. The Chamber's \nconcerts have really left their imprint on our State, with some twenty \nconcerts in and near Detroit each year, many of which occur in the \nvenues of the Festival's sponsors--St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic \nChurch, Temple Beth El, and Kirk in the Hills. Additional concert \nlocations range from the Detroit Zoo to the Detroit Institute of Arts. \nThe Festival is administered by Detroit Chamber Winds & Strings, which \nperforms a number of the concerts. But today, I would like to take a \nmoment to officially welcome the Chamber to our nation's capital for \nwhat is expected to be a stellar performance in the Library of Congress \non Friday evening.\n  The Great Lakes Chamber Music Festival was born in 1994. The Festival \nis sponsored by three religious institutions, representing Catholic, \nJewish, and Protestant faiths, and Detroit Chamber Winds & Strings, a \nprominent chamber music ensemble.\n  Pianist James Tocco has been Artistic Director of the Festival since \nits inception. A native Detroiter, Mr. Tocco has brought a rotating \ncontingent of world-class musicians to the Festival, creating an event \nof national significance. The list of performers reads like a long \n``Who's who'' in chamber music, including Ruth Laredo, Peter Oundjian, \nPaul Katz, Miriam Fried, Gilbert, Kalish, Philip Setzer, the St. \nLawrence Quartet, Peter Wiley, Ida and Ani Kavafian, and others. The \nFestival provides a major educational initiative to assist ensembles \nemerging to professional stature. Entitled the Shouse Institute, this \nprogram brings groups from throughout the world to Detroit for \nperformances and coachings by Festival artists. These young artists \nattend the Festival tuition-free and receive complimentary lodging.\n  So in welcoming the Great Lakes Chamber Festival to Washington, D.C., \nand thanking all of those from the Chamber that made this possible, I \nalso would like to single out Gwen and Evan Weiner, dear friends of our \nfamily who introduced the Chamber to me and who have played a critical \nrole in enhancing cultural life in Michigan, as well as Harriet Rotter, \nanother close friend who has contributed a great deal of time and \nenergy to this effort. Gwen, Evan, Harriet, and the many others who are \ninvolved with the Chamber Festival are sterling examples of community \nleadership at its best, and I am pleased they are here today. Finally, \nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the hard and dedicated work \nof Maury Okun, the Chamber Festival's Executive Director, an invaluable \nmember of the Chamber Festival team.\n  Again, I want to commend all those involved in making The Great Lakes \nChamber Music Festival a tremendous success, and extend my warmest \nwishes and best of luck for the concert Friday night and in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2875-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2875-S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DOUG SWINGLEY'S WINNING OF THE ALASKAN IDITAROD SLED DOG RACE\n\n Mr. BURNS. I rise today to bring attention to Doug Swingley's \nsecond victory in the Alaskan Iditarod. Doug hails from Simms, Montana, \nwhere he raises and trains his dogs.\n  As you all know, the Alaskan Iditarod is a grueling dog sled race \nfrom Anchorage to Nome, Alaska. The race covers 1,161 miles and is run \nin some of the harshest weather in the world.\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\n  Doug Swingley began mushing in 1989 with plans of running the \nIditarod. He ran his first Iditarod in 1992 and was the top-placing \nrookie hat year. He has competed in every Iditarod race since 1992 and \nwon the event for the first time in only his third attempt. I am sure \nthat Doug's second victory will disappoint my good friends Senators \nStevens and Murkowski, because Doug is the only non-Alaskan to win the \nIditarod. He has proven that a kid from Montana can take on our friends \nfrom the North and beat them at their own game and win.\n  Like his first victory, Doug pulled his team away from the \ncompetition, and showed incredible speed through the final stages of \nthis demanding race. I am impressed by his dedication and hard work, \nand I am proud to know that Montana is full of people like \nDoug.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2876-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EDUCATION FLEXIBILITY PARTNERSHIP ACT\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as the primary sponsor of S. 280, \nthe Education Flexibility Partnership Act (Ed-Flex), I am pleased that \nthe Senate passed this legislation by a 98 to 1 margin on March 11, \n1999. In addition, the House of Representatives passed the companion \nbill on the same day by a vote of 330 to 90. This bicameral, bipartisan \nsupport for Ed-Flex is a positive first step for education reform in \nthe 106th Congress.\n  This first step in education reform is desperately needed. Critics of \nour education system note that the federal government provides only \nseven percent of funds in education, but requires 50 percent of the \npaperwork. In addition, more often than not, well-intentioned federal \nprograms come with stringent regulations and directives which tie the \nhands of school officials and teachers. As the Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee's Task Force on Education, I have heard the pleas from \nstates and localities for greater flexibility in administering federal \nprograms in exchange for increased accountability. This theme has been \nechoed as I travel around Tennessee visiting schools and holding \neducation roundtable discussions for teachers, principals, \nsuperintendents, parents, school board officials, and other interested \nmembers of the community.\n  The First Ed-Flex bill passed by Congress will provide greater \nflexibility coupled with increased accountability for our nation's \nschools. Specifically, this bill will allow every state the option to \nparticipate in the enormously popular Ed-Flex demonstration program \nalready in place in twelve states. The twelve state currently \nparticipating in the program are: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and \nVermont.\n  Ed-Flex frees responsible states from the burden of unnecessary, \ntime-consuming federal regulations, so long as states are complying \nwith certain core federal principles, such as civil rights, and so long \nas states are making progress toward improving their students' \nperformance. Under the Ed-Flex program, the Department of Education \ndelegates to the states its power to grant individual school districts \ntemporary waivers from certain federal requirements that interfere with \nstate and local efforts to improve education. To be eligible, a state \nmust waive its own regulations on schools. It must also hold schools \naccountable for results by setting academic standards and measuring \nstudent performance. Using this accountability system, states are \nrequired to monitor the performance of local education agencies and \nschools that have received waivers, including the performance of \nstudents affected by these waivers. At any time, either the state or \nthe Secretary of Education can terminate a waiver.\n  The twelve states that currently participate in Ed-Flex have used \nthis flexibility to allow school districts innovate and better use \nfederal resources to improve students outcomes. For instance, the \nPhelps Luck Elementary School in Howard County, Maryland used its \nwaiver to provide one-on-one tutoring for reading students who have the \ngreatest need in grade 1-5. They also used their waiver to lower the \naverage student/teacher ratio in mathematics and reading form 25/1 to \n12/1.\n  A Texas statewide waiver to allow more flexible use of Federal \nteacher training funds has allowed districts to better direct \nprofessional development dollars to those areas where they are needed \nmost. In Massachusetts, a school that had been eligible for Title I \nfunding in the past was ineligible for the 1997-98 school year, but was \nexpected to be eligible again for 1998-99. Massachusetts was able to \nuse Ed-Flex waiver authority to give the school a one-year waiver and \nassure continuity of service rather than disrupt services for a year.\n  Support for Ed-Flex is broad. The President has called for Ed-Flex \nexpansion, as well as others including the Secretary of Education, the \nNational Governors' Association, the Democratic Governors' Association, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Education Association, and \nthe National School Boards Association.\n  Ed-Flex is a move in the right direction. We must empower States and \nlocalities by giving them the flexibility they need to best combine \nFederal resources with State and local reform efforts. I am pleased \nthat the 106th Congress has acted quickly on my bill to ensure that \nevery State will have the opportunity to participate in this successful \nprogram. Ed-Flex is a common-sense, bipartisan plan that will give \nStates and localities the flexibility that they need while holding them \naccountable for producing results.\n  Now, the challenge for this Congress is to build on Ed-Flex's themes: \nflexibility and accountability. As we consider the Reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act later this year, we must \ncontinue the push to cut red tape and remove overly-prescriptive \nFederal mandates on Federal education funding. At the same time, we \nmust hold States and local schools accountable for increasing student \nachievement. Flexibility, combined with accountability, must be our \nobjective. The end result of our reform effort must spark innovation--\ninnovation designed to provide all students a world-class \neducation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2876-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2876-S2877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor S. 261, the \nTrade Fairness Act of 1999. I believe this legislation is crucial to \nour attempts to save American jobs from unfair competition and dumping.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, we must implement this legislation to \nprotect our steelworkers from imports dumped into our domestic markets \nby our Russian, Asian and Brazilian competitors.\n  American steelworkers have proven that they are our nation's \nbackbone. They provide the materials on which our shipping, \nmanufacturing, indeed our entire industrial base rely. In my state's \nUpper Peninsula two mines, the Tilden and the Empire, employ almost \n2,000 Michiganians. Last year the workers in these mines produced over \n15 million tons of iron ore pellets. They paid $8 million in taxes. \nTime and again they have stood up for America, and it is time for \nAmerica to stand up for them.\n  We must stand up for these hard working men and women, Mr. President, \nbecause they face a very real threat to their livelihoods. Let me cite \na few numbers. By October of last year Japan had already doubled its \nimports to the United States from the year before. Just in that month \nof October, Japan sent 882,000 tons of steel to the United States, an \nall-time record. Finally, in that month alone 4.1 million net tons of \nsteel were imported to the United States.\n  The reasons for this steep increase in imports are threefold. First, \nthe Federal Reserve's longstanding tight money policy produced actual \ndeflation in commodity prices, deflation from which our steel industry \nhas yet to recover. Second, the Asian, Russian and Brazilian economic \ncrises are forcing those countries to rely on exports to keep their \neconomies afloat. The U.S. is the world's biggest market, and so they \nhave targeted us. Third, the International Monetary Fund convinced \nthese countries to raise interest rates and devalue currencies, which \nallowed their steel to undercut our prices.\n  Combined, these factors have encouraged the unfair trade practice of \ndumping, selling steel in the United States at prices below the cost of \nproduction. This practice threatens disastrous consequences for our \nsteelworkers and for\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nour economy. Already, Mr. President, 10,000 workers have been laid off, \nwith more than twice that many put on reduced hours.\n  We cannot stand by while American workers lose their jobs. We cannot \nabide the unfair trade practice of dumping. We have worked hard--these \nmen and women have worked hard--to build a prosperous America. We \ncannot sacrifice them to pay for bureaucrats' mistakes, be they in \nWashington, Tokyo, or Moscow.\n  Mr. President, I have never made a secret of my strong, free-trade \nviews. But free trade must also be fair trade. Our laws already \nrecognize this principle. After all, we already have trade laws on the \nbooks intended to deal with these kinds of issues. It is time to \nenforce them. In addition, however, I believe the fact that these trade \nlaws are not being enforced shows the need for reform.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring the Trade Fairness Act. This \nlegislation will lower the threshold for establishing injury to our \nindustries so that we may more effectively protect them from unfair \ntrade practices.\n  Under this law imports that have a causal link to substantial injury \nin an industry will trigger action. Substantial injury will be \ndetermined by the International Trade Commission, considering ``the \nrate and amount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in \nabsolute and relative terms; the share of the domestic market taken by \nincreased imports; changes in the levels of sales, production, \nproductivity, capacity utilization, profits and losses, and \nemployment.''\n  In addition, this legislation establishes a comprehensive steel \nimport permit and monitoring program modeled on similar systems in \nCanada and Mexico. The program would require importers to provide \ninformation regarding country of origin, quantity, value, and \nHarmonized Traffic Schedule number. The legislation also requires the \nAdministration to release the data collected to the public in aggregate \nform on an expedited basis.\n  The information provided by the licensing program will allow the \nCommerce Department and the steel industry to monitor the influx of \nsteel imports into the U.S. Presently, it is very difficult to obtain \ntimely information regarding the volume of steel that enters the \ncountry. It usually take 2-3 months before specific figures can be \nobtained. This makes it very difficult to gauge the extent of the \nproblem when the damage is occurring.\n  Mr. President, this legislation provides us with the tools we need to \nprotect working Americans from unfair foreign competition. It will \nprevent undue hardship while upholding the standards of free, fair and \nopen trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2877-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2877-S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAUTHORIZING LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN DIRK S.

Mr. President, S. Res. 66 concerns a request for testimony \nin a criminal trial brought on behalf of the United States against Yah \nLin ``Charlie'' Trie, in the United States District Court for the \nEastern District of Arkansas. Mr. Trie, who was one of the\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nprincipal subjects of the campaign finance investigation conducted by \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs in 1997, is under indictment for \nobstructing the Committee's investigation, according to the indictment, \nby instructing another individual to destroy and withhold documents \nunder subpoena by the Committee.\n  This resolution would authorize present and former staff of the \nCommittee to testify in this matter, which is scheduled for trial in \nApril 1999, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and would \nauthorize the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee, \nacting jointly, to produce records of the Committee, except where a \nprivilege should be asserted.\n  The resolution (S.

William Jefferson Clinton, et al.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, S. Res. 67 concerns a civil action commenced \nin the United States District Court for the District of Colorado by \nRepresentative Bob Schaffer and three other individuals against the \nPresident of the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \nSecretary of the Senate, and the Clerk of the House, seeking judicial \nintervention in the payment of salaries to Members of both Houses.\n  The action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the \noperation of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, which provides for the \nautomatic adjustment of the compensation of Members of Congress on an \nannual basis to reflect changes in employment costs in the preceding \nyear, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is the same \nannual cost-of-living adjustment paid to Federal judges and senior \nexecutive branch officials and is timed to coincide with the annual \nJanuary 1 adjustment of the general civil service schedule. The issue \npresented in this action was the subject of a lawsuit brought in 1992 \nby another Member of the House of Representatives, who sought \nunsuccessfully to enjoin the 1993 congressional COLA, based on the then \nnewly-ratified 27th Amendment.\n  This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the \nSecretary of the Senate and to seek dismissal of this action in order \nto defend the Secretary's ability to continue to carry out his duty \nunder the law to disburse congressional compensation payable pursuant \nto the Constitution and Federal statute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2878-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONTINUED CONSIDERATION OF THE NOMINATION OF DAVID WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

PATRICK, PATRON SAINT OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today is St. Patrick's Day. It is \ninteresting to me that when people think of St. Patrick's Day, they \nthink of Irish, of Ireland and green and spring and those sorts of \nthings, much more than we think of St. Patrick.\n  I was looking up today and asking for some information on St. Patrick \nhimself.\n  St. Patrick of Ireland--this is on a web site. It is fascinating. I \ndo not think most people realize about St. Patrick, but he is one of \nthe world's most popular saints, as people know, along with St. \nNicholas and St. Valentine. The day is one cherished by everyone, \nparticularly the Irish.\n  There are many legends and stories of St. Patrick. This is his story. \nI will go through it briefly.\n  He was born around 385 in Scotland, probably Kilpatrick. His parents \nwere Romans living in Britain in charge of the colonies. As a boy of 14 \nor so, he was captured during a raiding party and taken to Ireland as a \nslave to herd and tend sheep. Ireland at this time was a land of Druids \nand pagans. He learned the language and practices of the people who \nheld him.\n  During his captivity, he turned to God in prayer, and he wrote:\n\n       The love of God and his fear grew in me more and more, as \n     did the faith, and my soul was rosed, so that, in a single \n     day, I have said as many as a hundred prayers and in the \n     night, nearly the same.\n       I prayed in the woods and on the mountains, even before \n     dawn. I felt no hurt from the snow or ice or rain.\n\n  Patrick's captivity lasted until he was 20, when he escaped after \nhaving a dream from God in which he was told\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nto leave Ireland by going to the coast. There he found some sailors who \ntook him back to Britain, where he was reunited with his family.\n  He had another dream--and this is just fascinating and miraculous to \nme--in which the people of Ireland were calling out to him, ``We beg \nyou, holy youth, to come and walk among us once more.'' This, again, \nwas the land where he was enslaved and from which he escaped.\n  He began his studies for the priesthood. He was ordained by St. \nGermanus, the Bishop of Auxerre, whom he studied under for years.\n  Later, Patrick was ordained a bishop and was sent to take the Gospel \nto Ireland where he had been enslaved. He arrived in Ireland on March \n25, 433. One legend says that he met a chieftain of one of the tribes \nwho tried to kill Patrick. He converted the chieftain after he was \nunable to move his arm and so he became friendly to Patrick.\n  Patrick began preaching the Gospel throughout Ireland, converting \nmany. He and his disciples preached and converted thousands and began \nbuilding churches all over the country. Kings, their families, and \nentire kingdoms converted to Christianity when hearing Patrick's \nmessage.\n  Patrick by now had many disciples, several of whom were later \ncanonized, as was St. Patrick.\n  Patrick preached and converted all of Ireland for many years. He \nworked many miracles and wrote of his love for God in confessions. \nAfter years of living in poverty, traveling, and enduring much \nsuffering, he died March 17, 461. He died at Saul, where he had built \nthe first church.\n\n  That is the story of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2879-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, on March 4, 1999, Robert Lawrence Inman, or \n``Coach Inman,'' as he was known to his friends--and everyone who ever \nmet him was his friend--``slipped the surly bonds of earth,'' and, I am \nsure, passed into the waiting arms of his Lord and Savior.\n  He left behind a loving family. He left behind a grateful community. \nHe left behind two generations of Nashville youth, including my own, \nwho learned much more from Coach Inman than how to succeed on the \nathletic field.\n  They learned that kindness is contagious, that a smile is a wonderful \ngift, that the path to success is paved not with lesson plans and study \nguides but with encouragement and with support. They learned that life \nis not about just winning or losing, but about being the best that you \npossibly can be.\n  At his funeral last Saturday, at the First Methodist Church in \nFranklin, TN, the pews were literally packed with people whose lives he \nhad touched in so many personal ways: Fellow teachers from the Ensworth \nSchool in Nashville, where he taught for over 30 years, fellow coaches \nfrom the Harpeth Valley Athletic Conference--a local sports league he \nfounded for seventh and eighth graders--and family and friends and, of \ncourse, students, young and old. For almost all of them, graduation was \nnot the end of their friendship; it continued through college and \nthrough marriage and through children of their own.\n  They literally packed the pews; they lined the walls; they billowed \nover from the balcony; they crammed the choir loft; they spilled out \ninto the vestibule and literally overflowed into the street--all in an \noutpouring of love and enthusiasm for a man whose love for children was \nboundless.\n  What made him so special? Students of all ages who remembered him \nlast week answered that question far better than I ever could. Their \nwords:\n\n       He was always smiling. His smile alone would make you feel \n     better.\n\n  Another said,\n\n       He always had a story to tell to motivate you--and if he \n     didn't, he'd make one up.\n\n  Said another,\n\n       He liked to tell jokes and play tricks to make you laugh.\n\n  And yet another,\n\n       He always showed he cared--whether it was just a word of \n     welcome, or something much more serious--like tending to \n     injuries in body and spirit.\n\n  Realizing that learning does not just end at the school door, Coach \nInman started a tradition of outdoor education, initially in the \nglorious mountains over East Tennessee. There were camping trips with \nstudents, all where the students could practice problem-solving or \nstudy the stars or really just be together and have a good time.\n  When some of his students suggested that, ``Well, we should have one \nmore outing after graduation,'' then began the famous Inman ``Out \nWest'' trip, an excursion into the truly great outdoors of Mount \nRushmore and the Grand Canyon and the Redwood Forest.\n  Each summer these trips would be the focal point for scores of \nchildren. In fact, several of the Frist family children, including my \nown son Harrison, shared Coach Inman's ``Out West'' adventure--a time \nthat I know they will never forget.\n  What did they learn from him? Well, in the words of one little girl:\n\n       I learned how special it is to stand at the top of the \n     Grand Canyon and realize that--like the water--if we try hard \n     enough, and stay at it long enough, we too can create our own \n     wonders. . . .\n       I learned that--every now and then--you should stop to look \n     at an old tree because it has learned how to reach up to the \n     clouds and still keep its roots in the earth. . . .\n       I learned that beauty is everywhere . . . how nice it feels \n     to fall asleep to the sound of a stream . . . how bright the \n     moon can look from the top of a mountain.\n       I learned that there is a way to teach people without \n     lecturing, and that sharing with someone who you are and \n     where you've been is one of the best gifts that you can give. \n     . . .\n       I learned that love isn't about conditions . . . that there \n     are good people in the world.\n\n  And she continued:\n\n       If it hadn't been for Coach Inman, his words wouldn't be \n     the ones I still hear when I'm afraid or nervous telling me \n     that I can do anything and that there are people who will \n     support me--even if I fall.\n       If I could build a mountain, or paint a sky to tell him how \n     much a part of my life he is, then the mountain would stretch \n     out past the clouds and the sky would be the color of smiles \n     and laughter and it would tell him that I love him.\n\n  Mr. President, children weren't the only ones who appreciated Robert \nInman. He was six times honored by the Peabody College of Vanderbilt \nUniversity as an outstanding educator. Singer Amy Grant--herself a \nformer Inman student--donated the funds necessary to refurbish the \nEnsworth Elementary gym on the condition it be named for Coach Inman.\n  Commenting on this gift at his funeral, his friend and fellow \nteacher, Nathan Sawyer, noted that the Egyptian pharaohs believed that \nif their names were written somewhere they would live forever. Thus, he \nsaid, every time a stranger sees that name over the gym and asks who it \nwas that was so honored, the Robert Inman story will begin again.\n  True enough. But I think he needn't worry. For as the poet Albert \nPike said:\n\n       What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we \n     have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.\n\n  At a time when there is so much concern about the state of American \neducation, so much concern about the quality of teachers, the lack of \ngood and virtuous example, it is reassuring to know that there was a \nteacher of the caliber and the character of Robert Inman.\n  To his loving wife, Helen--who shared his life and his passion for \nchildren--and to their three wonderful sons, Michael, Matthew, and \nJohn--our love and support. Although Coach Inman is no longer with us, \nhis memory will live on in the inscription over the gym, on the \nfootball fields, on the\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nbasketball courts, at the wrestling matches, at the track meets, but \nmost of all in the minds and in the spirits and the hearts of all the \nchildren he touched; children who, indeed, are better people because \nthere was a teacher who cared, a teacher named Robert Lawrence Inman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/17/senate-section/article/S2880-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
