Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, I understand we are now on the Leahy amendment to S. \n254.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is intended to address the problem of \nyouth violence with tough law enforcement initiatives at the Federal \nlevel, with assistance to State and local law enforcement, proven \nprevention programs for juvenile delinquency, and measures to keep guns \nout of the hands of children.\n  Many of the proposals in this amendment were part of a bill I \nintroduced, along with Senator Daschle and other Democratic Members, \nlast year in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act of \n1998. That was S. 2484. We have introduced it this year as S. 9.\n  These are carefully crafted proposals. They were not done as knee-\njerk responses to the school shootings, or even the most bloody murders \nin Littleton. We talked with prosecutors and police officers and \nteachers and everybody else in putting these proposals together. The \nseries of proposals in the amendment have been ready since last year, \nbut this is our first opportunity to present them to the Senate for \ndiscussion and a vote. While these proposals predated the events at \nColumbine High School, it escapes nobody's notice that the events at \nthe high school give them added urgency.\n  This amendment is part of the Democratic multipronged agenda for \naction that embraces tough and more aggressive law enforcement \ninitiatives, plus those initiatives in our other amendments to help \nteachers, counselors, parents, and children with afterschool\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nprograms, with effective and proven school safety strategies and, of \ncourse, treatment programs for high-risk youth. It faces the reality \nthat we live in a different world, not like when I was going to school, \nor when most of us in this Chamber went to school. It is a complex \nworld and you do not attack the problems of it on just one front; you \nhave to attack them on many.\n  We Democrats look forward to the Senate debating and taking action on \nproposals that can be enacted now and working over the long haul on \nadditional structural remedies. No matter what legislation we pass this \nweek, we also need long-term solutions to school violence. These \nsolutions include getting smaller classrooms; smaller schools--not \nthese schools that are cities in and of themselves where students don't \neven know each other and the teachers don't know them--helping parents \nspend more time supervising their children, realizing that is the bond \nthat is often broken in today's society; and working constructively \nwith the movie, television, and video game industries to adopt rating \nsystems that parents can understand and use.\n  This law enforcement amendment is substantial and comprehensive. It \nhas five separate parts. I will highlight a few of the important \nproposals in this amendment. It addresses some of the same subject \nmatter areas as S. 254. I will highlight some of the differences in our \napproaches.\n  In the area of federalization, my amendment also proposes reforms in \nthe Federal juvenile justice system. We do so without Federalizing run-\nof-the-mill juvenile offenses and ignoring the traditional prerogative \nof the States to handle the bulk of juvenile crime. Too often when we \nhave talked about crime on the Senate floor in recent years, we \nbasically have told the States, the State legislatures, State law \nenforcement, and State prosecutors, that they are irrelevant, that we \nwill run everything out of Washington, and the Federal Government knows \nbetter. I don't believe that.\n\n  My proposal for reforming the Federal juvenile justice system heeds \nthe advice of Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Federal judiciary and \nreflects the proper respect for our Federal system.\n  Let me explain. My amendment retains the provision in current law \nwhich establishes a clear presumption that the States should handle \nmost juvenile offenders. S. 254 repeals that provision.\n  Furthermore, current law directs that most juveniles ``shall'' not be \nproceeded against in Federal court, unless the Attorney General \ncertifies certain things--in most cases, that the State does not or \nrefuses to exercise jurisdiction over the juvenile. Judges may review \nthat certification to see whether the threshold for exercise of Federal \njurisdiction has been met. S. 254 changes that.\n  As I mentioned in my statement yesterday, the bill before us gives \nconflicting signals. S. 254 contains one welcome change over S. 10 from \nthe last Congress by requiring the Attorney General or the U.S. \nattorney, depending on the charge, to ``exercise a presumption in favor \nof referral'' of juvenile cases to the appropriate State or tribal \nauthorities, where there is ``concurrent jurisdiction.'' But, in \ncontrast to the law today, that certification is not reviewable by any \ncourt. My amendment would continue to permit such court review in most \ncases but not cases involving serious violence or drug offenses.\n  Because of the repeal of the important State presumption provision \nand the lack of review of the Federal prosecutor's decision to proceed \nagainst a juvenile federally, many rightly fear that the State \nprerogative to handle juvenile offenders will be undermined by this \nbill. My amendment would not do that. Basically, what I am saying is \nthat we are not going to stand in the U.S. Senate and tell the 50 State \nlegislatures that they are irrelevant and tell the prosecutors of the \n50 States that they are irrelevant because 100 U.S. Senators know \nbetter and we can do it better from Washington.\n  Ironically enough, some of the same people who will vote for \nsomething that would take it away from the States and turn it over to \nWashington are the same ones who go back to their States and give great \nspeeches about: We know better here in our State, and we don't need \nWashington to tell us what to do. And then they come up here time after \ntime and vote to federalize cases that are being handled by the State \ncourts and make irrelevant the State legislatures, State prosecutors, \nand State law enforcement. Sooner or later, some of those speeches are \ngoing to catch up with us and haunt us.\n  Our law enforcement officials should be proud of the decline of the \nviolent crime rate and murder rate we have experienced since 1993, \nbecause it is largely due to their efforts and innovative programs like \nthe COPS Program and community policing. There is nothing like seeing a \npolice officer on the corner to make a criminal move on. We want that \ndecline to continue, particularly in schools. Certainly, it does not \ntake a criminologist to know that if you have the presence of the \npolice, crime will go elsewhere, or not occur at all.\n\n  The strong bipartisan report for this proposal was demonstrated \nyesterday on passage of the amendment by Senator Gregg, which was \ncosponsored by Senator Boxer and myself. That amendment set up a new \ngrant program with eligibility requirements to put cops in schools. The \nproposal in my amendment would expand the COPS Program and waive the \nmatching non-Federal fund requirement to put more police in and around \nour schools.\n  My approach builds on a program with a proven track record. It is not \na hypothetical. The States are familiar with it. We, at the State \nlevel, know how it works. This amendment extends grants to local law \nenforcement for other programs, such as rural drug enforcement and \nByrne grant funding.\n  My amendment also provides, in section 124, funding for the juvenile \nState court prosecutors. Yesterday, the Senate passed the Hatch-Biden-\nSessions amendment which authorizes $50 million per year for \nprosecutors. As I pointed out yesterday, this amendment does not \nauthorize any additional money for judges, public defenders, \ncounselors, or correctional officers. By leaving them out, you could \nend up exacerbating the backlog in the juvenile justice system rather \nthan helping it, because it requires all those parts within the \njuvenile justice system to make it work.\n  In contrast to Hatch-Biden-Sessions, my amendment authorizes funding \nfor ``increased resources to State juvenile court systems, juvenile \nprosecutors, juvenile public defenders, and other juvenile court system \npersonnel.'' I hope that will be something my distinguished friend from \nUtah, the exemplary chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, might \nsupport.\n  We need to do more to protect our children from drugs. My drug \namendment would increase certain penalties for drug sales to children \nor near schools or for using children in the illegal drug trade.\n  As terrible as it sounds, Mr. President, we see this--where children \nare being used in the drug trade and where they abuse children as \nrunners for distributors. It is one of the cruelest, most cynical \nthings that can be done.\n  We also establish juvenile drug courts that are modeled on the \nsuccessful drug court programs for adults, because it gives special \nattention to supervision and treatment of offenders, and how to get \nthem clean.\n  It doesn't do any good to simply prosecute a drug offender if they \nare going to come back out and be just as addicted. We should try to \nget them off their dependence on drugs.\n  Let's talk about guns. Everybody tiptoes around this Chamber when it \ncomes to the question of guns. On the one hand, you have people who \nfeel there should be no guns at all, who couldn't even conceive of \nhandling a gun, to those who feel that everybody should walk around \nwith their own arsenal. The reality is somewhere in between.\n  Growing up in Vermont in a rural State, I grew up with guns. I have \nowned guns from the time I was a youngster. I went through the usual \ngun safety courses, became a champion marksman in college, and, in \nfact, competed in schools all over the country, and still shoot \ncompetitive target shooting.\n  I also taught my two sons and my daughter how to use and enjoy guns \nsafely. We have very strict rules, and still have very strict rules at \nour home in Vermont in using guns, or in target practice--a lot \nstricter rules than most gun clubs would have.\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\n  But having said all of that, every gun owner, or not, is sickened by \nthe school shootings and the tragic murders of the young children and \ndedicated teachers.\n  We recognize we have to take steps to protect our children from gun \nviolence--steps that might go beyond just one parent to their child. \nNothing can substitute for parental involvement and supervision.\n  Let me emphasis that. Most of us know as parents that nothing \nsubstitutes for parental involvement and supervision. But we also know \nwe can take constructive steps to keep guns out of the hands of \nchildren when they are not under that kind of parental involvement and \nsupervision.\n  The statement of administration position on S. 254 points out that \nthis bill does not include any provisions on guns, and that this should \nbe part of the broad-based, comprehensive approach to juvenile crime.\n  This amendment contains a number of proposals to protect children \nfrom guns.\n  I ask Senators: Are you willing to stand up and vote for or against \nthese proposals?\n  Let me tell you what you are going be voting on, that every Senator \nis going to determine whether they want to vote for it or against.\n  We ban the transfer to and possession by juveniles of assault weapons \nand high-capacity ammunition clips.\n  Are you for or against that?\n  We increase criminal penalties for transfers of handguns, assault \nweapons, and high-capacity ammunition clips to juveniles.\n\n  Senators are going to have to ask themselves when they vote on this: \nAre we for or against that provision?\n  We ban gun sales to persons who have violent crime records, even if \nthose crimes were committed as juveniles.\n  Senators, are we for or against this provision?\n  We increase penalties for certain gun offenses involving minors.\n  Senators, are you for or against this provision?\n  We provide grants for the children's gun safety programs and for \njuvenile gun and youth violence courts with dissemination of model \nprograms via Internet web sites.\n  Senators, are you for or against this provision?\n  We expand youth crime gun interdiction efforts in up to 250 cities by \nthe year 2003.\n  Senators, are you for or against this provision?\n  We grant priority for tracing of guns used in youth crime, with \nincreased Federal resources dedicated to the enforcement of firearm \nlaws.\n  Senators, are you for or against this provision?\n  We have heard that this administration is not enforcing our gun laws. \nLet's stop the political mudslinging and ignoring of important facts \nand realize that as Americans we are in this together. The murder rate \nfor juveniles rose sharply in the late 1980s and the early 1990s due to \na rise in gun violence. Since then, with some strong programs by this \nadministration, the murder rate is on the decline. In fact, juvenile \nmurder and non-negligent manslaughter arrests declined almost 40 \npercent between 1993 and 1997.\n  According to the Justice Department, Federal enforcement has focused \non serious firearm offenders. These prosecutions are up 30 percent from \n1992--up 30 percent. Federal and State law enforcement are working \ntogether more and more resulting in a 25-percent increase in combined \nannual firearm prosecutions since 1992--a 25-percent increase. The \nviolent crime rate has come down. The murder rate has come down. The \nprosecution of gun offenses has gone up.\n  Those are indisputable facts. But having said that, we should strive \nto improve enforcement of our gun laws. That is why my law enforcement \namendment provides $100 million for the next 2 years dedicated to \nFederal firearm prosecutions.\n  It also establishes grant programs to replicate successful juvenile \ncrime and truancy prevention programs, such as the program in Boston \nwhere they had a terrible, terrible slew of juvenile murders. They \nstarted this program and the murders stopped. We can replicate that in \nother cities.\n  As an aside, I strongly urge that those who prosecute cases involving \nweapons--be it at the Federal level or the State level--do what I did \nas a prosecutor. When I had a case involving a weapon of any sort--a \ngun, a knife, in a couple of instances a baseball bat--I sought, under \nour State law, a law that is similar to almost every State, an \nadditional penalty for the use of a weapon. It can be anything that was \nused as a weapon in the commission of a crime. The word got around \npretty quickly that if you used any kind of a weapon in a crime, \nassault, or burglary, or anything else, you were going to pay some \nadditional penalty and you served additional time.\n  Finally, we commit resources and attention in this amendment to \npreventing juvenile crime with grant programs to youth organizations \nfor supervised youth activities and afterschool programs.\n\n  The amendment would authorize spending $2 billion over the next 2 \nyears on juvenile crime prevention and intervention.\n  Mr. President, everybody in law enforcement will tell you the same \nthing. The easiest crime to handle is the crime that never happened. \nAnd our crime prevention programs are modeled after what the police and \nothers have told us work the best to prevent crimes.\n  I do not know and have never worked with a police officer who hasn't \ntold me to help them prevent the crime from happening in the first \nplace--juvenile crime especially. There are proven ways that work.\n  We are talking about spending billions and billions and billions of \ndollars more on the Kosovo crisis, along with the billions and billions \nand billions of dollars we spend in bombing Belgrade and elsewhere. Why \ndon't we take a small part of that and invest it on our children, the \nsafety of our children in a nation of a quarter of a billion people? \nWhy not spend some money to protect our children within our own \nborders?\n  Similarly to S. 254, my amendment would reauthorize the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act. But in contrast to S. 254, my \namendment preserves intact four core protections for youth in \ndetention, but it also grants flexibility for rural areas.\n  We can come to the floor of the Senate and vote for feel-good \nproposals. We can pass resolutions condemning crime and violence--as \nthough any Senator within this debate is for crime and violence; we are \nall against it. The reality is sometimes more difficult than the \nrhetoric. We need more than feel-good efforts. Parents and children in \nthis country want concrete proposals. We give them those in this \namendment.\n  As I said earlier, the question will be, Are Senators for or against \nthem? We will have the vote and we will make that determination. These \nare proposals put together by Senators whose political philosophies go \nacross the spectrum, by law enforcement officials who have testified \nand given Members their best analyses, by those who have run successful \njuvenile programs that have lowered juvenile crime and have stopped \njuvenile violence. We have put all this together. We have taken off any \nmantles of partisanship. These are proposals that we know work, not \npie-in-the-sky but proven proposals.\n  The American people send Senators here to do a job, to pay taxes, to \nhelp parents seek a life where they do not have to fear for their \nchildren when they go to school, where parents do not have to fear for \ntheir children while they are at school, where there will be some \ncontrol of juvenile violence. That is what is in this amendment.\n  How much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Seven minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I enjoyed listening to my colleague and I \nappreciate his efforts.\n  Before I move into the substance of Senator Leahy's substitute, which \nis essentially an amendment, I note that we have had very little time \nto study and consider this amendment. We saw this amendment, which is \n211 pages long, for the first time yesterday. The Senate has held no \nhearings--none whatsoever--on this amendment, nor has the amendment \never been referred to the committee as a bill or otherwise. \nConsequently, not only has the Senate\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nnot considered Senator Leahy's substitute, no outside groups in law \nenforcement or the juvenile justice communities have had the \nopportunity to examine this amendment. Having said that, that doesn't \nmean we should not consider it at this time.\n  By contrast, the Judiciary Committee has worked on S. 254 and its \npredecessor, S. 10, for more than 2 years. The Youth Violence \nSubcommittee, under the leadership of Senators Sessions and Biden, has \nheld numerous hearings on S. 254 and its predecessor. These hearings \nhave examined S. 254 from different angles and perspectives. A variety \nof experts have testified in favor and in detail about this bill. S. \n254 is the most thoroughly considered juvenile crime legislation in my \n23 years in the Senate and service on the Judiciary Committee and it \nhas bipartisan support, as we saw yesterday on the vote.\n  Senator Biden, the ranking member of the Youth Violence Subcommittee, \none of the leading Senators on crime issues, supports S. 254. We \nappreciate the efforts he has made. Moreover, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Boy and Girl Scouts, and the \nNational Collaboration for Youth, among other organizations, have \nexamined S. 254 in detail. These groups have written letters of support \nfor S. 254. Needless to say, these groups have not endorsed Senator \nLeahy's substitute, because they have not had a chance to consider the \namendment.\n  I don't mean to imply that this substitute does not contain some good \nproposals. In certain ways it is similar to S. 254. For example, I \ncommend Senator Leahy for including funds for juvenile prosecution and \ndrug treatment, but funding for these purposes is already in S. 254. In \nfact, virtually every basic fund for prevention is in S. 254. Also, \nthis substitute changes procedural reforms to the Federal prosecution \nof juveniles that are very similar to S. 254, the bill before the \nSenate. Again, we address this area in the underlying bill.\n  In particular, the substitute contains a reverse waiver that allows \nFederal district court judges to reverse any Federal prosecutor's \ndecision to prosecute a juvenile as an adult. Under both S. 254 and \nSenator Leahy's substitute, the juvenile defendant must prove by \n``clear and convincing evidence'' that he or she should not be tried as \nan adult.\n  In short, there is much in the Leahy substitute that Senators will \nhave the opportunity to vote for when we pass S. 254.\n  Despite some positive provisions, the Leahy substitute is, in my \nopinion, badly flawed. For example, the Leahy substitute changes the \nprovision to encourage and assist States to upgrade and share juvenile \ncriminal records. One of the major features of our juvenile justice \nbill is improving criminal records sharing--I might add, that is a \nuniquely Federal role--but the Leahy amendment does not improve \njuvenile records in a meaningful way. It would effectively strike the \nprovisions governing the upgrading and improving of juvenile felony \nrecords. This is an important part of our bill. We found that if we \ndon't keep these records, people don't realize when violent juveniles \nreach the age of maturity, or of majority, they don't realize what \nthese young people may have done with regard to violence in their \nyouth.\n\n  In addition, the Leahy substitute is not a balanced approach toward \nthe accountability program. It provides only $150 million for \naccountability programs, such as graduated sanctions and detention for \njuveniles, out of an annual authorization of $1.86 billion in that \nbill, in that substitute. In other words, only 8.9 percent of the total \nfunding goes to accountability programs. We all want prevention, but \naccountability is important, too. I have worked long and hard to remedy \nwhat some have thought in the past to be a failure to have enough \nprevention in these bills, as we are concerned about accountability. So \nwe have made those changes on S. 254 to try to make this a more \nbipartisan bill for all Members to support.\n  We need to support and encourage a full range of graduated sanctions \nfrom the earliest acts of delinquent behavior to help ensure that early \nacts of delinquency do not grow into more serious problems.\n  This chart indicates that the earliest acts of delinquent behavior \nstart at age 7, the green line. That is the average age where \nbehavioral problems really come into focus and start with young people. \nThey continue to grow worse as they get older if there is no effective \nintervention. The underlying bill, unlike my colleague's substitute, \nrecognizes this and addresses it thoroughly.\n  Although we showed this chart yesterday, it is worthwhile going over \nit again and again. People need to understand the history and the \nprobabilities of misbehavior by young people. Minor problems of \nmisbehavior generally start at age 7, usually because of broken \nfamilies or the lack of a father in the home, with the mother doing her \nbest to try to help the children but having to work generally or, if \nnot working, on welfare. It starts then. It isn't necessarily the \nchild's fault. So we need to do what we can to intervene at that time \nwhen we have some of these minor behavior problems. That includes both \ncorrection and enforcement.\n\n  Now, moderately serious problem behavior really starts gaining focus \nat 9.5 years. As a child grows to 9.5 years old, if that child has not \nbeen helped between 7 and 9.5, you start to get moderately serious \nproblem behavior.\n  Then it becomes serious delinquency by almost 12 years of age, or \n11.9 years of age. Then the first court contact generally, for index \noffenses--in other words, offenses that are quite serious--happens \nreally at about 14.5 years of age.\n  This is important stuff, because we have to balance both sides of \nthis equation, not just prevention but accountability as well. If we do \nnot expect young people to be accountable and we don't put the \nresources into helping them be accountable, they are going to get to \n14.5 years and we are going to be left with a hoped-for prevention that \nreally isn't going to work in many cases. It may work, but we almost \nguarantee it will work if we can require a certain aspect of \naccountability during these years of age, 7 to 14.5.\n  That is one of the things we are trying to do in this bill. This is \nnot a partisan bill. This is not a bill that is a triumph of Republican \nprinciples over Democrat principles. We have taken the best from both \nparties and tried to mold it together into a bill that really will work \nand make a dent in some of these problems that really are despoiling \nour society.\n  Prevention programs are not effective unless there are some \naccountability measures to reinforce them. Providing only 8.9 percent \nfor accountability measures is not a balanced approach. S. 254, by \ncontrast, provides approximately 40 percent for accountability \nprograms. We balance the two.\n  By the way, we are spending an extra half billion dollars, if we pass \nthe Leahy substitute, an extra half billion dollars on top of what we \nare spending, which is a monumental amount of money, over $1 billion, \n$1.1 billion in the Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill. It is important we do \nthe accountability aspects of this.\n  On what does Senator Leahy's amendment propose spending funds? In \nenforcement, it authorizes rural drug training, grants for State courts \nand prosecutors, and the Byrne Program. All of these are generally \nworthy programs, and I commend the Senator for recognizing them. \nIndeed, I have been a vocal critic of the recent efforts of the Clinton \nadministration to cut funding for some of these very same programs. \nWhat of the $200 million the Leahy amendment purports to spend on more \npolice officers in schools? This is in reality just an extension of the \nexisting COPS Program, and it is not targeted at juvenile crime. Some \nCOPS funding can of course be used for school security. In fact, \nRepublicans last Congress, led by Senator Campbell, amended the COPS \nProgram to allow its grants to pay for school security officers. But to \ncall this general reauthorization a program dedicated to cops in \nschools is a bit inaccurate.\n  What is left of the Leahy amendment? Prevention, which of course we \nall agree is important, no question about it. The Hatch-Biden-Sessions \namendment the Senate adopted yesterday increases our bill's commitment \nto prevention to $547.5 million per year, as this chart indicates.\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\n  Just so we all understand this, from the juvenile crime prevention \nstandpoint, the funding of the OJJDP prevention programs, you can see \nthat in 1994 we spent $107 million on these juvenile justice \ndelinquency prevention programs--$107 million, which many in that year \nthought was quite a bit of money. I did not. Senator Leahy did not. I \ndon't think Senator Biden did. But the fact is it was $107 million.\n\n  We have in 1995 jumped to $144 million, and in 1996 as well. Then in \n1997 we went to $170 million; then in 1998, $201.7 million. We have \nbeen bringing it up gradually. But look, in our bill we put it up to \n$267.6 million. As we have gradually worked hard to do, we put it up. \nThen in our bill, starting in the year 2000, we go all the way up to \n$547.5 million. We double the money in this bill. That is a lot of \nmoney. And we ought to make sure that money works. We should not get \ninto a contest of throwing money at these problems and saying that is \ngoing to solve them.\n  We have a balanced bill here that takes care of the accountability \naspects, about 40 percent of our bill, and about 60 percent is for \nprevention. Those green lines, from 2000 through 2004, represent almost \n$600 million a year on top of other prevention funds we already have in \nother programs. So it is not as if we are letting prevention down. In \nfact, we have balanced it so we have both accountability and \nprevention.\n  I might add, our prevention is more balanced than that in the Leahy \namendment. Mr. President, $850 million of Senator Leahy's amendment's \n``juvenile crime prevention'' is focused exclusively on crime \nprevention. I think that is important, but we do that as well. And $400 \nmillion of that funding is not even dedicated to the juvenile drug \nproblem. So that bothers me a little bit, too. We are now working on a \njuvenile drug bill.\n  Yesterday, we got into a little bit of a hassle on the floor because \nSenator Robb and Senator Kennedy and others wanted to add SAMHSA money, \nmental health moneys, to this bill. We provide that our prevention \nmoneys can be used for mental health, but we do not try to rewrite in \nthe bill the whole of mental health legislation in this country. We are \ngoing to do that later. I will help them do that, because I am as \nconcerned about mental health issues as Senators Kennedy and Robb and \nthe others who voted for that. But that is not the purpose of this \nbill, when we provide that is one of the alternatives, one of the \noptions that State and local governments will have in resolving this.\n  It is the same thing with juvenile crime prevention and drug \nprevention. We provide for that in this bill. Moreover, this \nsubstitute, the Leahy substitute, is not narrowly focused on the \nproblem we should be debating, and that is juvenile crime. Indeed, of \nthe advertised $3.581 billion over 3 years, by my count, only $1.6 \nbillion, or 45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime.\n  We would like to make this bill be a juvenile justice/juvenile crime \nbill, and not make it a big social spending bill, when we have other \nprograms that literally can be beefed up for those purposes. I am not \nnecessarily against doing that in other programs, but this bill is \nbalanced and we want to keep it that way.\n  So of the advertised $3.581 billion over 3 years, only $1.6 billion, \nor 45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime. My omnibus \ncrime bill, the 21st Century Justice Act, which is S. 899, is a \ncomprehensive approach to our general crime problem. But the bill we \nare debating today is a juvenile crime bill, and that ought to be our \nfocus, our total focus. If we can pass this bill, we will do more to \nsolve and resolve juvenile crime problems than almost anything we have \ndone in history. That is why it is such an important bill, especially \nwhen we have had to go through some of these very difficult times that \nthis country has gone through recently.\n\n  In short, the Leahy substitute is no substitute for the effective \ncomprehensive approach to juvenile crime proposed in the underlying \nHatch-Biden-Sessions bill. So I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment, as much as it is well intentioned, as much as I respect my \ncolleague. I really do respect my colleague, who works very hard on the \nJudiciary Committee. I know he is sincere in presenting these matters. \nBut I want this bill to be balanced. I want it to be tough and lean--\nand work. We have added plenty of money, as you can see. We are jumping \nthose funds dramatically in 1 year to where we have very significant \namount of funds. We have doubled them, in essence.\n  There will be people around here, no matter how much money you spend, \nwho will always want to spend more. There comes a time when you have to \ndo what is best under the circumstances and what is right under the \ncircumstances. That is what will get this bill through both Houses of \nCongress and will do what really needs to be done for our young people \nin this society who are troubled and who have difficulties and whom we \ncan save if we pass this bill. We can prevent some of the things that \nhave happened in the past that have literally disrupted our society and \nhurt so many people.\n  Finally, S. 254 is supported by real people who took the time to get \ninvolved in juvenile justice. For example, more than a year ago, I \nreceived a letter from a woman named Cris Owsley in Sunnyside, WA. She \nwrote about how her son, Shaun, was knifed to death by a 15-year-old \nattacker in January of 1997. Shaun was just 2 days past his 18th \nbirthday, and he was murdered at his birthday party.\n  Shaun's parents are courageous people. They took their grief and \nturned it into activism. Working with other parents and the State \nlegislature, they became advocates for laws that would appropriately \npunish juveniles like the murderer who killed their son. Then they \ncontacted me and asked what they could do to promote reform nationally. \nI invited them to Washington last summer where they joined me and \nothers on the Judiciary Committee and numerous law enforcement groups \nto urge passage of this juvenile crime bill. I am sure they will \napprove the amendment we adopted yesterday, the Hatch-Biden-Sessions \namendment. They have set up a web site to advocate the passage of S. \n254. That is how much it means to them and, really, millions of parents \nacross this country.\n  I close my remarks with this exhibit. This box that I have contains \nmore than 1,000 letters in support of S. 254 generated by these folks. \nThese are real people who have endorsed this bill. Given their support, \nI urge the Senate to reject the Leahy substitute and support S. 254, \nand let's get this done. I hope we can move this ahead today and get it \ndone today, because the sooner we get this bill passed, the more likely \nwe are going to have greater tools and greater efforts to resolve some \nof these problems that are tearing our society apart. This is an \nextremely important bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that \nwill make a difference, and I think we ought to do this as quickly as \nwe can.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first off, I thank my good friend from Utah \nfor the kind words. I am reminded of Shakespeare and Julius Caesar: I \nam here not to praise Caesar but to bury him. I think my friend from \nUtah has expanded on that. He wants to both bury me and praise me. I \nthank him for one-half of that equation and regret the other half.\n  I will point out a few errors, though, in his statement. One, this is \nan amendment. It is not a substitute. It is not intended as a \nsubstitute. It would not begin to be a substitute because there are \nmany parts of S. 254 with which I agree.\n  The distinguished chairman has talked about the hearings on S. 254. \nIn fact, there have been no hearings on S. 254; not one, not one at \nall. In fact, my amendment, which is basically what was introduced over \na year ago and not something that popped out here yesterday, has had \njust as many hearings as S. 254.\n  There are things in S. 254 I like. I praised Chairman Hatch for \nincluding my reverse waiver in the bill. That is very good. Senator \nDeWine of Ohio and I worked on it, and we adopted a technology grant, \nthe DeWine-Leahy-Hatch Law Crime Identification Technology Act that \nprovides a $250 million block grant for States to upgrade their \ncriminal records. It will be funded this year to help States upgrade \ntheir criminal history records.\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n  My amendment provides money for both intervention and primary \nprevention programs because we need primary prevention programs before \nchildren get into trouble. In some ways we fail, because the only time \nwe step in is after they get into trouble. Let's stop it before they \nget into trouble.\n  The distinguished chairman said that it is a lot of money, that I am \nadding $\\1/2\\ billion for prevention for children. Let's talk about \nthis. That is a lot of money. That is close to $2 a person in this \ncountry. I think the math probably works out to about $1.85 or $1.90 \nper person every year. That is almost enough to buy a small soda at a \nmovie, or that is almost enough to buy a comic book.\n  Let's be realistic. To help keep our children out of trouble, can we \nnot afford $1.85 or $1.90 a year? Ask the parents in Littleton, CO, \nwhether they would spend that kind of money, or ask the parents in any \ntown in Vermont, California, Oregon, Utah, or Alabama if they would.\n  We want to address youth violence and school violence problems in \nthis country. This is a problem that is a lot bigger than just whatever \nhappens in our courts, once the crime has happened, once the juvenile \nhas been apprehended.\n  We need an approach obviously to handle juvenile crime after it \nhappens, but let's spend that extra $1.85 or $1.90 to try to use \nprograms that have been proven to work, that our own hearings have \nshown work to prevent a crime from happening in the first place.\n  How much time do I have left, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 minutes of that to the distinguished Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I rise because I think it is very important to point out to my \nfriend, Senator Hatch from Utah, that what we are trying to do on this \nside of the aisle, under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont, is \nput more of a stress on prevention.\n  Here is the point. The good Senator from Utah, working with Senators \nLeahy, Biden, and Sessions, had an excellent amendment that moved more \ntoward prevention. We, on our side of the aisle, support the \nenforcement part, the tougher penalties part, but we want to see even \nmore of a balance. There is still an imbalance.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, and I know he has had a similar \nexperience or I think that he has, if you talk to law enforcement--and \nI have so many times in my State--they tell me: Senator, once the kids \nget into these teenage years, until they are 19, 20, 21, it is too late \nto turn them away from crime. Do more for prevention.\n  Law enforcement has been the driving force behind my afterschool bill \nbecause they understand if the kids get the attention after school, \nthey will not go home, get in trouble, and choose a life of trouble.\n  What the good Senator from Vermont is doing in this amendment, and I \nhope he will get bipartisan support, is to say, let's stress prevention \nas much as we do enforcement. He has pointed out quite eloquently, yes, \nwe are talking about a couple of dollars out of the pockets of the \naverage American every year, a couple of dollars to prevent crime from \nhappening in the first place. I can assure you, Mr. President, it is \nmuch cheaper. Many have said, and it is a fact, that it costs more to \nimprison one of our youngsters than it does to send him or her to \nHarvard for a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We know what we are doing. I ask for 30 more seconds to \nwrap up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, to address the issue that Senator Hatch \nraised, the vast majority of the programs in Senator Leahy's amendment \nare proven programs. A couple of them that are new are essentially \ntaking adult programs and applying them to the juveniles in our \ncountry. So this is a tried and true amendment.\n  I am very hopeful it will pass. It would put more cops on the street. \nSenator Leahy waives the matching requirement if you place a community \npoliceman in a school. This is very important. I think those of you who \nreally want to help our children should vote yes on the Leahy \namendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to yield some time to my distinguished colleague, \nthe chairman of the subcommittee. We are both thinking of the same \nthing. If I could just take a minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Please.\n  Mr. HATCH. And you can reemphasize it, if you could.\n  Look, one of the things that has always bothered me about Washington, \nand especially the Congress of the United States, is no matter how much \nmoney you put up that is reasonable, there is always going to be \nsomebody who says we have to spend a lot more. Generally, it does come \nfrom the other side of the floor.\n  In this particular case, we have just shown you how we double the \nprevention moneys for the next 5 years, each year, over what they are \ntoday and how they have gone up. They will go up about five times what \nthey were in 1994.\n  Now look, today, before this bill passes, let me show you the \nimbalance in the law right now. We are spending $4.4 billion on \njuvenile prevention programs--117 programs. That is what we are \nspending. That is going to be spent whether this bill passes or not.\n  We are going to add another $547 million to that. It will bring it up \nto about $5 billion that we are spending on juvenile prevention.\n  One of the problems I have with the amendment of Senator Leahy--he \nsays it is not a substitute. That is fine. But one of the problems I \nhave with his amendment is he is only spending 8.9 percent on the \naccountability side of the equation, where we spend 40 percent in our \nbill.\n  Look how much we are currently spending: zero dollars for juvenile \nlaw enforcement or accountability. You wonder why kids are in trouble \ntoday. We made the case. The troubles begins at age 7; they escalate \nuntil age 14\\1/2\\, when it is too late, and they then go to court. That \nis what accountability is going to do. It will help to make them \naccountable up to age 14\\1/2\\, and hopefully the prevention moneys will \nwork then, because you will have both sides of the scale, admittedly \nnot an awful lot for accountability in comparison, but we will have \naccountability money and we will have even more prevention money.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, who has made this case over and over.\n  But what never ceases to amaze me is, whatever money we put in these \nprograms, there is always going to be someone who wants to spend a lot \nmore. The point we make is there is a lot more there now, and we are \ngoing to add a lot more. And we do not need to add $400 million for \neach year for the next 5 years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished chairman of our Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch. He is right on point.\n  I have a similar chart here. There has been $4.4 billion spent on \njuvenile prevention programs, 117 separate juvenile programs. We have \nhad no money for law enforcement, make no mistake. The point I really \nwant to make is, when you spend money strengthening our juvenile \njustice system, giving juvenile judges alternatives and possibilities \nto intervene effectively through the appropriate discipline when young \npeople go wrong, that is prevention--that is prevention.\n  Fox Butterfield in the New York Times had a front page article about \nChicago's juvenile court system. They spend 5 minutes per case. It is \njust a revolving door. We need to strengthen the ability of juvenile \njudges to intervene effectively when kids first start getting into \ntrouble, because if you have a limited amount of money for prevention, \nyou should apply it where it works best, for those people who are \nalready beginning to get into trouble.\n  Let me show you a Department of Justice study done recently by a \nprofessor at the University of Maryland on behalf of Attorney General \nReno.\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\n  The chart says, ``The findings of the Department of Justice \nPrevention Evaluation Report.'' What did they find? Most crime \nprevention funds are being spent where they are needed least. That is a \ncondemnation of us in Congress and the Department of Justice. Most \nprevention money is being spent where it is needed least. That is \nPresident Clinton's own Department of Justice.\n  Most crime prevention programs have never been evaluated. We have 117 \nof them. They have 4-H Clubs in inner cities that are supposed to keep \npeople from committing crime. I do not know if that works or not. I \nused to be in a 4-H Club, but I do not know whether that is a good \nidea. There are 117 of these programs.\n  Among the evaluated programs, some of the least effective receive the \nmost money. We want to just do more, more, more.\n  We have worked for over 2 years on this legislation. We have given it \na lot of attention. Chairman Hatch has given it his personal attention. \nWe have now worked with Senator Biden and have his support. In the \ncommittee, the bill came out with bipartisan support last year. It has \nbipartisan support.\n  Here we have an amendment of 100 or more pages, submitted by the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. I know that as a former prosecutor \nhe cares about these issues, but we get it this morning--I think my \noffice got this morning probably the only two copies in existence. He \nwants to spend, what, $3.8 billion--just $3.8 billion. We have not even \nhad time to read the amendment.\n  There are a couple of things that are important to me. There is no \nmoney dedicated for law enforcement. I tell you, the people think \njuvenile judges do not care about kids. The Juvenile Judges Association \nis supporting this effort because the money is coming in a way that \nrequires a committee, a coordinated committee in a community. Our \nvision is that the community would come together--the judge, the \nprosecutor, the sheriff, the probation officers, civic leaders--and \nprepare a plan to deal with young people who are getting into trouble.\n\n  Everyone needs to be drug tested upon arrest. If you do not care \nabout the kids, you will not drug test them. If you love them and care \nabout them, you will find out if part of their criminality is being \ndriven by drug use; and if so, then you need to have treatment and \ncontinued monitoring of them if they are let go.\n  Parents need to know if the reason their children got involved in \ntheft was because they were strung out on drugs. That is an important \nthing. That is how you intervene effectively. The power of a court \ngives credibility to the process that no other drug treatment center or \nmental health center can give because a judge can order things to \nhappen. You talk to your prevention people, the drug treatment people, \nthe mental health people. They like the order of a judge requiring \nthese things to happen.\n  So I believe that a good criminal justice system is prevention. And \nwhat they comment on is a ``lock them up'' mentality. This is what our \naccountability block grant provides: drug testing of juveniles upon \narrest; and it provides the money for State and local people to do \nthat, and the renovation or expansion of detention facilities.\n  The truth is, we have quadrupled the amount of bed space for adults \ncoming in and have driven down adult crime dramatically because we \nfocused significantly on repeat, dangerous adult offenders. But we have \nspent very little money at the same time that juvenile crime has been \nincreasing dramatically.\n  That is why, as frugal as I am about government money, I think it is \nappropriate for us as a nation to rise up and address the shortcomings \nin juvenile court systems in America and try to give them some \nstrength. You have to have some detention.\n  People across the aisle have a little mantra. They are saying: Well, \nwe want to really lock up these tough kids. But when you have three \ntimes as many people committing murder as a juvenile, three times as \nmany committing assault with intent to murder, and rapes, and that kind \nof thing in the last 15 years, then we have to have more capacity, \ndon't we?\n  What are judges doing with a second-time burglar when the only bed \nspace in the State juvenile center is filled with a youngster charged \nwith murder? Where are they going to put these kids? That is what they \nare telling me.\n  Police officers say: Well, police officers want prevention. Look, I \nwas a prosecutor. I had been a prosecutor for nearly 17 years. Many of \nmy best friends are police officers. You ask them: Don't you wish we \ncould prevent crime?\n  Oh, yes, they answer, I wish I could prevent crime. I am tired of \narresting these kids.\n  They will always say that. But you ask them about what they know, you \nask them how the juvenile justice system is working, and they will tell \nyou it is in a state of collapse. They have told me over and over \nagain: Jeff, these kids are laughing at us. We can't do anything to \nthem, and they know it. We arrest them, and they are released within \nhours of their arrest. Nothing happens to them, time after time.\n\n  This isn't a first-time offense. People act as if you are going to \ntake some youngster----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in support of the amendment has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. People act as if first-time young offenders are getting \nsent off for long periods of time. That is not so. It is just not so. \nAsk people who know about the system.\n  What we need, though, is for that seriously disturbed youngster who \nis heading down the wrong road to get to a juvenile court system where \nthe judge can look them in the eye with toughness, concern, and tough \nlove, and be able to discipline them, to set forth a program that fits \ntheir needs, whether it is mental health, drug treatment, family \ncounseling, or prison.\n  We do not have that in America, because we don't have any money spent \nfor that. We need to do it, and this bill will do so.\n  I thank the chairman for his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. All time is all yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then I move to table and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 327. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last evening, Senator Robb, Senator \nLeahy, Senator Kennedy and other Democratic Senators offered two \namendments to S. 254 that were developed by a working group within the \nDemocratic Caucus. Those amendments, together with an amendment to be \noffered by Senator Boxer to extend after-school programs, provide a \ncomprehensive, measured response to youth violence.\n  Children today face incredible emotional and societal pressures that \nmost people my age never had to worry about. An average of 12 children \ndie each day from gunfire in America. The National School Board \nAssociation estimates that 135,000 guns are brought into U.S. schools \neach day. This reality was painfully reinforced by the terrible, \nsenseless tragedy that occurred in Littleton, Colorado, only a few \nweeks ago.\n  The fear of school-related violence can have a profound effect on \nchildren's ability to learn. This fear has increased over the last \ndecade. Fear for personal safety causes a significant number of \nstudents to stay home from school, or avoid certain areas of their \nschools. A full 71 percent of children ages 7 to 10 say they worry they \nwill be shot or stabbed while at school.\n  The root causes of the Columbine High School shooting, and wider \nthreats to our schools and communities, are complex and deep. Finding \nsolutions will require a national commitment that goes far beyond \nlegislative proposals. It will require students, parents, teachers and \nprincipals, business leaders, faith-based organizations, youth groups, \nlaw enforcement officials and many others working together to reduce \nthe threat of violence.\n  While government--alone--can't solve the problem of youth violence, \ngovernment must be part of the solution.\n  The amendments that make up the Democratic package to S. 254 would \nhelp America's communities reduce violence in our schools and \ncommunities.\n  Our caucus is united in our support of these amendments. We are also \nunited in our determination to continue to seek long-term solutions to \nthe problem of youth violence--solutions that will encompass both \nlegislative and non-legislative strategies.\n\n\n       Providing Resources and Services to Prevent Youth Violence\n\n  More than 9 out of 10 police chiefs agree with the statement, \n``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in \nprograms to help children and youth get a good start'' by ``fully \nfunding Head Start for infants and toddlers, preventing child abuse, \nproviding parenting training for high-risk families, improving schools \nand providing after school programs and mentoring.''\n  Nine out of 10 police chiefs also agree that ``if America does not \npay for greater investments in programs to help children and youth now, \nwe will all pay far more later in crime, welfare, and other costs.''\n  They know, and we know, that prevention works.\n  Efforts to prevent delinquency before it starts can make a real \ndifference in keeping children and communities safe. That's not \nconjecture. It's a fact.\n  A recent study on the effectiveness of after-school programs looked \nat 2 housing projects. One of the projects instituted an after-school \nprogram, the other did not. In the project with the after-school \nprogram, juvenile arrest rates declined 75 percent. In the other \nproject, juvenile arrest rates rose 67 percent.\n\n  In housing projects with Boys and Girls Clubs, juvenile arrest rates \nare 13 percent lower, and drug activity is 22 percent lower, than in \nprojects without clubs.\n  In Boston and Los Angeles, comprehensive efforts to prevent juvenile \ncrime have significantly reduced the number of murders of young people.\n  Violence prevention saves lives. And it saves money.\n  A RAND study found that crime prevention efforts were three times \nmore cost-effective than increased punishment.\n  A Vanderbilt University study estimates that each high-risk youth \nprevented from adopting a life of crime could save the country from \n$1.7 million to $2.3 million.\n  That is why our leadership amendments sought to balance smart \nprevention and tough enforcement.\n  Senator Robb's amendment would have created a National Center for \nSchool Safety and Youth Violence--a national clearinghouse of \nstrategies that work.\n  A Center could provide expert advice to schools and communities.\n  It could establish a toll-free number for students to seek help and \nanonymously report criminal activity and other high-risk behaviors.\n  It could provide assistance to parents and communities to address \nemergencies.\n  The Center could also conduct research on and evaluate effective \nschool safety strategies.\n  It could serve as a clearinghouse of model programs, and establish a \nweb site on school safety.\n  It could also work with local communities to strengthen school \nsafety.\n  It could do all of those things if the Senate had chosen to adopt the \namendment.\n  The Robb amendment also built on the existing Safe Schools/Healthy \nStudents program. This is a program that brings together schools, law \nenforcement and the mental health community to reduce both juvenile \nviolence and drug and alcohol abuse.\n  We think this program should be available to 150 additional \ncommunities, not just 50. Charges that the Robb amendment would create \na whole new bureaucracy and duplicate existing programs are just not \ntrue.\n  Mr. President, I find it ironic that Republicans in the Senate voted \nagainst the Robb amendment, yet voted in support of the Gregg \namendment, which claims to do many of the things the Robb amendment \nwould do with fewer resources. Making our schools safe should be one of \nour highest priorities.\n  Preventing youth violence also requires a special focus on after-\nschool hours.\n  Many students today spend more of their waking hours alone than they \nspend in school.\n  We know that children left home alone are more likely to become \ninvolved in risky behaviors.\n  Most juvenile crime occurs between 3 p.m and 8 p.m.\n  We also know that children who attend quality after-school programs \nare less likely to engage in delinquent activity than children who do \nnot. They have better relationships with their peers. They're better \nadjusted emotionally, get better grades, and they're better behaved in \nschool.\n  So, our package includes an amendment, to make quality, school-based \nafter-school programs available to more students, in more communities.\n  Our amendment triples funding authorization for the existing 21st \nCentury Learning Center grant program, from $200 million to $600 \nmillion. This proposal is in S. 7, our education agenda bill, and was \nin the President's budget.\n  By investing in prevention, we can prevent a lot of good kids from \ngoing bad.\n  But we know there are young people who need tougher measures.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont would have provided \nthose measures as well. It was tough on juvenile crime--especially \nviolent juvenile crime.\n  It gave the Attorney General greater discretion to prosecute violent \noffenders as adults in the federal courts, and streamlines the process \nfor doing so--without trampling on the rights of juvenile suspects.\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n  It established a program of flexible, graduated sanctions.\n  Our amendment also provided grants to States to incarcerate violent \nand repeat offenders. We need to get violent kids off our streets, and \nout of our communities.\n  When police chiefs were asked to rank the long-term effectiveness of \na number of possible crime-fighting approaches, they chose ``increasing \ninvestments in programs that help children and youth to get a good \nstart'' nearly 4 times as often as ``trying more juveniles as adults.''\n  Four times more often!\n  Our law enforcement amendment reflects the police chiefs' judgment. \nIt invests in programs we know work, from ``Say No to Drugs'' \ncommunity-based centers, to incentive grants for local delinquency \nprevention programs and drug prevention education programs.\n  We also proposed to better protect children from drugs by expanding \ndrug treatment opportunities, and increasing penalties for people who \nsell drugs to children.\n  In addition, our amendment built on one of the most successful \ninitiatives of the 1994 Crime Act, the COPS program.\n  We proposed to put 6,000 more police officers in our schools and our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I think we were all disturbed by the bomb scares that \nwere called into schools all across our nation in the wake of the \nLittleton tragedy. South Dakota has had to deal with 30 bomb scares or \nthreats of violence since that incident.\n  One of those bomb scares was called into Tri-Valley, a school in a \nrural community outside Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n  Fortunately, Tri-Valley has a police officer, called a ``school \nresource'' officer. His name is Deputy Preston Evans. His position is \nfunded by a COPS grant. He actually covers two schools.\n\n  On the day of the bomb threat, as students were being evacuated from \nthe school, a number of students came up to Deputy Evans and told him \nthey knew who had made the threat. By the end of the day, two students \nhad been arrested.\n  Those students were able to confide in Deputy Evans because they \ntrusted him. And they were able to trust him because they knew him. \nThey had a relationship with him.\n  By expanding the COPS program, and giving kids the opportunity to \nhave police as mentors and role models when they are young, we can \nreduce the chances that they'll need judges and wardens when they're \nolder. That makes sense for our children, for our communities, and for \nour future.\n  Mr. President, I never had to worry about assault weapons or pipe \nbombs when I was in school. No child, and no parent today should have \nto worry about those things, either.\n  We simply cannot provide hope for our children if we cannot guarantee \ntheir safety in the very institutions where they go to learn the skills \nthey need to succeed in life.\n  I know that gun control proposals alone will not keep our children \nsafe when they leave our homes in the morning. But we can--and we \nmust--do more to keep dangerous weapons out of the hands of children, \nand away from our schools.\n  Our law enforcement amendment banned the possession of assault \nweapons and high capacity ammunition clips by anyone under the age of \n18.\n  It also increased criminal penalties for those in the deadly black \nmarket of selling handguns, assault weapons and high-capacity \nammunition clips to juveniles.\n  Finally, when juveniles commit violent crimes and put the lives of \nothers at risk, our amendment took away their right to possess a gun--\never--regardless of whether they are prosecuted as adults or juveniles.\n  In all this talk about juvenile crime, it's important for us to \nremember that the vast majority of our young people are good kids. They \nwork hard in school. They're involved in their communities.\n  Our goal should be to empower these young people, and their \ncommunities, to take action against crime, rather than be victimized by \nit.\n  I've seen what can happen when we harness the power of our young \npeople in my own state.\n  Not long ago, a student in our capitol city, Pierre, took his own \nlife.\n  Many of his classmates were deeply affected. In addition to mourning, \nthey also resolved to try to prevent other young people from making the \nsame tragic mistake.\n  High school students Craig Schochenmaier, Nick Johnson, and Blair \nKrueger have been working to raise money to give away gunlocks \nimprinted with the number for a suicide prevention hotline to parents \nwho own guns.\n  Instead of simply becoming numb to violence, Craig and his friends \nhave found a way to fight it, and help others.\n\n  I believe there are young people in communities all across our \ncountry who feel as Craig, Nick, and Blair do. They want to make their \nschools and communities safer. They're willing to work to end the \nviolence. Our amendments would have given them, and their communities, \nthe tools and support they needed to do that.\n  I think we have missed two key opportunities on this bill. The \nprovisions we have proposed and would make a real, positive difference \nin the lives of the people of this country. They represent the next \nright step in our ongoing effort to secure the safety of our schools \nand communities. My colleagues and I may offer some of these as \nindividual amendments before the debate on this bill is over.\n  I certainly encourage my colleagues, especially on the other side of \nthe aisle but on both sides of the aisle, to reconsider these issues, \nto reconsider how we address these problems, and to vote in support of \nthese amendments when they are offered again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like briefly to respond to the \ndistinguished minority leader's comments. I agree with the Senator from \nSouth Dakota that we need long term solutions to the problem of youth \nviolence. S. 254, a comprehensive package designed to combat youth \nviolence through multiple approaches--like prevention and \naccountability programs--is a long term, but flexible, approach to \nassist the States in curbing youth violence.\n  My colleagues across the aisle want more funding dedicated to \nprevention programs, despite the funding increases approved yesterday \nin the Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment. In addition, the Federal \ngovernment, according to a 1999 GAO study, spends over $4 billion \nannually on 117 prevention programs. The Robb amendment was wisely \ntabled, since it added an additional $1 billion to Federal programs \nthat already exist. S. 254 and the pending Republican amendments \nalready address programs to steer youth away from a life of crime. For \ninstance, S. 254 has a unique mentoring program that utilizes college \nage adults and retired couples that are matched to troubled juveniles \nand their families. By giving the juveniles proper guidance, \ncommunities can prevent youngsters from choosing to commit crime.\n  Furthermore, although there were some similar provisions between the \nLeahy substitute amendment and the underlying bill, the devil is always \nin the details. Upon close inspection, this amendment was not an \nadequate substitute for the most thoroughly considered juvenile crime \nlegislation in my 23 years in the Senate.\n  First, the Leahy amendment duplicated programs that are already in S. \n254. My bill gives the Attorney General greater discretion to prosecute \nviolent juvenile offenders that commit Federal crimes in adult court, \nand streamlines the process to do so. S. 254 already has a flexible \naccountability block grant that provides funding for a system of \ngraduated sanctions to hold violent and repeat offenders responsible \nfor the crimes inflicted on their victims. Since S. 254 provides a \ncomprehensive package to fight juvenile violent crime, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police supports the bill.\n  Second, the Leahy amendment was not narrowly focussed on the problem \nwe should be debating--juvenile crime. Indeed, of the advertised $3.581 \nbillion over three years price tag, by my count only $1.632 billion, or \n45.6 percent, is dedicated to addressing juvenile crime. In the law \nenforcement category, the imbalance is even more startling. Of the \n$1.684 billion the amendment claimed to spend on juvenie crime law \nenforcement, only $150 million, or 8.9 percent, is targeted at reducing \njuvenile crime.\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\n  This $150 million is for juvenile and violent offender incarceration. \nI certainly agree with Senator Leahy that we need to provide assistance \nto States and local governments for secure juvenile detention. But, we \nneed to fully support and encourage a full range of graduated sanctions \nfrom the earliest acts of delinquent behavior, to help ensure that \nearly acts of delinquency do not grow into more serious problems. \nAccording to the OJJDP, the earliest acts of delinquent behavior start \nat age seven, and continue to get worse if there is no effective \nintervention. S. 254, unlike my colleague's amendment, recognizes this, \nand addresses it.\n  So what did the Leahy amendment propose spending funds on? In the \nenforcement area, it reauthorizes Rural Drug Enforcement and Training, \ngrants for state courts and prosecutors, and the Byrne program. Now, \nall of these are generally worthy programs. Indeed, I have been a vocal \ncritic of recent efforts by the Clinton Administration to cut funding \nfor some of these same programs. And my crime bill, the 21st Century \nJustice Act (S. 899) is a comprehensive answer to our general crime \nproblem. But the bill we are debating today is a juvenile crime bill, \nand that should be our focus.\n  And what of the $200 million the Leahy amendment purports to spend on \nmore police officers in schools? This is, in reality, just a two year \nreauthorization of the existing COPS program. Some COPS funding can, of \ncourse, be used for school security. In fact, I supported the bill by \nSenator Campbell we enacted last Congress to amend the COPS program to \nallow its grants to pay for school security officers. But to call this \ngeneral reauthorization a program dedicated to cops in schools is a bit \ninaccurate.\n  What is left of the Leahy amendment then? Prevention. Which, of \ncourse, we all agree is important. The Hatch-Biden-Sessions amendment \nthe Senate adopted yesterday increases our bill's commitment to \nprevention to $547.5 million per year. And, I might add, our prevention \nis more balanced than that in the Leahy amendment. $850 million of the \nLeahy amendment's ``juvenile crime prevention'' is focussed exclusively \non drug prevention. And $400 million of that funding isn't even \ndedicated to the juvenile drug program, which I agree is in dire need \nof attention.\n  In short, the prior Democratic amendments are no substitute for the \neffective, comprehensive approach to juvenile crime proposed in the \nunderlying Hatch-Biden-Sessions bill. This bill, and the amendments we \nwill offer, address our juvenile crime problem in four key areas. These \ninclude:\n  (1) prevention and enforcement assistance to state and local \ngovernment;\n  (2) parental empowerment and stemming the influence of cultural \nviolence;\n  (3) getting tough on violent juveniles and enforce existing law; and\n  (4) safe and secure schools.\n  So far, the amendments to this serious juvenile crime package have \nbeen simple calls for increased spending and rhetorical trinkets. So \nwhile I respect the minority leader's views on this issue, I must \ndisagree with his conclusions.\n  Mr. President, before we begin the Brownback amendment debate, I ask \nunanimous consent the distinguished Budget Committee chairman be \ngranted 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer my thoughts on the \njuvenile justice legislation before us here today. I want to commend \nthe majority leader for bringing this important bill to the floor this \nweek.\n  I think it is time for the Senate to have a full debate about our \nNation's juvenile crime policies, and the role the Federal Government \nshould play in addressing youth violence.\n  The Federal Government should provide greater funding to the States \nto combat juvenile crime, but without tying the hands of the States and \ntheir ability to implement new and innovative approaches to the \nproblem. The bill before us is a step in that direction.\n  In the wake of the tragedy in Littleton, CO, this will be a \nparticularly timely debate. But I want my colleagues to know that, in \nthe view of this Senator, this is a debate which is long overdue.\n  As far back as 1995, I held field hearings in my home State of New \nMexico to talk to people about their experiences with escalating youth \nviolence.\n  I brought in judges, law enforcement officers, youth counselors, and \nprevention experts, as well as victims of juvenile crime, to see what \nthe Federal response to the problem ought to be. I then introduced \nlegislation based on what I heard from the experts in New Mexico.\n  And I must say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and his colleague, Senator Sessions, you all must have heard the \nsame things from your experts as we heard in new Mexico. Because many \nof the same concepts and ideas which I heard during those discussions \nin New Mexico have found their way into your bill before us today.\n  Ideas like graduated sanctions, so that kids are punished the first \ntime they commit a bad act, and given more severe punishment for \nsubsequent, more severe offenses.\n  In New Mexico, I heard countless stories of juveniles who committed \n10 or 15 minor crimes before they ever were given even the slightest \npunishment. It is not wonder that so many kids disrespect our justice \nsystem. This bill will encourage States to adopt graduated sanctions \npolicies, and provide resources to do so.\n  Another theme echoed throughout the field hearings and meetings I \nheld in New Mexico was the need to better address the rights of the \nvictims of juvenile crime.\n  Often, the victims and their families are forgotten in the juvenile \njustice system. States frequently require closed court hearings, rarely \nnotify victims when offenders are sentenced or released, and often fail \nto allow for restitution.\n  One issue that is critically important to a rural State like New \nMexico is the need to address the Federal mandates imposed upon the \nStates as a condition of receiving Federal funds.\n  I have been working with Congresswoman Heather Wilson of New Mexico's \nFirst District on this issue since the time when she served as the \nSecretary of Children, Youth and Families in our State. One problem she \nalways faced was how to deal with the Federal ``sight and sound \nseparation'' mandate, which led to arbitrary, burdensome, and often \ntimes ridiculous restrictions placed on my State's use of juvenile \nfacilities.\n  Let me make it clear to the critics of this bill's handling of the \nmandates: no one, including this Senator, wants to house juveniles in \nthe same cell as adults or to allow adults the ability to physically or \nemotionally abuse juveniles held in secure facilities.\n  All this bill seeks to do is impose some common sense, to allow \nStates the flexibility to use their facilities and staffs in a \nrational, but responsible way. I think Senators Hatch and Sessions have \ndone a good job addressing the problem.\n  I have before me a list of the 15 Federal and 7 State gun laws \nalready on the books which were violated by those disturbed youths in \nColorado. I want my colleagues to know that I think that we should do a \nbetter job of enforcing those laws already in place, particularly at \nthe Federal level, before we consider enacting a laundry list of new \ngun laws. There may be some suggestions offered this week which are \nreasonable, and which might be acceptable to a majority of Senators. I \nwait to see what will be offered.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for recognizing me. Again, I commend the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and the chairman of \nthe Youth Violence Subcommittee, Senator Sessions, for their hard work \non this bill. I do not agree with every single provision, and I may \noffer some amendments later in the process, but I think they have done \na fine job getting this legislation to the floor. And I look forward to \nworking with them as we continue to shape the bill.\n  Mr. President, while this bill will be contentious and we will have \nscores of amendments, it is the right debate at the right time in the \nright place. I think after we have fully debated this we are going to \ncome up with a bill that will help our sovereign States and the \ngovernments within those sovereign States to do a better job with \njuvenile crime policies. We do not have\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\na major role, but we have certainly not had a sufficient role. This \nbill will expand that and modify and make more responsive some of the \nmandates we have in our laws today with reference to juveniles.\n  First of all, there is a great discussion taking place about firearms \nand guns. While I do not address that in my few remarks, in due course \nwe will have a significant debate on this. Clearly, we will all listen \nattentively and pay attention. We will try to do the very best we can. \nI will certainly try to do that.\n  But essentially there is a much bigger issue. The issue is the \ncriminal justice system. In our land we have an adult criminal system. \nWe all hear about that regularly. It is jury trials for serious crimes. \nIt is whether or not to have death penalties. It is do we have enough \ndistrict attorneys to prosecute. It is what is happening to the \nfamilies of these adults against whom these crimes have been committed. \nAnd it is a myriad of things that apply to adults.\n  For the most part, the juvenile justice system in America has been \nalmost mysterious, because we have been bent on protecting the young \npeople and protecting their rights and protecting their reputations--\nand properly so. But I submit much of that apprehension about \ndisclosing what crimes teenagers and juveniles have committed, keeping \ntheir records separate such that they can have the equivalent of two or \nthree felonies and nobody ever knows about it when they enter the next \nphase of life--many of these things were done in a completely different \nera. Clearly, we have a small portion of America's young people \ncommitting crimes. The overwhelming number, as the minority leader \nsaid, are diligently doing their jobs, trying to grow up, learning and \nconducting themselves in a very, very good manner.\n  There is a growing number of teenagers that has become just as \ndangerous as adult criminals. They commit the very same crimes from \nrape to murder to mayhem to burglary to robbery. Drive-by shootings are \nnot just done by adults. Many of them are done by teenagers and young \npeople. The time has come, it seems to me, to give a little more \nrecognition to that and to help our States and their juvenile apparatus \nfor helping them do a better job.\n  I held hearings in my State the year before last, and I introduced a \nbill, along with my colleague from the House, Representative Heather \nWilson. Many of the ideas in it which we got from our educators, from \nour judges, from our policemen, are in this bill. I compliment those \nwho put it together. It moves in the right direction, without any \ndoubt.\n  Frankly, there are young people who commit significant crimes over \nand over who deserve to be treated as adults. We do, to some extent, \nurge the States to move in that direction--and many are--to treat as \nadults those young people who commit certain kinds of crimes which are \njust abhorrent to society.\n  We are moving in the direction of making sure that the records of \nsevere juvenile criminals are made available so that the courts can be \napprised in later years as these juvenile criminals commit other \nserious crimes. It is not as if the first 5 years of criminality as a \nyoungster do not count. We are moving in that direction, and I think we \nare moving there correctly.\n  Likewise, it is obvious that we ought to be doing some things to help \nin the prevention area. I am very pleased that we are urging our \nschools that have great physical capacity--their gyms, their recreation \ncenters, their classrooms--to make them available for afterschool, \nweekend and even summer activities so that our young people have more \nto do with their enormous amount of spare time, other than to spend, on \naverage, 7 hours--it is not just teenagers, but televisions in our \nhomes are on 7 hours a day, a rather incredible number. Probably with \nso many of our young people with nothing to do in the afternoons, it \nwould not be a surprise if for a substantial number of those 7 hours, \nteenagers and our youngsters are watching, with no adults around, \nwhatever they please.\n  Clearly, this bill is moving in the right direction, with reference \nto another area which is totally frustrating for fellow New Mexicans \nand for Americans, and that is victims of juvenile crime. We are now \nfinding how abusive a court system can be to victims if, in fact, the \ncourts do not take the victims into consideration.\n  I will be offering an amendment with reference to victims which, I \nbelieve the Senate will be pleased to hear, will take some things out \nof the proposed constitutional amendment that was offered with \nreference to victims and makes it statutory. A few of those ideas were \nin Dan Coats' proposal. I believe we can put in rights that victims \nwill have under the juvenile codes of our land.\n  Let me close by suggesting one other thing. Again, if we get away \nfrom the shootings and look at the ordinary daily operation of the \ncriminal justice system for young people, we find a problem with \nreference to what we do with young people who commit small offenses. Do \nwe do nothing? It is pretty obvious that small offenses repeated yield \nto more serious offenses, and if there is no corrective action, then it \nwill yield to more egregious offenses. Go to one of our facilities in \nNew Mexico and interrogate a 17-year-old boy and ask him why he is \nthere. He will say: I am finally here, but I was arrested 17 times and \nI was found guilty of 14 crimes, and nothing happened to me. I ended up \nhere.\n\n  This bill talks about progressive punishment--little crimes, little \npunishment; bigger crimes, bigger punishment--but suggests that we will \nhelp with funding in the States if they have a system that, indeed, \nimposes some kind of corrective measure, even for the lesser offenses.\n  This is not intended to create a situation where we are just being \nmean to somebody. As a matter of fact, it looks like young people learn \nwhen they are corrected, when they are told they cannot do something \nand when violating the law means they have to suffer in some way, be it \nmighty small when they are small offenses, or significant as they move \nup the ladder of criminality in terms of the number of times they \nviolate our laws.\n  I hope by the time we finish this bill, we will have taken a giant \nstep forward in helping our States which, after all, do most of the law \nenforcement of this criminal behavior by our young people and most of \nthe offenses that are taking place in our school systems, such as the \nevents that occurred in my neighboring State of Colorado. Most of the \nauthority to do something about that is not in our hands; it is in the \nhands of our States.\n  We ought to be helpful to the States in this legislation by not tying \ntheir hands but giving them flexibility, and where we really think \nthere ought to be improvements in the system, giving some benefit to a \nState that changes the system in a positive manner. This bill has that \nkind of incentive built into it which is the part I put in the bill \nwhich I introduced not too long ago, because I thought it was very \nimportant to encourage States to make changes.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 329\n\n(Purpose: Relating to telecast material, video games, Internet content, \n                           and music lyrics)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, by a previous unanimous consent \nagreement, I call up amendment No. 329.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback], for himself, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 329.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr President, I call up this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Hatch and Senator Lieberman. I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Abraham be listed as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is a discussion we have been \nhaving within the country and we now need to have in the Senate. We \nhave four provisions in the amendment. They are, basically, things that \nwe can address in the Senate about the culture of violence that has \nenveloped the country and has taken us to the point where so many \npeople have so many fears of what has taken place, and we see some of \nthis acted out.\n  This is not a panacea amendment. It will not solve all our problems, \nbut I think it is a positive step in the right direction. It has \nbipartisan support, and I am hopeful we can get broad support \nthroughout the Senate so that these amendments will become law. Let me \ngo through each of them.\n  The amendment will provide, first, a limited antitrust exemption to \nthe entertainment industry enabling the industry to develop and \ndisseminate voluntary guidelines for television programming, movies, \nvideo games, Internet content and music.\n  What we are seeking is an antitrust exemption so that the industry \ncan enter into its own voluntary code of conduct, the likes of which \nthe television industry used to have and then left after there was some \nfeeling that this was potentially an antitrust violation.\n  We want to give them an antitrust exemption so they can set a code of \nconduct, a floor below which they will not go in the race to the bottom \nfor ever more violent, ever more explicit, ever more troubling content. \nWe want to provide that for television, movies, video game producers, \nInternet content, and music.\n  These voluntary guidelines will be used to alleviate some of the \nnegative impact of violent sexual content and other subjects \ninappropriate for children that are so pervasive throughout the \ntelevision shows, movies, video games, Internet content, and music \nproduced today by the industry.\n  This amendment does not--does not--require the entertainment industry \nto develop or disseminate such guidelines, nor does it provide the \nFederal Government with any additional authority to regulate TV \nprogramming, movies, video games, Internet content, or music. Members \ncan support this and know what this amendment does not do.\n  The amendment does enable the entertainment industry to establish \nvoluntary guidelines. I believe this is an appropriate way for us to \nencourage the industry to reconsider their entertainment products with \nan eye toward their corporate responsibility.\n\n  My amendment would simply make clear that the entertainment industry \nwould not be subject to antitrust scrutiny if its members create such \nguidelines. This amendment does not infringe upon the first amendment \nrights of the entertainment industry. It would provide us with the \nopportunity to give the industry the tools that are necessary to \narticulate what their standards are and to inform parents what they can \nexpect from the industry.\n  Why do we need a code of conduct? I think there are several very \nimportant reasons why.\n  First, our popular culture exerts an enormous influence on our young \nchildren and on our entire society. What we see, hear, and experience \nhelps shape how we think, how we feel, and how we act. This is \nparticularly true for children. All too often, what kids see in movies \nor on television, what they hear in music, and what they experience in \nthe games they play actually desensitizes them and debases rather than \nuplifts.\n  Given that entertainment companies wield such enormous power in this \ncountry, it is only right that parents and consumers should know what \ntheir standards are and how they will use their media. This code of \nconduct will call on entertainment executives to define those \nstandards, what levels they would not sink below, and what ideals they \nintend to uphold. I think the public has a right to know that as well.\n  Second, establishing a code of conduct not only informs parents, it \nhelps hold the entertainment industries accountable. Parents will have \na written code by which to judge television, movies, music, and games \nand be empowered to demand that companies live up to their code.\n  Third, a code of conduct says that entertainment companies do bear \nsome corporate responsibility for the impact of the entertainment that \nthey peddle. For too long, entertainment executives have insisted--in \nthe face of mountains of evidence to the contrary--that the violence \nand sexual activity they depict had no impact, and that therefore they \nhad no responsibility. A code of conduct recognizes that these \ncompanies wield enormous power and must therefore bear a corporate \nresponsibility to the public at large.\n  There are some who defend the extreme violence and sexual activity in \nsome movies, television shows, or music lyrics by claiming they are \nmerely reflections of the reality of life, that they hold a mirror to \nsociety. But it is not a mirror; it is a mirage. The world of \ntelevision and movies is--thank goodness --far more violent, conflicted \nand sexually explicit than the life of the average American. There are \nfar more Amish people in the United States than there are serial \nmurderers. There are more pastors than prostitutes. But you would never \nknow that from watching television.\n  Enabling the entertainment industry to develop and enter into a code \nof conduct is not a panacea. It will not, by itself, put an end to all \nobjectionable content, but it will be an important first step in \nencouraging the industry to reconsider the influence--for good or ill--\nof its products, its internal standards, and its corporate \nresponsibility.\n  It will provide parents and consumers with information, and enable \nthem to hold entertainment companies responsible for their product, and \nit will further an important national dialogue about what our duties to \nour children are and the role we play in determining whether we live in \na culture that glorifies death, carnage and violence, or in a civil \nsociety.\n\n  We also have other provisions that are in this amendment beyond just \nthe code of conduct, the voluntary code of conduct. This amendment \nwould also require the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of \nJustice to conduct a joint study of the marketing practices of the \nmotion picture industry, recording industry, and video game industry.\n  The amendment requires the FTC and the DOJ examine the extent to \nwhich the entertainment industry targets--targets--the marketing of \nviolent, sexually explicit or other material unsuitable to minors, \nincluding whether such content is advertised in media outlets in which \nminors comprise a substantial percentage of the audience. We want to \nknow, are these entertainment companies actually marketing violence to \nminors? Are they lacing more violence in their products to get more \nsales to minors?\n  The effectiveness of voluntary industry ratings in limiting access of \nminors to content that is unsuitable is something else that we want \nstudied as well. Further, we want to study the extent to which those \nwho engage in the sale or rental of entertainment products abide by \nvoluntary industry ratings or labeling systems. We want to know whether \nmechanisms or procedures are necessary to ensure the effective \nenforcement of voluntary ratings or labeling systems.\n  We need to know the extent to which the entertainment industry \nencourages the enforcement of their voluntary ratings and labeling \nsystems. And we need to know whether any of the entertainment \nindustry's marketing practices violate Federal law.\n  Recently, I held a hearing at which Senator Lieberman and Senator \nHatch testified regarding the marketing of violence to our children, \nand whether violence is used to market products. There is a strong \nsuspicion that, indeed, it occurs.\n  I would like to draw the attention to the Senate to some of the \nadvertisements of products to children. These are particularly of video \ngames.\n  This one that I am showing you now is an advertisement in a magazine \nfor a video game rated for teens. This is rated for teenagers. This is \nthe advertisement: ``Deploy. Destroy. Then relax over a cold one.'' It \nsure is laced with violence and uses violence to market a product to \nteens.\n  Here is one, a popular video game, a video game called Carmageddon. I \nhave shown this to the Senate before. Rigormotorist. It is about \nkilling people in a car-driving video game.\n  There is another video game that we have shown to the Senate before. \nIt is\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nrated for teens. You can see the symbol there: ``Destroying your \nenemies is not enough. You must devour their souls.'' Clear use of \nviolence and other imagery with that as well.\n  There is in the amendment an NIH study. There have been literally \nhundreds of studies, some would estimate even more, conducted on the \nimpact of television on our attitudes, thoughts, psychological well-\nbeing, behavior, development, level of aggression, and predisposition \ntoward violence. The more we study it, the clearer the link we have of \nthe consumption of violent entertainment and increased aggression, \nfear, anger, emotional difficulties, even predisposition towards \nviolence.\n\n  However, there have been very few studies done on the impact of music \nand video games on young people. We need to know more. The other point \nof this amendment is to study that connection. By some estimates, the \naverage teen listens to music around 4 hours a day. Between 7th and \n12th grades, teens will spend around 10,500 hours listening to music. \nListen to that again. Between the 7th and 12th grades, they are going \nto listen, the average teen, to around 10,000 hours of music. That is \nmore time than they will spend in school.\n  Similarly, the popularity of video games is rapidly increasing among \nyoung people. One study, conducted by Strategy Records Research, found \nthat 64 percent of young people played these games on a regular basis. \nClearly, young people spend a huge amount of time focused on these \nkinds of entertainment.\n  It stands to reason that music and games have some sort of impact on \nyoung people, just as it stands to reason that what we see, hear and \nexperience has some impact on our thoughts and attitudes and, thus, our \ndecisions and our behavior. Determining what this impact is, is clearly \nin the public interest.\n  This amendment, sponsored by myself, Senator Hatch, Senator \nLieberman, and Senator Abraham, provides for a study to determine that \nimpact. We need to know more, and we need to start now.\n  The first step towards addressing problems is to accurately define \nthem. And for that, we need all the available information. This \namendment is an important start in that direction.\n  I point out something that I hope is becoming more familiar to \nMembers of the Senate and to the country, the violence that is in some \nof the music. We talked about video games. We have studied music and \ntelevision. In music, here is a person who is pretty famous now, \nMarilyn Manson, with an album ``Anti-Christ Superstar.'' You can look \nat all the words pointing towards ``Tomorrow's turned up dead.'' ``You \ncan kill yourself now.'' Glorification of suicide and violence.\n  Here is another record out of it. ``Anti-cop, Anti-fun.'' I am not \ngoing to read any of that. Here is another top record from Master P, \n``Come and Get Some.'' ``I got friends running out the blanking crack \nhouse.''\n\n  You can go down through this and see the violent, in many cases, very \nhateful and misogynistic, some racist terminology. We need to know what \nis the impact on a young mind that is consuming, in many cases, on the \naverage of 4 hours of this a day. That is the intent of this study to \nask that those things be looked at.\n  We think the evidence is clearly growing. We need to do something \nabout what has happened to our culture. We are asking in this set of \namendments, one, for an antitrust exemption for a voluntary code of \nconduct, for enforcement of industry rating systems, for a study on the \nmarketing of violence to children, and for an NIH study of violent \nentertainment, particularly video games and music, and its impact on \nchildren.\n  We have had terrible, unthinkable tragedies that have happened to our \nchildren in this country. We know there is a link between the violence \nand the action. Both the American Medical Association and the American \nAssociation of Pediatrics have warned against exposing children to \nviolent entertainment.\n  One 1996 American Medical Association study conducted concluded this: \n``The link between media violence and real life violence has been \nproven by science time and time again.''\n  Another AMA study concluded that ``exposure to violence in \nentertainment increases aggressive behavior and contributes to \nAmericans' sense that they live in a mean society.''\n  Those are pretty clear points of view.\n  Mr. President, we need to do something. These are modest steps. They \nwill not, in and of themselves, change the society or change the \nculture, but they are appropriate steps. They can continue our national \ndebate. I think they can help focus us on moving away from this culture \nof violence, this culture of death, towards more of a culture of peace \nand a culture of life that clearly we need to provide to our children.\n  I note that there are a number of people who wish to speak on this \namendment. I recognize first the chairman of the committee, who wanted \nto address this subject, Senator Hatch, and then Senator Lieberman has \nbeen on the floor to speak as well. I yield to Senator Hatch on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we keep the \nstatus quo with regard to no amendments to this amendment until 12:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I do not intend to \nobject, but I want to make sure that others are going to be able to \naddress the Senate during this period of time. I know the Senator from \nUtah, the Senator from Connecticut--I see the Senator from California \nhas some inquiries. I would like to be able to speak as well. I would \nlike to see that we have an opportunity for each of these Members \nbefore we get to 12:30. That is my only concern.\n  Mr. HATCH. I hope everybody can be recognized, but I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 12:30 I be permitted----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I can't hear the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to keep the status quo until 12:30 \nand then at 12:30 I retain the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object to that. We have an agreement \nnow. The Senator is recognized for 30 minutes. Now we are in the \nposition that we can offer second-degree amendments. The Senator is \nasking that we do not do that for 30 minutes. If you want to get this \nSenator to agree to it, we are going to have to give other Members the \nchance to speak on the floor. Otherwise, I am going to object to it. \nWhy don't we just try to work this out with comity?\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would be happy to not speak at this particular time and \nhave somebody from the Democrat side speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Why doesn't the Senator speak for 10 minutes, and the \nSenator from Connecticut for 10 minutes, and the remaining 15 minutes \nto Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. HATCH. We also have to reserve 10 minutes for Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Between now and 12:30?\n  Mr. HATCH. We will go beyond 12:30. I think he can come after that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest that the Senator be recognized now for 10 \nminutes; following that, the Senator from Connecticut, 10 minutes; \nfollowing that, 15 minutes divided between Senator Boxer and myself; \nand following that, at 12:30, Senator DeWine be recognized for 10 \nminutes; and that there be no intervening motions or actions or \namendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. Or amendments, and that I get the floor as soon as Senator \nDeWine has concluded with his speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, just with a question to my \nfriend from Utah. It is my understanding that this amendment would be \nopened up to second-degrees.\n  Mr. HATCH. We keep the status quo of not opening it to second-\ndegrees.\n  Mrs. BOXER. At 12:35 the amendment would be opened for second-\ndegrees?\n  Mr. HATCH. But the floor would be yielded to me.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So you may well offer a second-degree?\n  Mr. HATCH. I may well offer a second-degree at that time. We would \nprefer not to have any amendments to this, but that is what I may very \nwell do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry: Just so we know, I am to speak for \nhow many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is as follows: Currently 10 minutes \nfor the chairman, 10 minutes for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. Fifteen minutes divided equally between the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Massachusetts?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes between the Senators from \nCalifornia and Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HATCH. And then 10 minutes for----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And then 10 minutes for the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. HATCH. Then the floor would be yielded back to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I first want to commend Senator Brownback \nfor his initiative to curb the exposure of our youth to violence. I \nrecognize that as early as last year Senator Brownback and I, and I \nhave to add my dear friend from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, and \nothers, had developed legislation designed to encourage television \nbroadcasters to join forces and develop a code of conduct for \nresponsible programming. That legislation is part of the amendment \nbeing offered today, and it addresses the broader concern that our \nchildren are exposed to too much violence, too much obscenity, and too \nmuch filth--whether through television, in movies, in modern music, or \nin video games.\n  Let me say for the record that I hope that as the new V-chip is \nimplemented in televisions, our concern for the pervasive exposure of \nchildren to violence on the tube will be alleviated.\n  Again, I commend my colleague for his leadership in efforts to \nencourage the broadcast media to exercise responsibility. I commend my \ncolleague from Connecticut as well. They have been two great leaders on \nthese subjects. There are others who deserve credit as well.\n  Mr. President, I do not take the floor to attack the entertainment \nindustry. It is well known that I work very closely with people in the \nentertainment industry, trying to make sure that their intellectual \nproperty needs are taken care of, and others as well. Indeed, it is \njust one part of a more complex problem. I do hope we can encourage the \nindustry to work with us to do what is best for our children in \nAmerica.\n  As my colleagues know, I have long supported the creative industry, \nas evidenced by continued efforts to ensure strong intellectual \nproperty rights that protect the creative products of these industries.\n  Why can't this industry, which is a source of so much good in \nAmerica, do more to discourage the marketing of filth to children? Why \nshouldn't the industry help fight the marketing of violence to young \npeople?\n  Study after study indicates that prolonged exposure of children to \nultra-violent movies and video games increases the likelihood for \naggression and aggressive conduct on their part. As President Clinton \nnoted in his radio address last week, the two juveniles who committed \nthe atrocities in Littleton played the ultra-violent video game Doom--\nthat is this right here--the ultra-violent video game Doom obsessively, \nover and over and over. In addition, the 14-year-old boy who killed \nthree in the Paducah, KY, school killing in 1997 was also an avid video \ngame player. In fact, the juvenile had never fired a pistol before he \naccurately shot eight classmates.\n  Let me give one typical example of how these games are advertised. \nThis chart back here is a page from a video game company's web site. It \nis promoting a new video game called Turok 2--Seeds of Evil. This ad \ndescribes this game as--if you can read those words--``the undeniably, \ncertifiably el numero uno death match Frag fest because we know what \nyou want.''\n  Now, this last sentence bears repeating: ``Because we know what you \nwant.'' The ad describes ``over 24 devastating weapons'' and exclaims \nthat players may ``unload twin barrels of ricocheting shotgun shells'' \nand ``blow enemies clean away'' with the scorpion launcher. And worst \nof all, it urges players to ``send brains flying'' with something the \ngamemakers call a ``skull drilling cerebral bore.''\n  How much more graphic can this get? They emphasize how ``real'' the \ngames are, too, with ``real-time flinch generation.'' ``Enemies flinch \nand spasm differently, depending on which body part you hit.'' Absent \nhere is any realistic depiction of the consequences of real violence. \nThis is just one example of the irresponsibility of these games being \nmarketed and accessible to our kids. It is pathetic when you stop and \nthink about it.\n  I might add, given there is evidence that extremely violent or \notherwise unsuitable material in movies, music, and video games have \nnegative effects on children, many are concerned about how these \nproducts are marketed and sold. Do these industries specifically target \nproducts to minors that, according to their own guidelines, are \nunsuitable to minors? I think the American people deserve an answer to \nthat question.\n  As I testified before the Senate Commerce Committee last week, I was \ntroubled to learn that according to the National Institute on Media and \nthe Family, some manufacturers of video and computer games are \nmarketing ultraviolent video games rated for adults only to children. \nIn 1998, the National Institute on Media and the Family conducted a \nthorough study of the video and computer game industry. Some of the \nfindings were very disturbing. For example, lurid advertisements for \nviolent video games are aimed directly at children. The advertisement \nfor the video game Destrega states: ``Let the slaughter begin,'' while \nthe advertisement for the video game Carmageddon states: ``As easy as \nkilling babies with axes.'' These and similar advertisements appeared \nin recent gaming magazines that are targeted to teenagers.\n  Moreover, an advertisement for Resident Evil 2, a violent video game \nrated for adults only, was featured in the magazine Sports Illustrated \nfor Kids. Few people would argue that cigarettes, alcohol, or X-rated, \nor NC-17 rated movies should be advertised in children's magazines. Why \nshould such violent video games--games the industry itself has found \nunsuitable for children--be advertised and marketed to children? I \nthink we need an answer to that.\n  Nor is the problem of marketing violence to children limited to video \ngames. In recent years, the lyrics of popular music have grown more \nviolent and depraved. And much of the violence and cruelty in modern \nmusic is directed toward women.\n  Here is one of the recent violent things. This is Eminem, and it is \ndirected, in large measure, toward violence and cruelty toward women.\n  As Senator Brownback noted on the floor two weeks ago, the group Nine \nInch Nails had a commercial success a few years ago with a song \ncelebrating the rape and murder of a woman. This is not an isolated \nexample. Hatred and violence against women in mainstream hip hop and \nalternative music are widespread and unmistakable. Consider the singer \nMarilyn Manson, whom MTV named the ``Best New Artist of the Year'' last \nyear. Some of Manson's less vulgar lyrics include: ``Who says date rape \nisn't kind''; ``let's just kill everyone and let your god sort them \nout''; and ``the housewife I will beat, the pro-life I will kill.'' \nOther Manson lyrics cannot be repeated here on the Senate floor.\n  The weekend after the Colorado shootings, a 12-year-old boy whom I \nknow, bought a Marilyn Manson compact disc from a local Washington area \nrecord store, even though it was rated for adult content. Ironically, \nthe warning label on the disc was covered by the price tag. Here is the \ndisc, and here is the way the warning label was covered. The tag \ncovered the warning label, clearly making it easier for kids to buy \nthese products. This indicates that these record warnings are not being \ntaken seriously. Consider Eminem, which I mentioned before, the hip hop \nartist featured frequently on MTV who recently wrote ``Bonnie and \nClyde''--a song in which he described his killing his child's mother \nand dumping her body into the ocean. Many of his songs contain violent, \ntroubling lyrics with the misogynistic message.\n\n  Despite historic bipartisan legislation by the State and Federal \ngovernments, it is stunning how much modern music glorifies acts of \nviolence, sexual and otherwise, against women.\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nThis music is what many children are listening to. This music is \nmarketed to our youth, and we should not ignore the fact that violent \nmisogynistic music may ultimately affect the behavior and attitudes of \nmany young men toward women.\n  One might argue that these groups are not embraced by the \nentertainment industry. How, then, would the industry explain a 1998 \nGrammy nomination for Nine Inch Nails and a 1999 nomination for Marilyn \nManson? It is one thing to say these people can't produce this \nmaterial; it is another thing for the industry to embrace it.\n  Many Americans were justifiably outraged when it was discovered that \ntobacco companies marketed cigarettes to children. I believe we should \nbe equally concerned if we find that violent music and video games are \nbeing marketed to children. Limiting access to ultraviolent music and \nvideo games to children does not raise the same constitutional concerns \nthat a general prohibition on such material would entail.\n  For example, while some can reasonably contend that the first \namendment protects certain X-rated material, no one can reasonably \nargue that the Constitution prohibits restricting such material to \nchildren.\n  Now, that is why one provision of this amendment--a provision I \ndeveloped with Senators Lieberman, Harkin, and Kohl--directs the FTC \nand the Department of Justice to examine the extent to which the motion \npictures, recording, and video game industries market violent, sexually \nexplicit, or other harmful and unsuitable material to minors--including \nwhether such content is advertised or promoted in media outlets in \nwhich minors comprise a substantial percentage of the audience.\n  The report will also examine the extent to which retailers, and in \nthe case of motion pictures, theater owners, have policies to restrict \nthe sale, rental, or admission of such unsuitable material to minors--\nand whether the industry requires, monitors, or encourages the \nenforcement of their respective voluntary rating systems by retail \nmerchants or theater owners.\n  Mr. President, I do want to note that over the years each of these \nindustries has taken some positive steps in developing voluntary \nlabeling systems that provide notice to parents about unsuitable \ncontent of certain products.\n  But as I have said before, it is important to see if such standards \nare enforced at the retail stage, and also see if, despite their \nstandards, the industry targets unsuitable materials to minors.\n  I also want to take a few moments to discuss another provision of \nthis amendment that provides a limited antitrust exemption to the \nindustry in order to empower them to develop effective enforcement \nprocedures for their voluntary guidelines. This provision is different \nfrom the provision developed by Senator Brownback, which relates to the \ndevelopment of a code of conduct.\n  For years, I and others in Congress have searched for solutions for \nlimiting the negative impact exposure to violent or sexually explicit \ncontent--whether in motion pictures, television, songs, or video \ngames--has on our children. This provision of the amendment is designed \nto achieve this objective by empowering the respective industries to \ndevelop and enforce responsible guidelines without the fear of \nliability under our antitrust laws. It will allow manufacturers and \nproducers to agree among themselves to refuse to sell their products to \nretail outlets who do not follow the industry's standards and \nguidelines--if the industry chooses to do that.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am mindful \nof the first amendment concerns that could be raised by attempts on the \npart of the Federal Government to broadly regulate content, on the \nInternet or over the other media. But I do believe that we must do what \nwe can do to promote responsibility on the part of the film industry, \nthe recording industry and the entertainment software industry in \nmeeting the needs of children. This amendment does that.\n  Over the years each of these industries has taken positive steps in \ndeveloping voluntary rating systems that either provide notice to \nparents about unsuitable content of certain products, or attempt to \nrestrict the sale of unsuitable products to adults or mature audiences. \nUnfortunately, it appears that adequate and effective enforcement of \nthese guidelines at the retail level is lacking. For instance, there is \nlittle enforcement effort that ensures children under the age of 17 are \nin fact prohibited from viewing NC-17 rated movies--or that children \nare not allowed to purchase music or video games which are purportedly \nintended for sale to adults. The inquiry by the FTC and DOJ directed by \nthis amendment will further be helpful in this regard.\n  I believe that the enforcement of the voluntary standards is \nnecessary to make the system work. Proper enforcement will protect the \nintegrity of the overall self-regulatory system. If the industry \nchooses to exercise responsibility and refuse to sell its product to a \nretailer who does not follow the industry code of conduct, it should be \nable to do so--without the fear of antitrust laws.\n  Here is how this provision of the amendment works: to the extent that \nthe antitrust laws might preclude the motion pictures, recording or \nvideo game industries from developing guidelines and procedures for \ntheir respective industries to limit the sale of unsuitable material to \nchildren, this amendment fixes that. It provides industry with limited \nfixes that. It provides industry with limited exemption from the \nantitrust laws in order to give them the freedom to develop and enforce \nvoluntary enforcement mechanisms without the fear of antitrust \nliability or government regulation.\n  But with this amendment I hope to encourage industry to limit the \nsale to minors of material, whether it is music, movies, or video \ngames, which the industry itself deems unsuitable for children.\n  Again, it is important to underscore that this provision does not \ntell industry to do or not to do anything. It simply gives them the \npower to join forces in order to develop enforcement mechanisms without \nthe risk of liability under the antitrust laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment. I am privileged to be \na cosponsor of the amendment with the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback, and with the Senator from Utah, Chairman Hatch.\n  This amendment incorporates several proposals which many of us have \nbeen working on together across party lines in this Chamber to try to \ntone down one of the influences that we are convinced is contributing \nto the outbreak and crisis of youth violence in our country.\n  Two other colleagues whom I have been privileged to work with are \nSenator McCain of Arizona and Senator Kohl of Wisconsin. At this time I \nask unanimous consent that Senators McCain and Kohl be added as \noriginal cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the wake of the tragic shooting in \nLittleton, we as a nation, as individuals, are focusing in on an \nunsettling fact: No matter how good times are economically in America, \nsomething seems to have gone wrong in our country, something that is \nwhetting the taste for blood and death in our children, turning too \nmany of them into killers in our schools, in the suburbs, on the urban \nstreet corners, and in the homes of every kind of community throughout \nour country.\n  As I have listened to this discussion at home in Connecticut, and as \nI have listened to it here on the floor of the Senate, in the \ncommittees and caucus rooms of this Capitol, I think what is important \nis that we are all recognizing and accepting that this is an extremely \ncomplicated problem without a single cause, fueled by an amorphous mix \nof factors.\n  A child is not, if I may say, a natural born killer. A child, \nunfortunately, is affected by a variety of circumstances that make him \ninto a killer, from the disengagement of parents, from the makeup of \nthe child himself, to the disconnection and alienation that many \nchildren feel from their families, their peers, their communities, to \nthe weakening of our moral and community safety nets. This is a mix \nthat has been\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nmade more deadly in our time by the easy access many children have to \nguns.\n  Most of what we know for sure, as we consider the complexity of the \nproblem, is, unfortunately, in the statistics, there is a Littleton \nevery day. An average of 13 children die from gunshot wounds every 24 \nhours in America--some self-inflicted and more from murder.\n  The fact is that no civilized country in the world comes close to \nmatching this level of homicide and suicide, let alone the massacres we \nhave seen committed in public places. The more we look at this problem, \nthe more we understand--many of us--that the environment in which we \nare raising our children, with all of the death and destruction and \ndismemberment and degradation that we expose them to in the \nentertainment media, with the wealth of perverse messages we send them \nromanticizing and in many ways sanitizing violence--all of that has an \neffect. All of that draws a connection between the culture and the \nkilling, between the viciousness pouring out of our children and piling \nup throughout our society.\n  I know there are skeptics and naysayers who, despite the reams of \nevidence and scientific and anecdotal information gleaned from \nLittleton, Jonesboro, Paducah, and elsewhere--despite all that our \nintuition tells us about the omnipresence of electronic media and the \npull on our society, despite all of this--cling to the notion that the \nculture of violence is harmless, that the relentless assault of virtual \nmurder and mayhem on our children is having no effect, and that it \ncan't be true. There has always been violence in our country, these \nskeptics rationalize. There has always been violence in the culture. So \nthe answers must lie elsewhere.\n  But the answer lies within each of us, and within each of the groups \nand industries we are referring to here. The truth is, we have always \nhad alienated, disaffected, and in some cases mentally troubled \nchildren. We have always had the cruel taunting of adolescents, the \ncliques in schools, and in many parts of the country we have also \nalways had guns within easy reach of children. And yet, never before in \nthe history of our country have we seen this level of violence among \nour children. Something entirely different, chillingly different, is \nhappening, and we have to find out what it is and do something about \nit.\n\n  We could spend weeks discussing this question. In fact, in another \namendment several of us will be proposing a year-long commission to \nlook at the problems underneath the problems.\n  Clearly, some of it has to do with the fact that many of the \ntraditional transmitters of values we have long relied on to shape the \nmoral sense of our children--family, community, faith, and school--have \nbeen weakened in recent years, and more and more what is filling that \nvalue vacuum is the enormously alluring and powerful, influential \nentertainment media which too often has become a standard shredder \ninstead of a standard setter.\n  So how do we in this society that so values freedom of expression \nurge and push the entertainment industry to self-control, to self-\nregulate, to acknowledge not that they are causing this problem but \nthat they are contributing to a crisis that is killing too many of our \nchildren?\n  It is not easy. I think in this amendment we have found a way to \nbegin to do it with an industry code of conduct exempting those in the \nentertainment industry from the fear of antitrust prosecutions so that \nthey can work together to develop a code of conduct which will protect \nthem from what some of them claim to be: With the currently existing \ncompetitive pressure downward, if the other company produces an ultra-\nviolent movie and makes money, we have got to do it.\n  Of course, nobody has to do anything. Lines should be drawn about \nwhat people won't do to make an extra dollar or two or an extra 10 \nmillion dollars or two.\n  This amendment enables the companies to get together to do just that, \nand also to enforce the rating system that they themselves put on. We \ndon't want to be censors. Let the industries themselves rate their \nproducts, as they do now. But then let them agree not to market \nproducts that they have rated as inappropriate, as harmful to children. \nLet them agree that when they rate a movie as unsuitable for kids under \n17, there ought to be some responsibility in the theater owner not to \nlet children under 17 into that movie, just the way there was \nresponsibility on the owner of a bar not to serve liquor to a minor.\n  Mr. President, last week I submitted evidence to the Commerce \nCommittee, which I think is strongly suggestive of the fact that two \nmajor entertainment industries--the movies and the video games--are \nrating products as bad for our children and then, as my colleagues have \nshown here on the floor, directly marketing those products to our \nchildren, contributing to the culture of violence that is embracing, \nsurrounding, suffocating, and too often motivating our kids.\n  This amendment rightfully calls on the Justice Department and the \nFederal Trade Commission to conduct an investigation of the marketing \npractices of the video game, music, and motion picture industries to \ndetermine if they engage in deceptive marketing practices by targeting \nminors for the acquisition of material they themselves have deemed \nunsuitable for such minors.\n  I am afraid to say that Joe Camel has not gone away. He seems too \noften to have gone into the entertainment business.\n  Consider the anecdotal evidence from the movie industry, which \nindicates that violent films rated for adults only are being marketed \nto children. Over the last few years we have seen the rise of a new \nclass of teen-targeted films--referred to by some as \n``teensploitation'' movies--which has engaged producers and directors \nin a conspicuous contest to see who can be more violent, more sexually \nprovocative, and generally more perverse to attract youth audiences. A \nperfect example of this trend is ``Very Bad Things,'' a supposed comedy \nabout a bachelor party gone wrong, which finds fun in the dismembering \nof a stripper and the successive mutilation of the partygoers.\n  The latest entry is ``Idle Hands,'' which was released just last \nweek. It is promoted as ``sick and twisted laugh riot,'' and it's not \nhard to see where this description comes from--according to reviews, \nthe film features a severed hand that fondles a girl before strangling \nher, a knitting needle that is driven through a policeman's ear, and a \ndecapitation by circular saw blade, all apparently played for laughs.\n  What these movies have in common, beyond their violent and offensive \ncontent, is that they are rated ``R,'' meaning that they are not meant \nfor children under 17. Yet according to several recent news media \nreports, most producers and studio executives assume that underage kids \ncan and will get in. ``Well, let's hope so,'' says Roger Kumble, the \ndirector of ``Cruel Intentions,'' the teen remake of ``Dangerous \nLiaisons'' which is by all accounts far more salacious than the \noriginal. This sentiment was affirmed by Don Mancini, the writer of all \nfour R-rated ``Child's Play'' horror films, who acknowledged that young \nteens were the target for his most recent release, ``Bride of Chucky,'' \nand other similarly bloody slasher films. ``They have grown up watching \nthese movies on home video,'' he said. ``Now that there are new ones \ncoming out, these kids are tantalized.''\n  To apparently help lure in young audiences, these teensploitation \nmovies are heavily advertised on MTV and network series that teens \nwatch regularly, such as ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire \nSlayer,'' and are stocked with actors from these teen-favored TV shows. \nThis pattern succeeded with the teen slasher movies ``Scream'' and ``I \nKnow What You Did Last Summer,'' and it continues with the current \n``Cruel Intentions''--the director said casting Sarah Michelle Gellar \nof Buffy fame was like ``dangling the carrot'' in front of young teens. \nThis dangling is apparently working--according to a recent Gallup poll, \nhalf of American teens say they have seen an ``R''-rated movie in the \nlast month, including 42 percent of those aged 13-15.\n  The video and PC and arcade gamemakers are less candid about \ntargeting their marketing to teens than the moviemakers, but the \nevidence is there just the same. Action figures based on bloodthirsty \ncharacters from ``Resident Evil 2,'' ``Duke Nukem,'' and\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\n``Mortal Kombat''--three heavily-violent titles that are rated ``M'' \nfor 17-and-up--are being sold at Toys-R-Us and similar toy stores. \nThose same toy stores, which cater largely to children, typically carry \nthose games and many of ``M''-rated titles filled with guns and gore.\n  Equally disturbing is the advertising that publishers place in the \nvarious glossy game-player magazines. These magazines are widely read \nby young gamers, and they are filled with perverse and antisocial \nmessages. Here are just a few: ``Carmageddon'' boasts it is ``as easy \nas killing babies with axes''; ``Point Blanks'' claims it is ``more fun \nthan shooting your neighbor's cat''; ``Die by the Sword'' instructs, \n``Escape. Dismember. Massacre.''; and ``Cardinal Syn'' features a \nsevered, bloodied head on top of a spear, with the tag line, \n``Happiness is a Warm Cranium.'' A good indication these messages are \nreaching their target audience came from a survey done by the national \nInstitute on Media and the Family last winter, which found that while \nonly five percent of parents were familiar with the game ``Duke \nNukem,'' 80 percent of junior high students knew of it.\n  Taken together, the evidence here is enough to demonstrate that there \nis a troubling trend in the entertainment industry, one that it needs \nto stop now. The marketing of these ever-more vicious and violent \nproducts is making a mockery of the various rating systems, telling \nparents that these products are inappropriate for children but we're \ngoing to sell them anyway, and reminding us of similar behavior by the \ntobacco industry. More than that, it is unethical and unacceptable, and \nshould stop now.\n  We presented this evidence at a hearing before the Commerce Committee \nearlier this month, and the response from Hollywood was a deafening \nsilence. There was no acknowledgment that this is going on, or even \nthat it presents a problem. Their unwillingness to discuss this problem \nleaves us no chance to act. That is why Senator Hatch and I, along with \nSenator Brownback, are calling for an investigation into the marketing \npractices of the movie, music and video game industries, to determine \nto what extent they are targeting ultraviolent, adult-rated products to \nchildren.\n  Finally, in this amendment we call for an NIH study on violent \nentertainment. NIH is directed to conduct a study of the effect of \nviolence in video games and music, building on the studies that have \nbeen done which conclusively show that violence in movies and \ntelevision affects the behavior of children and makes them more \nviolent.\n  This study would be a companion piece to the directive the President \nissued on Monday at the summit. He called on the Surgeon General to do \na broad-based study of the causes of youth violence in our country, \nincluding the effect the entertainment industry is having on the \nviolent behavior of our children.\n  This amendment is one of several that will be introduced today. None \nof them individually will solve this problem. This is all a matter \nwhich in some ways is the history of human civilization and the extent \nto which we can improve the prospect that we will express our better \nnatures and not our worst natures. As humans, we are far from perfect. \nParents try to raise children and develop their better nature. Too \noften today those parents feel as if they are in fundamental and in \nsome ways critical competition with the entertainment industry to raise \ntheir kids.\n  All we are doing in these amendments and these statements is to \nappeal to the entertainment industry to exercise some responsibility: \nHelp America raise our children so that society will be safer than I \nfear it is as a result of the violent material included in too many \nentertainment products.\n  I hope--and I say this with some confidence based on the bipartisan \nreach of the cosponsors of this amendment--Senators Brownback, Hatch, \nMcCain, Kohl, and myself at least--that this amendment will be passed \nacross party lines with an overwhelming majority of colleagues of the \nSenate voting in favor of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have 7\\1/2\\ minutes and Senator Kennedy \nhas 7\\1/2\\ minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work the Senator \nfrom Kansas, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from Utah \nhave put into their amendment. I have no problem with looking at all \nthe different causes of violence among our youth. As a matter of fact, \nit is very much called for.\n  I also believe that anyone in our society who says, I have nothing to \ndo with this, is simply not taking responsibility for something very \npervasive in our society. That goes for every one of us, in our private \nlives as moms, dads, grandmas, and grandpas, in our public lives as \nMembers of the Senate.\n  There is one thing missing from this well-worded amendment. I know \nthe Senator from Kansas is checking on some matters for Members who may \nhave some concerns. What is missing from here as we look at the \nmarketing practices of the entertainment industry--which, as I say, I \ndon't have an objection to looking at that--I don't see anything in \nhere at all that deals with the marketing practices of another \nindustry, a huge industry in our country, and that is the gun industry.\n  Why do I bring that up? We all say that angry kids and guns don't \nmix. We know we want to keep guns away from children. So it seems to \nme, as we see more and more kids with weapons, we ought to look at the \nmarketing practices of the gun manufacturers if we are to be fair in \nthis amendment. We should look at everybody if we are truly being fair.\n  Why do I think this is important? Let me give my friend a couple of \nexamples so I am not just being theoretical. I say to my friend from \nKansas, the author of the amendment before the Senate, this is taken \noff the amendment. This is a picture directly from the Internet in the \nBeretta catalog. They call it their Youth Collection. We can see the \nbold colors in the gun. What they say in advertising--and I think this \nis very important--from their Youth Collection:\n\n       An exciting, bold designer look that is sure to make you \n     stand out in a crowd.\n\n  I don't know about my friend from Kansas, but I don't know what they \nmean, ``stand out in a crowd.'' If mom or dad takes them hunting, you \n``stand out in a crowd'' with your mom and dad? You already ``stand out \nin a crowd'' with them.\n  This is from a gun magazine called Guns and Ammo: A young man who \nlooks like he is about 13. It is titled ``Start 'Em Young.'' ``There is \nno time like the present.'' This young man is not holding a long gun; \nhe is holding a handgun--which we believe is a make-believe gun--\nholding a handgun in one hand and a bottle of Pepsi in the other hand.\n  If we are going to look at marketing practices, we ought to look at \nthem across the board.\n  Here is another advertisement that will take your breath away. A \nlittle boy, who like my grandson's age, about 3\\1/2\\, is being used in \na catalog advertising Browning guns. This child looks like he is about \n3\\1/2\\ years old.\n  In the NRA Youth Magazine, it says, ``News for Young Shooters.'' It \ndoesn't say young hunters. ``New youth guns for '97.''\n  This is an advertisement in the NRA magazine. This is a handgun. The \nadvertisement says, ``The right way to get started in handgunning.'' \nThis is in a youth magazine.\n  The law says you can't buy a handgun from a dealer unless you are 21; \nat a gun show you can purchase at 18.\n  This is the Youth Magazine, I say to my friend from Kansas, Youth \nMagazine--below 18--and they advertise a handgun.\n  I could show more examples of marketing practices that look to a lot \nof Members as if they are going after very, very young people.\n  I understand the rules around here and I have great respect for my \nfriend from Utah. He will second-degree the Senator's amendment with an \namendment of his own, and I don't know exactly what it will contain. I \nhope it will be to expand this to gun manufacturers, expand our study. \nIf it is, I would be delighted.\n  I ask my friend from Kansas if he would accept this amendment, which \nsimply adds a new title, takes the same study and includes a study of \nmarketing practices of the firearms industry toward young people, so \nthat we have a well-balanced amendment before the Senate that deals \nboth with\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nwhat the entertainment industry is doing and what the gun manufacturers \nare doing. I ask my friend from Kansas if he is willing to accept this \namendment that simply takes the same study and allows it to be made of \nthe marketing practices of the firearms industry toward juveniles.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, if I could respond to my colleague, I \nappreciate her bringing this up. It would have been nice, maybe, to \nhave caught it at a little earlier time.\n  The amendment itself is directed at a particular facet. I think we \nare going to have a number of different amendments that are going to \naffect the gun industry.\n  We do not have an amendment here on marketing for the knife industry \neither. There are other places, I suppose, we could look at marketing \nissues as well, and perhaps should.\n  This is particularly directed at a certain sector. I hope my \ncolleague will bring this up at another time with another amendment. I \nam afraid I could not accept it at this point in time because I have \ntoo many cosponsors on this amendment and I would have to go around to \nthose cosponsors and ask them.\n  I think the Senator brings up a good point. I think this is a fair \nitem to look at. It has been studied. There have been several studies, \nI am informed, on this very point she is raising. It might be good to \nlook at some of those. The things we are trying to study here have not \nbeen studied before. That is why we particularly look at that set of \npoints, because we have not. It is tied into a particular industry \narea.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If I may reclaim my time, because I have limited time, \nthe reason I wanted to find out if my friend would accept it--\nobviously, he is not going to do it. I am happy to look at how many \nkids a year die because of knives, but I can tell you now, 4,600 kids a \nyear die of gunshots. It is the leading cause of death among children \nin my State. It is the second leading cause of death among youngsters \nnationwide. If you want to look at knives, I am happy to look at \nknives. You show the numbers. They do not come close. Guns are the No. \n1 cause of death in California among kids; No. 2 nationwide. It has \novertaken car deaths in my State, and it is about to overtake car \ndeaths nationwide.\n  All I am saying to my friend is this. I appreciate the hard work he \nhas put in on his amendment, but I hope he will consider accepting this \namendment. I think it is fair. We are looking at causes of violence, \ndealing with marketing practices in the entertainment industry. We \nought to expand it to include this.\n  I have the numbers: 137 children died of knives in 1996 compared to \n4,600 who died of gunshots. If you want to examine the knifing deaths, \nI am happy to do that, but the magnitude of the problem is not the \nsame. We have the equivalent of one Columbine High School incident \nevery day. I know the Senator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield my time to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend wants to continue the colloquy, I am happy \nto yield him 2 minutes. Then I can discuss this back and forth with \nhim.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would note, I think we should look at these prior \nstudies that have been done on this particular issue. I think it would \nbe wise as well to look at those. I appreciate my colleague raising \nthis. We have a series of amendments that are bipartisan. We have a \nseries of cosponsors on this amendment. It is an area on which we have \nheld a number of hearings. That is what we seek to have addressed here.\n  If she seeks to add it into another, or bring it up as a separate \namendment, I think that would be a good thing to do. I am certainly not \nopposed. But on this, at this point in time, we have a number of \ncosponsors. I think we are up to eight cosponsors, bipartisan, on this. \nI would need to go to all of them and ask all of them to add this \nparticular amendment. It is out of the flow of what we are trying to do \nwith this amendment. We have announced this. I have been working with a \nnumber of people on a bipartisan basis. I think we need to stay with \nthat at this time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I have to say to him, why is it out of \nthe flow of this amendment? I am just taking back my time at this \npoint. I yielded my friend time. He made a statement that my amendment \nis out of the flow.\n\n  I thought we were looking at reducing juvenile crime and juvenile \ndeath. I thought we were looking at reducing the culture of violence. \nAll I am saying to my friend is, you are going after one industry here. \nFine. They better stand up and be counted on this. But when it comes to \nthe gun industry, you cited studies. What other studies?\n  As a matter of fact, if you want to look at the way Congress has \ntreated the gun industry, that is the only industry in the whole \ncountry that I know of which is not even regulated by any Federal law, \nin terms of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which they are \nspecifically exempted from. I have to say I am disappointed because, in \nthe spirit of bipartisanship, we should make every industry stand up \nand be counted when it comes to our children.\n  Every day in America there is another Columbine. Every day, 13 \nchildren are gunned down. They die. Yes, we need to look at the violent \nculture, as my friend from Utah has pointed out, and my friend from \nKansas. Yes, we need to look at why that culture seems to impact our \nkids more.\n  I was struck by a comment of Senator Levin from Michigan, who pointed \nout that in the town directly across from Detroit, in Canada, where \nthey get the same videos, the same movies, the same music, there were \nhardly any gun deaths. He has those exact numbers, something like 300 \ncompared to 19.\n  So there are a lot of factors that we have to deal with, including \nfamily lives of our children. Do they have enough to do after school?\n  It is about prevention. Senator Kennedy has been eloquent on the \npoint. Senator Leahy has been eloquent on the point, saying: Yes, we \nwant to do even more on prevention. But when we are down to studying an \nindustry, how do you say, I really can't study at this point the \nmarketing practices of the firearm industry? To me, it is amazing that \nthey would advertise a handgun in the NRA youth bulletin when laws in \nour country today say you have to be 21 to buy a handgun from a dealer, \nand, at a gun show, 18. But nowhere does it say in our law you can buy \na handgun under 18. Yet, in the youth magazine, what does it say? ``The \nright way to get started handgunning.'' Here is this young man, 13 \nyears old, posing with a handgun replica. ``Start 'em young. There's no \ntime like the present.''\n  Here is the Beretta, painted in bright colors to attract children, in \ntheir youth collection of which they say, ``an exciting bold designer \nlook that is sure to make you stand out in a crowd.'' You know, I think \nthat ought to be investigated. What do they mean? I would love to know \nwhat they mean by that: ``An exciting bold designer look that is sure \nto make you stand out in a crowd.'' Those two shooters at Columbine \nwanted to stand out in a crowd.\n  So I think if we are going to look at an industry and say we will \nonly look at one and turn our back on the firearms industry and their \nmarketing practice, that is wrong. I am disappointed that my friend \nfrom Kansas will not accept this amendment. He has eight cosponsors. I \nam sure a lot of them would support this amendment.\n  It is my intention to offer this at another time, because I do not \nfeel we should study one industry and bring all our efforts down on one \nindustry while turning our back on another industry which looks to me \nas if it is going after our kids--really young. A picture of a 3\\1/2\\-\nyear-old child in one of these advertisements--maybe he is 2\\1/2\\, \nmaybe he is 4.\n  Let me express my deep disappointment we cannot do this by unanimous \nconsent, and express my desire to offer this amendment, which is \nbasically the same as the one before us, with the FTC looking at the \nadvertising practices of the gun industry.\n  I think not to take this amendment, I say to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, is a sad day. It is a sad day because it looks to me \nas if you want to blame everything on one industry and turn your back \non another one that is going after our children.\n  It is not balanced; it is not fair. I hope to offer this amendment, \nand I hope to get support for it at a later time.\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California. I \nbelieve most of our time has been used. I will address the Senate on \nthe matters which I had intended to address later in the afternoon. I \nsee my friend and colleague from Ohio on the floor, so I will seek \nrecognition later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. DeWine, as an original cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, and \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. I want to \ndiscuss one of the provisions of this amendment. This provision is \nsimilar to legislation Senator Brownback and I introduced in the last \nCongress, and that bill was S. 539, the Television Improvement Act. We \nintroduced that bill in the last Congress, along with the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and my friend and ranking member of the \nAntitrust Subcommittee, Senator Kohl.\n  This amendment will create an exemption from antitrust liability to \nallow the entertainment industry to develop and agree upon voluntary \nguidelines designed to alleviate the negative impact of numerous forms \nof entertainment--broadcast programming, movies, music lyrics, video \ngames, and Internet content.\n  In other words, this amendment will remove a legal obstacle that \narguably could prevent decisionmakers in the entertainment industry \nfrom getting together to make responsible decisions about the products \nthey produce. Specifically, this amendment will allow them to agree \nvoluntarily to limit the amount of violence, sexual content, criminal \nbehavior, and profanity that exists in their various mediums. It will \nalso, equally important, give them an opportunity, if they chose to \ntake it, to promote and provide entertainment that is educational, \ninformational, or otherwise beneficial to children. In other words, it \nwill allow them to come together to agree to limit the bad things, but \nit will also allow them to come together to try to improve the quality \nof product they are putting out and specifically when they are dealing \nwith products for children.\n  I emphasize that the purpose of this amendment is to allow the \nentertainment industry to voluntarily come together to address the \nAmerican people's growing concern about the negative influence of \ntelevision, movies, and other forms of entertainment on our children. \nRather than mandate Government restrictions on programming content, \nthis amendment is designed to give industry leaders the opportunity to \nimprove on their own the quality of television programs, music, movies, \nvideos, and Internet content.\n  In the past, the television industry has had such a code of conduct. \nIn fact, for most of its history, the television industry utilized the \ncode in order to help it make programming decisions. But in recent \nyears, many of the entertainment industry have expressed concern that \nsuch a code might expose them to legal liability and they, therefore, \nhave abandoned it.\n  As chairman of the Antitrust Subcommittee, I studied this matter in \nthe last Congress, and I came to the conclusion that a code of conduct \nwould be appropriate and legal under current antitrust laws. However, \njust to be sure and to remove any doubt, I am supporting this amendment \nexemption.\n  This amendment exemption will remove any lingering doubts those in \nthe industry might have. Quite candidly, quite bluntly, this will say \nto the entertainment industry: You have no excuse--no excuse--not to \ncome together and try to improve programming for children. You have no \nexcuse not to come together and try to limit the bad things that are \non, to limit the things that the American people find so objectionable.\n  Acting on this legislation gives the Senate the opportunity to urge \nentertainment providers to work together and to cooperate to ensure our \nchildren's best interests are, in fact, protected.\n\n  This amendment encourages voluntary, responsible behavior. It will \nnot give any Government agency or entity any new authority to regulate \nor control the content of television programs or the content of movies, \nmusic, video games, or the Internet. It merely gives those in the \nentertainment industry the freedom to regulate themselves and to do the \nright thing.\n  I recognize that entertainment, like almost everything else in our \neconomy, is driven by competitive pressures. Often in the heat of \ncompetition, those in the industry may believe they are offering a \nproduct that is of lower quality than they might like, but they may \nfeel they have to do that. This amendment offers a way out of the \nsituation.\n  The amendment basically calls for a cease-fire among cable stations \nand the networks, the movie studios, the record companies, the video \ngame industry, and the web sites. This is a cease-fire so they can try \nto work out an industry-by-industry response to the legitimate demands \nof millions of American parents for more family-oriented entertainment.\n  When I look at this amendment, I look at it as I think many parents \ndo. I am worried about what is happening in this country. There was a \ntime, not too many years ago, when parents did not have to worry about \nwhat was on television during the so-called family hour. That is not \ntrue anymore. There really is not a family hour anymore. We have all \nseen the steady decline in the quality of television over the last few \nyears.\n  In addition, we all know music lyrics have become more graphic and \nmore violent and, in recent years, video games and the Internet are \nproviding more violent and sexually explicit material than we ever \nimagined possible.\n  It is beyond dispute that these television shows, movies, records, \nand video games are having an effect. For a young person, for a \nteenager, popular music is really the sound track of their lives. \nMovies and television provide a lot of the context for their \nrelationships. Video games and the Internet provide a great deal of \ntheir entertainment.\n  As these movies become more violent, more sexually explicit, as these \nsongs show more and more disrespect for life and for the rights of \nothers, some of our children are starting to believe this behavior is \nacceptable and normal. Some are starting to believe this make-believe \nworld of music and movies is the real world with sometimes very tragic \nconsequences.\n  I understand it is not the role or the responsibility of the \nentertainment industry to raise our kids or to protect them from the \nviolence of the real world. That is our job as parents and as citizens. \nIt is time that the entertainment industry did its fair share. That is \nwhat this amendment is calling for.\n  I hope the entertainment industry takes the opportunity that is \noffered by this amendment and makes a commitment to provide the kind of \nentertainment of which we can all be proud.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for offering this very \nimportant and, I think, timely amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay the \npending amendment aside so that the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia may be able to call up a separate amendment, which we will \naccept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 330\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Lautenberg proposes an amendment \n     numbered 330.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . STUDY OF MARKETING PRACTICES OF THE FIREARMS \n                   INDUSTRY.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       The Federal Trade Commission and the Attorney General shall \n     jointly conduct a study of the marketing practices of the \n     firearms industry; with respect to children.\n       (b) Issues Examined.--In conducting the study under \n     subsection (a), the Commission and the Attorney General shall \n     examine the extent to which the firearms industry advertises \n     and promotes its products to juveniles, including in media \n     outlets in which minors comprise a substantial percentage of \n     the audience.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission and the Attorney \n     General shall submit to Congress a report on the study \n     conducted under subsection (a).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah and my friend \nfrom Kansas for indicating they will accept this amendment. All we do \nhere is we extend this study to the firearms industry as it relates to \ntheir marketing practices aimed at children. I am very pleased that, \nafter we had a chance to discuss this, they have agreed to accept it. I \nthink it makes what we are doing here stronger and fairer, by looking \nat all the aspects of this problem.\n  I thank my friend for indicating he will accept this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I could just comment, I have had no objection to \nthis all along. We had a specific set area we wanted to talk about and \nto address and to have a discussion on. I have not had an objection to \ndoing this. But we have had a focus and set of hearings on the things \nwe talked about, and it has been well developed, and it had eight \ncosponsors to it. I just did not want to do that without having a \nchance for other people to look at it and have their point of view. I \nhave no objection to this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, I thank my friend.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kennedy and Durbin be added as \ncosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I look forward to working with my colleagues to reduce \ngun violence. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Lautenberg be \nadded as a cosponsor as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 330.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 330) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the status of the time \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have no time agreement.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly in favor \nof the Brownback-Hatch amendment.\n  I believe it is a good, realistic first step, because what it deals \nwith is a voluntary step that would allow us to conduct a search and \nallow voluntary actions by the movie and entertainment industry to \nconfront a problem many of us believe is affecting the culture of \nviolence in America.\n  All of us know that it is not a bomb or a knife that has the intent \nto kill. The intent to kill comes from the person who wields that \nweapon. There must be ``malicious intent'' under the law to constitute \na criminal act.\n  We believe, and I think most Members of this body believe, that \nsomething is awry, that somehow, some way we are allowing a plethora, a \nhost, a bombardment of unhealthy messages to reach our children and \nthat some of them are seriously affected thereby.\n  I, for one, think that the reason we have had more than one of these \nmass shootings at schools is because a very, very small number of young \npeople in America have found themselves able to immerse into a \nnihilistic, depressive, death-oriented, violent-oriented lifestyle. It \nsurrounds them. If they are in an automobile, there is violent, \ndepressive music on the radio. If they go to the movies, there are \nviolent movies they can watch. They not only can see them in the \ntheater, but they can rent the movies and play them time and time \nagain, as some of these young people apparently have. These very \ndangerous movies are filled with anger and violence.\n  There are such things more and more happening on television today. \nAnd a young person can get on the Internet and play very intense life-\nand-death games in which youths are out to kill before they are killed. \nIt is an intense experience for many young people.\n  There are chat rooms on the Internet. You can get on the Internet and \nfind somebody who can feed your negative thoughts, who believes that \nAdolf Hitler is worthy of respect. You can find somebody on the \nInternet who would agree with that and affirm this unhealthy view of \nlife.\n  I think we are seeing that kind of thing, and maybe that is a factor \nin what is happening in America.\n  I would say there is no better champion than Senator Brownback, and I \nam so proud of the Senator from Kansas for raising this issue so \narticulately and so persuasively. I think this is just the beginning. I \nthink we are called upon as leaders in the American Government to think \nseriously about what we are doing and how it affects our culture.\n  One of the great Greek philosophers--Plato, I believe--said, ``The \npurpose of education is to make people good.''\n  We think the purpose of education is to transmit technical knowledge \nand job skills, and that no teacher should even be empowered to suggest \nwhat is good and what is bad, to choose light rather than darkness, to \nchoose life rather than death. Are we not capable of affirming those \nbasic principles in our public life in America? I think we can.\n  I think this is a bizarre and abnormal theory we have developed about \nthe proper role of government with regard to matters of arousing \nreligion and faith in this country. The Constitution deals only briefly \nwith the right to express religious opinions. For example, I would like \nto make this point. It is the only reference in our Constitution about \nreligion. The First Amendment says Congress ``shall make no law \nrespecting the establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.''\n\n  People say, what about this ``wall of separation'' between church and \nstate? Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter in which he made reference to a \n``wall of separation'' between church and state. This was later. Those \nwho ratified the Constitution never ratified that. We don't even know \nwhat he meant by that, it was a private letter, not a formal opinion. \nThat is not part of the Constitution. It has never been approved by the \nAmerican people, adopted by we, the people of the United States of \nAmerica, when they ratified the Constitution or voted on in \nPhiladelphia by the people who were there. What they voted on was that \nCongress, the United States Congress, ``shall make no law respecting \nthe establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise \nthereof.''\n  The President, sitting in the Chair--I happen to have done that a \nnumber of times in just over 2 years in this body. When you look out \nacross the wall, you see in words 6 inches high, or higher, right up \nthere over the door of this august room, it says ``in God We Trust.''\n  If you go in the anteroom over here, in the President's Room, there \nis a figure holding a Bible in her arm. It is painted on the ceiling. \nHow long it has been on there I don't know, but for many, many years. \nThere is another one with a cross. There are four words on the four \ncorners of the wall. I think one of them is ``philosophy.'' One of them \nis ``government.'' And one of them is ``religion.'' We made reference \nin our founding documents to divine providence, to our creator.\n  So I believe we have established an extraordinarily bizarre \nunderstanding in recent years of what the meaning and the proper \nunderstanding of the\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nseparation between church and state is. I believe that this Congress \nwas prohibited by the American people and the Founding Fathers from \nestablishing an official religion. I do not believe there is anything \nthat any scholar can say that the Constitution is prohibiting \nacknowledgment of a higher being. In fact, we have done that throughout \nthe history of this country.\n  My personal view is that this legalistic approach has intimidated \nteachers and made them less willing to provide moral guidance and \naffirmation of religious impulses of their students. They feel that it \nis somehow illegal for them even to do so.\n  I do not believe that is true. I think threats of lawsuits have \nintimidated natural free speech. The Constitution says Congress shall \nnot prohibit the free expression of religion.\n  I think we ought to have a more natural approach. I think any \nteacher, or any government official, ought to be sensitive not to use \nany position of authority they may have to impose their own personal \ntheology or philosophy or political views on people who are in a \ncaptive audience. That is normal, natural decency. Where I grew up, I \nwas taught to respect people's religion. If they disagreed with me, \nthat was their prerogative. In this country, you are allowed to have \nand adhere to deep religious beliefs. If a religious faith called on \nstudents to pause at a certain time during the day to have a prayer and \nit is part of their doctrine and they believe deeply in this, why would \nwe not allow that to happen? I was taught you tried to accommodate \npeople's religious beliefs--not to get into debate and argument with \nthem--because we respected people who had something more important than \nwho made the highest test score.\n\n  Griffin Bell, former Federal judge, and former Attorney General of \nthe United States for President Carter once made a speech. It was \nsuggested he might be critical of President Reagan--he was appointing \njudges and he said President Reagan had a litmus test for judges. Judge \nBell was asked what he thought about this litmus test. He shocked the \nState bar association meeting members by walking to the microphone and \nsaying, ``I don't know, maybe we ought to have a litmus test--nobody \nought to be on the Federal bench who doesn't believe in a prayer at a \nfootball game.''\n  I wonder about that. Why do we think you can't even have a voluntary \nmoment so those people who choose to do so might bow for one moment at \nthe football game to affirm that there is something more important in \nlife than who is the biggest, strongest and who has the most points? \nHow does this undermine our freedom as Americans? If you don't want to \nbow your head, you don't have to; if you think it is superstitious--\nfree country. If you respect other people's religion and if this is \nimportant to them, you will benignly allow them to carry on with their \nbeliefs.\n  I think we have gone way too far. I think it has affected the ability \nof the American leadership to assert certain cultural beliefs and \nvalues, and if we don't do that, we are suggesting directly and \nindirectly to our children that there are no permanent values, there \nare no values worth dying for.\n  One reporter, referring to a prominent American, said there is not \none single belief he would adhere to if he thinks it is against his \npolitical interest to do so. I hope we haven't reached that point. I \nhope there are still things that people are willing to stand for, pay a \nprice for--yes, die for.\n  That ought to be transmitted to our children. There are a multitude \nof ways that can be done. Even our televisions, our newspapers, and our \nradios affirmed those basic values consistently in the 1950s, for \nexample. It was affirmed at our schools. It was affirmed in our \nfamilies. It was affirmed in our churches.\n  Now we have begun to lose our moral compass. How we deal with it, I \ndon't know. The Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, has said he \ndoesn't really know the answers but he is raising those questions. He \nis calling on us as a nation to analyze what is happening, to recognize \nthat a culture that affirms life, a culture that affirms light, is \nbetter than a culture that affirms death and darkness. Honesty is \nbetter than dishonesty; kindness is better than meanness. There is \nright and there is wrong. We ought to adhere to the right even when, in \nthe short-term, it is not helpful to us. Somehow we have to deal with \nthis.\n  These amendments are a step. We believe it is constitutional, \nappropriate, and fair.\n  We believe we should analyze in one little area what is happening, to \ncreate some studies about the market, a National Institutes of Health \nstudy of violent entertainment and the impacts it may have.\n  Just this week I happened to be passing a television set tuned to the \nMaury Povich show. A mother was expressing her concern about her \ndaughter who was off stage. And they would flip back and forth. The \nmother said she is doing a lot of dangerous things, even saying she \nkilled somebody. The daughter, off stage, hearing this was still \nsmiling. The daughter even acknowledged throwing her own school \nprincipal on the floor.\n\n  That is so bizarre. Some say television won't affect anybody. Well, \nmaybe it won't one time. But what happens when you see this every \nafternoon after school? When certain children who are unhealthy receive \nthese messages, can it distort their view of life? Make them less \npositive, more negative? Less peaceful, more violent? Less committed to \nhonoring rules and civility and decency and order? I suspect that it \ndoes and can and it is not going away.\n  We have a great economy; things are doing well. We are benefiting \nfrom some of the greatest technological achievements in the history of \nthe world. I hope they will continue. It is making life better for us. \nHowever, if we have a danger, it will be that we as a nation will lose \nour way, lose our direction, lose our discipline, our commitment to \norder and peacefulness and cooperation. If we lose that, then \nimprovements in technology that made our life so much better may not be \nable to carry us much further.\n  When talking about how much money we spend on education, what good \ndoes it do to have a $500 textbook if the child won't read that book \nand he has no motivation, no commitment to improve himself or herself \nor the parents are not supportive? You have a state of the art \nclassroom with the finest technology and students are not interested. \nYou talk to teachers and they will say a lot of children in their \nclassrooms are just not interested, they have no thought for what they \nare going to make of their lives in the future.\n  I don't know all of the answers. I know this juvenile violence bill \ndoes not answer all of them. I know this: In America today, if we have \ncriminal activity by young people, this society has to take that \nseriously. Even Doctor Laura tells us that. Everybody knows that. A \nfootball coach knew that. If you are in the Army and you get out of \nstep, they get you back in line. There is punishment; there are \nexpectations of people that we insist on. That is how you have good \nArmy units, good football teams, good classrooms, and good nations.\n  I am concerned with those issues. I think they are fundamental. I \nfeel a burden to think more about it, to pray more about it, and try to \nbe able to contribute effectively to it.\n  We do need to make sure we are doing fundamental things well. One of \nthem is to have a court system that works well. When a young child is \narrested for a serious crime, he should be confronted by a judge and a \nprobation officer and something should be done that is appropriate to \nthat crime. You do not love children and you do not care for them if \nyou blindly allow them to get away with serious wrongdoing. We are \nfailing them when we do that. It is the concept of tough love. If you \nlove children, you cannot have them break into a house and steal \nsomething and be caught and allow nothing to happen to them. That is \nhappening in America today. You talk to your police officers, they are \nhaving to make these arrests. They tell me: Jeff, these kids are \nlaughing at us. We can't do anything to them and they know it.\n\n  Victims often are not even allowed to go into the juvenile centers \nand know what is going on. Their records are not maintained. Judges \nhave no alternatives for punishment or mental health treatment or \ncounseling or drug testing and drug treatment.\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n  We want to improve this system to focus on those young people who are \ngoing astray, to intervene in their lives and, hopefully, create a \nbetter America. It is just a small step. But we have an absolute \nobligation to make sure the moneys we expend are spent wisely and that \nthey affirm the needs of our civilization; that is, the need for order, \nabiding by the law, peacefulness, and not violence.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Brownback for their \nsupport of this amendment. It is a good step in the right direction. We \nare going to have to do more of that as the years go by.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his excellent \nremarks. He has been a major player in this matter from the beginning. \nI really appreciate what he has been doing.\n  I appreciate the cooperation we have had from colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle because this is an important bill. This is going to \nmake a difference as to whether we have, time after time, incidents \nsuch as we had in Littleton, CO, or whether we are going to do \nsomething about it. This bill will do an awful lot about it, although \nnothing is going to stop people who have an emotional disturbance from \nperhaps doing things we cannot contemplate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent with respect to the Brownback \namendment on culture that the amendment be laid aside and no amendments \nto the amendment be in order prior to the vote on or in relation to the \namendment.\n  I further ask consent that Senator Lautenberg be recognized in order \nto offer an amendment regarding gun shows under the same terms as \noutlined above, and the amendment be laid aside, and Senator Craig then \nbe recognized to offer an amendment regarding gun shows, and there be \n90 minutes equally divided for debate on both amendments, under the \nsame terms as outlined above.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the debates the \namendments be laid aside, with votes occurring beginning at 4 p.m., in \nthe order offered, with 5 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes on the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know we have been discussing the \njuvenile justice bill now for several days. I would like to compliment \nthe leadership on both sides of the aisle for trying to move this bill. \nBut this is not about a bill. It is not about an amendment. It is not \nabout money. It is about America's children and how are we going to get \nbehind our children so they are safer in their schools and safer on \ntheir streets.\n  There are two aspects of this bill where I have had a longstanding \npassion. Number one is making sure we have the support services in our \nschools to back up our teachers and help our children. And number two \nis after school so we can provide meaningful, structured activities for \nkids so they will not only have a place to go but a place to benefit \nfrom both learning and character building.\n\n  This is why in this legislation I support the Democratic initiative \nto put more mental health counselors into the schools and also to put \nschool social workers and school nurses into the schools. Our teachers \nare very busy. I hope we pass the 100,000 new teachers initiative, so \nwe have smaller class sizes so our teachers can give more attention to \nour children. But, while our teachers are in the classroom, there are \nother support services that help those children while they are in \nschool.\n  I want to see more school nurses in our schools to help our kids. Mr. \nPresident, a school nurse often provides the early detection and \nwarning for other problems the children have. They know whether our \nchildren need eyeglasses or a hearing aid. Sometimes a child who \ndoesn't have needed eyeglasses is a child headed for trouble out of \nfrustration. It is often the school nurse who begins identifying the \nearly warning signals of emotional problems. Or if a child is under \ntreatment, it is that school nurse who is supervising that the child is \ntaking his or her medication and staying on the medication. This is \nwhat helps our kids.\n  Let me talk about the school social worker. This is not about Freud, \nthis is not about Jung, this is not about in-depth counseling. This is \nmaking sure we know where these children are in terms of some aspects \nof the problems they are having. If a child is referred to a school \nsocial worker, that means the child is teeter-tottering and could go \none way or the other. Often a child comes to school troubled because of \nproblems at home. It could be a mother who has a substance abuse \nproblem. It could be a father who is without a job. A school social \nworker first and foremost listens to the child and helps the family. \nOften it is the school social worker who takes the child in a teeter-\ntotter situation and makes sure they do not go off on the wrong track. \nIt is the school social worker that can get them back on the right \ntrack.\n  These are the kinds of things we want to have in our juvenile justice \nbill. Yes, we need more security. But I tell you, while we are looking \nfor more cops in the schools, let's also get more counselors into the \nschools to be able to help our kids and our teachers.\n  Our children are lonely. Our children are very lonely. Listen to \nthem. They often turn to each other and, as we saw in some communities, \nthey turn on each other. We have to reach out to our children so they \nhave a significant adult they can relate to in their lives. Hopefully, \nit is their parents. That puts you on first base. Hopefully, they can \nrelate to a good teacher. That can put you on second base. But often \nwhat puts you on the third base and brings you home is structured, \nafterschool activities. Our most famous general, Colin Powell, is \ndevoted to these afterschool activities. It is the single most \nimportant prevention program for children. Afterschool can help kids \navoid trouble. Or help them to move on, exercising the great talents \nthey have. I visited the afterschool programs in my community. I even \nhad townhall meetings with children in these communities. It was \nfantastic.\n  You say: What do you like about the afterschool program?\n  They say: At 3 o'clock we leave school and we walk in here and we are \ngreeted with a snack and we are greeted with a smile. Often it could be \na police officer in a PAL Program, a Police Athletic League, or it \ncould be part of the Boys and Girls program. Then they learn. Often \nthey do their homework. They even have computer classes.\n  They are learning. They have activities. Then they move to sports or \nother programs. For the kids who go into sports, it is not only about \nplaying basketball, it is about learning sportsmanship. This is about \ncharacter building, confidence building, and so on. We can do no more \nimportant things than getting behind our teachers, supporting our \nfamilies, and having these services.\n  I hope we do not think our children should be taught in a prison-like \natmosphere. We need to make sure they are safe. Let's have enough \nteachers, enough counselors, and enough support so the schools are not \nonly safe, but our children's learning is sound.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nclose the gun show loophole which allows criminals, mentally deranged, \nand children easy access to firearms.\n  First, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to offer an \namendment at this time, which will be set aside, and then the Craig \namendment will be offered and laid aside. There then will be 90 minutes \nfor debate on both amendments.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I assume, Mr. President, that is equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n        (Purpose: To regulate the sale of firearms at gun shows)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Mr. Schumer, Mrs.\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\n     Boxer, Mr. Kohl, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 331.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIdaho is to be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Lautenberg \namendment that was just offered will be laid aside or should I ask that \nit be laid aside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is the order.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, without objecting, this is simply to \nsend up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To send it up to be read.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be laid aside, and the Senators will \nhave 90 minutes for debate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 332\n\n   (Purpose: To amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, to \npreserve privacy and property rights, prohibit the collection of fees, \n and the retention of information in connection with background checks \n              of law abiding citizens acquiring firearms)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask that the Lautenberg amendment be laid \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 332.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have now offered a gun show amendment \nthat I believe is an important counter to the one just offered by \nSenator Lautenberg. I yield the floor to Senator Lautenberg for the \npresentation of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, and I \nlook forward to the discussion that will ensue, because we are going to \ndecide, with serious debate, whether or not we are going to close this \ngun show loophole which, as demonstrated in this chart, shatters the \nimage of the Brady bill that has been responsible for obstructing gun \npurchases 250,000 times in the years it has been in business.\n  Some of my colleagues are well aware of criminals who have used gun \nshows to purchase guns to kill, maim and destroy the lives of others.\n  I am going to talk about specific examples. Most of my colleagues \nalso know that there are thousands of gun shows across the country each \nyear. Last year, over 4,400 gun shows were advertised in the Gun Show \nCalendar, a trade publication.\n  Ordinarily, these shows are held in public arenas, civic centers, et \ncetera. The gun seller rents a table--it could be a card table or any \nkind of a table--from a gun show promoter to display material for a fee \nranging from $5 to $50. The number of tables at shows vary from as few \nas 50 to as many as 2,000.\n  Fortunately, most of the people who participate in gun shows are law-\nabiding citizens. Many families look forward to a Saturday or a Sunday \nspent at a gun show. But these families are not aware that they may be \nin the presence of dangerous criminals who use gun shows as cash-and-\ncarry convenience stores.\n  I mentioned before there are many criminals who use gun shows as a \nplace to shore up their weaponry to commit mayhem. In 1993, Gian Ferri, \na mentally disturbed man with a grudge against lawyers, used a TEC-DC9 \nto kill eight people and wound six others in a San Francisco law \noffice. He walked in there and started shooting. He bought the gun at a \ngun show.\n  In 1987, Robert Mire escaped from a Florida prison and got his \nweapons at a gun show to launch a lengthy robbery spree. Mire then took \nhis own life when confronted by law enforcement at a Tampa gun show in \n1991.\n  Perhaps the most notorious criminals associated with gun shows are \nTimothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. They used gun shows to raise money \nfor the Oklahoma City bombing episode that took place in 1995.\n  In fact, a recent study by the Department of the Treasury and the \nDepartment of Justice reveals that thousands of firearms from gun shows \nwind up in the hands of criminals. This may be just the tip of the \niceberg. Because many vendors are not required to keep records of their \nsales, there is no way to precisely know how many firearms from gun \nshows wind up in the hands of criminals or the mentally unstable and \nchildren.\n  The threat that gun shows pose for our children became clear with the \nterrible tragedy in Littleton, CO. Although all of the facts are not in \nyet, it appears that a female associate of the killers, Eric Harris and \nDylan Klebold, purchased some of the guns that were used in the attack \nat a gun show. Regrettably, it has become clear to our youth that gun \nshows provide easy access to weapons.\n  How did we get to this point? The problem is a loophole in Federal \ngun laws. The Brady law requires that federally licensed gun dealers \ncomplete a background check and keep certain records when they sell a \nfirearm, whether at a gun store or at a gun show. But many individuals \ncan sell firearms without a license, and they are not required to \nconduct a background check.\n  Since between 25 and 50 percent of the gun sellers at gun shows are \nnot licensed, tens of thousands of firearms are sold at these events \nwith no background checks or recordkeeping. You can just walk into a \ngun show, put down your cash, and walk away with a shotgun, a \nsemiautomatic handgun, or any other deadly weapon you can get your \nhands on. Of course, you can also sell a deadly weapon. If you have \nstolen a gun or are involved in a gun trafficking scheme, gun shows \nprovide an easy opportunity to distribute firearms.\n  While the gun show loophole helps criminals further their deadly \nschemes, it also places federally licensed firearms dealers--people who \nbought a license through the Federal Government and have been checked \nout--at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to the gun shows, \nbecause these guys can just sell it from their table, they can sell it \nfrom the back of their car, and they can sell as many as they want. \nThey do not care who they sell it to, and they do not even have to ask \nthe person's first name. Just give me the cash. I don't know if they \nuse credit cards. Give me the cash and here are the guns you want.\n  When federally licensed firearms dealers participate in a gun show, \nthey have to comply with a background check and recordkeeping \nrequirements of the Brady law. It is so simple but so appropriate.\n  But an unlicensed seller at the next table can make unlimited sales \nto any person who comes up with the cash without any requirements.\n  The ease of these sales drains significant business from the law-\nabiding gun store owners and other licensees and penalizes them for \nfollowing the law. So there are a good many reasons to close the gun \nshow loophole, and there is no excuse not to. We have to act, and act \nnow, to help make our communities safer.\n  The amendment I am proposing would take several simple steps to \nprevent illegal activity at gun shows. First, I point out that this \namendment is very clearly designed for gun shows, the places where \nthese unlicensed dealers sell to anybody they want. Gun shows are \ndefined as an event where two or more people are selling 50 or more \nfirearms. So this amendment does not cover someone who is selling their \nfavorite gun to a friend or a club member or a neighbor.\n  The key provision would require that all gun sales go through a \nfederally licensed firearms dealer. So if the person who is unlicensed \nwants to sell a gun to somebody over here, he then has to include a \nfederally licensed firearms dealer in the process. The federally \nlicensed firearms dealer then would be responsible for conducting a \nBrady check on the purchaser. This ensures that the prohibited \npurchasers--criminals, the insane, and children--cannot buy guns. This \nwill not burden the vast majority of collectors or hunters or sportsmen \nwho want to buy firearms.\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\n  Of course, a gun sale may take a few more minutes, but why not? This \nminor inconvenience is a small cost to pay. And if you do not believe \nthat, ask the 61 percent of the American people who think that the \naccessibility of firearms had a large measure of responsibility in the \nkillings that took place at Columbine High School. This minor \ninconvenience is a small cost to pay when weighed against the need to \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  My amendment would also take other steps to help the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms investigate gun crimes and to help law \nenforcement prosecute criminals.\n  Taken together, these provisions will prevent criminals from abusing \ngun shows to buy deadly weapons. For many Americans, as we note, these \ncommonsense steps seem so obvious. They are probably wondering why we \nhave not addressed this problem sooner. Frankly, I do, too. Well, I \ndon't wonder, because there is an influence around here and around the \nHouse of Representatives that always intervenes when we try to get \ncommonsense legislation in place.\n  We are not taking away guns from people who have a legitimate right \nto buy them. But we are saying that gun violence is an unacceptable \ncondition in our country.\n  In the last 20 years, over 70,000 children have lost their lives--\n70,000 families stricken with grief--because of the availability of a \ngun, obviously, we think, in the hands of the wrong person.\n  I do not want to point any fingers or try to assess blame, but this \nis not the time for partisan politics. This is not the time for \norganizations, such as the NRA, that stand in the way of any sensible, \ncommonsense legislation every time we bring it up--87 percent of the \npeople in a poll just conducted said they want the gun show loophole \nclosed. Why do we have to fight to make it happen?\n  Everybody--every one in this Chamber--ought to stand up and salute it \nand say, yes, we want to save the lives of our kids who are going to \nschool. Do they have the right to bear arms? That is a question, but we \nknow people have a right to bear children. And we think they have a \nright to see these children live safely and that when they go to \nschool, they do not have to worry as much about whether they are going \nto be injured or perhaps even killed than whether they do their \nhomework.\n  Our country has seen too much violence. Every year in this country \nover 4,000 children lose their lives to guns. Every day, 13 kids, on \naverage, are gunned down by a gun, either in their own hand or someone \nelse's. Too many parents have seen their children injured or killed. \nToo many families have been torn apart by grief and anguish as a result \nof the absence in their lives of a child they brought to this world.\n  So, please, let us work together to pass this measure. I plead with \nmy colleagues: Step up to the plate and be people of honor, people of \nconcern. Let's try to prevent future tragedies. Let's make it harder \nfor young people and criminals to gain access to guns.\n  I think we are reaching a consensus on this issue. We are going to \nfind out in a few minutes. There is a broad range of bipartisan support \nfor closing the gun show loophole. Also, there is a broad spectrum of \norganizations that support this amendment.\n  They know that it is going to help fight crime. Law enforcement \nofficials support it. In addition to the Federal agencies that enforce \ngun laws, the Police Executive Research Forum, the Police Foundation, \nthe Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, and the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives have written \nletters of support. I ask unanimous consent that copies of those \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Police Executive Research Forum,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Police Executive Research Forum \n     (PERF)--a national organization of police professionals who \n     are dedicated to improving policing practices through \n     research, debate and leadership--believes that reasonable \n     measures need to be taken to protect our citizens and our \n     children from gun violence. We are currently studying the \n     President's proposed gun legislation and other pending \n     firearms proposals that affect public safety. While we cannot \n     give our position on every amendment that is expected to be \n     offered on the Senate floor this week, PERF has taken a \n     position on a number of the provisions, and supports the \n     goals of the remaining measures.\n       It is estimated that there are 2,000 to 5,000 gun shows \n     annually across the nation that are not subject to federal \n     gun laws. Sales from ``private collections'' can be made at \n     these shows without a waiting period or background check on \n     the purchaser, unless the seller is a licensed Federal \n     Firearm Dealer. To close the loopholes that are exploited by \n     sellers who operate full-fledged businesses, but are not \n     FFLs, we believe the proposed legislation is needed and long \n     overdue. PERF has supported gun show legislation to this \n     effect in the past and will continue to work towards ensuring \n     reasonable measures that will help keep guns out of the hands \n     of criminals.\n       PERF has also been a long-standing proponent of a waiting \n     period that would give local police the opportunity to screen \n     handgun purchasers using local records. PERF members believe \n     that there is also value in a ``cooling-off'' period between \n     the purchase and receipt of a firearm, particularly when \n     there are exceptions for exigent circumstances.\n       We have witnessed again the carnage that results when \n     children have access to firearms. PERF has supported child \n     access prevention bills in the past because we see the horror \n     that can occur when angry and disturbed kids have guns. PERF \n     has supported measures that impose new safety standards on \n     the manufacture and importation of handguns requiring a child \n     resistant trigger standard; a child resistant safety lock; a \n     magazine disconnect safety for pistols; a manual safety; and \n     practice of a drop test. PERF has supported proposals to \n     prohibit the sale of an assault weapon to anyone under age 18 \n     and to increase the criminal penalties for selling a gun to a \n     juvenile.\n       We must do more to keep America's children safe--not just \n     because of recent events--but because of the shootings, \n     accidents and suicide attempts we see with frightening \n     regularity. These proposals are steps in the right direction. \n     We applaud your efforts to help police make our communities \n     safer places to live.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Edward A. Flynn,\n\n                               PERF's Legislative Committee Chair,\n     Arlington (VA) Police Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Police Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The Police Foundation is a private, \n     independent, nonpartisan, and nonprofit organization \n     dedicated to supporting innovation and improvement in \n     policing. Established in 1970, the foundation has conducted \n     seminal research in police behavior, policy, and procedure, \n     and works to transfer to local agencies the best new \n     information about practices for dealing effectively with a \n     wide range of important police operational and administrative \n     concerns. Motivating all of the foundation's efforts is the \n     goal of efficient, humane policing that operates within the \n     framework of democratic principles and the highest ideals of \n     the nation.\n       As a founding member of the Law Enforcement Steering \n     Committee, an unprecedented coalition of the nation's \n     foremost law enforcement organizations, the foundation worked \n     tirelessly for six years for passage of The Brady Law to \n     require a waiting period and a background check prior to the \n     purchase of a handgun. The foundation has also supported \n     efforts and legislation to regulate the sale of armor-\n     piercing ammunition, and the importation, manufacture, and \n     sale of assault weapons, the high-capacity magazines.\n       The reality of policing in America includes dealing with \n     citizens who possess firearms. About 200 million guns are in \n     private hands. So huge is the domestic arsenal that American \n     police must be aware that a firearm may be at hand in any \n     situation they encounter. Tragically, in thousands of \n     situations each year, the potential for injury or death by \n     firearms is realized.\n       In 1994, almost 40,000 Americans died from gunshot wounds. \n     By the year 2003, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, the leading cause of death by injury in the United \n     States will be from gunshots. Yet we regulate guns less than \n     we do other consumer products such as automobiles.\n       The legacy of disability and death that guns, especially \n     handguns, have wrought on American society is of concern to \n     law enforcement personnel, health officials, educators, \n     policy makers, families and communities across America. \n     Today, in the wake of yet another tragic episode of gun \n     violence by high school students, it is incumbent that these \n     same forces join together to formulate rational national \n     policies to address gun violence and children. Every day in \n     America, 13 young people aged 19 and under are killed in gun \n     homicides, suicides, and unintentional shootings, a toll \n     equal to the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado.\n       The Police Foundation, therefore, supports the following \n     amendments to S. 254:\n       (1) An amendment to ban juvenile possession of assault \n     weapons;\n       (2) An amendment that bans juvenile possession of high-\n     capacity ammunition clips;\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n       (3) A ban on the importation of high-capacity ammunition \n     clips;\n       (4) An amendment that requires that no guns are sold at gun \n     shows without a background check, a waiting period, and \n     appropriate documentation;\n       (5) An amendment requiring anyone offering guns for sale \n     over the Internet to possess a federal firearms license and \n     to oversee all resulting firearms transactions;\n       (6) An amendment that will provide: enhanced tools for the \n     prosecution of firearms laws, including substantially \n     increasing the scope of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \n     Firearms' youth gun tracing program; additional resources to \n     investigate and prosecute violations of Federal firearms \n     laws; and resources for increased federal and state \n     coordination of gun prosecutions.\n       (7) An amendment raising the minimum age to 21 for \n     possession of handguns, semi-automatic assault weapons, and \n     large-capacity ammunition feeding devices.\n       (8) An amendment that requires the sale of child safety \n     locks with every handgun sold;\n       (9) An amendment to reinstate a permanent, mandatory \n     national waiting period prior to the purchase of a handgun.\n       (10) An amendment to limit handgun purchases to one per \n     month.\n       The Police Foundation is committed to working with you and \n     your colleagues in the Congress in supporting and enacting \n     sensible gun control measures that protect all Americans and \n     most especially our children.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Hubert Williams.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Hispanic American Police\n\n\n                                 Command Officers Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 1999.\n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, HAPCOA \n     to express our general support for the eight gun control \n     amendments that are expected to be offered on the Senate \n     floor this week. HAPCOA also supports President Clinton's \n     legislation. The 1999 Gun Enforcement and Accountability Act. \n     Both of these measures are designed to reduce child criminal \n     access to firearms.\n       HAPCOA represents of 1,500 command law enforcement officers \n     and affiliates from municipal police departments, county \n     sheriffs, and state agencies, to the DEA, U.S. Marshals \n     Service, FBI, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Park Police and other \n     federal agencies and organizations.\n       As a law enforcement association, we know only too well the \n     impact gun violence has on Communities. As with all law \n     enforcement officers, we too live in the communities. We have \n     witnessed first hand what happens when children and criminals \n     have too easy access to guns. Today, in every city in our \n     country, there are children in schools and homes with hand \n     guns. Children who are expressed to Violence on a daily \n     basis, children who feel they need protection--more than they \n     need an education. Children who should be enjoying life--\n     rather than taking a life.\n       We place profound responsibilities on our nation's police \n     officers asking them to combat Crimes, uphold the law, and \n     defend the lives of others while continually risking their \n     own. We trust the police to keep our homes, schools and \n     neighborhoods safe from crime. Police officers cannot achieve \n     these and other goals without legislation that supports their \n     work.\n       These eight proposed amendments would do that--help law \n     enforcement officials in their efforts to reduce gun related \n     crimes. It is time to break the cycle of gun violence in \n     America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jess Quintero,\n     National Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Organization of\n\n\n                             Black Law Enforcement Executives,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Rod R. Blagojevich,\n     House of Representatives, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Blagojevich: This is to advise you that \n     National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives \n     (NOBLE) representing over 3000 black law enforcement \n     managers, executives, and practitioners strongly supports \n     your effort to provide a permanent legislative mandate (S. \n     443) to promote the fair, safe, and reasonable regulation of \n     gun shows.\n       As the threat of violence against the police and citizens \n     alike has escalated, so has NOBLE'S commitment to the passage \n     of effective gun control legislation. The potential threat \n     posed to our members and to law enforcement personnel \n     nationwide by the unregulated selling of firearms demands \n     that S. 443 be enacted. Your efforts to bring fairness and \n     accountability to gun shows by holding all participants to \n     the same standards is commended and supported by NOBLE.\n       If our organization can be of further assistance on this \n     matter, please call me.\n           Sincerely\n                                                Robert L. Stewart,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have also received support, surprisingly--and I \nsay, hooray--from some in the gun industry. The American Shooting \nSports Council, which represents the interests of gun manufacturers, \nand the National Shooting Sports Foundation have both endorsed my \nlegislation. They say, ``Support the amendment that is proposed closing \nthe gun show loophole.''\n  The National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers, the trade association \nfor gun dealers, has endorsed this legislation. I would like to read \npart of their letter:\n\n       While it is uncommon for our organization to endorse \n     legislation that would place any new regulations upon the \n     sale of guns, we view the case of gun shows as an exception.\n       As your legislation creates no new requirements or \n     regulations that don't already exist for law-abiding gun \n     owners, we find it a reasonable and necessary change to \n     existing laws and fully endorse the gun shows accountability \n     act.\n\n  It is a letter that they sent to me.\n  There are prominent Republican politicians--this isn't exclusively a \nDemocratic matter--who support closing the gun show loophole, for \ninstance, Texas Governor George W. Bush, a prominent name in national \npolitics, as well as the Governor of one of the largest States in this \ncountry. Congressman Henry Hyde, a distinguished, respectable \nCongressman--he has always been a supporter of gun ownership--supports \neliminating the gun show loophole.\n  The amendment is also supported by Jim and Sarah Brady's Handgun \nControl, Incorporated, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which \nrepresents a number of health, religious and civil rights \norganizations.\n  When Sarah Brady, George W. Bush, Henry Hyde, gun manufacturers and \ngun dealers get behind closing a loophole, I think everybody here ought \nto listen, and we ought to close it. We ought to close that loophole, \nbecause what happens in that loophole is children fall through it, and \nlives, way too early, are permanently maimed as a result.\n  All you have to do is remember a picture of the boy jumping out of \nthe window at Columbine High and see what has happened to him. He is \ndamaged, severely damaged. It looks as if those damages are going to \nlast all of his life, impairing his speech, his ability to walk, and so \nforth.\n  Americans are tired of it. They are tired of losing those lives to \ngun violence. Again, I do not understand why the opposition is trying \nto say, no, let's leave the loophole there. Let's make sure that we \ndon't inhibit those purchases of guns by anybody who just wants to buy \nthem.\n  I do not understand it. I am sure the American people, whether they \nare here or watching television and seeing what is going on, don't want \nto have that loophole continue to exist.\n  Every year we lose 34,000 Americans to gunfire. It is the number of \ndeaths that we would expect to see in a war. In Vietnam, a terrible, \nterrible period in American history, we lost 58,000 people in the 11 \nyears of that war. Here we see more than half of that number lost every \nyear. When will the public's rage finally reach into this place and say \nwe have had enough? Instead, there is a war going on in our \ncommunities. We have to stop this senseless slaughter.\n  Every day, 13 young lives end prematurely. The hopes and the dreams \nof 13 children, their families, their friends are destroyed.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this step with all of us holding \ntogether in the battle against gun violence. Let those who want to \noppose this legislation think about what they would say to a neighbor \nor a friend or someone in their community who lost a child: Well, he \nhad the right to bear arms, or guns don't kill, people kill.\n  They always blame it on the criminal. But for a lot of people, the \nfirst time they commit a crime is when they pull the trigger on that \nweapon.\n  I hope we are going to pass this amendment, make it harder for \ncriminals and children to get guns. We might not stop all the \nshootings, but we may stop some. I hope that the American people will \nnotice everybody who votes for and against this amendment or what they \ntry to do to water it down, to leave a glaring loophole sitting there.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the Senator from New York 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\nvery much. I also thank my friend, the Senator from Idaho, for his \ngraciousness in letting me take the floor right now.\n  Let me say, as somebody who has been involved in this issue for a \nlong time, today is a very crucial day in our fight to bring \nrationality to the laws that relate to guns in America. It is the first \ntime we have had a real opportunity to make progress since the Brady \nlaw was passed.\n  All we are trying to do here is make sure that Brady continues to \nwork. The bottom line is a simple one; that is, as Brady has begun to \nwork, the vast majority of Americans, gun owners and nongun owners, \nhave abided by this law. Almost everybody believes it has worked, but \nthose who wish to avoid the law have found loopholes--the Internet, \nwhich we will be dealing with later, an amendment I will propose, and \nmost notably, gun shows, which the Senator from New Jersey has \nhighlighted. I am proud to be his lead cosponsor of that legislation we \nhave worked on.\n  The problem we face in the law when we try to make laws on gun \ncontrols is we are always ruled by the least common denominator. If 99 \npercent of the people obey the law, but 1 percent finds a loophole, \nthen all the criminal element and everybody who wants to give guns to \nchildren, to criminals, to the mentally incompetent will use that \nloophole. So all the rest of the laws do no good.\n  They say there are 40,000 laws on the books about gun control. But as \nlong as you have a weak link in the chain, it is exploited, and we \nsuffer. In my city, 95 percent of the guns that are used in crimes come \nfrom out of State, many of them from gun shows. Gun shows have \nproliferated as the loophole has become more obvious and more known to \npeople.\n  I plead with my colleagues--it is so important for us to continue the \nwork of Brady. We are not seeking to go further in the area of gun \ncontrol. We are simply trying to keep the status quo by plugging the \nloopholes that have allowed people to get around the Brady law which \nmost people regard as very, very successful.\n  I know that my friend, the Senator from Idaho, has an amendment to \nmake it voluntary. The problem with that is very simple, in my \njudgment. Again, it would not work because it is the least common \ndenominator. If you go to a gun show and nine of the sellers of guns \nare using the instant check system and one isn't, anyone who evades the \nlaw will go to that one. All the other nine law-abiding people will \nboth lose business and not be able to stop it. So making these laws \nvoluntary, you may as well not make them at all, because those who wish \nto avoid the law will go to the one person who doesn't participate in \nthe system and send a cascade of guns forward.\n  I am proud of this debate, Mr. President. First, I am proud that its \ntone is one of constructiveness in the light of Littleton, CO. Each of \nus is groping to see what can be done. We have differences of opinion, \nbut there is respect in the debate.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho. When he added his amendment, he did \nnot come up with an amendment that was a subterfuge. He did not come up \nwith an amendment that simply diverted the issue, as we have seen time \nand time again. He came up with an amendment that would allow us to \ndebate this issue foursquare.\n  It is very simple. If you believe in closing the gun show loophole, \nyou have to vote yes on the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. \nIf you vote no on that, the loophole will continue, because no matter \nhow many people voluntarily comply at gun shows, those who wish to \nviolate the law or turn the other way, as the law is violated, will \ncontinue to do so.\n  This is an important crossroads in our debate. Just as in warfare \nthere is defensive and offensive warfare and some move forward and then \nnew mechanisms are found to get around those who move forward, we are \nat that point right now. If we allow people who wish to get around the \nBrady law and sell guns to criminals and sell guns to children and sell \nguns to the mentally incompetent, to use gun shows or use the Internet \nor any other way to get around it, we will have taken a dramatic step \nbackwards. I believe the Brady law has in good part contributed to the \ndecline in gun violence throughout America. Has it made it certain; has \nit made it so that there is no gun violence? Of course not. But why is \nit that gun violence has plummeted even more than other crimes since \nthe Brady law has been passed?\n  The best explanation is that, yes, it works. The best explanation is \nthat despite the doom and gloom, when we debated Brady, from the \nopponents, it has not interfered with the rights of the legitimate gun \nowner. I ask my colleagues, if you believe in keeping Brady sound--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator, and I thank the Chair.\n  If you believe in keeping Brady sound, if you believe that we can \nsave lives without impinging on the rights of legitimate gun owners, \nthen the only vote you can cast is yes on the Lautenberg amendment. Any \nother vote will not do the job.\n  This is a modest but important first step that will continue to \nreduce the number of deaths caused by firearms without impinging on the \nrights of those who believe they need them. I thank the Senator, and I \nthank the Senator from Idaho, again, for his graciousness.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 332\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I hope that those of our colleagues who are \nnot on the floor this afternoon will take time to watch this debate and \nlisten on television, because today we have very clear comparatives of \nsomething that works, that lessens the impact of Government, lessens \nthe creation of a bureaucracy, and something that doesn't work which \ncreates a very large bureaucracy against a substantial American pastime \nand an American business activity in this country. We are talking about \ngun shows. Some 5,000 gun shows across America are attended today by \nbetween 4.5 million and 5 million people annually. They are not in some \nback room or in some dark alley creating the environment for \nclandestine meetings between criminals. They are at fairgrounds, large \nconvention centers and hotel lobbies. They are something that many \nAmericans attend today because most Americans who attend gun shows are \nlegitimate law-abiding citizens who have disposable income and wish to \ncollect firearms as something they do in their pastime. Those are the \ntrue dynamics of a gun show.\n  Let me read to you what the President of the United States --and I am \nafraid what my colleagues have tried to generate this afternoon is that \nit may be some evil activity. This is a radio message from the \nPresident of the United States, November 7, 1998, speaking of gun \nshows.\n\n       . . . illegal arms, bazaars for criminals, and gun \n     traffickers looking to buy and sell guns on a cash-and-carry/\n     no-questions-asked basis, entirely without background checks.\n\n  That is the rhetoric that has imbued this issue and came up with this \nneat little quick phrase called a ``loophole.'' That is the basis from \nwhich we come this afternoon to this debate. Five million people are \nclandestine criminals going to gun bazaars across this Nation? Five \nmillion? I doubt that very much.\n  In fact, the National Institute of Justice, which is an arm of the \nJustice Department of this administration, said this about gun shows:\n\n       Less than 2 percent of the guns used by criminals may have \n     come from gun shows.\n\n  Less than 2 percent. So those are the dynamics and the realities of \nthis debate. I don't know how you paint it any other way, except by \nusing bright red and black paint, because other than that, you have to \ndeal with the truth and the facts at hand.\n  What is this great loophole that my colleagues are talking about at \nthis time? The loophole, they would have you believe, happens to be the \nFederal law. That law is a very straightforward\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\nlaw. That law of several years ago defines what a gun dealer is and \nwhat a gun dealer isn't. It is the Gun Control Act of 1968 and the \nFirearm Owners Act of 1986. In there it is clearly defined what a gun \ndealer is and what a gun dealer isn't and, most importantly, what a \nprivate citizen is allowed to engage in in an occasional sale or \nexchange or purchase of a firearm for the enhancement of a \npersonal collection, or for a hobby and/or to sell all or part of a \npersonal collection of firearms within their State of residence without \nobtaining a dealer's license.\n\n  What the Senator from New Jersey has not talked about are the laws \nthat govern gun shows. Mr. President, 98 percent of those who are there \nare dealers licensed under Federal law who must keep records and have \nthose records inspected by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. \nThat wasn't mentioned. Maybe it was simply forgotten. But there is no \nquestion, the Senator from New Jersey is right; there are private \ncitizens who come to gun shows and engage in discussions with other \nprivate citizens and decide to buy or sell their gun or guns. Is that a \nloophole? No. It is provided for in the 1986 law. It is something this \nCongress has already decided is right and proper to do as a private \ncitizen--to engage in the sale of his or her private property. And we \nhave been very clear in tightening it up so they could not get beyond \nthe law. But we have also talked about legitimate collectors, and they \nare very definable within the law.\n  But what is important is that we make sure can clarify even the 2 \npercent. My amendment works to do that. There are people who collect \nguns, and now and then want to sell more than just one or two of their \nguns. Guess where they would go. They would probably go to a gun show \nwhere there are a lot of people who are interested in guns. And we \nwould say in my amendment that we would allow them a special license \ncategory, that they could become a licensed gun dealer for a short \nperiod of time for either the sale of their guns, or for gunsmithing, \nor for a firearm repair business. This would be a new category of \nlicense in the Federal law.\n  This term of ``engage in business'' would not necessarily fit because \nthey were not businesspeople. They didn't make their living from the \nsale of firearms or firearm equipment or gun cleaning equipment or \nloading equipment or all of those kinds of things that are the hobbies \nof millions of Americans. But we recognize that we ought to give them a \ncategory, and in that category, in selling their guns, they would be \nrequired to keep records. They would be required to keep records, and \nthey could keep them at their homes. Those records must be available \nfor inspection by the ATF because they don't have a business.\n  Remember, those in business keep copious Federal records, and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms can inspect them at any time. \nPeople who are involved in the sale of guns, and certainly in the \nimportation of guns, all of those kinds of things today, under the 1968 \nand 1986 laws, are clearly well defined and controlled. But we are \nsaying in these special instances we want to make sure these people do \nit right.\n  Now, this is more than just to protect the person who purchases; we \nwant to protect the person who sells, because if that gun were to end \nup being used by a criminal in a criminal act, and an independent \nperson sold it, they could be liable under local law, under State law, \nunder Federal law. Remember, there are 40,000 gun laws in America \ntoday--city, State, county and Federal laws--40,000 gun laws. I would \nlike to adjust it a little, and the Senator from New Jersey wants to \nadd one more so that we would have 40,001.\n  We also do something else. We spent a lot of time with Brady, and out \nof Brady we came up with the national instant check system. We created \na large computerized system by which when a gun dealer sells a gun, he \ncan check the background of an individual to see whether he or she is a \nconvicted felon, or if they have some adjudication against their \npersonality that would cause them not to be able to own a gun. We will \ncreate a special class of register to be at a gun show so that people \nengaged in the legal, private sale of guns under Federal law can go to \nthat person and say: I have this individual who wants to buy one of my \nguns. Here is his or her Social Security number. Run it through your \nsystem.\n\n  Now, what does it do if you comply with these two areas? It creates a \nsafe haven against liability because you have been within the law. But \nwhat the Senator from New Jersey didn't say is that if you sell to \nminors at a gun show, you are breaking the law. If your sale at a gun \nshow went to a felon and it is proven, you are breaking the law. I am \ntalking about private citizens. It is as if he suggested that gun shows \nare big black holes that criminals congregate in because they can \ntraffic in illegal gun sales. That is false, Mr. President. I don't \nknow of any other way to say it more clearly and abruptly in order to \ncatch the ear of my colleagues. It is not true, and there is no \nloophole, unless the Senator from New Jersey wants to say that the laws \nhe voted for are loopholes.\n  I doubt that he would want to do that, because I think at least he \nwas here for the passage of one of those laws. I can't honestly tell \nyou whether he voted for or against it. But it did restrict the rights \nand activities of individuals as they relate to guns. My guess is that \nhe did. But I will let him speak to that issue.\n  What we are talking about here is continuing to shape and refine the \ngun laws--all 40,000 of them.\n  If my amendment passes, and we create a special new license for a \ntemporary person, or if we create a registrant for gun shows so that \nprivate sales can have a background check, under either of the new \nlicense or the special registrant, which would be optional--I don't \nargue that because I don't want to infringe on the right of private \ncitizens under the 1986 law; congress has already spoken to that--it \nwould provide a very clear incentive to individuals to participate as I \nhave suggested.\n  Why? Because, as I have mentioned, if the firearm was later used \nillegally and caused harm, they would be immune from the civil \nliabilities of that action, except for a lawsuit based on negligent \nentrustment, or the negligence per se. That you will never get away \nfrom, nor should you.\n  So I think therein lies the difference.\n  Let me talk to one other thing about my colleague's amendment that \nconcerns me a great deal.\n  On page 4 of his amendment he tries to define what a gun show is. I \nmust tell you, very frankly, it demonstrates to me that he doesn't \nunderstand collectors, and hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \nAmericans who own well more than 50 guns, from antique, Civil War \nweapons to World War II and World War I weapons, Revolutionary War \nweapons, are collectors. It doesn't define any of them; it just says 50 \nfirearms or more.\n\n  What it says to me is that he has suggested by his law that he is \ngoing to move from about 35,000 gun shows a year to hundreds of \nthousands of gun shows.\n  What do I mean by that?\n  If two collectors happen to get together and they happen to own more \nthan 50 guns, and they decide to trade a gun or sell a gun between \nthemselves, they are in violation of the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I think we have to be careful of that, because it says, ``at which \ntwo or more persons are offering or exhibiting one or more firearms for \nsale, transfer, or exchange.'' I know the law, or at least I know this \nlanguage. I know that when ATF gets through interpreting it, it won't \nbe any narrower than this; it will be considerably broader.\n  What about a gun show promoter?\n  Is that Marriott Corporation, which happens to be housing the gun \nshow for participants next to the convention center, which has a sign \nup: Gun show participants, come stay at the Marriott, promoting the gun \nshow? I think they would be, by definition of the Lautenberg law.\n  In other words, what I am asking my colleagues today to do is to read \nthe fine print--which is really not so fine at all--for the term ``gun \nshow vendor.''\n  What I am suggesting is, we don't change the law, that we strengthen \nthe law at hand, that we give some options to the private individual, \nwho still should have the right as a private citizen to sell his or her \nguns to other private citizens if those actions do not fall within \nFederal law where they are\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\n businesspeople making a profit and are not therefore licensed dealers \nunder the law.\n  It was interesting when the Senator from New Jersey quoted Handgun \nControl. They got involved in this issue, and they cranked up \nAmericans, talking about this issue some time ago. They talked about \n``unlicensed dealers.'' But, all of a sudden, they found out they \ncouldn't use that term, because all of the dealers are licensed by \ndefinition of the Federal law. They had to back off.\n  In other words, they were more interested in the political impact \nthan the legality and the correctness of their debate, and how tragic \nthat is. So they backed away from that. But they kept the term \n``loophole,'' because somehow it conjures up this idea of this dark \nescape hatch through which criminals pass. That is not the case. It is \nnot the case in 5,000 legitimate, publicly promoted gun shows which \nnearly 5 million Americans attend annually in city parks, in legitimate \nhotels, in State convention centers, and in State fairgrounds around \nthis country.\n  My amendment and the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey are \ndistinctly different. We honor the right of the private citizen. But we \ngive that private citizen options to protect themselves and to access \nthe information system that the taxpayers of this country have spent \nmillions and millions of dollars building so we could have an instant \nbackground check to make sure guns didn't get into the hands of \nconvicted felons or other citizens who have adjudicated problems.\n  I have supported that and have strongly fought for it, even though \nthis administration was dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st \ncentury of computer background checks because they wanted the right of \ncontrol.\n\n  Therein lies the ultimate difference between these two pieces of \nlegislation.\n  I hope in the course of the debate we can hear a much clearer \ndefinition of what a gun show is, because now I have a lot of friends. \nIf I walk into their home and they discuss the idea of trading a gun or \nselling a gun to me, I might be in a gun show, and that citizen and I \nwould be engaged in an illegal act. Yet, up until now, that would have \nbeen a legal act, because of the right of the private nondealer citizen \nto engage in those kinds of activities.\n  There is no loophole. It is only in the minds of those who see guns \nto be the evil instead of the problems that citizens have either \nabiding by the law or dealing with their own frustrations.\n  We have offered a clear alternative, and I think an appropriate \nalternative, to deal with the question of the 2 percent of sales at gun \nshows that may on some occasions find themselves in the hands of \ncriminals where that gun was used in illegal activity. Therein lies the \ndifference.\n  I hope it is clear to my colleagues, the importance of sustaining the \ngun laws we have and guaranteeing that private citizens have the right \nto engage in gun sales from their private collections and their private \nownership, on a limited basis, clearly described by the law, without \nhaving to become a federally-licensed firearms dealer, as many would \ncare not to be.\n  I retain the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I want to tell those following this debate that you are never going \nto have a clearer choice than between the Lautenberg amendment and the \nCraig amendment. The Lautenberg amendment closes down the loophole that \nallows people to sell lethal weapons at a gun show--what they call \n``private sales''-- without a background check. The Craig alternative \nmakes it permissible.\n  What does that mean? It means if you want to get involved in a \nbackground check for sale at a gun show, you may. You may. How many \nlaws do we write across America where you say ``you may'' observe the \nspeed limit, ``you may'' observe the law when it comes to the sale of \ndrugs, ``you may'' observe the law when it comes to treason against the \nUnited States? No. If a law is going to work, a law has to be sensible \nand enforceable.\n  The Craig amendment is neither. It is neither sensible nor \nenforceable, because not only does it ignore the reality of the horror \nthat is coming out of schools in America but it ignores the reality \nthat at gun shows across America people are buying weapons without a \nbackground check and using them in the commission of crime.\n  This is not my observation, it is the observation of the Department \nof Treasury, the Department of Justice, and ATF, and other researchers \nwho reviewed 314 recent investigations involving gun shows across \nAmerica. Their findings are chilling. Felons, although prohibited under \nthe Brady law from buying firearms, have been able to purchase guns at \ngun shows. In fact, felons buying or selling firearms were involved in \nmore than 46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows.\n  There are plenty of gun shows in my home State of Illinois. Most of \nthe people who attend are law abiding. Most of them follow the law and \nare glad to do it. Clearly, the criminal element is using this gun show \nas a way to launder weapons and purchase them when they can't buy them \nfrom a licensed dealer.\n  Mr. Craig would suggest the people attending gun shows are much like \nthose who come around to buy and sell baseball cards. There is a big \ndifference. Of course, what you are buying and selling at a gun show is \na lethal weapon.\n  Senator Lautenberg is trying to close down a loophole which is a \nloophole for criminals. Why the National Rifle Association--which \ncontinues to say it is just defending the rights of hunters and \nsportsmen across America who want to use guns safely and legally--would \ncome in with the Craig amendment in an attempt to undermine Senator \nLautenberg's amendment is beyond me.\n  That is not all that is in the Craig amendment. Read on, my friends, \nbecause he proceeds in this amendment to provide immunity from civil \nliability for those who would ask for a special license at a gun show. \nThere are only two groups in America who can't be sued now--diplomats \nand some health insurance companies--and we are debating that \nparticular element. And now the Senator from Idaho says we should also \ninclude in the group of Americans who cannot be held accountable in \ncourt those who want to sell guns at a gun show.\n  The last point I want to make is this: As they poured through the \nrecords to try to figure out how these two children in Littleton, CO, \ncame up with two sawed-off shotguns and other weapons, they were \nstymied because there were no records; they couldn't trace them. They \nwere trying to figure out where they came from. Senator Craig's \namendment would mandate that we destroy records about the sale of \nfirearms, records that law enforcement needs to try to figure out when \nguns are stolen and used in the course of crime.\n  I can't believe any gun owner, who as I do opposes the gun crimes \nacross America, is going to stand up and defend what Mr. Craig is \narguing for. Senator Lautenberg's amendment is clear and concise and \nhits the points in this loophole that many criminals are using to come \ninto possession of guns which they are using to menace Americans and \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nhis continued leadership on sensible gun laws. That is what we are \ntalking about here: closing a loophole that is leading to trouble, that \nis leading to death. We have a chance to close the loophole. That is \nall the Lautenberg amendment does.\n  Good people go to gun shows but not all gun shows are good. Let me \nread from an associated press article:\n\n       Undercover state [this is California] agents found illegal \n     weapons so plentiful at a Los Angeles County gun show that \n     they ran out of money after shopping at a handful of booths.\n       The weapons included rocket launchers and flame throwers, \n     Attorney General Bill Lockyer said. . . .\n       They were readily available, all sorts of illegal weapons.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I don't know what hunter needs a flame thrower.\n\n  I have to say to my friend from Idaho, if we followed his \nleadership--\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nand the Senator from Illinois has pointed out the flaws in his \namendment--we would be saying something we don't say to any other \nindustry.\n  Let me explain what I mean. We have standards for cars. They have to \nhave brakes, they have to have wipers, they have to have seatbelts. But \nguess what. If you sell them at a ``car show,'' as opposed to a ``car \ndealership,'' they don't need to meet any of the standards and you can \nsell a car to someone who hasn't got a license because none of the laws \nwould apply.\n  You could do that with pharmaceuticals. The FDA approves a \npharmaceutical and says it has to contain certain elements, that is \nwhat they approve, but if you sell it at a ``pharmaceutical show'' you \ndon't have to have any of those elements.\n  We could do the same thing for industry after industry.\n  There are more standards for toy guns in this country than there are \nfor real guns, but even toy guns have to meet certain standards if they \nare sold at a toy show--the same laws apply.\n  To make the law voluntary, as my friend from Idaho does, makes no \nsense at all. It exacerbates a problem that is already a serious \nproblem.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is saying people are dying unnecessarily \nfrom gun violence. There are people getting guns, getting their hands \non guns at gun shows who couldn't do it if they went to a licensed \ndealer. Why on Earth would anyone in this Senate want to condone that--\nno background checks at a gun show, nothing?\n  All the Senator from Idaho is saying is make it voluntary. That is \nnot going to fly. The bad people who want to get away with it aren't \ngoing to say: Do a background check on me; you might find out I'm a \nfelon. They will say: No, I don't want to comply.\n  I thank my friend, the Senator from New Jersey, for this intelligent \namendment.\n  I point out to my colleagues who may be following this debate, and I \nknow we vote our conscience here, 87 percent of the American people \nsupport a background check on a gun buyer at a gun show--87 percent of \nthe people; 83 percent support requiring background checks on gun show \nbuyers, including dealers.\n  The bottom line is people want us to take action. The people don't \nlike the fact that thousands of people a year die from gunshot wounds. \nWe can stop it.\n  This is a good amendment. I hope we will support it and defeat the \nCraig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, while the Senator from California is on the floor, I \nthink it is important we understand the facts about which she talks. \nShe is referencing a recent gun show in California where State justice \ndepartment agents were involved. What she did not say is that every \nprivate sale in California, by State law, must be run through the \ndepartment of justice background check. In other words, the very thing \nthat she wants is now available in California but doesn't work.\n  What is wrong? Why didn't it work? I guess she will have to answer \nthat question. I am not sure. She is saying she wants what the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is offering, but they have it in California as State \nlaw and it doesn't work.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will allow the Senator to debate this on her own time.\n  It is important we keep the record very clear. She said there are no \nbackground checks at gun shows. Only 98 percent of the transactions are \nbackground checked. She cannot come to the floor and make a broad \nstatement that says there are no background checks. That is within \nitself a clearly false statement.\n  In the State of California, the very gun show where there were found \nto be some violations of State law--and probably Federal law--somehow \nthe State of California can't control it, either. Or should they? \nTherein lies the question.\n  In the case of my legislation, private transactions would be given \nthe opportunity of sanctuary, and it would be a tremendous incentive. I \nthink what we need to do here is create incentives. In the State of \nCalifornia there are no incentives; there are mandatory laws, and \napparently those laws were broken, at least in some instances.\n  It is important the record show that it was instances of probably \nless than 2 percent. It is important the record show that well over 98 \npercent of sales at gun shows--not by ATF but by the Justice \nDepartment's own figures--are background checked. Those are the facts. \nThey shouldn't be just intentionally generated for this debate. They \ncome from the Justice Department itself.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is my understanding that time not \nin a quorum call is divided equally. If we want to stand here silently \nso that their rebuttal time is reserved for the Senator from Idaho, we \nare not going to do that; we will wile it away.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Idaho yield himself \ntime?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield myself time. I want to make a correction to one of \nthe statements I made just a minute ago. Because I insist others use \nright figures, I must use the same rules. I said 98 percent. I am \nwrong. It is about a 60-40 percent relationship at gun shows; about 60 \npercent are sold by licensed firearm dealers that require background \nchecks. By the estimation of ATF and the Justice Department, there \nappears to be about 40 percent of sales that are private by definition \nof the law. That is a much more accurate statement than the one I just \nmade. But it is clear the State of California does have a law that \nrequires all private sales, all transactions, to be subject to \nbackground check.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 10 minutes and \n39 seconds. The Senator from Idaho has 23 minutes and 9 seconds. If \nneither side yields time, time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator from Idaho yield some time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee such time as he requires.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the proposal, the Democratic proposal to \nheavily regulate firearms at gun shows, while well intentioned, is an \nexample of regulatory overkill.\n  First, the proposal would require a law-abiding gun show organizer to \nnotify Federal and State law enforcement prior to holding a gun show, \nand require substantial recordkeeping and reporting before and after \nthe show. But gun shows are not conducted in a secret black market. \nThey are publicly advertised for weeks in advance in order to generate \npublic participation.\n  Second, the proposal would require individuals to sell through a \nlicensed dealer in order to obtain the background check and other \ninformation. While obtaining a background check is a laudable goal, \nrequiring an individual to pay a dealer for the service could be cost \nprohibitive to a lawful business transaction. So that is a matter of \ngreat concern.\n  The Republican proposal provides for a ``special registrant'' at a \ngun show that any nonlicensed seller can use to conduct a background \ncheck on the instant check system. This cost-effective mechanism will \nprevent any unlawful sales without unduly burdening a lawful \ntransaction with regulatory costs. Thus, I must oppose the amendment to \nheavily regulate gun shows because it is overly burdensome on law-\nabiding sellers.\n  I strongly support the amendment filed by my colleague, Senator \nCraig, which will provide for increased safety and licensing of firearm \nsales at gun shows. This amendment contains several provisions that \nwill make it more difficult for criminals to purchase firearms at gun \nshows, but this amendment allows law-abiding citizens to continue to \nbuy and sell legal products.\n  First, the Craig amendment will provide for ``special registrants,'' \nwho may conduct background checks for individual sellers at a gun show \nusing the instant check system. These checks will prevent criminals \nfrom purchasing a firearm from another individual, an unlicensed seller \nat a gun show. It will also provide an inexpensive and efficient means \nto facilitate the lawful\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nsale of a firearm by one individual to another.\n  Second, this amendment will provide for special licenses for persons \nwho want to buy and sell guns primarily or solely at gun shows. This \nwill allow occasional sellers, such as gunsmiths, to avoid the expense \nand regulation of becoming full-fledged Federal firearms licensees.\n  Third, the Craig amendment will prohibit Federal and State law \nenforcement officials from charging a fee to conduct a background check \non the instant check system. This would reduce the cost of criminal \nbackground checks to individuals.\n  Fourth, the Craig amendment would encourage the use of the instant \ncheck system by granting civil liability protection to those who use it \nat gun shows. Given the litigation climate we are currently \nexperiencing, this will be a strong incentive to use the ``special \nregistrant'' provision of this amendment.\n  In short, this amendment will promote background checks on sales by \nnonlicensed individuals at gun shows without an undue financial burden. \nIt will prevent crime without punishing law-abiding citizens. So, \naccordingly, I do believe this amendment deserves support.\n  I respect the distinguished Senator from Idaho. In fact, I respect \nboth Senators on the Democrat side and the Senator from Idaho for \ntrying to resolve these difficult problems. But I do believe that the \namendment of the Senator from Idaho resolves this problem in a more \nfair and reasonable manner while accomplishing just as much as the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey is trying to do with his \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If nobody yields time, time \nwill be charged equally by the Chair.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since we have had the measure on the \njuvenile crime bill before us, this is really the first opportunity we \nhave had to deal with one of the compelling aspects of reducing \nviolence, not only in our schools but in our communities. We are \ntalking about youth violence. We have had debate and discussion on how \nwe can help schools, how we can help parents, and how we can help \nteachers. We have also considered, under the Leahy proposal, a series \nof different strategies to effectively use law enforcement to reduce \nviolence.\n  Now, we really begin the debate about the proliferation and \navailability of guns in our society. There are many who choose not to \ntalk about this particular issue, but, hopefully, we will have an \nopportunity to debate and have votes. We will find out who in this body \nis serious about trying to reduce the availability and accessibility of \nguns whose only purpose is not for hunting, but for killing and maiming \nindividuals.\n  It is particularly important that we have this discussion about \nchildren. Every single day, 13 children die because of the use of \nguns--almost the equivalent of Littleton, every single day. We know \nthat when we reduce the availability and accessibility of guns, it \nextends children's lives and the lives of others.\n  I have just a few moments now. I will, later in the course of the \ndebate, clearly demonstrate, how the United States compares to other \ncountries in terms of the incidence of violence and the incidence of \nviolence and the utilization of guns.\n  One of the most extraordinary examples we have seen in recent times \nis what has happened in my own city of Boston. But before discussing \nBoston's success, I think it is important to understand the weakness of \nthe Craig proposal. This proposal fails to meet the minimum standards \nof doing anything about guns because, as has been pointed out, this is \na completely voluntary program. Those who are not interested in \nparticipating, will not participate in the program. It fails to meet \nthe minimum standard of responsibility in dealing with the loophole \nwhich the Senator from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, has identified.\n  If we are going to do something about gun shows, the Lautenberg \namendment is the way to do it. I think any fair reading or listening to \nthe debate will reveal that the Craig amendment fails, and fails \nabysmally, in reducing the availability and accessibility of guns.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 7 minutes and 16 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the time I was yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes remaining on the Senator's \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in my 2 remaining minutes, I want to \nmention what has happened with the use of firearms in homicides for \nthose 16 and under in Boston, MA. In 1990, we had 10; in 1995, we only \nhad 2. In 1998, we had 4. In 1999, for youth homicides in Boston, MA, \nin 128 schools, zero so far. Zero so far. Something is working. \nSomething is working.\n  What is working is tough gun laws--and I will have a chance to go \ninto greater detail on that later in the debate--tough law enforcement, \neffective programs in the schools, and working with children and \nparents to respond to some of the underlying causes, and the needs of \nchildren. It is that combination, but it is also effective because we \nhave tough gun laws.\n\n  The Lautenberg amendment is a downpayment on the things that are \nimportant in reducing violence. Many say here: This is a complex issue, \nand therefore we can't really solve the problem. What the Lautenberg \namendment and other amendments say is, we can reduce the incidence of \nviolence in our society and we will miss that opportunity if we fail to \nadopt them.\n  This is about saving children's lives. That is what this proposal is \nabout, and a number of other proposals. We should be willing to accept \nthis in an overwhelmingly positive way. The Lautenberg amendment does \nsomething; the Craig amendment fails the minimum standard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 5 minutes 13 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Idaho has 18 minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand it is possible to extend \nthe time some because the vote, I am told, is going to be delayed from \n4 to 4:30. I ask the Senator from Idaho if he is interested in taking \nsome more time for our discussion here. I do not want the time to go by \nwithout use.\n  Mr. HATCH. I prefer to get these two amendments over with so we can \nmove on to the next amendment. We do have one or two others that are \ngoing to come up today. I think we have covered it pretty well on both \nsides.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I have. I understand there \nis a 2\\1/2\\-minute presentation before each of the votes; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes equally divided; that is correct. \nThe Senator now has 3 minutes 49 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest and felt like \nthe famous philosopher from New Jersey, Yogi Berra, who said, ``This is \ndeja vu all over again,'' because the Senator from Idaho and I have \nsharply disagreed on what constitutes freedom.\n  I think there is a freedom that overrides all the others--the freedom \nto live, the freedom to send your children to school and not worry \nabout whether or not they are going to get shot and permanently injured \nor worse yet, killed.\n  The Senator from Idaho points out the fact that there is only a small \npercentage--he corrected that; he is an honest man. He corrected the \npercentage he ascribed to gun show purchases away from licensed \ndealers. A small percentage he said. What are we talking about? What \npercentage did it take to kill 13 kids in Littleton, CO? It could have \nbeen done with 1 percent or less. Four weapons, all of which had a \nhistory of gun show traveling.\n  Four weapons killed those children. Ask those families whether they \nwant tighter control or whether they are\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\nworried about the menace that the Senator from Idaho presented. The \nmenace, he says, is a bigger bureaucracy. How about the menace of \nlosing your child? Where does that stand in the list of things? No, it \nis important that the Federal Government doesn't intervene; we ought to \nget rid of the Federal Government. Maybe we do not need any laws.\n  He said only a small percentage are violators. Yes, we have in our \ncountry over 100 million cars on the road, but we have laws against \ndrunk driving; we have laws against reckless driving; we have laws \nagainst speeding. Why? Because even though a car is a nice convenience, \nit can be a lethal weapon if it is mishandled.\n  What is wrong with saying we ought to take some time, we ought to \nmake records? I do not understand this sham attempt to obscure reality.\n  He said we don't want to interfere; we will let private citizens--let \na private citizen go to an FBI file and say: Listen, I want to look up \nthis guy, and tell me what you will.\n  A private citizen going to the FBI to find out what kind of history \nthis person has, whether they have mental disease or mental illness or \nwhether or not they have ever been in jail, in private records? But, \nno, we can't trivialize the gun show business. We are not trivializing \nit. We say if you want to buy a gun at a gun show, then let a licensed \nFederal dealer offer a check.\n  The Senator from Idaho and I had a disagreement a few years ago about \nwhether or not spousal abusers ought to be deprived of their right to \nown a gun. Beat up your wife as many times as you want, but you still \nshould have your gun. We won that one. It took a heck of a fight to win \nit, and they are still trying to upset it, but the court upheld our \nright to say no to a spousal abuser, you don't have a right to own a \ngun if you are going to abuse your family. Mr. President, 150,000 times \na year a woman has a gun put to her head with the threat: I am going to \nkill you. And the children are watching. What kind of trauma is that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will yield for a question on your time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Did I support you in the spousal abuse amendment? Did I \nsupport you and vote for it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The vote was for it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Thank you.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But the amendment died in committee. The amendment \ndied because the NRA wanted to kill that amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. But the Senator from New Jersey said I did not support it. \nHe is wrong. I voted for it, and I supported him.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We negotiated very hard as they tried to strip it \nbare but finally resolved it because it was too embarrassing in the \npublic to vote against it, to say to the public: No; you still deserve \na gun even though you beat the heck out of your wife.\n  What are we talking about here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. This is theater; this isn't government.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I guess I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is important that facts be facts. The \nSenator from New Jersey and I did negotiate on the spousal abuse issue \nbecause there were some differences. When those differences were worked \nout, we agreed. So it is not correct to characterize on the floor that \nI opposed him. He and I agreed, we shook hands, and we voted for it. \nAnd I do not run from that vote at all. So let's set that one aside.\n  Let's talk about the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which the \nSenator said some minutes ago had endorsed his legislation. We called \nthe National Sports Shooting Foundation today, and they said they do \nnot endorse the Lautenberg legislation.\n  Just last Monday, the president of NSSF said the industry supports \nbackgrounds checks at gun shows provided the FBI does not maintain the \nnames in violation of the law and the White House agrees to a more \naggressive prosecution of felons turned up by the background checks. \nThat is what they said. They did not, by my checking today, support the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  I am also told by Governor Bush's office here in Washington that his \noffice has now called the Lautenberg office to say they do not support, \nnor have they endorsed, the Lautenberg amendment. That is possibly why \nthat placard a few moments ago that said George W. Bush supported the \nlegislation has been taken down. I do not know that to be a fact. I \nhave not talked with Governor Bush, but it is my understanding at this \nmoment that that is the case from the Governor's office here in \nWashington. I will set that one aside.\n  Let's talk about the facts. The facts are that there are 40,000 gun \nlaws in America. Twenty of those were violated at Columbine High School \nin that tragic event which all of us mourn. We are here today in a \njuvenile justice bill trying to create a much stronger environment in \nwhich to deal with juveniles who act in violent and illegal ways. That \nis what we are trying to do. That is what the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee has worked for over 2 years to do. We are going to be \ntreating violent juveniles more like adults--a significant change in \nour society and in our culture. And we should. We must.\n\n  Well, then, why are gun shows a part of it? Because every time some \npeople get an opportunity to talk about opposing guns, they take that \nopportunity. I do not deny them that right, but what is important is \nthat we deal with the character of the law in the right and appropriate \nway.\n  Private citizens are allowed to sell guns in private transactions--at \ngun shows, in the middle of the street, or in the privacy of their \nhome. That is what the law says. There are liabilities to that. If you \nsell to a minor, that is against the law. If you sell in an interstate \ntransaction, that is against the law. If you sell to a felon, you \nbetter be careful; you will be liable. Those are the laws that exist \ntoday.\n  If you are a licensed dealer of guns, making your living from guns, \nthen the laws are manyfold and you walk a very tight rope. You keep \nrecords, as you should, and you do background checks to deny felons \naccess to guns or those who have an adjudicated problem that would make \nthem unstable in the ownership of guns.\n  Those are the laws today with which we deal. There are some 5,000-\nplus gun shows annually that nearly 5 million people attend across \nAmerica, where 60 percent of the gun transactions are done within the \ncontext of federally licensed firearms dealers, and 40 percent are not. \nWe are saying something distinctively different than the Senator from \nNew Jersey, who says: Federally controlled, federally defined, in a \nbureaucracy of recordkeeping that puts the private citizen at a \ntremendous liability, even though they are law abiding and do all the \nright things. We are saying we ought to allow background checks to \nprivate citizens if they are involved in those transactions. Our \namendment would do that, would create a special registry to access, for \nthat citizen, the NICS, instant background check system of the FBI.\n  That is right, and it is proper, and it will go a long ways toward \ndealing with illegal activity--some exist; I cannot deny that. But \nclearly even the Justice Department says that of the guns that are sold \nat gun shows, less than 2 percent are found to be in illegal \nactivities. That is this Justice Department. That is Bill Clinton's \nJustice Department. Yet, Bill Clinton, our President, who tried to \ncharacterize gun shows as being a bazaar for criminal activity, is \nwrong, and he knows it. But when he can play politics with this issue, \nhe runs to do so, even though his own Justice Department would argue \nthat the statistics are substantially different.\n  We also provide for a unique status of licensure. But what we do most \nimportantly is we do not increase the liability or the recordkeeping \nresponsibility of the private citizen. No tripwires here, no failure to \ndot the ``i'' or cross the ``t'' of a Federal process for which the ATF \ncan come into your home and find you liable. That is not the way it \nshould be. Private citizens have rights in this country, and they even \nhave rights to own guns within the law and under the Constitution. That \nis what\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\nwe guarantee here with clearer definition and clearer process.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator has 11 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one other area that concerns me a great \ndeal is the definition by the Senator from New Jersey of ``gun show.'' \nI have spoken to that to some extent. But I am tremendously fearful \nthat law-abiding citizens, who are legitimate collectors of guns, all \nof a sudden will find themselves, where more than one should meet, \nautomatically by definition of the Federal law a gun show.\n  That is wrong. It should not be that way. But certainly if it becomes \nthat way, their liability to even talk about guns and trade guns or \nexchange guns amongst their friends who are collectors is dramatically \ncurtailed.\n  Also, I do not think the Senator from New Jersey has done an \neffective job of refuting what ``gun show promoter'' means. Because he \nsays that the term ``gun show promoter'' means any person or \norganization that plans or promotes and operates a gun show. These are \nthe people who find themselves not only liable but having to get \nFederal licensure to do so. Does that include the Marriott Hotel next \nto the Convention Center with a sign out front: All gun show exhibitors \nstay here. We promote gun show X in city Y or Z? It could. Because we \nall know that what we mean here as legislative intent oftentimes \nbecomes vastly different once interpreted by the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Those are my concerns as they relate to these issues. I hope my \ncolleagues will clearly understand those before they take the \nopportunity to vote this afternoon.\n  I retain the remainder of my time and relinquish the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to express my views with \nrespect to the issue of background checks at gun shows in relation to \nthe amendments we have today before the Senate.\n  I am a strong supporter of the second amendment; however, I also \nbelieve we must maintain procedures to ensure that guns do not find \ntheir way to the wrong hands. This is why I have supported the instant \ncheck system which is currently in place.\n  I have reviewed the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg and the \namendment offered by Senator Craig. I have concerns with both. In my \nview the amendment offered by Senator Lautenberg goes much further than \nsimply requiring a background check for purchases at gun shows. It \nwould put in place new and burdensome record requirements for gun show \noperators and vendors and provide the Secretary of the Treasury with \nunlimited authority to issue additional regulations.\n  On the other hand, the amendment offered by Senator Craig, in my \nview, does not go far enough. Senator Craig's amendment merely outlines \na voluntary or optional background check process.\n  Mr. President, consistent with my view and past support of the Brady \nbill, I would support a straightforward background check system for gun \nshow sales, but that is not the choice we have before us today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. With the permission of Senator Craig, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the distinguished Senator from Arizona be given 7 minutes \nto offer his amendment, speak to it, and, as I understand, he is going \nto withdraw the amendment at the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, not objecting but clarifying, if I may, do \nI retain my time or is that simply used up in this----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho retains his 5 minutes, \nand the Senator from Arizona would have 7 minutes intervening. Is that \nthe intent of the Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator's time would not come out of the time of the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I ask a question, please? How is the time \nderived? Is the time now under the control of the Senator from Idaho?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the Senator from Idaho has 5 \nminutes 2 seconds remaining. The unanimous consent request is that the \nSenator from Arizona have 7 additional minutes for his own purposes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 333\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit the receipt, transfer, transportation, or \n   possession of a firearm or ammunition by certain violent juvenile \n                   offenders, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 333.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FIREARMS PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Straw Purchase Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 924(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), whoever knowingly \n     violates section 922(a)(6) for the purpose of selling, \n     delivering, or otherwise transferring a firearm, knowing or \n     having reasonable cause to know that another person will \n     carry or otherwise possess or discharge or otherwise use the \n     firearm in the commission of a violent felony, shall be--\n       ``(i) fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 15 \n     years, or both; or\n       ``(ii) imprisoned not less than 10 and not more than 20 \n     years and fined under this title, if the procurement is for a \n     juvenile.\n       ``(B) In this paragraph--\n       ``(i) the term `juvenile' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 922(x); and\n       ``(ii) the term `violent felony' means conduct described in \n     subsection (e)(2)(B).''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (b) Juvenile Weapons Penalties.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 924(a) of title 18 United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (4), by striking ``Whoever'' and inserting \n     ``Except as provided in paragraph (6), whoever''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (6), by striking subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(B) A person other than a juvenile who knowingly violates \n     section 922(x)--\n       ``(i) shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more \n     than 1 year, or both; or\n       ``(ii) if the person sold, delivered, or otherwise \n     transferred a handgun or ammunition to a juvenile, knowing or \n     having reasonable cause to know that the juvenile intended to \n     carry or otherwise possess or discharge or otherwise use the \n     handgun or ammunition in the commission of a violent felony, \n     shall be imprisoned not less than 10 and not more than 20 \n     years and fined under this title.\n       ``(C) In this paragraph--\n       ``(i) the term `juvenile' has the meaning given the term in \n     section 922(x); and\n       ``(ii) the term `violent felony' means conduct described in \n     subsection (e)(2)(B).''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by this subsection \n     shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and also the \nSenator from Idaho for allowing me this time. I don't think I will use \nas much as 7 minutes. At that time, I will withdraw my amendment upon \nthe completion of my statement.\n  This amendment is designed to prevent juveniles from illegally \naccessing weapons and to punish those who would assist them in doing \nso.\n  This amendment provides that whoever illegally purchases a weapon for \nanother individual, knowing that the recipient intends to use the \nweapon to commit a violent crime, may be imprisoned for up to 15 years. \nFurther, the amendment mandates that whoever illegally purchases a \nweapon for a juvenile, knowing that the juvenile intends to commit a \nviolent felony with the weapon, will receive a mandatory minimum \nsentence of 10 years and may be imprisoned for up to 20 years. Current \nlaw provides a maximum prison term of 10 years, regardless of the age \nof the shooter.\n  Additionally, if a person transfers a handgun or ammunition to a \njuvenile knowing that the juvenile intends to\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\ncommit a violent felony, that individual will receive a minimum 10-year \nsentence and may be imprisoned up to 20 years.\n  Mr. President, as I just outlined, this amendment is very simple. The \namendment targets the nexus of the youth gun violence issue. Despite \nthe arguments of those who are pushing for more restrictive guns \nownership laws, the fact is that the overwhelming majority of kids who \nare committing these violent acts are getting guns illegally. It is \nludicrous to argue that gang members are going to gun shows or to \nWalmart to buy their weapons. For the most part, they are obtaining \nthem illegally.\n  Recent events have shaken the collective conscience of this nation. \nThe murders at Columbine High School in Colorado have again brought \nhome to every American the degree to which we are failing our children.\n  The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture--any \nculture--has is raising its children. We are failing in that \nresponsibility, and the extent of our failure is being measured in the \ndeaths and injuries of kids in schoolyards and on neighborhood streets. \nOver the past 2 years, we have been jolted time and again with the \nhorrifying news and images of school shootings. Every day, in towns and \ncities across this country, kids are killing kids, and kids are killing \nadults in a spiraling pattern of youth violence driven by the drug \ntrade, gang activity, and other factors.\n\n  Our children are killing each other, and they are killing themselves. \nWe must act to change this.\n  Primary responsibility lies with families. As a country, we are not \nparenting our children. We are not adequately involving ourselves in \nour children's lives, the friends they hang out with, what they do with \ntheir time, and the problems they are struggling with. This is our job, \nour paramount responsibility, and we are failing. We must get our \npriorities straight, and that means putting our kids first.\n  However, parents need help. They need help because our homes, our \nfamilies, and our children's minds are being flooded by a tide of \nviolence. This dehumanizing violence pervades our society. Movies \ndepict graphic violence, and children are taught to kill and maim by \ninteractive video games. The Internet, which holds such tremendous \npotential, is used by some to communicate unimaginable hatred, images \nand descriptions of violence, and ``how-to'' manuals on everything from \nbomb construction to drugs. Our culture is dominated by media, and our \nchildren, more so than any other generation, are vulnerable to the \nimages of violence and hate that are, sadly, the dominant themes in so \nmuch of what they see and hear.\n  I recently joined with some of my colleagues to call upon the \nPresident to convene an emergency summit of the leaders of the \nentertainment and interactive media industry to develop an action plan \nfor controlling children's access to media violence. I am pleased that \nthe President heeded this call. However, I am very disappointed that \nthe President's summit proved to be heavy on symbolism and light on \nsubstance. We can do more.\n  I have also joined others to introduce legislation calling upon the \nSurgeon General to conduct a comprehensive study of media violence in \nall its forms, and to issue a report on its effects together with \nrecommendations on how we can turn around the tragic tide of youth \nviolence.\n  Further, yesterday, I, along with Senator Lieberman and others, \nannounced legislation that would establish a National Youth Violence \nCommission, consisting of religious leaders and experts in education, \nfamily psychology, law enforcement, and parenting, to produce a \ncomprehensive study of the forces that are conspiring to turn our \nchildren into killers.\n  Combined, these measures--along with this legislation--are important \nsteps targeting various aspects of the complex problem of youth \nviolence. However, if we are to turn this tide, we must press the fight \non every front.\n  One reality of the horrific schoolyard shootings, and the criminal \ngun violence that is so prevalent among our youth, is the illegal use \nof guns. The amendment I have offered is specifically targeted at the \nillegal means by which kids are acquiring guns. The extent of this \nproblem is made acutely apparent by the events that unfolded in \nLittleton. From what we are told, 18 different gun laws were violated, \nincluding illegal straw purchases and transfers.\n  This amendment states simply that, if you know a kid is going to \ncommit a violent felony, and you give him or her the gun to commit that \ncrime, you are going to go to jail for a long time.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is not a panacea. As I have stated, the \nmalady of youth violence that is eating at the soul of this Nation is a \ncomplex disease. It will require a multi-faceted cure. I believe we \nmust push for a comprehensive approach. What we must have is the \nunqualified commitment of all Americans to raise our children, to put \nthem first.\n  This amendment is one step--one necessary step that will help us deal \nwith the problem of kids killing kids. I hope the Senate will adopt \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, my understanding is that the distinguished manager of \nthe bill has included this amendment in the package. I thank him for \ndoing that. Therefore, it would be deemed unnecessary that this \namendment be considered separately at this time. I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for including this \namendment in the package.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 333) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Arizona for \nhis leadership on this issue and for the work that he has done to help \npass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously stacked \nvotes be delayed to begin at 4:30 this afternoon. We have three so far \nlined up. And further, following the debate outlined in the previous \nconsent, Senator Thompson be recognized for up to 20 minutes for \ngeneral debate on the bill, and then Senator Kennedy for 10 minutes and \nthen Senator Leahy for 5 minutes.\n  I further ask that following the votes, Senator Hollings be \nrecognized to offer an amendment regarding TV violence limited to 3 \nhours equally divided prior to a motion to table, with no amendments in \norder prior to that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nunderstand this. We are starting basically now, Senator Thompson will \nbe recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And then my 5 minutes is in there prior to the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Following Senator Kennedy.\n  Now, also if we have enough time left over after Senator Leahy \nspeaks, I ask unanimous consent that we can work on a Republican \namendment before the votes, too, so we can at least have one more. We \nwill try to work that out between the two managers on the floor. We \nwill begin with Senator Thompson for 20 minutes, Kennedy for 10, and \nLeahy for 5, and then we will see where we can go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah and I \ncongratulate him for his long work in this area. While I cannot support \nthis legislation, it is certainly better than much I have seen in this \narea. I know he and Senators Sessions, Biden, and others, have spent a \nlot of time on this. I congratulate them for it.\n  Mr. President, I rise not to debate any particular amendment. There \nhas been a lot of good discussion as to the grants, the programs, and \nas to the various amendments and details of what we should do and how \nmuch money we should spend on various programs.\n  I rise not to address that because I have a significant problem with \nthe entire concept. I believe that our approach with regard to youth \nviolence\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nhere is misguided. First, I will address basically what this bill does. \nAmong other things, it makes it easier to prosecute juveniles in \nFederal criminal court. We have from 100 to 200 prosecutions a year of \njuveniles in Federal court. It is a minuscule part of our criminal \njustice system.\n  In 1998, there were 58,000 Federal criminal cases filed involving \n79,000 defendants. As I say, there were only 100 or 200 juvenile \nFederal crime cases among that group. This bill would make it easier to \nbring what has traditionally been a State matter into the Federal \nsystem. It makes it easier to try a juvenile as an adult. It would \nallow juveniles as young as 14 years of age to be tried as an adult for \nviolent crimes and drug offenses--drug offenses, again, that are of the \nstreet crime category, where we have laws on the books in every State \nof the Union. It makes more local street crime Federal offenses--\nrecruiting gang members and things of that nature. It allows the \nAttorney General to send in a Federal task force if she deems it \nnecessary.\n  Then there is an array of programs and grants that this bill sets \nforth: Educational programs, educational grants for dropout prevention, \nschool violence, restitution, child abuse, probation enhancement, \nmentoring programs, drug abuse, gang prevention, gun prevention, job \ntraining, afterschool activities, family strengthening, evaluation \nprograms. Then this bill requires in a few instances, and in a few \ninstances encourages, States to do certain other things if they want to \nparticipate and get this grant money and program money. It encourages \nboot camps, sentencing of juveniles who are as young as 10 years old as \nadults, encourages graduated sanctions, and encourages States to set up \nvarious kinds of programs for victims of juvenile crime. That is \nrequired if the States want this money. It requires communities to \nestablish coalitions to replicate other communities. In other words, it \nrequires coalitions of groups of law enforcement officers to get \ntogether and do some of the things that have been done in \nother communities where they apparently have had good results.\n\n  Then we have seen research amendments with regard to crime in \nschools, establishing of hotlines, and increasing the penalties for \nvarious things. We have extended, by amendment, the 1994 crime bill \nthat will spend about $31 billion over the next 5 years. This bill does \nall of these things.\n  Mr. President, it is a tremendous conglomeration of grants and \nprograms and mandates, whereby we spend additional billions of dollars \non matters that are being, or should be, covered by State and local \nlaws, or that should be handled by local governments--such things that \nwould be anticrime measures, tough on crime measures; or we are dealing \nwith areas in which we really don't know what we are doing, with all \ndue respect, as a Federal Government. With that, I am referring to \nbasically prevention programs.\n  Basically, what we try to do is either get tough on crime programs, \nincreasing penalties, and federalizing additional offenses, on the one \nhand, or coming in with prevention programs designed to reach young \npeople before they get in trouble. Both are laudable goals. But not too \nlong ago, I chaired the Youth Violence Juvenile Justice Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee. We had extensive hearings. It is a subject \nthat we are all concerned about. We are looking for solutions. I came \naway with the distinct feeling and impression that we need to \nconcentrate more on research and evaluation of the underlying problems \nof juvenile violence. There is no question but that these are deep-\nrooted, social, complex problems about which we know very little.\n  I believe there is one thing the Federal Government does probably \nbetter than anybody else, and that is research and evaluation. We have \nthe resources and we can get the capability and we can make the long-\nterm commitment if we desire to come up with evaluation programs over a \nperiod of time to really determine what kind of programs work. We spend \nall of this money, we put forth all of these programs, and we really \nhave no idea what is working.\n  We have 132 Federal criminal juvenile justice programs on the books \ntoday. I daresay we have very little idea what is really working and \nwhat is not working. We have another tragedy, so we double the money \nwith regard, in many instances, to the same programs we have already.\n  Professor Alfred Blumstein was a witness before our committee. He is \na professor at Carnegie-Mellon University. He talked about the research \nand evaluation that was needed. You could not listen to him without \ncoming away with a certain feeling of humility about how little we know \nregarding this matter. He said:\n\n       The last 25 years has seen a considerable accumulation of \n     research findings and insights that were not available \n     earlier. Those research findings, however, reflect only a \n     tiny portion of what we need to know to make effective policy \n     and operational decisions in each of the many areas relating \n     to juvenile violence.\n\n  He said:\n\n       There have been some evaluations of various kinds of \n     rehabilitation programs, and these are encouraging, but we \n     have very little in the way of evaluation of prevention \n     programs. This is partly because so little has been done, but \n     also because it is very difficult to measure the effects of \n     programs whose effects may not be observed for a decade or \n     more.\n\n  In other words, what he is saying is, in order to have an evaluation \nof a research program worth its salt, we need to set it up for a decade \nor more.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       . . . Thus, while it is clear that much important research \n     has been conducted over the past decade, it is also clear \n     that we are still at an extremely primitive stage of \n     knowledge regarding violence, especially for directing \n     focused action, and that much more still needs to be done.\n\n  He says:\n\n       . . . we need much more and better information on the \n     development and the nature of criminal careers . . .\n\n  He goes on and on and says:\n\n       . . . The major growth in juvenile violence is not only of \n     concern itself, but it is symptomatic of many key aspects of \n     juvenile development that need major attention. The knowledge \n     base to address these issues is remarkably thin in terms of \n     knowing how best to intervene in these developmental \n     processes.\n\n  So, Mr. President, instead of passing additional laws, additional \nget-tough-on-crime measures, instead of establishing a Federal entity \nthat is sufficiently funded where there is a commitment over many, many \nyears, instead of focusing on research and evaluation before we go \nabout implementing these policies, we are now coming up with the same \nold responses that we have had in the past.\n  In this bill, there is some research and evaluation provisions that I \nthink are very good; in fact, some of the things we worked on in times \npast when I was on the Judiciary Committee. But it is minuscule in \ncomparison to what we need. Research and evaluation programs are \nscattered out among the States, a little bit here and there. We need a \nlong-term Federal commitment in the one area where the Federal \nGovernment does it best--for research and evaluation of programs. We \ncan see what works--which of these 132 Federal programs are working--\nand then be a clearinghouse for State and local governments so they can \nget the benefit of that knowledge, and they can go back and implement \ntheir own programs, instead of us instituting all of these grants and \nall of these programs directing States to do some things, and \nencouraging States to do other things, thinking that we have answers \nthat we do not have. We are getting the cart before the horse because \nof the tragic circumstances we are faced with.\n\n  We know now that some of these programs are very questionable in \nterms of results.\n  The DARE program, the GREAT program, some of the mentoring programs--\nwe simply know that in some cases there is absolutely no objective data \nthat indicates they are doing any good, and in some cases there is \nexpert testimony that in fact they are doing some bad things.\n  We cannot sit up here and have things occur to us that sound good to \nus and assume they are going to work out in real life. That is how we \ngot the airbags that killed children. That is how we got the program of \nasbestos removal that we now know was the wrong way to go about that \nproblem. We need to have a little humility as we approach this problem.\n  We encourage things. There are some amendments, such as counseling \nprograms for juvenile violence in schools,\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\nand so forth. I understand they have a gymnasium full of counselors out \nthere in Colorado now that people are not using. We encourage boot \ncamps for juveniles as adults when we know now that in some cases \njuveniles treated as juveniles will get more than they do being treated \nas adults.\n  We want to pass additional gun laws. Every State in the Union has \nlaws against children taking guns to school. We came in and overlaid \nthat with Federal law that made it a Federal offense for kids to take \nguns to school. Now we have State laws and a Federal law.\n  Now we have had a tragedy. And goodness knows what the next batch of \nlaws will be that portend to address this.\n  When I see statements made that by this bill we are giving our \nchildren back their childhood, or we are empowering parents to be \ndecent parents, it concerns me that we may really believe that, because \nwe do not have that ability, we do not have that power, we do not have \nthat knowledge, or know-how.\n  What is the underlying philosophy for Federal involvement in this \narea, or Federal control in some cases? Is it expertise? Do we have \nmore expertise on the Senate floor than out among the State and local \npeople who deal with this problem every day?\n  I doubt it, because we keep coming up with the same old programs and \nadding one every once in a while. We have the waterfront covered as far \nas programs are concerned. I can't think of a program that has not been \ncovered or funded in some way.\n  Is it because we have the money? Well, yes. We do have the money, \nbecause more and more we are depriving States and local governments of \ntheir sources of revenue, bringing it to Washington, then doling it \nback to them and telling them how to spend it, as if we knew.\n  In this bill we have $450 million for juvenile accountability block \ngrants, $75 million for juvenile criminal history upgrades, $200 \nmillion for challenge grants, $200 million for JJDPA prevention grants, \n$40 million for the National Institute for Juvenile Crime Control and \nPrevention, of which $20 million would go to evaluation research, $20 \nmillion for gang programs, $20 million for the demonstration programs, \n$15 million for mentoring programs.\n  I defy anyone to point out to me which one of these programs is \nworking or not working of the ones that we already have on the books \nthat basically track these same kinds of efforts.\n  Is the federalization of this matter because the problem is bigger \nand, therefore, we have to address it? I don't think that is the case. \nWe continue to federalize matters that are so insignificant that we \ndon't even prosecute them once they get on the books.\n  We now have Federal laws with regard to animal enterprise terrorism, \ntheft of livestock, and odometer tampering. There has been a total of \nfour prosecutions nationwide for all three of those acts.\n  Now we have a horrendous incident out in Colorado, which disturbs all \nof us. But the fact of the matter is that less than 1 percent of youth \nhomicides occur in schools.\n  Deaths by homicide is the second leading cause of deaths among \nchildren, second to accidents. And much of that has to do with driving \nwhile intoxicated and things of that nature.\n  Mr. President, the 10th amendment was put in the Constitution for a \nreason. The Federal Government ought to do the things the Federal \nGovernment is good at and leave the States alone to do the things the \nConstitution gives them under the Constitution. There is no plenary \nFederal law enforcement power under the Constitution.\n  We think we have a good result up here with a program in Boston, or \nwherever, so that we want to authorize the Attorney General to go in \nand put that program in other places. If it were a good program, logic \nwould extend it to every place in the country, which means a Federal \npolice power. And we do not want that.\n  We held federalism hearings the other day. We had a consensus from \nDemocrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, law enforcement \nofficers and defense lawyers. And they are all concerned about the \ntrend toward federalizing what essentially have been State and local \nmatters for more than 200 years.\n  There were 1,000 bills introduced in the 105th Congress. A lot of \nthem had to do with juvenile crimes. No one knows actually how many \nFederal crimes are on the books now; the statutes are so complicated. \nSome people say 3,000. But with the administrative regulations, and so \nforth, there are thousands and thousands of statutes and regulations \nthat have criminal consequences. That is the wrong direction.\n  The Federal Government should cover things in the Federal criminal \nlaw that have to do with Federal people or property, and interstate \ntransactions that are truly interstate. Local corruption conflicts, \nlitigation of civil rights, and things of that nature; that is, the law \nenforcement side of the equation, that is the equation that the State \nand local governments have the responsibility for. If we take that away \nfrom them, either in one fell swoop or gradually, they will do a worse \njob of it in the future instead of a better job.\n  On the prevention side, especially with regard to juveniles, let us \nhave a little modesty and acknowledge that we do not know the answers \nto these problems. Some of them we will never know. They are complex. \nThey are inherent societal problems that we did not get into overnight; \nwe will not get out of them overnight.\n  But I would suggest again that instead of spending these billions of \ndollars--literally billions of dollars on top of billions of dollars--\non programs about which we have no idea of their efficacy, what is \nworking and what is not working, let's scale that way back and put some \nmoney up here for some long-term research and evaluation for over a \ndecade or so, so we can really tell what works. Let us be a \nclearinghouse and an example then for the States. We don't have to dole \nout the money to them or suggest that they do this program or that \nprogram when we don't know what we are doing. They can see what works \nand what doesn't work.\n\n  On the grounds of the Federal Government properly doing what it \nshould be doing, letting the States do their traditional job under the \nConstitution, and, second, on the grounds of a little bit of modesty in \nterms of crime prevention--and that is where it is as far as these \njuveniles are concerned, on the prevention side--we have to get to \nthese kids earlier. But the fact of the matter is, we are scattered to \nthe four winds, throwing billions of dollars at a problem without \nknowing what the solution is.\n  There is only one way that I see we can go, and that is more research \nfor Federal evaluation and research, and in the meantime let's hold our \nhorses and not respond to the headlines--the most difficult thing in \nthe world to do. But by getting out front and pretending we can do \nthings we can't do, we are setting the cause back; we are not advancing \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I was listening to my good friend from Tennessee talking about what \nwe need to do, that we need to give more time for research and \nevaluation of where we are in terms of violence among young people in \nthis country.\n  Quite frankly, I would invite our colleagues and Members of \nCongress--Members of the Senate in this instance--to look at what has \nhappened up in my own home city of Boston, MA, in recent years.\n  In Boston, Mr. President, we have had a dramatic strengthening of \nvarious gun laws in recent years, stricter enforcement of existing \nlaws, and the implementation of very important programs in terms of \nhelp and assistance for the students, the teachers, and the parents, \nand the schools. We have had the community police men and women working \nin the schools, working with the superintendents, working with the \nparents, working with the children.\n\n  There has been the development of support groups for the children. \nThere has been the development of violence prevention and mediation \nprograms; an important 2 to 6 program; an afterschool program which is \nso important\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nin terms of helping and assisting children in the afternoon with their \nvarious academic endeavors so when the children do go home in the late \nafternoon and see their parents--in most situations both of whom have \nbeen working hard--they will have quality time with them.\n  It is an effective approach. We are not here to suggest this will be \nthe only approach. I am not here to suggest that there shouldn't be \nadditional reviews or studies. But as we look at the various challenges \nwe are facing today, we shouldn't just throw up our hands and say \nbecause there are so many things to do, we can't do anything at all. \nThere are important things that we can do.\n  The Senate has made some judgments on some of those recommendations--\nthose which have been offered by Senator Robb, Senator Leahy, and \nothers during the course of the last day or so. Now we are beginning a \ndebate on another, I think, extremely important provision. That is the \naccessibility and the availability of these weapons, particularly to \nchildren, in our society.\n  It is uncontrovertible that various societies that deny easy access \nand easy availability of these weapons do not have the kind of homicide \nrecords we have seen in the United States. Industrial nations that have \nstrict restrictions on the access and availability of weapons see a \nfraction of the number of homicides that we have seen. There is a \ndirect correlation. We have seen that ourselves over the years.\n  We have had leadership from our colleagues, including Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Lautenberg, and others here on the development and \nthe support of the Brady bill. We have made important progress. In my \nown State of Massachusetts, we have made significant progress in a \nvariety of ways regarding gun laws.\n  This chart describes firearm homicides by all ages in recent years in \nBoston. We see the dramatic reduction: 1993, 65; 1994, 62; 1995, 64; \n1999, 4. It seems to me it would be worthwhile to look and listen to \nthose who are out there in the streets, in the schools, in law \nenforcement, who have witnessed this kind of result. We hear a great \ndeal of postulating and theorizing about what may be done or what \nshould be done, but we have a very practical example in this chart of \nwhat has been done and what is being done. So far in this particular \nyear, with 128 schools, we have not had a single homicide in Boston, \nMA.\n  The school lots of the city of Boston were fire zones, not too many \nyears ago, but we have made important progress. One of the most \nimportant reasons is the gun laws that have been passed.\n  The age for juvenile possession of handguns in Massachusetts is 21--\nit is 18 nationwide--but it is 21 in my State of Massachusetts. We \nenacted the cap law, a law that says we are going to hold individuals \nwho have weapons in their homes responsible, so that there will be a \nseparation of the gun from the ammunition. We hear a great deal of talk \nabout the second amendment, about responsible Americans. We say that is \nfine; we will hold you responsible. You are going to store your gun \nseparate from your ammunition. If you don't and there is a crime, we \nare holding you responsible.\n  That has had an important impact. There have been 16 States that have \nadopted similar laws, and we are beginning to see important progress \nmade.\n  In Massachusetts, we have a waiting period for handgun purchases. We \nhave a State ban on all assault weapons, and we have yet to hear from \nany hunters that they need to have assault weapons to go out in the \nwoods and hunt deer. We have effectively halted all assault weapons, \nand that has been an important addition.\n\n  We have barred private sales of guns between individuals avoiding, \ncircumventing the background checks.\n  We have insisted we will have safety locks on the guns that are sold \nin Massachusetts. We have the technology for a gun safety lock to \nprevent children up to maybe 4 years of age from pulling the trigger of \na handgun. Why aren't we putting those requirements into the \nlegislation?\n  We have important, strict, provisions in terms of reporting stolen \nweapons.\n  Those are the kinds of measures we have passed in Massachusetts. I \ndon't see how anyone can make the case that they provide much hindrance \nto individuals who want to exercise their right to go out and hunt. I \ndon't see how those measures inhibit that opportunity.\n  We are seeing, not only in the city of Boston, similar results in \nother cities around our Commonwealth. Something is working; something \nis happening. We are saying, let us try to find what is working, what \nis happening, what is tried and tested. We are not going to solve all \nof the problems, but we are going to reduce the number of youth \nhomicides. We can see very clearly from this chart we are talking about \n15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 children who are alive today that would not be \nalive, I daresay, unless those steps had been taken. These are positive \nbottom-line results.\n  We are going to see various amendments offered by Members on this \nside of the aisle--whether it is the Lautenberg amendment on the gun \nshows; whether it is the Durbin amendment; or whether it will be \nSenator Boxer and Senator Feinstein offering amendments that have been \nalong the lines of what has been proven and tested here. And I doubt \nvery much we will have much success.\n  The American people ought to pay close attention to this debate. We \nwill have votes this afternoon. And hopefully, we will have the \nimportant votes on these issues tomorrow. We need to listen to the \nAmerican people on these issues. We are talking not just about a policy \non education. We are not talking about a health policy. We are not \ntalking about an environmental policy. We are not talking about a \ndefense policy. We are talking about whether there are steps that can \nbe taken, by this body, that will make a difference in terms of the \nlives of children in our society.\n  We can do it. We demonstrated it. We should do it. And we ought to be \nable to accept it here in the Senate during the course of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy, is to be recognized for 35 minutes.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a series of \nvotes in a short while. I would like to speak about one of them, \namendment No. 332, introduced by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, \nMr. Craig. I have heard of the emperor not having clothes, but this \namendment has no clothes.\n  This is an amendment that speaks about controlling gun sales at guns \nshows, auctions or out of the back of your truck or whatever, and we \nare going to put some controls on it. We are going to put some controls \non for background checks, but only if the person who opens the back of \nhis trunk to sell these guns ``desires to have access to the national \ninstant check system.'' Of course, if he doesn't want to, he can keep \nright on selling the guns, no checks, nothing. I am not that great at \ndriving a truck, but I could drive an 18-wheeler through that hole.\n  Then it has a whole lot of civil liabilities in here for certain \nfuture Federal firearm violations. But then there is probably the best \nsweetheart deal I have ever seen. It dismisses pending actions from any \nFederal or State court for gun dealers. It gives blanket immunity. This \namendment might cover a State or a city, Attorney General or anybody \nelse who sued a gun dealer and dismiss the case. Not even a TV judge \ncould throw it out that easy, but this amendment could. It is not clear \nfrom its drafting who is covered by this immunity section of the \namendment.\n  I do not know why we do not amend it. I am sure there are some around \nhere, because of their ties with the tobacco industry, who would like \nto do that for the tobacco industry. Can you imagine if anybody brought \nup a piece of legislation that said we will, by this amendment, remove \nall liability on tobacco suits? They would be laughed out of here. It \nwould be a front-page story in the paper. Suppose somebody came in and \nsaid, I want to throw a little amendment in here to do away with suits \nagainst toxic waste sites. People would be calling up, saying, what, \ndid you get a PAC contribution from Polluters, Incorporated?\n  I have seen some remarkable amendments. I commend the distinguished\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\nSenator. He has very strong feelings about guns and he has concerns \nabout any limitations on them. But this is remarkable.\n  I keep a file of extraordinary things I have seen during my 25 years \nhere. This will go in the file. To put in an amendment, not even debate \nthis line, but to say, anybody who has a suit against a gun dealer or \nperhaps a gun manufacturer, it might be thrown out. No hearings. No \ndebate. Nothing. But the Senate has thrown it out. In fact, this \nsection is just titled ``Immunity.'' That is pretty amazing. It says:\n\n       A qualified civil liability action pending under the date \n     of enactment of this subsection shall be dismissed \n     immediately by the court.\n\n  Man, every defendant is going to be rushing into court if we pass \nthis, saying, I am home free. I get out of jail. I do not have to pass \n``go.'' I do get to collect the $200.\n  Mr. President, every Senator who votes for this is voting to override \nthe courts of their State. They are voting to override the \nmunicipalities of their State. They are voting to override the \nlegislature of their State. They are voting to override the Attorney \nGeneral of their State. They are voting on suits they have not even \nseen, to just throw them out of court. I have been here long enough to \nknow special interest legislation makes it to the floor of the Senate, \nbut this may be the all-time king.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we now have 25 minutes left. There are a \nfew people who would still like to speak, especially the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, in response to Senator Kennedy and his \nconclusions. I ask unanimous consent to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, and then immediately thereafter \ncall up the Hatch-Leahy Internet screening amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his leadership \non this. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, the Boston project \nhas been a very successful project and contrary to his understanding of \nour legislation, it does model itself after the key successes of the \nBoston project. I have had members of my staff visit Boston. The number \nof murders and decline in crime have been remarkable. It is driven, if \nyou talk to the people there, by a coordinated effort by the entire \ncommunity, really led by the judiciary, the courts, the police and the \nprobation officers.\n  When judges give a young person probation in Boston, if he is a \nmember of a gang and he is supposed to be in at 7 o'clock at night, a \nprobation officer, along with a uniformed policeman, will go out at \nnight, knock on the door and make sure he or she is home. This is not \nbeing done anyplace else in America.\n  They are taking these young people seriously. They are following up. \nJudges and parole officers in Boston have the capacity to discipline \nthem through detention facilities and other forms of discipline if they \nviolate their probation, which most juvenile judges do not.\n  The whole purpose, what we are doing here, is to try to empower other \ncourt systems in America to do the same type of innovative research. In \nfact, our bill, on page 230, requires this coordinated local effort, \nwhich was the key to Boston and several other cities which are making \nprogress in juvenile crime.\n  This requires, prior to receiving a grant under this section, that\n\n       . . . a unit of local government shall certify that it has \n     or will establish a coordinated enforcement plan--\n\n  That is what they have in Boston.\n\n     for reducing juvenile crime within the jurisdiction of the \n     unit of local government developed by a juvenile crime \n     enforcement coalition, such coalition consisting of \n     individuals within the jurisdiction representing police, \n     sheriff, the prosecutor, State or local probation services, \n     juvenile court, schools, business, and religious affiliated, \n     fraternal, nonprofit and social service organizations \n     involved in crime prevention.\n\n  So I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, this is what we are doing \nhere. The key to the success of the Boston project, in my opinion, is a \ncoordinated effort among Federal, State and local agencies under the \njurisdiction of the court and probation officer, who actually monitors \nyoung people who started to be involved in violations of the law, with \nan intense interest, an intense interest borne out of love and concern, \nto insist that they stop their bad activities and, in fact, return to \nthe rule of law.\n  If we do that effectively, I do believe we have the capacity to \nreduce crime in America.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Chairman Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 335\n\n   (Purpose: Relating to the availability of Internet filtering and \n                          screening software)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 335.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 265, below line 20, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. PROVISION OF INTERNET FILTERING OR SCREENING \n                   SOFTWARE BY CERTAIN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) Requirement To Provide.--Each Internet service provider \n     shall at the time of entering an agreement with a residential \n     customer for the provision of Internet access services, \n     provide to such customer, either at no fee or at a fee not in \n     excess of the amount specified in subsection (c), computer \n     software or other filtering or blocking system that allows \n     the customer to prevent the access of minors to material on \n     the Internet.\n       (b) Surveys of Provision of Software or Systems.--\n       (1) Surveys.--The Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention of the Department of Justice and the \n     Federal Trade Commission shall jointly conduct surveys of the \n     extent to which Internet service providers are providing \n     computer software or systems described in subsection (a) to \n     their subscribers.\n       (2) Frequency.--The surveys required by paragraph (1) shall \n     be completed as follows:\n       (A) One shall be completed not later than one year after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) One shall be completed not later than two years after \n     that date.\n       (C) One shall be completed not later than three years after \n     that date.\n       (c) Fees.--The fee, if any, charged and collected by an \n     Internet service provider for providing computer software or \n     a system described in subsection (a) to a residential \n     customer shall not exceed the amount equal to the cost of the \n     provider in providing the software or system to the \n     subscriber, including the cost of the software or system and \n     of any license required with respect to the software or \n     system.\n       (d) Applicability.--The requirement described in subsection \n     (a) shall become effective only if--\n       (1) 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Office and the Commission determine as a result of the survey \n     completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(A) that less \n     than 75 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided computer software or systems described in \n     subsection (a) by such providers;\n       (2) 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, \n     the Office and the Commission determine as a result of the \n     survey completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(B) that \n     less than 85 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided such software or systems by such providers; or\n       (3) 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, if \n     the Office and the Commission determine as a result of the \n     survey completed by the deadline in subsection (b)(2)(C) that \n     less than 100 percent of the total number of residential \n     subscribers of Internet service providers as of such deadline \n     are provided such software or systems by such providers.\n       (e) Internet Service Provider Defined.--In this section, \n     the term ``Internet service provider'' means a ``service \n     provider'' as defined in section 512(k)(1)(A) of title 17, \n     United States Code, which has more than 50,000 subscribers.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this next amendment \nalong with Senator Leahy, my friend and colleague, which I have \ndeveloped with the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy. This amendment is largely aimed at limiting \nthe negative impact to children from violence and indecent material on \nthe Internet.\n  At the outset, let me note this amendment does not regulate content. \nInstead, it encourages the larger Internet service providers to \nprovide, either\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\nfor free or at a fee not exceeding the cost to the ISP, the Internet \nservice provider, filtering technologies that would empower parents to \nlimit or block access of minors to unsuitable material on the Internet.\n  We cannot place all the blame for today's culture of violence on the \nInternet. But we also cannot ignore the fact that this powerful new \nmedium has the ability to expose children to violent, sexually \nexplicit, and other inappropriate materials with no limits, not even \nthe time-of-broadcast limits that are currently imposed on television \nbroadcasters. Indeed, a recent Time/CNN poll found that 75 percent of \nteens aged 13 to 17 believed the Internet is partly responsible for \ncrimes like the Columbine High School shootings.\n  This amendment respects the first amendment of the Constitution by \nnot regulating content, but ensures that parents will have the adequate \ntechnological tools to control the access of their children to \nunsuitable material on the Internet.\n  Let me say that many Internet subscribers already have such tools \nprovided to them free of charge. For example, the largest Internet \nservice provider currently provides its 17 million subscribers with \nsuch filtering technology as part of their standard service.\n  I honestly believe that other ISPs, or Internet service providers, \nwho do not already provide filtering software to their subscribers will \ndo so voluntarily. They will know it is in their best interests and \nthat the market will demand it. That is why this amendment will not go \ninto effect if, within 3 years, the service providers end up offering \nsuch technologies voluntarily.\n  This is what we would like to do. We think it is a fair amendment. We \nthink it is something that should be done, and we think responsible \nInternet service providers should be willing to do this, and I am very, \nvery pleased to offer this with my esteemed colleague who has worked \nvery, very hard on all software Internet issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the generous comments of the \nSenator from Utah. This can be propounded later on, but we will be \nvoting on this one tomorrow. I ask unanimous consent it be in order to \nask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, the Lautenberg, the Craig, \nand the Brownback amendments at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the Lautenberg amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, on the Hatch-Leahy Internet \namendment, let me just say I have worked on a number of these issues \nwith the distinguished Senator from Utah. I think this is one that \nshould get very broad support in this body.\n  I have talked for years about how we should allow the users of the \nInternet to control limited access to objectionable material that can \nbe found on line. Anybody with any kind of ability at all can find \nobjectionable material on line. It fits the standard of objectionable \nby any of us in this body. Some of it is disgusting and obscene and \nnothing I would want even my adult children to see.\n  But there is also a lot of amazing and wonderful material in this \nrelatively new communication medium when you can go on the Internet and \nsee people exploring in Antarctica or on Mount Everest, or see surgery \nbeing performed experimentally, or talk with astronauts on our space \nshuttle. These are the wonderful things on line and should be \nencouraged.\n\n  What worries me is when Congress tries to regulate content on the \nInternet. I have opposed that. For example, I was against the \nCommunications Decency Act, eventually found unconstitutional by the \nSupreme Court. The law was passed with the best of intentions. It was \ndone to protect children from indecent on-line materials, something all \nof us as parents want to do. It did it by empowering the Government and \nwas, thus, unconstitutional.\n  What we should do is empower individual users and parents to decide \nwhat material is objectionable. This belongs to parents and users. \nAlso, it brings parents and their children closer together if they \nactually work together and look at what is on the Internet.\n  The amendment Senator Hatch and I have offered will require large on-\nline service providers to offer subscribers filtering software systems \nthat will stop material parents find objectionable from reaching their \ncomputer screen.\n  I am supportive of voluntary industry efforts to provide Internet \nusers with one-click-away resources on how to protect their children as \nthey go on line. Senator Campbell, the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, and I joined the Vice President at the White House just last \nweek to hear about this One Click Away Program. Vice President Gore, \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, I, and others across the political \nspectrum joined together to say this is something parents want, need, \nand can use.\n  Our amendment promotes the use of filtering technologies by Internet \nusers. It is a far better, more constitutional alternative to \nGovernment censorship. I commend the distinguished Senator from Utah. I \nappreciate working with him on this. While I realize we will not vote \non this one until tomorrow morning, I look forward to joining the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah and encourage all Senators of both \nparties to vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am honored to have my colleague work with \nme on this. It always makes me feel good when we work together on these \nmatters. This is an important issue, and since one ISP, or Internet \nservice provider, already provides these services as a matter of \ncourse, it seems to us it is not asking too much for others to do so. \nIf they do not want to do it without cost, then they should not charge \nmore than what the actual costs are, which is what this amendment does.\n  Do we have the yeas and nays on this amendment, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We do.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be put over \nand set aside until tomorrow morning, to be voted on at 9:40 in the \nmorning with at least 6 minutes divided equally between the Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Utah for final debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, we are coming in at 9:30 a.m., so we \nhave allowed for the prayer and 6 minutes for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont and the Senator from Utah. Of course, if the majority \nleader wants to change the times--I understand the 9:30 time is all \nright with the majority leader, but if he wants to change it, we will \nbe glad to do that.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Kansas \nis here. I understand he is prepared to go forward. There is 5 minutes \nto be equally divided between him and whoever decides to speak on the \nminority side. I suggest we go ahead and be prepared to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator have a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that we proceed at this time on \nthe three amendments and the three votes, with the 5 minutes equally \ndivided for each one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 329\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as the vote nears on the amendment that \nI have proposed, along with the chairman and Senator Lieberman and a\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nnumber of others--and I will be asking for a recorded vote--I thank \nthem for their work on this issue. The chairman has done tireless work \nin trying to do things to clean up the culture, and also in this \njuvenile justice bill to address issues here which I think are \ncritically important. Senator McCain, with his leadership on the \nCommerce Committee, has elevated the issues, as well as Senator \nLieberman in his work, and Senator Sessions as well.\n  I also note the addition of Senator Kent Conrad as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment, and I appreciate all of his support.\n  There has been much discussion today about the causes and cures of \nyouth violence. As I have noted before, I do not believe my amendment--\nthis amendment--is a panacea for all that ails us, but it is a modest \nand necessary first step towards encouraging a sense of corporate \nresponsibility among some of the most powerful corporations in the \nworld--corporations with incredible access to the minds of young \npeople--and towards gaining a better understanding of the impact of \ncultural influences on youth violence.\n  I firmly believe that youth violence is not merely, or even \nprimarily, a public policy problem; it is a cultural and a moral \nproblem.\n  We live in a society, unfortunately, that glorifies violence. Popular \nculture is awash in violence. It is glorified in gangsta rap songs, \nglamorized in movies with vigilante heroes, and simulated in numerous \nvideo games. Violence, carnage, destruction and death is presented not \nas a horror but as entertainment for our young people--young people \nwhose minds, hearts, moral sense, manners, behavior, convictions, and \nconscience are still being developed.\n\n  Recently, the Pope denounced what he called a ``culture of death,'' a \nculture that rewards the producers of violent entertainment with \nlucrative contracts and critical acclaim, celebrates the casual cruelty \nand consequence-free violence depicted in movies and music, that \nmarkets the simulation of mass murder in games that were sold to \nchildren. His remarks should give us much to think about. This is not \nsomething we can fix with legislation, but it should be raised and \ndiscussed and seriously considered, not only on the floor of the \nSenate, but in homes, studios, and corporate boardrooms across America.\n  Nothing in this amendment curtails freedom of expression in any way. \nIt does not restrict the entertainment industry in any way. Rather, it \ngives entertainment companies more freedom, enabling--not requiring but \nenabling--them to enter into a voluntary code of conduct. Such a code \nwould spell out what the company standards are, what products they \nwould be putting forward, and would set a line that the industry would \nsay below this we will not go, and say that to the public.\n  This amendment also provides for further studies on the impact and \nmarketing of violent entertainment. We need to know more, and we need \nto start now. The first step towards addressing problems is to \naccurately define them.\n  Mr. President, I say, in conclusion on this amendment, we are here \ntoday saying that it is time to address this. It is time for us to step \nforward and be serious about it. It is time for us to renew the culture \nin America. This amendment is a first step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I will ask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate \ntime on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, for 7 years now as a member of the \nSenate Judiciary committee I have watched the situation in this nation \ngoing from bad to worse to terrible with respect to violence and its \nglorification in the media.\n  I am voting for this amendment because I believe it gives the various \nindustries what they need to be able to establish voluntary guidelines \nthrough a voluntary ``code of conduct'' to limit the depictions of \nviolence in music, films, video games or television.\n  This amendment provides the entertainment industry with an exemption \nfrom antitrust laws in order to develop and disseminate voluntary codes \nof conduct with respect to violence, similar to the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters television code prior to 1983, when a court \nhelt the code violated antitrust laws.\n  Additionally, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission \nwill be directed to conduct a joint investigation of the marketing \npractices used by the makers of video games, music and motion pictures \nto determine whether they engage in deceptive marketing practices, \nincluding directly targeting material to minors, which is unsuitable \nfor minors.\n  Furthermore, the National Institutes of Health will be directed to \nconduct a study of the effects of violent video games and music on \nchild development and youth violence, examining whether and to what \nextent such violence affects the emotional and psychological \ndevelopment of juveniles and whether it contributes to juvenile \ndelinquency and youth violence.\n  The glorification of violence in the media has reached such an extent \nthat a manufacturer of interactive computer games to young people \nadvertises: ``Kill your friends, guilt free.''\n  With such messages of death and degradation delivered through the \nmedia, and with our nation awash with guns easily accessible to young \npeople, is it any surprise that troubled youths are now taking up these \nweapons and going on rampages, killing their classmates and teachers?\n  The latest of these tragedies occurred in Littleton, Colorado, where \nEric Harris spent hours and hours playing violent computer games like \nDoom and Quake, featuring the wholesale slaughter of digital enemies \nbefore joining his friend Dylan Klebold in killing 12 other students \nand a teacher.\n  Isn't it time, at the very least, that the manufacturers of video \ngames, television programs, motion pictures and music acknowledge the \nimpact on young people of the carnage they promulgate and demonstrate \nthrough a voluntary code of conduct some willingness to limit the \nviolence?\n  Isn't it time that the entertainment industry does its best to \ndiscourage the production and promotion of gratuitous, simulated death \nand destruction that all too often triggers real and terrifying acts of \nviolence by our young people?\n  Isn't it time that we in Congress direct the Justice Department and \nthe Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether deceptive marketing \npractices are being employed to target minors?\n  Isn't it time that we in Congress direct the National Institutes of \nHealth to study the effect of these violent video games and music on \nour young people?\n  Isn't it time that we do everything we can to stop tragedies like \nLittleton from happening again?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I rise to cosponsor this measure, \nwhich aims to provide us with a better understanding of how violence in \nour culture is marketed to children and encourage industry to take \nself-regulatory steps to reduce this violence. Just as important, it \nwill help us determine whether the video game industry is breaking its \npromise and targeting ultraviolent games to minors.\n  Mr. President, as we look to find meaning--or to develop policy--in \nthe wake of the Littleton tragedy, it is clear that there's no single \nanswer as to how we can prevent such a terrible event from happening \nagain. Indeed, throughout my time in the Senate, I've worked very hard \nfor a comprehensive approach: Prevention programs for at-risk kids, \nlaws that try to restrict minors from getting handguns, strong \npunishments for folks who use guns to commit a crime and for truly \nviolent juveniles, and reasonable restrictions on providing \ninappropriate information to children. My sense is that by the time we \ncomplete action on this juvenile justice bill, many of these issues \nwill be addressed in productive, bipartisan ways.\n  But one part of this comprehensive approach that I'll focus on today \nis the marketing of violence to children, especially in ultraviolent \nvideo games. Senator Lieberman and I have worked very hard on this \nissue for quite some time, and we've made some progress since we first \nheld joint hearings on the video game industry back in 1993. Since \nthen, the industry has rated all games, giving parents a far better \nsense of what they are buying for their kids. Recently, though, we have \nseen\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nsome disturbing signs of ``backsliding,'' especially on enforcement of \nthe ratings system.\n  Let me give you just a few examples. The Interactive Digital Software \nAssociation--which represents video game manufacturers--has an \nAdvertising Code of Conduct that says, ``Companies should not \nspecifically target advertising to [underage] consumers.'' But the \ncompanies who produce games like ``Duke Nukem'' and ``Resident Evil''--\nboth rated ``M'' for age seventeen and up--sell action figures from \ntheir games at Toys-R-Us to much younger children.\n  That is not only wrong, it is unacceptable.\n  Make no mistake about it: Though these games are for adults, the \nmanufacturers are marketing to our kids. That's why we think an FTC/DOJ \nstudy--one that separates out the bad actors from the good ones and \ngives this disturbing trend the scrutiny it deserves--is not just an \nappropriate response, it is also a timely one. And while the evidence \nis much clearer with respect to video games than other forms of \nentertainment, what harm can there be in a study? It might just prove \nsome folks in the industry are doing a good job.\n  Mr. President, this amendment also includes an antitrust exemption \nfor the entertainment industry so its members can collaborate on a \n``code of conduct'' and how best to implement the various ratings \nsystems. It is not entirely clear that the industry actually needs this \n``safe harbor,'' but again, there is no harm to reenacting and \nexpanding Senator Simon's measure.\n  Of course, Mr. President, these measures are certainly no panacea--no \nlaw can be. But they each represent a small step that we in Congress \ncan take as our national community gains a better understanding of what \nkind of violent images our children face today and what effect it is \nhaving on them. For if we do not take the time to learn more about the \nroot causes of youth violence and, instead, blindly make scapegoats out \nof games or artists or movies we simply don't like, we might as well \nknow nothing at all. Thank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand the thrust of what the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas wishes to do. I am inclined to agree \nwith him.\n  I am worried that his amendment may be creating not just one, but two \nantitrust exemptions in the bill. I do not want, nor do I expect that \nhe would want to create unnecessarily large loopholes in our antitrust \nlaws.\n  I will support his amendment so we can go on to conference with it, \nbecause what he is trying to accomplish is something I think the \nmajority of us here in this Senate would want to accomplish. I suggest \nthat the distinguished Senator, between the time this bill leaves the \nSenate and goes to conference, may want to work with the distinguished \nSenator from Utah and myself to make sure that we do not create an \nantitrust exemption that goes beyond what the distinguished Senator \nwishes to accomplish.\n  I am not suggesting such an expertise in antitrust law that I could \ntell him precisely how we might do that, but there are a couple red \nflags here. My recommendation is that we pass the amendment, but then \nthat the three of us, and any other Senators who may be interested, may \nwant to look at it closely to make sure that it is drafted, one, to \naccomplish exactly what all of us want to accomplish, but, two, not to \nraise an antitrust problem in another area.\n  With that, Mr. President, I am perfectly willing to yield back the \nremainder of my time, if there is any time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n329. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) would vote ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is \nthe Lautenberg amendment is next and there are 5 minutes to be equally \ndivided before I make a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes equally divided prior to \nthe motion to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't believe the time should start until \nthe Senate is in order. The Senator from New Jersey is entitled to be \nheard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 331\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my amendment is pretty simple. It does \nnothing more than close a loophole--that exists at gun shows--from the \nBrady law. The loophole allows criminals, children, and other \nprohibited persons to purchase guns at gun shows without a background \ncheck, without giving them a name, without giving them an address. Just \ntake it away. Pay your money and take your gun.\n  Some people may be surprised to hear you can walk into a show, put \nyour money on the table, walk away with a shotgun, semiautomatic, \nhandgun or any other deadly weapon that you want to get your hands on. \nIt is an unacceptable condition. We have to insist that all gun \npurchases at gun shows go through the background checks that a gun \nstore has to have or that any federally licensed gun dealer will have \nto have.\n  Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear from this amendment. They \ncan buy a gun to the limits already established. All they have to do is \nconsent to an instant background check which takes only minutes. This \nwon't inconvenience. It will save lives and reduce injuries.\n  This isn't a time for partisan politics. Our country has seen too \nmuch gun violence. If we reflect a little bit, see what happened in \nColorado. Understand that at Columbine High School those guns traveled \ntheir way through gun shows to get into the hands they did. Too many \nparents have seen their children killed. Too many families have been \ntorn with grief as they understand what has happened to a child--\nunbelievably, in a school.\n  Let us work together. I plead with my colleagues, let us pass this \nmeasure. Who does it hurt? It doesn't hurt anybody and it may save \nsomeone. Let's make it harder for young people and criminals to gain \naccess to guns.\n\n  I think we are reaching a consensus on this issue. There is a broad \nrange of bipartisan support for closing the gun show loophole. An \nextraordinary alliance supports closing the gun loophole, including gun \ndealers, law enforcement, Republicans, Democrats, the Bradys.\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n  I hope we can come together, pass this amendment, and show the \nAmerican people that Democrats and Republicans alike, the gun industry, \nlaw enforcement and handgun control, can put partisan politics aside \nand pass this commonsense legislation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, you are being asked to table the Lautenberg \namendment and to vote up or down on the Craig amendment.\n  There are very real differences in these two amendments. First of \nall, there are 40,000 gun laws spread across America. There are 5,000 \ngun shows and 5 million people attending them on a regular basis.\n  The question is, Is there a loophole in the law through which illegal \nactivity is going on? If the 1986 gun act is right --that many of you \nvoted on--that says that private citizens have the right to engage in \nlegal transactions, then there is no loophole. In fact, this Justice \nDepartment says that less than 2 percent of the guns found in criminal \nuse were sold at gun shows.\n  What do we do about it? There were 20 laws broken in Littleton, CO. \nMany people are dead. Laws were broken and now people are being \narrested for having violated those laws.\n  What I offer is a reasonable way to begin to shape gun shows and \nallow law-abiding citizens the right of access to the FBI instant check \nsystem so if they are engaged in the sale of a gun they can make sure \nthat they are safe in that sale. Therefore, we provide an instant check \ncapability at a gun show.\n  What the Senator from New Jersey did not say is if you are selling at \na gun show and you are a licensed dealer, you already come under \nFederal law. No child, no juvenile walks into a gun show and buys a \ngun. It is against the law in this country and it is against the law in \nevery State. Nothing should be represented to say anything different. \nThat is the law.\n  There is a 40-percent sale at a gun show between private citizens, \nprivate citizens who are protected under the 1986 gun act who do not \nengage in gun sales for business purposes.\n  The Senator from New Jersey goes on to say when two people meet and \nthere are 50 guns present and they exchange a gun, that is a gun show. \nYou have a lot of friends and neighbors that are gun collectors and all \nof a sudden they find themselves libel.\n  He also goes on to say promoters must register. Who is a promoter? \nHow about the Mariott Hotel across the street from the convention \ncenter of the gun show that has a sign on the marquee; ``Gun sales. \nPeople attending the gun show stay here.'' Is that a promotion?\n  I don't know how to define that definition.\n  These are the realities of the issues we deal with. I have a much \nmore aggressive, voluntary approach that rapidly begins to tighten down \nwhile at the same time protecting the civil liberties of our citizens.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 331. The yeas and nays are ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

There now are 5 minutes equally \ndivided on the Craig amendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HATCH. Will either side object to yielding back the time so \neverybody can vote?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will Senators please take their conversations \noff the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have spoken earlier about this. The Craig amendment, \nas drafted, dismisses pending and future lawsuits against some firearms \ndealers. And I say ``some,'' because the way it is drafted it is not \nclear, but it throws out State court cases, Federal court cases, gives \nblanket immunity. I think that goes to such special interests on gun \nlegislation that we ought to reject it, even in this setting.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  It is unfortunate we could not take this step forward on the \nLautenberg amendment. Let me just inform my colleagues that the Craig \namendment would not be a status quo amendment, but it would be a big \nstep back, for three reasons.\n  One was mentioned by Senator Leahy, that it would exempt certain \npeople--it is unclear who--from liability. No. 2, it expands the pawn \nshop loophole. The law now is if you are a criminal, you have to get a \nbackground check when you redeem your gun at a pawn shop. Under the \nCraig amendment, that background check would be erased--no check.\n  And most significantly of all, the Craig amendment repeals a \nsignificant portion of the 1968 gun control act. Right now, if you are \na licensed Federal firearms dealer, you can only sell guns at your \nlicensed premises or at a gun show in your State. Under the Craig \namendment, you could go anywhere in the country and sell your gun. It \nis a significant step backward.\n  I had hoped the Senate would take what would be, in my judgment, a \nstep forward on Lautenberg. But please let us not take a step backward, \nwhich we would be doing if we voted for this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have to deal with the facts and we have \nto deal with what is in print. Is there a liability exemption? Yes. If \nyou are a new registrant, and you do a background check, and you play \nby the rules at a gun show, or if you are a new licensed dealer at a \ngun show, those are the incentives to get there. We are not exempting \nanybody. What we are saying, by definition--on page 14 it clearly \nspells out what a qualified civil liability action is.\n\n  What the Senator from New York just said is not true. I have not \nchanged any Federal law except to deal with gun shows. I am sorry he \nhas misinterpreted it that way. You cannot have it both ways. If you \nare a registered firearms dealer, and a Federal dealer, you have to \nmeet those standards and qualifications. You do not ramble around the \ncountry. You do not do interstate sales. That is against the law. And \nhe knows it.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n  But what we are saying, to encourage background checks, to encourage \nparticipation at a gun show--under the legal status now, remember, \nthese guns that are sold by individuals without background checks are \nlegal under the law, but we want to tighten it up. So we say, we will \nprotect your liability, not your negligence but your liability, if you \nget a license and become registered and do background checks and keep a \nrecord.\n  And if you choose not to do that, but you still want to protect \nyourself, we are putting a new registrant in each gun show qualified by \nthe ATF and the FBI, and you walk over to them and say: I want to sell \ngun ``X'' to person ``Y.'' Run a background check on them to find out \nif they are a legal citizen. That is the new law. That is the \nincentive.\n  If you believe in the right of free citizens to own a gun, but you \nwant to create incentives to create the kind of thing we are talking \nabout here, then you vote for this amendment. But you do not change the \nlaw; you do not create interstate trafficking. That is against the law \nnow, and it will always be.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that immediately following this \nvote, Senator Thurmond be recognized for up to 5 minutes for debate and \nSenator Hollings then be recognized as under the previous order for up \nto 30 minutes under his control for debate on his TV violence \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. In light of this agreement, there will be no further votes \ntoday. The first vote tomorrow will be at 9:40 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Craig \namendment No. 332. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague for yielding \nme this time.\n  I am very pleased that we are considering S. 254, Violent and Repeat \nJuvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act. This \nlegislation is badly needed to help states effectively confront youth \ncrime and violence.\n  The recent murders in Littleton, Colorado were random and senseless \nacts of violence. There are no Federal laws, including the bill we are \nconsidering here, that would have prevented this terrible tragedy. \nHowever, the events there highlight the importance of having an \neffective policy to deter and combat youth crime and violence. Children \naged 15 to 19 committed over 20 percent of all crime in 1997, including \n20 percent of all violent crime. America must have safe schools where \nstudents can learn, and this bill is part of this Congress' efforts to \nhelp families and communities provide this security.\n  The states have responsibility over almost all juvenile offenders, \nand this legislation provides hundreds of millions of dollars to assist \nstates in their efforts. In part, it contains flexible block grants to \nhelp states hold violent juveniles accountable for their actions. The \nmoney can be used for a wide variety of initiatives according to the \nneeds of the states, including drug testing, boot camps, and detention \nfacilities. It also encourages states to implement graduated sanctions \nfor young offenders. This early intervention with appropriate penalties \nat the first signs of trouble is essential to deterring more serious \ncrime down the road.\n  Further, the bill provides almost an equal amount of money, over $400 \nmillion, that can be used for prevention programs. Indeed, the key \nfeature of S. 254 is that it provides a balance between prevention and \naccountability. While prevention is important, it is not alone the \nsolution to violent criminal activity.\n  During the consideration of this bill, there will probably be more \ndiscussion about gun laws. This legislation takes a responsible, \nreasoned approach in this regard, prohibiting someone who commits a \nviolent felony as a juvenile from possessing firearms. Gun control is \nnot the solution to America's crime problem.\n  Before we take a reactive approach to putting more Federal gun laws \non the books, we should consider whether the laws we already have are \nbeing adequately enforced. My Subcommittee on Criminal Justice \nOversight in the Judiciary Committee recently held a joint hearing with \nthe Youth Violence Subcommittee on gun prosecutions in the Justice \nDepartment. We discovered that gun prosecutions during the Clinton \nadministration have declined considerably from the Bush administration. \nUnfortunately, the Clinton administration is just beginning to take \nnotice of programs, modeled after Bush administration successes, which \naggressively prosecute the gun laws already on the books. In Richmond, \nVirginia, a concerted effort to enforce gun laws has reduced violent \ncrime almost 40 percent. The Congress is working to expand successes \nsuch as this into other cities.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Congress to address violent crime \ncommitted by young people, and S. 254 represents the most comprehensive \nFederal effort to address this problem in American history. I hope we \ncan work together to enact this critical legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 328\n\n (Purpose: To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require that the \n    broadcast of violent video programming be limited to hours when \nchildren are not reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of \n                             the audience)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\n   TITLE  --CHILDREN'S PROTECTION FROM VIOLENT TELEVISION PROGRAMMING\n\n     SEC.  --01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC.  --02. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences the perception children have of \n     the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) pervasive presences in the lives of all American \n     children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young age have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of \n     others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Because some programming that is readily accessible to \n     minors remains unrated and therefore cannot be blocked solely \n     on the basis of its violent content, restricting the hours \n     when violent video programming is shown is the least \n     restrictive and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a \n     compelling governmental interest.\n       (10) Warning labels about the violent content of video \n     programming will not in themselves prevent children from \n     watching violent video programming.\n       (11) Although many programs are now subject to both age-\n     based and content-based ratings, some broadcast and non-\n     premium cable programs remain unrated with respect to the \n     content of their programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming that has in fact been rated for \n     violence.\n       (13) Technology-based solutions will not be installed in \n     all newly manufactured televisions until January 1, 2000.\n       (14) Even though technology-based solutions will be readily \n     available, many consumers of video programming will not \n     actually own such technology for several years and therefore \n     will be unable to take advantage of content based ratings to \n     prevent their children from watching violent programming.\n       (15) In light of the fact that some programming remains \n     unrated for content, and given that many consumers will not \n     have blocking technology in the near future, the channeling \n     of violent programming is the least restrictive means to \n     limit the exposure of children to the harmful influences of \n     violent programming.\n       (16) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, are unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solution, or are unable to determine the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n\n     SEC. --03. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO \n                   PROGRAMMING.\n\n       Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 715. UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO \n                   PROGRAMMING.\n\n       ``(a) Unlawful Distribution.--It shall be unlawful for any \n     person to distribute any violent video programming to the \n     public during hours when children are reasonably likely to \n     comprise a substantial portion of the audience.\n       ``(b) Rulemaking proceeding.--The Commission shall conduct \n     a rulemaking proceeding to implement the provisions of this \n     section and shall promulgate final regulations pursuant to \n     that proceeding not later than 9 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Children's Protection from Violent \n     Programming Act. As part of that proceeding, the Commission--\n       ``(1) may exempt from the prohibition under subsection (a) \n     programming (including news programs and sporting events) \n     whose distribution does not conflict with the objective of \n     protecting children from the negative influences of violent \n     video programming, as that objective is reflected in the \n     findings in section 551(a) of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996;\n       ``(2) shall exempt premium and pay-per-view cable \n     programming; and\n       ``(3) shall define the term `hours when children are \n     reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of the \n     audience' and the term violent video programming'.\n       ``(c) Envorcement.--\n       ``(1) Civil penalty.--The Commission shall impose a civil \n     penalty of not more than $25,000 on any person who violates \n     this section or any regulation promulgated under it for each \n     such violation.

SEPARABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this title, or any provision of an \n     amendment made by this title, or the application thereof to \n     particular persons or circumstances, is found to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this title or that \n     amendment, or the application thereof to other persons or \n     circumstances shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. --05. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The prohibition contained in section 715 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (as added by section--03 of this \n     title) and the regulations promulgated thereunder shall take \n     effect 1 year after the regulations are adopted by the \n     Commission.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand in the debate on this \nparticular amendment I can have a V-chip device. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I may have that on the floor during the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As I understand it from the managers of the bill, on \nthe 3-hour agreement, we are to be allocated 1\\1/2\\ hours per side, \nwith me introducing the particular amendment tonight and using a half \nhour. I ask the Chair to call my hand at 15 minutes, because I have \ndivided that time with the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so informed.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic moment for this Senator and the \nSenate in that I hearken back to 1969, 30 years ago, when the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Pastore, raised the question of \nviolence on television and the deleterious effect it had on children \nand their particular conduct. After much wrangling and debate, it was \nforestalled for what? A Surgeon General's report. Mind you me, this is \n30 years ago. I say ``historic'' because the stonewalling has been \ngoing on for 30 years.\n  Mr. President, I refer to the Sunday program of ``Meet the Press'' \nwhen my distinguished friend, Mr. Jack Valenti of the Motion Pictures \nAssociation, was being interviewed by Tim Russert.\n  I refer exactly to Mr. Russert's question:\n\n       Do you believe that movies can create a sense of violence \n     in people and force them to imitate or copy what they see on \n     the screen, particularly children?\n\n  In response, Mr. Valenti said:\n\n       The answer is I don't know. This is why I've supported \n     Senator Joe Lieberman's call for the surgeon general to do an \n     in-depth analysis to find out the ``why'' of violence.\n\n  Thereupon, of course, my distinguished friend, Mr. Valenti, went into \nhis dog and pony show of the church, the home, and the school.\n  Now, there it is, Mr. President. For 30 years, we have been trying to \nget a measure of this kind up, and it was reported out with only one \ndissenting vote from the Commerce Committee in the congressional \nsession before last, and again with only one dissenting vote, in a \nbipartisan fashion, in the last Congress. But we couldn't get it up \nbecause they have been very clever about their opposition, their \nstonewalling, their put-off.\n\n  Right to the point, Mr. President, we have done everything possible \nto show that this particular amendment would pass constitutional muster \nwith all the hearings. There have been some 18 sets of hearings in the \nCommerce Committee over the 30-year period, with the support of the \nParent-Teacher Association, the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, and different other ones,\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\naccording to this kind of action, with the industry putting in its \nreport, with the cable television people sponsoring it, and finding the \nsame conclusion in here just last year--and with, of all things, the \nput-off that we had under the leadership of Senator Paul Simon of \nIllinois. He said the industry ought to be able to get together. But \nthey couldn't on account of the antitrust laws. He wanted to lapse \nthose antitrust laws for a period of time so they could get together \nand form a code of conduct.\n  They issued that code of conduct. Of all things, Mr. President, they \nhave been ever since in violation of it.\n  But I want to refer to the bill itself, and exactly what it does in \nthe sense of having a precedent set, and the idea of TV indecency. We \nhad indecency on TV. It was bothersome to all of the colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We passed a law that the FCC should determine \nindecency and call the stations' hands if they saw that being violated. \nObviously, that thing was taken up immediately under the First \nAmendment of the Constitution and in the Supreme Court. They found it \nconstitutional.\n  Incidentally, in the hearings that we had back a few years ago, we \nhad none other than Attorney General Reno attest to the fact that this \nparticular amendment that I now submit would pass constitutional \nmuster. The amendment prohibits the distribution of violent video \nprogramming during the hours when children are reasonably likely to \ncomprise a substantial portion of the audience.\n  That is tried and true. We know in the United Kingdom, France, \nBelgium, countries in Europe, and down under in Australia, that they \nhave had this safe harbor during a period of time, say, from 9 in the \nmorning until 9 in the evening. I think under the indecency one, it is \nfrom 6 in the morning until 10 in the evening. But it is to be \ndetermined by the Federal Communications Commission.\n  Under that safe harbor, they are not shooting each other in the \nschools in Europe. They are not shooting each other in the schools in \nAustralia. It is tried and true. It has been working. And the issue has \nbeen taken up to the highest court and found constitutional.\n  The FCC is required to define ``violent programming'' and determine \nthe appropriate timeframe for the safe harbor.\n  The bill permits the FCC to exempt news and sports programming from \nthe safe harbor, as well as premium and pay-per-view cable programming.\n  Incidentally, the emphasis is on gratuitous--excessive, gratuitous \nviolence.\n  Obviously, with the Civil War series, with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' \nthey are going to require a showing of violence for the authenticity of \nthe film itself. That is not what we are really concerned with. Those \nare educational, and everyone should know about them, including \nchildren. But we are talking about gratuitous violence not being \nnecessary, and even excessive gratuitous violence.\n  We have legislated in the matter of public interest, after hearings \nin all of these committees. We have the most restrictive application \nunder the decisions of the Court with respect to the FCC making its \nfindings. Violators of the prohibition would be fined up to $25,000 for \neach violation on each day on which a violation occurs. The FCC would \nrevoke the licenses of repeat violators of this prohibition. In \nconsidering license renewals, the FCC would consider a licensee's \nrecord of compliance with the legislation.\n  Why, Mr. President, the big objection?\n  We go back. I counsel my friend, Mr. Valenti, to get the three-volume \nset of ``The History of Broadcasting of the United States,'' the Oxford \nPress.\n  I will turn to that first chapter talking about, in 1953, where we \nhad the film ``Man Against Crime.'' I read from page 23, a quote that \nthe writers received for this plot instruction. I think it is very, \nvery important that everybody pay attention to this one. I quote:\n\n       It has been found that we retain audience interest best \n     when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although \n     other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, \n     preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come.\n\n  Could there be any better evidence than their writing of their own \nhistory of broadcasting to say: Look, the issue here is money. As long \nas it is going to be supported and, more so, supported with violence, \nthen more money is made. And let's get up to the Congress.\n  I sort of became amused about these term limitations. We have up \nhere. I am in my 33rd year. We are finally getting the measure that \nSenator Pastore had in mind when he was put off with the Surgeon \nGeneral study, which was formulated finally in 1972.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe summary of that Surgeon General report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Television and Growing Up: the Impact of Television Violence\n\n\n summary of report to the surgeon general, U.S. Public Health service \n   from the U.S. surgeon general's scientific advisory committee on \n                  television and social behavior, 1972\n\n       The work of this committee was initiated by a request from \n     Senator John O. Pastore to Health, Education, and Welfare \n     Secretary Robert H. Finch in which Senator Pastore said:\n       ``I am exceedingly troubled by the lack of any definitive \n     information which would help resolve the question of whether \n     there is a causal connection between televised crime and \n     violence and antisocial behavior by individuals, especially \n     children. . . . I am respectfully requesting that you direct \n     the Surgeon General to appoint a committee comprised of \n     distinguished men and women from whatever professions and \n     disciplines deemed appropriate to devise techniques and to \n     conduct a study under this supervision using those techniques \n     which will establish scientifically insofar as possible what \n     harmful effects, if any, these programs have on children.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     Effects on aggressiveness: Evidence from experiments\n       Experiments have the advantage of allowing causal inference \n     because various influences can be controlled so that the \n     effects, if any, of one or more variables can be assessed. To \n     varying degrees, depending on design and procedures, they \n     have the disadvantages of artificiality and constricted time \n     span. The generalizability of results to everyday life is a \n     question often not easily resolvable.\n       Experiments concerned with the effects of violence or \n     aggressiveness portrayed on film or television have focused \n     principally on two different kinds of effects: imitation and \n     instigation. Imitation occurs when what is seen is mimicked \n     or copied. Instigation occurs when what is seen is followed \n     by increased aggressiveness.\n       Imitation: One way in which a child may learn a new \n     behavior is through observation and imitation. Some 20 \n     published experiments document that children are capable of \n     imitating filmed aggression shown on a movie or television \n     screen. Capacity to imitate, however, does not imply \n     performance. Whether or not what is observed actually will be \n     imitated depends on a variety of situational and personal \n     factors.\n       No research in this program was concerned with imitation, \n     because the fact that aggressive or violent behavior \n     presented on film or television can be imitated by children \n     is already thoroughly documented.\n       Instigation. Some 30 published experiments have been widely \n     interpreted as indicating that the viewing of violence on \n     film or television by children or adults increases the \n     likelihood of aggressive behavior. This interpretation has \n     also been widely challenged, principally on the ground that \n     results cannot be generalized beyond the experimental \n     situation. Critics hold that in the experimental situation \n     socially inhibiting factors, such as the influence of \n     social norms and the risk of disapproval or retaliation, \n     are absent, and that the behavior after viewing, through \n     labeled ``aggressive,'' is so unlike what is generally \n     understood by the term as to raise serious questions about \n     the applicability of these laboratory findings to real-\n     life behavior.\n       The research conducted in this program attempted to provide \n     more precise and extensive evidence on the capacity of \n     televised violence to instigate aggressive behavior in \n     children. The studies variously involve whole television \n     programs, rather than brief excerpts; the possibility of \n     making constructive or helping, as well as aggressive, \n     responses after viewing; and the measurement of effects in \n     the real-life environment of a nursery school. Taken as a \n     group, they represent an effort to take into account more of \n     the circumstances that pertain in real life, and for that \n     reason they have considerable cogency.\n       In sum. The experimental studies bearing on the effects of \n     aggressive television entertainment content on children \n     support certain conclusions. First, violence depicted on \n     television can immediately or shortly thereafter induce \n     mimicking or copying by children. Second, under certain \n     circumstances television violence can instigate an increase \n     in aggressive acts. The accumulated evidence, however, does \n     not warrant the conclusion that televised violence has a \n     uniformly adverse effect nor the conclusion that it has an \n     adverse effect on the majority of children.\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\n     It cannot even be said that the majority of the children in \n     the various studies we have reviewed showed an increase in \n     aggressive behavior in response to the violent fare to which \n     they were exposed. The evidence does indicate that televised \n     violence may lead to increased aggressive behavior in certain \n     subgroups of children, who might constitute a small portion \n     or a substantial proportion of the total population of young \n     television viewers. We cannot estimate the size of the \n     fraction, however, since the available evidence does not come \n     from cross-section samples of the entire American population \n     of children.\n       The experimental studies we have reviewed tell us something \n     about the characteristics of those children who are most \n     likely to display an increase in aggressive behavior after \n     exposure to televised violence. There is evidence that among \n     young children (ages four to six) those most responsive to \n     television violence are those who are highly aggressive to \n     start with--who are prone to engage in spontaneous aggressive \n     actions against their playmates and, in the case of boys, who \n     display pleasure in viewing violence being inflicted upon \n     others. The very young have difficulty comprehending the \n     contextual setting in which violent acts are depicted and do \n     not grasp the meaning of cues or labels concerning the make-\n     believe character of violence episodes in fictional programs. \n     For older children, one study has found that labeling \n     violence on a television program as make-believe rather than \n     as real reduces the incidence of induced aggressive behavior. \n     Contextual cues to the motivation of the aggressor and to the \n     consequences of acts of violence might also modify the impact \n     of televised violence, but evidence on this topic is \n     inconsistent.\n       Since a considerable number of experimental studies on the \n     effects of televised violence have now been carried out, it \n     seems improbable that the next generation of studies will \n     bring many great surprises, particularly with regard to \n     broad generalizations not supported by the evidence \n     currently at hand. It does not seem worthwhile to continue \n     to carry out studies designed primarily to test the broad \n     generalization that most or all children react to \n     televised violence in a uniform way. The lack of \n     uniformity in the extensive data now at hand is much too \n     impressive to warrant the expectation that better measures \n     of aggression or other methodological refinements will \n     suddenly allow us to see a uniform effect.\n     Effects on aggressiveness: Survey evidence\n       A number of surveys have inquired into the violence viewing \n     of young people and their tendencies toward aggressive \n     behavior. Measures of exposure to television violence \n     included time spent viewing, preference for violent \n     programming, and amount of viewing of violent programs. \n     Measures of aggressive tendencies variously involved self and \n     others' reports of actual behavior, projected behavior, and \n     attitudes. The behavior involved varied from acts generally \n     regarded as heinous (e.g., arson) to acts which many would \n     applaud (e.g., hitting a man who is attacking a woman).\n       All of the studies inquired into the relationship between \n     exposure to television violence and aggressive tendencies. \n     Most of the relationships observed were positive, but most \n     were also of low magnitude, ranging from null relationships \n     to correlation coefficients of about .20. A few of the \n     observed correlation coefficients, however, reached .30 or \n     just above.\n       On the basis of these findings, and taking into account \n     their variety and their inconsistencies, we can tentatively \n     conclude that there is a modest relationship between exposure \n     to television violence and aggressive behavior or tendencies, \n     as the latter are defined in the studies at hand. Two \n     questions which follow are: (1) what is indicated by a \n     correlation coefficient of about .30, and (2) since \n     correlation is not in itself a demonstration of causation, \n     what can be deducted from the data regarding causation?\n       Correlation coefficients of ``middle range,'' like .30, may \n     result from various sorts of relationships, which in turn may \n     or may not be manifested among the majority of the \n     individuals studied. While the magnitude of such a \n     correlation is not particularly high, it betokens a \n     relationship which merits further inquiry.\n       Correlation indicates that two variables--in this case \n     violence viewing and aggressive tendencies--are related to \n     each other. It does not indicate which of the two, if either, \n     is the cause and which the effect. In this instance the \n     correlation could manifest any of three causal sequences:\n     --That violence viewing leads to aggression;\n     --That aggression leads to violence viewing;\n     --That both violence viewing and aggression are products of a \n     third condition or set of conditions.\n       The data from these studies are in various ways consonant \n     with both the first and the third of these interpretations, \n     but do not conclusively support either of the two.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     General implications\n       The best predictor of later aggressive tendencies in some \n     studies is the existence of earlier aggressive tendencies, \n     whose origins may lie in family and other environmental \n     influences. Patterns of communication within the family and \n     patterns of punishment of young children seem to relate in \n     ways that are as yet poorly understood both to television \n     viewing and to aggressive behavior. The possible role of mass \n     media in very early acquisition of aggressive tendencies \n     remains unknown. Future research should concentrate on the \n     impact of media material on very young children.\n       As we have noted, the data, while not wholly consistent or \n     conclusive, do indicate that a modest relationship exists \n     between the viewing of violence and aggressive behavior. The \n     correlational evidence from surveys is amenable to either of \n     two interpretations: that the viewing of violence causes the \n     aggressive behavior, or that both the viewing and the \n     aggression are joint products of some other common source. \n     Several findings of survey studies can be cited to sustain \n     the hypothesis that viewing of violent television has a \n     causal relation to aggressive behavior, though neither \n     individually nor collectively are the findings conclusive. \n     They could also be explained by operation of a ``third \n     variable'' related to preexisting conditions.\n       The experimental studies provide some additional evidence \n     bearing on this issue. Those studies contain indications \n     that, under certain limited conditions, television viewing \n     may lead to an increase in aggressive behavior. The evidence \n     is clearest in highly controlled laboratory studies and \n     considerably weaker in studies conducted under more natural \n     conditions. Although some questions have been raised as to \n     whether the behavior observed in the laboratory studies can \n     be called ``aggressive'' in the consensual sense of the term, \n     the studies point to two mechanisms by which children might \n     be led from watching television to aggressive behavior: the \n     mechanism of imitation, which is well established as part of \n     the behavioral repertoire of children in general; and the \n     mechanism of incitement, which may apply only to those \n     children who are predisposed to be susceptible to this \n     influence. There is some evidence that incitement may follow \n     nonviolent as well as violent materials, and that this \n     incitement may lead to either prosocial or aggressive \n     behavior, as determined by the opportunities offered in the \n     experiment. However, the fact that some children behave more \n     aggressive in experiments after seeing violent films is well \n     established.\n       The experimental evidence does not suffer from the \n     ambiguities that characterize the correlational data with \n     regard to third variables, since children in the experiments \n     are assigned in ways that attempt to control such variables. \n     The experimental findings are weak in various other ways and \n     not wholly consistent with one study to another. \n     Nevertheless, they provide suggestive evidence in favor of \n     the interpretation that viewing violence on television is \n     conducive to an increase in aggressive behavior, although it \n     must be emphasized that the causal sequence is very likely \n     applicable only to some children who are predisposed in this \n     direction.\n       Thus, there is a convergence of the fairly substantial \n     experimental evidence for short-run causation of aggression \n     among some children by viewing violence on the screen and the \n     much less certain evidence from field studies that extensive \n     violence viewing precedes some long-run manifestations of \n     aggressive behavior. This convergence of the two types of \n     evidence constitutes some preliminary indication of a \n     causal relationship, but a good deal of research remains \n     to be done before one can have confidence in these \n     conclusions.\n       The field studies, correlating different behavior among \n     adolescents, and the laboratory studies of the responses by \n     younger children to violent films converge also on a number \n     of further points.\n       First, there is evidence that any sequence by which viewing \n     television violence cause aggressive behavior is most likely \n     applicable only to some children who are predisposed in that \n     direction. While imitative behavior is shown by most children \n     in experiments on that mechanism of behavior, the mechanism \n     of being incited to aggressive behavior by seeing violent \n     films shows up in the behavior only of some children who were \n     found in several experimental studies to be previously high \n     in aggression. Likewise, the correlations found in the field \n     studies between extensive viewing of violent material and \n     acting in aggressive ways seem generally to depend on the \n     behavior of a small proportion of the respondents who were \n     identified in some studies as previously high in aggression.\n       Second, there are suggestions in both sets of studies that \n     the way children respond to violent film material is affected \n     by the context in which it is presented. Such elements as \n     parental explanations, the favorable or unfavorable outcome \n     of the violence, and whether it is seen as fantasy or reality \n     may make a difference. Generalizations about all violent \n     content are likely to be misleading.\n       Thus, the two sets of findings converge in three respects: \n     a preliminary and tentative indication of a causal relation \n     between viewing violence on television and aggressive \n     behavior; an indication that any such causal relation \n     operates only on some children (who are predisposed to be \n     aggressive); and an indication that it operates only in some \n     environmental contexts. Such tentative and limited \n     conclusions are not very satisfying. They represent \n     substantially more knowledge than we had two years ago, but \n     they leave many questions unanswered.\n       Some of the areas on which future research should \n     concentrate include: (1) Television's effects in the context \n     of the effects of other mass media. (2) The effects of mass \n     media in the context of individual developmental history and \n     the totality of environmental influences, particularly that \n     of the home environment. In regard to the relationship \n     between\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\n     televised violence and aggression, specific topics in need of \n     further attention include: predispositional characteristics \n     of individuals; age differences; effects of labeling, \n     contextual cues, and other program factors; and longitudinal \n     influences of television. (3) The functional and \n     dysfunctional aspects of aggressive behavior in successfully \n     adapting to life's demands. (4) The modeling and imitation of \n     prosocial behavior. (5) The role of environmental factors, \n     including the mass media, in the teaching and learning of \n     values about violence, and the effects of such learning. (6) \n     The symbolic meanings of violent content in mass media \n     fiction, and the function in our social life of such content.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, a reading of that report will show a \ndefinite causal connection between TV violence and aggressive behavior \non the part of children. Time and time again it was shown.\n  But let me go to the next put-off that we had with my good friend, \nSenator Paul Simon.\n  I knew they had somebody to stop me here in the early 1990s.\n  He got his measure passed. So we couldn't get our bill up for a vote. \nWe had then a finding of standards for the ``Depiction of Violence in \nTelevision Programming'' issued by ABC, CBS, and NBC in December 1992.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Appendix B. Standards for the Depiction of Violence in Television \n                                Programs\n\n              (Issued by ABC, CBS, and NBC--December 1992)\n\n\n                                preface\n\n       The following standards for the Depiction of Violence in \n     Television Programs are issued jointly by ABC, CBS, and NBC \n     Television Networks under the Antitrust Exemption granted by \n     the Television Violence Act of 1990.\n       Each network has long been committed to presenting \n     television viewers with a broad spectrum of entertainment and \n     information programming. Each Network maintains its own \n     extensive published broadcast standards governing \n     acceptability of both program (including on-air promotion) \n     and commercial materials.\n       These new joint standards are consistent with each of the \n     Network's long-standing preexisting policies on violence. At \n     the same time they set forth in a more detailed and \n     explanatory manner to reflect the experience gained under the \n     preexisting policies. While adopting and subscribing to these \n     joint Standards, each Network will continue the tradition of \n     individual review of material, which will necessitate \n     independent judgments on a program-by-program basis.\n       The standards are not intended to inhibit the work of \n     producers, directors, writers, or to impede the creative \n     process. They are intended to proscribe gratuitous or \n     excessive portrayals of violence.\n       In principle, each of the ABC, CBS, and NBC Television \n     Networks is committed to presenting programs which portray \n     the human condition, which may include the depiction of \n     violence as a component. The following Standards for the \n     Depiction of Violence in Television Programs will provide the \n     framework within which the acceptability of content will be \n     determined by each Network in the exercise of its own \n     judgment.\n\n\n       standards for depiction of violence in television programs\n\n       These written standards cannot cover every situation and \n     must, therefore, be worded broadly. Moreover, the Standards \n     must be considered against the creative context, character \n     and tone of each individual program. Each scene should be \n     evaluated on its own merits with due consideration for its \n     creative integrity.\n       (1) Conflict and strife are the essence of drama and \n     conflict often results in physical or psychological violence. \n     However, all depictions of violence should be relevant and \n     necessary to the development of character, or to the \n     advancement of theme or plot.\n       (2) Gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence (or \n     redundant violence shown solely for its own sake), are not \n     acceptable.\n       (3) Programs should not depict violence as glamorous, nor \n     as an acceptable solution to human conflict.\n       (4) Depictions of violence may not be used to shock or \n     stimulate the audience.\n       (5) Scenes showing excessive gore, pain, or physical \n     suffering are not acceptable.\n       (6) The intensity and frequency of the use of force and \n     other factors relating to the manner of its portrayal should \n     be measured under a standard of reasonableness so that the \n     program, on the whole, is appropriate for a home viewing \n     medium.\n       (7) Scenes which may be instructive in nature, e.g., which \n     depict in an imitable manner, the use of harmful devices or \n     weapons, describe readily usable techniques for the \n     commission of crimes, or show replicable methods for the \n     evasion of detection or apprehension, should be avoided. \n     Similarly, ingenious, unique, or otherwise unfamiliar methods \n     of inflicting pain or injury are unacceptable if easily \n     capable of imitation.\n       (8) Realistic depictions of violence should also portray, \n     in human terms, the consequences of that violence to its \n     victims and its perpetrators. Callousness or indifference to \n     suffering experienced by victims of violence should be \n     avoided.\n       (9) Exceptional care must be taken in stories or scenes \n     where children are victims of, or are threatened by acts of \n     violence (physical, psychological or verbal).\n       (10) The portrayal of dangerous behavior which would invite \n     imitation by children, including portrayals of the use of \n     weapons or implements readily accessible to this \n     impressionable group, should be avoided.\n       (11) Realistic portrayals of violence as well as scenes, \n     images or events which are unduly frightening or distressing \n     to children should not be included in any program \n     specifically designed for that audience.\n       (12) The use of real animals shall conform to accepted \n     standards of humane treatment.

We have the \nopponents agreeing to this particular amendment. Of course not. They \nwill have Members move to table the amendment.\n  I am trying to plead for favorable consideration. All we are doing is \nwhat the industry--ABC, CBS, NBC--issued to themselves in their own \ncode of conduct.\n  I read:\n\n       Gratuitous or excessive depictions of violence are not \n     acceptable.\n\n  Exactly what we are saying in this amendment.\n  Again I read:\n\n       Programs should not depict violence as glamorous.\n\n  That is exactly what we found last year in the National Television \nViolence Study. This study is too voluminous to print in the Record. It \nis what they found in the cable TV-sponsored study with the most \noutstanding authorities imaginable conducting this study. Various \ncampuses were represented, as I recall. Included were the Society for \nAdolescent Medicine, the National Cable Television Association, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Producers Guild of America, American \nSociological Association, the Caucus for Producers and Writers, the \nAmerican Bar Association. They say it is too glamorous.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have those names in support printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           National Television Violence Study Council Members\n\n       Trina Menden Anglin, M.D., Ph.D, Society of Adolescent \n     Medicine.\n       Decker Anstrom (Ex Officio), National Cable Television \n     Association.\n       Char Beales, Cable and Telecommunications: A Marketing \n     Society.\n       Darlene Chavez, National Education Association.\n       Belva Davis, American Federation of Television and Radio \n     Artists.\n       Carl Feinstein, M.D., American Psychiatric Association.\n       Charles B.

Otherwise, the industry \nassociates--writers, producers and everyone else--follow exactly what \nthey found in the history of broadcasting in the 1950s, 40-some years \nago, that violence pays.\n  I retain the remainder of our time, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator from South Carolina for raising a \nnumber of important issues concerning the quality of TV programming and \nother programming.\n  I remember very distinctly a number of years ago I was watching when \nthe Pope came to California and in Hollywood met with top executives. \nHe met with them, encouraged them, and urged them to do a better job, \nand to start to clean up some of the things being shown on television.\n  When the program was over, they came out to the TV cameras. They \ninterviewed each one of these executives and asked what happened, and \nwhat they thought. They said the Pope had made a number of very \nimportant suggestions that deserved great consideration and they \nthought they could make some progress toward his goals.\n  Charlton Heston came out. They asked: Mr. Heston, what do you think? \nMr. Heston, do you think things will get better? Mr. Heston said: If \nthe Lord himself were speaking to them, they wouldn't change. The only \nthing they are looking at is the rating.\n  Since then, things have continued to get worse. I have always \nremembered that. I think it is fair to say that violence apparently \npays. They are looking for ratings and money. It does leave us with a \ndifficult question of what we can do to make this a healthier society, \na society that is better for raising children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5151-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, all Americans were disturbed and very \nsorry about NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. \nThe President has apologized to the Chinese people, and it was, of \ncourse, appropriate for him to do so. I think it is also right that \nthose responsible for this tragic error are held accountable for their \nmistake. I know that neither apologies nor other responses will \nalleviate the suffering of those who lost loved ones in the bombing. \nBut America does sincerely regret what happened, and as inadequate as \nthat might be to a grieving parent or spouse or friend, it will have to \nbe enough for the Government of China.\n  It is outrageous that Beijing would claim, suggest or even hint to \nthe Chinese people that the bombing was intentional. It was a mistake \nand the leaders of China know that. They do us and themselves a great \ndisservice by pretending otherwise. States that aspire to be great \npowers should not indulge paranoid delusions as a means of motivating \ntheir people. The political consequences are seldom predictable or as \neasy to manage as they might have anticipated.\n  America and China have a complex, important, and very consequential \nrelationship that will, in large part, shape the history of the next \ncentury. That relationship should not be jeopardized as cavalierly as \nBeijing has allowed it to be jeopardized over these last few days.\n  China must cease immediately fueling anti-Americanism and tolerating \nthe attacks it engendered on our embassy and on Americans in China. \nChina should cease immediately its calumnies against the United States. \nAmerica is a just power, and the greatest force for good on Earth. A \nvery regrettable accident does not change that historical fact, and \nBeijing knows it. Finally, China should cease immediately to threaten \nthe other elements of our relationship, be they human rights \ndiscussions, anti-proliferation cooperation or trade agreements. A \nsound bilateral relationship is a vital interest for both of us, and, \nindeed, for the world. Both countries' leaders must conduct themselves \nwith that priority in mind at all times.\n  China should accept our apology confident that it is sincere, and \nbegin to play a constructive role in helping to persuade Milosevic that \nhe must accede to the just demands of humanity, and the, I hope, \nnonnegotiable demands of NATO.\n  Terrible things happen in war. People often make bad mistakes in the \nfog of battle. That is why decent people try to avoid resolving their \ndifferences by force of arms. But that is not always possible. The \nenemy of peace and justice in the Balkans, Milosevic and his regime, \nare not decent people. They are the cause of this war, and, thus, are \nultimately responsible for the tragedy that occurred last week, and the \nsuffering of the people of Serbia. Furthermore, the calamity that \nSerbia is now experiencing, as awful as it is, in no way approximates \nthe scale of the horror that has been visited on the Kosovars. Let us \nbe clear about that, Mr. President. Should Mr. Milosevic observe the \nmost basic standards of human decency no bombs would fall anywhere in \nthe Balkans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5151-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, yesterday I introduced a bill to assist \nin the preservation of the great apes. The bill, the ``Great Ape \nConservation Act of 1999'', is modeled after the highly successful \nAfrican and Asian Elephant Conservation Acts, and the Rhinoceros and \nTiger Conservation Act. It will authorize up to $5 million per year to \nfund various projects to aid in the preservation of the endangered \ngreat apes.\n  Great ape populations currently face many threats, including habitat \nloss, population fragmentation, live capture, and hunting for the \nbushmeat trade. Of all these threats, the danger posed by the \nincreasing bushmeat trade is the most severe. This trade is being \nfacilitated by the construction of inroads to logging areas, which \nallows once remote forests to be linked directly with urban markets.\n  Chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos, once hunted sustainably, now face \npopulation destruction due to increased illegal trade, powerful \nweapons, and high market prices. This consumption of ape meat not only \nthreatens ape populations, but poses severe health risks to humans. \nHuman contraction of many viruses, including the Human Immunodeficiency \nVirus (HIV) has\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\nbeen linked to the slaughter and consumption of apes. With the loss of \nape populations, comes the loss of critical medical knowledge that can \nbe obtained through simple, noninvasive research on wild populations. \nSome estimates suggest that several thousand apes are killed every year \nacross West and Central Africa, a level that is unsustainable and means \nthe certain destruction of viable populations in the very near future.\n  If we do not act now, not only will great apes face extinction, but \nthe ecosystems that depend on their contributions will suffer. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting legislation that can provide \nfunding to the local farming, education and enforcement projects that \ncan have the greatest positive impact. This small, but critical \ninvestment of U.S. taxpayer money, matched with private funds, could \nsecure the future of these extraordinary animals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5152-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5152-S5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION TO THE RECORD\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nVIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACCOUNTABILITY AND REHABILITATION \n                              ACT OF 1999\n\n  The text of amendments Nos. 326 and 328 did not appear in the Record \nof May 11, 1999.

APPLICABILITY OF CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY ACT TO \n                   FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Firearms are one of the few consumer products not \n     subject to consumer product safety regulations.\n       (2) There are currently no quality and safety standards in \n     place for domestically manufactured firearms. In contrast, \n     minimal quality and safety standards have been applied to \n     imported firearms since passage of the Gun Control Act of \n     1968.\n       (3) As a result, firearms made in the United States often \n     lack even the most basic safety features designed to prevent \n     unintentional shooting by children. Such features include \n     cylinder locks, trigger locks, magazine disconnect safety, \n     manual safety, and increased trigger resistance.\n       (4) In 1996 alone, 1,134 people were killed in the United \n     States by accidental firearm discharges, including 376 people \n     aged 19 years and under. In addition, 162 children aged 14 \n     years and under committed suicide using a firearm.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to reduce the \n     number of unintentional shootings in the United States each \n     year, especially among children, by permitting the Consumer \n     Product Safety Commission to regulate firearms and ammunition \n     so as to develop uniform safety standards and protect the \n     public against unreasonable risks of injury from firearms and \n     ammunition.\n       (c) Applicability of Consumer Product Safety Act.--Section \n     3(a)(1) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2052(a)(1)) is amended by striking subparagraph (E).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HOLLINGS AMENDMENT NO. 328\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 254, surpa; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n    TITLE--CHILDREN'S PROTECTION FROM VIOLENT TELEVISION PROGRAMMING\n\n     SEC.   SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children's Protection from \n     Violent Programming Act''.\n\n     SEC.   FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television influences the perception children have to \n     the values and behavior that are common and acceptable in \n     society.\n       (2) Broadcast television, cable television, and video \n     programming are--\n       (A) pervasive presences in the lives of all American \n     children; and\n       (B) readily accessible to all American children.\n       (3) Violent video programming influences children, as does \n     indecent programming.\n       (4) There is empirical evidence that children exposed to \n     violent video programming at a young are have a higher \n     tendency to engage in violent and aggressive behavior later \n     in life than those children not so exposed.\n       (5) Children exposed to violent video programming are prone \n     to assume that acts of violence are acceptable behavior and \n     therefore to imitate such behavior.\n       (6) Children exposed to violent video programming have an \n     increased fear of becoming a victim of violence, resulting in \n     increased self-protective behaviors and increased mistrust of \n     others.\n       (7) There is a compelling governmental interest in limiting \n     the negative influences of violent video programming on \n     children.\n       (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in \n     channeling programming with violent content to periods of the \n     day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial \n     portion of the television audience.\n       (9) Because some programming that is readily accessible to \n     minors remains unrated and therefore cannot be blocked solely \n     on the basis of its violent content, restricting the hours \n     when violent video programming is shown is the least \n     restrictive and most narrowly tailored means to achieve a \n     compelling governmental interest.\n       (10) Warning labels about the violent content of video \n     programming will not in themselves prevent children from \n     watching violent video programming.\n       (11) Although many programs are now subject to both age-\n     based and content-based ratings, some broadcast and non-\n     premium cable programs remain unrated with respect to the \n     content of their programming.\n       (12) Technology-based solutions may be helpful in \n     protecting some children, but may not be effective in \n     achieving the compelling governmental interest in protecting \n     all children from violent programming when parents are only \n     able to block programming that has in fact been rated for \n     violence.\n       (13) Technology-based solutions will not be installed in \n     all newly manufactured televisions until January 1, 2000.\n       (14) Even though technology-based solutions will be readily \n     available, many consumers of video programming will not \n     actually own such technology for several years and therefore \n     will be unable to take advantage of content based ratings to \n     prevent their children from watching violent programming.\n       (15) In light of the fact that some programming remains \n     unrated for content, and given that many consumers will not \n     have blocking technology in the near future, the channeling \n     of violent programming is the least restrictive means to \n     limit the exposure of children to the harmful influences of \n     violent programming.\n       (16) Restricting the hours when violent programming can be \n     shown protects the interests of children whose parents are \n     unavailable, are unable to supervise their children's viewing \n     behavior, do not have the benefit of technology-based \n     solutions, are unable to afford the costs of technology-based \n     solutions, or are unable to determinate the content of those \n     shows that are only subject to age-based ratings.\n\n     SEC.   . UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF VIOLENT VIDEO PROGRAMMING.\n\n       Title VII of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 701 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 715.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Nebraska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                       Legislative Resolution 69\n\n       Whereas, until 1993, the federal Natural Gas Policy Act of \n     1978 established the maximum lawful price that a natural gas \n     producer could charge its pipeline customers for natural gas, \n     providing under section 110 of the act that the producer \n     could adjust the maximum price upward in order to recover \n     from pipeline customers any state severance tax payments made \n     by the producer; and\n       Whereas, in 1988, in the case of Colorado Interstate Gas \n     Co. v. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 850 F. 2d \n     769, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit ruled that the ad valorem tax levied by the \n     State of Kansas was not a severance tax within the meaning of \n     section 110 of the Natural Gas Policy Act and ordered natural \n     gas producers to refund that portion of the payments received \n     from the pipelines attributable to the cost of the Kansas ad \n     valorem taxes paid plus interest; and\n       Whereas, upon remand of the matter to the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission, the commission ordered the refunds to \n     be made on that portion of all purchases which had included \n     Kansas ad valorem taxes which were charged after June 28, \n     1988, the date of the Appeals Court ruling in the Colorado \n     Interstate Gas Co. case; and\n       Whereas, in 1996, in the case of Public Service Company of \n     Colorado v. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 91 F. \n     3d 1478, the United States Court of Appeals for the District \n     of Columbia overruled the commission, holding that the \n     refunds should commence from October 1983, when notice was \n     filed in the Federal Register of the petition before the \n     commission challenging the propriety of including the Kansas \n     ad valorem taxes in the price charged for natural gas \n     produced in Kansas; and\n       Whereas, as of November 1997, the consumers of natural gas \n     in twenty-three states were entitled, pursuant to this ruling \n     and the subsequent order of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, to refunds and accrued interest from natural gas \n     producers for the period of October 1983 through June 1988, \n     amounting to more than $334,840,000, with Nebraska consumers \n     to receive approximately $34,360,000 (approximately ten \n     percent of the total); and\n       Wheres, of those sums, over 60 percent of the total is \n     accrued interest as of that date with additional interest \n     being compounded quarterly on unpaid balances and on those \n     sums not placed in escrow accounts pursuant to commission \n     order; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate and the United States \n     House of Representatives in their indiviudal versions of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999 (S. 544 and H.R. 1141) have provisions, added by \n     amendment, which would amend the Natural Gas Policy Act of \n     1978 to prohibit the commission or any court from ordering \n     the payment of any interest or penalties with respect to \n     ordered refunds of rates or charges made, demanded, or \n     received for reimbursement of State ad valorem taxes \n     in connection with the sale of natural gas before 1989; \n     and\n       Whereas, both acts were adopted by their respective houses \n     of the Congress on March 25 of this year, immediately prior \n     to their Easter adjournment and are pending consideration by \n     a Joint Appropriations Conference Committee; and\n       Whereas, legislation for the same purpose (S. 626 in the \n     Senate and H.R. 1117 in the House of Representatives) is \n     currently pending; and\n       Whereas, the sole result of the final adoption of these \n     amendments or these bills will be to mitigate or reduce the \n     liability of natural gas producers for charges wrongfully \n     imposed on consumers in the period of 1983 to 1988 by denying \n     consumers interest on the amount of those charges and \n     relieving the producers of any liability for future penalties \n     flowing from the failure to make court-ordered payments in \n     the prescribed manner; and\n       Whereas, the lost refunds to Nebraska natural gas consumers \n     will amount to more than 10 percent of the total reduction, \n     representing the fourth largest state loss of the twenty-four \n     states receiving court-ordered refunds; and\n       Whereas, Nebraska has been urged to join with other states \n     in petitioning Congress to reconsider the adoption of these \n     ill-advised and possibly unconstitutional provisions and \n     avoid future litigation at the expense of all parties \n     involved.\n       Now, Therefore, be it Resolved by the Members of the \n     Ninety-Sixth Legislature of Nebraska, First Session:\n       1. That the Legislature hereby petitions the Congress of \n     the United States to oppose the enactment of S. 626 and H.R. \n     1117 or any version thereof which would have the effect of \n     waiving interest or penalties of any kind with regard to \n     natural gas producer refunds of state ad valorem taxes \n     charged to consumers on the sale of natural gas before 1989.\n       2. That the Legislature hereby petitions the Congress of \n     the United States to reconsider its actions with regard to S. \n     544 and H.R. 1141 in the adoption of the amendments which \n     would have the effect of waiving interest or penalties of any \n     kind with regard to natural gas producer refunds of state ad \n     valorem taxes charged to consumers on the sale of natural gas \n     before 1989 and urges that the ultimate version of the \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999 as reported by the conference committee and adopted by \n     the Congress not include any provision having this effect.\n       3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the State ceiling on the low-income housing credit; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               Affordable Housing Opportunity Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Affordable \nHousing Opportunity Act of 1999. My colleague from my home state, Bob \nGraham, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, and 42 other \nmembers of the Senate join me as original cosponsors of this effort to \nmake sure that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is not undercut by the \neffects of inflation.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is one federal housing program that \nworks. It works to produce affordable rental housing by allowing states \nto distribute tax credits to those who invest in apartments for low \nincome families. It works because it is decentralized, it is market-\noriented, and it relies on the private sector.\n  The Low Income Housing Tax Credit works because it is based on sound \neconomics. This is in stark contrast to the alternative government \napproach to the problem of a scarcity of privately owned, affordable \nhousing units, the approach of rent control. Under rent\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\ncontrol, owners are restricted in the price they can charge for their \napartments. Since this dramatically reduces the return on their \ninvestment in housing, potential owners of rental units take their \nmoney elsewhere. The result, confirmed in a study of rent control in \nCalifornia in the early 1990s, is that rent control actually reduces \nthe number of rental units available for low income families.\n  There is a better way. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit is that way. \nUnder this program, tax credits are allocated by states and their \nlocalities to investors in low income housing. In return for agreeing \nto charge low rents for the units produced, the investors receive a tax \ncredit that makes up for the financial risk of the investment. Instead \nof mandating low rents, the program provides an incentive for property \nowners to charge low rents.\n  And, as Adam Smith would have predicted, this incentive does the job. \nSince 1987, state agencies have allocated over $3 billion in Housing \nCredits to help finance nearly one million apartments for low income \nfamilies, including 70,000 apartments in 1997. In my own state of \nFlorida, the Credit is responsible for helping finance over 52,000 \napartments for low income families, including 3,300 apartments in 1997. \nThe demand for Housing Credits nationwide currently outstrips supply by \nmore than three to one.\n  Despite the success of the Housing Credit in meeting affordable \nrental housing needs, the apartments it helps finance can barely keep \npace with the nearly 100,000 low cost apartments which are demolished, \nabandoned, or converted to market rents each year. This is because the \ncredit has been set at an annual amount of $1.25 per resident of each \nstate, since its creation in 1986. To make up for the loss in value of \nthe credit due to inflation, we propose to increase this amount to \n$1.75 per resident and to index the amount for future inflation. It has \nbeen estimated that this will increase the stock of critically needed \nlow income apartments by 27,000 each year.\n  There has long existed in this body a dedication to affordable \nhousing, an interest that knows no party lines. One of the major, early \nproponents of federally supported affordable housing was Senator Robert \nA. Taft of Ohio, known in his day as Mr. Republican, whose monument \nchimes regularly just a few hundred yards from here. With this strong, \nbipartisan pedigree, I have no hesitation in asking my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to join me to enact this proposal--which is \nsimilar to one contained in the President's budget and is supported by \nthe nation's governors and mayors and the affordable housing \ncommunity--to ensure the continued vitality of a program that works.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable Housing \n     Opportunity Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN STATE CEILING ON LOW-INCOME HOUSING \n                   CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Clause (i) of section 42(h)(3)(C) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to State housing \n     credit ceiling) is amended by striking ``$1.25'' and \n     inserting ``$1.75''.\n       (b) Adjustment of State Ceiling for Increases in Cost-of-\n     Living.--Paragraph (3) of section 42(h) of such Code \n     (relating to housing credit dollar amount for agencies) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(H) Cost-of-living adjustment.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In the case of a calendar year after \n     2000, the dollar amount contained in subparagraph (C)(i) \n     shall be increased by an amount equal to--\n\n       ``(I) such dollar amount, multiplied by\n       ``(II) the cost-of-living adjustment determined under \n     section 1(f)(3) for such calendar year by substituting \n     `calendar year 1999' for `calendar year 1992' in subparagraph \n     (B) thereof.\n\n       ``(ii) Rounding.--If any increase under clause (i) is not a \n     multiple of 5 cents, such increase shall be rounded to the \n     next lowest multiple of 5 cents.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to calendar years after 1999.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mack to introduce the Affordable Housing Opportunity \nAct of 1999. This legislation would raise the annual limit on state \nauthority to allocate low-income housing tax credits from $1.25 to \n$1.75 per capita, and to index the cap to inflation.\n  Since its creation in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the low income \nhousing tax credit program has been a tremendous success that has \ngenerated nearly a million units of housing for low and moderate income \nfamilies. In my home state of Florida the tax credit has produced over \n52,000 affordable rental units, valued at over $2.2 billion, including \n3,300 apartments in 1997.\n  This housing tax credit is a valuable incentive for developers to \nbuild and rehabilitate low-income housing. It encourages the \nconstruction and renovation of low income housing by reducing the tax \nliability placed on developers of affordable homes. The credit is based \non the costs of development as well as the percentage of units devoted \nto low-income families.\n  The low income housing tax credit not only helps developers but also \nbenefits families. Those families that get up and go to work every day \nto earn their rent and mortgage payments, the low income housing tax \ncredit provides families with an important stake in maintaining self-\nsufficiency. By supporting this credit we make the American dream more \navailable to all Americans.\n  This credit has succeeded as a catalyst in bringing new sources of \nfunding to low income housing development. This is particularly \nimportant at a time when decreasing appropriations for federally-\nassisted housing and the elimination of other tax incentives for rental \nhousing production have only grown. While this success is gratifying, \nwe should not take for granted the continued growth of this program.\n  Under the current formula used to fund this program, each state is \nlocated $1.25 multiplied by the State's population. Unlike other \nprovisions of the Tax Code, this formula has not been adjusted since \nthe credit was created in 1986. During the same period, inflation has \neroded the credit's purchasing power by nearly 45 percent, as measured \nby the Consumer Price Index. This cap is strangling state capacity to \nmeet the pressing low income housing needs.\n  By increasing the cap on this credit to $1.75, we will free the 12 \nyear cap on housing credit from it current limitations, as requested by \nour Nation's governors, and we will liberate states' capacity to help \nmillions of Americans who still have no decent, safe, affordable place \nto live.\n  A brief look at the history of the housing credit provides ample \nevidence of why we need our legislation. Nationwide, demand for housing \ncredits outstrips supply by a ratio of three to one. In 1998, states \nreceived applications requesting more than 1.2 billion in housing \ncredits--far surpassing the $365 million in the credit authority \navailable to allocate that year. This trend coupled with the fact that \nevery year nearly 100,000 low cost apartments are demolished, \nabandoned, or converted to market rate use makes clear the need for \nthis legislation. Increasing the cap as I propose would allow states to \nfinance approximately 27,000 more critically needed low income \napartments each year using the housing credit.\n  In the last Congress, sixty seven Senators cosponsored this \nlegislation, including nearly two-thirds of the Finance Committee, \nraising the low income housing tax credit to $1.75 and indexing it for \ninflation. Nearly 70 percent of the House Ways and Means Committee and \na total of 299 House Members cosponsored legislation proposing the same \nincrease.\n  That indicates just how much support this program has in the \nCongress. Also, the Administration, the nation's governors and mayors, \nother state and local government groups, and the affordable housing \ncommunity strongly support this increase. I am confident with all this \nsupport that this measure will finally pass this year. I urge all my \ncolleagues to embrace this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. EDWARDS:\n  S. 1018. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict judges in the State of North Carolina, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\n                 Justice for Western North Carolina Act\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Justice for \nWestern North Carolina Act--legislation that will create an additional \npermanent district court judgeship and an additional temporary district \ncourt judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina.\n  The Western District of North Carolina is one of the most overworked \ndistricts in the United States. And it is strained almost to the \nbreaking point. The statistics tell the tale: its judges have the \nheaviest caseload of all the district courts in the Fourth Circuit. \nThat means of all the district court judges working in Maryland, \nVirginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina--no other \njudges have a more crushing workload. Indeed, they deal with a caseload \nalmost twice that recommended for any federal judge. The nonpartisan \nJudicial Conference of the United States, the principal policymaking \nbody for the federal court system, believes that no judge should handle \nmore than 430 weighted case filings. Well, the judges in the Western \nDistrict have a weighted filing per judge of 703.\n  The people of western North Carolina feel the impact of this burden. \nCriminal felony cases take longer to deal with in western North \nCarolina than any other district in the country but two. And businesses \nhave to wait almost two years to have their lawsuits heard before a \njury. Business disputes, Social Security claims, civil rights \ndisputes--all of them are needlessly delayed when we in the Senate fail \nto fulfill our responsibility to ensure the prompt administration of \njustice.\n  Three able Western District Court judges are doing their utmost to \ndeal with this deluge. But they need our help. And we have failed to \naddress the need sooner. It has been more than twenty years since \nCongress authorized the Western District's third judgeship. In 1978, \nthere were 775 raw case filings. Last year, there were more than 7,000. \nIt is folly to think that three judges should be able to handle the \nnearly tenfold increase in case filings in the Western District.\n  Nor is there any relief from a growing caseload in sight. North \nCarolina is in the midst of a population boom. Since the 1990 census, \nthe state's population grew by 12%. The Charlotte metropolitan area, \nwhich is in the western district of North Carolina, grew by 19 percent \nsince 1990, making it the tenth fastest growing region in the country \nduring this period. This growth in population, business, and industry \ntranslates into more commercial, corporate, and criminal law cases.\n\n  Mr. President, more than any other justice system in the world, ours \nprovides fair and equal administration of justice. We put this at risk \nwhen we do not have enough judges. When judges are overworked, they may \nbe unable to give each case the attention it deserves. The maxim that \n``justice delayed is justice denied'' is absolutely true. Slow justice \ndoes not just affect the litigants. With commercial cases involving \nmajor corporations, it can also hurt employees and consumers, as well. \nMoreover, we cheapen the Constitution when we fail to authorize the \nresources necessary for the federal judiciary--one of the three, \ncoequal branches of government--to adequately serve society. Congress \nmust respect the principle of an independent federal judiciary by \nensuring that federal judges are not so consumed by the backlog of \ncases that they are not able to give the cases that come before them \nthe attention they deserve.\n  The legislation I propose puts into effect the recent recommendation \nmade by the Judicial Conference. The Judicial Conference works to \nensure that the federal judiciary delivers equal justice under law. On \nMarch 16 of this year, it recommended that we add one permanent and one \ntemporary judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina. The \nChief Justice serves as the presiding officer of the nonpartisan \nJudicial Conference. The membership of the Conference includes the \nchief judges of the 13 courts of appeals, a district judge from each of \nthe 12 geographic circuits, and the chief judge of the Court of \nInternational Trade.\n  No one, at least no one I know, disagrees that the Western District \nis overworked. But some people have proposed the misguided solution of \neliminating a judgeship from the Eastern District of North Carolina and \ntransferring it to the Western District. I think that eliminating a \njudge from the Eastern District would be a real mistake, as big a \nmistake as not creating new judgeships in the Western District. The \nproposal is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  Eliminating a judgeship from the Eastern District would leave it in \nthe same painful position that the Western District is in now. Last \nyear, the Eastern District had 2056 weighted filings, or 514 for each \nof its four judgeships, easily above the national average of 484. \nTaking away a judgeship from the Eastern District would result in a \nweighted caseload per judge of 685. Transferring a judgeship from the \nEastern to the Western District would do no more than switch the \nproblem from the west to the east.\n\n  I am also very concerned about the effect this elimination would have \non Raleigh and the many people and companies who are based there and \ndepend on the federal judiciary. For the last twenty years, at least \none Eastern District judgeship has been filled by a judge presiding in \nRaleigh. Today, however, the three active judges in the Eastern \nDistrict reside in Elizabeth City, Greenville, and Wilmington, and most \nof the Eastern District's court sessions are held in those cities. It \nis important that those areas have judges, but it is also important \nthat there be a judge in Raleigh. If we transfer the unfilled judgeship \nto the west, we will do serious harm to our state capital.\n  Raleigh is the home of the main offices of the U.S. Attorney, the \nFederal Public Defender for the Eastern District, the Clerk of Court, \nthe United States Probation Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nfor the Eastern District, and the North Carolina Department of Justice. \nIn addition, many private lawyers who handle civil and criminal cases \nin the Eastern District come from Raleigh. Finally, the Raleigh \nmetropolitan area, which has more than one million people, is the fifth \nfastest growing urban area in the nation--swelling by 26 percent since \n1990. Eliminating a judgeship based in Raleigh would create unnecessary \nobstacles to the pursuit of fair administration of justice in that \ncity.\n  Mr. President, the marble facade on the Supreme Court building says, \n``Equal Justice Under Law.'' We in the Congress must not jeopardize \nthis principle by failing to provide the judiciary the resources it \nneeds to do its work. Therefore, I urge your support of the Justice for \nWestern North Carolina Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For the relief of Regine Beatie Edwards; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       Private Relief Legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to allow Regine Beatie Edwards, an 18 year old German-born \nlegal resident of the United States, to realize her lifelong dream of \nbecoming a United States citizen.\n  Miss Edwards is the adopted daughter of Mr. Stan Edwards, a U.S. \ncitizen who married Regine's mother while engaged in military service \nin Germany. Regine moved to the United States with her mother on \nOctober 16th, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards contacted the INS on several \noccasions, attempting to obtain the proper form to apply for Regine's \nnaturalization. The INS sent Mr. Edwards form N-643, Application for \nCertificate in Behalf of an Adopted Child. The INS informed Mr. Edwards \nthat the adoption had to be completed by the time Regine turned 18. The \nadoption was completed on January 13th, 1997, when Regine was 16\\1/2\\ \nyears of age. Mr. Edwards delivered Regine's application to the INS \noffice in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1998.\n  The INS reported in January of 1998 that the application was to be \ndenied since the adoption of Ms. Edwards had not been completed prior \nto her 16th birthday, and therefore form N-643 was the incorrect form \nfor application. Previously, the INS had told Mr. Edwards that the \nadoption need only be completed by Regine's 18th birthday. The INS then \nrefunded to Mr. Edwards the application fee and informed him that, \nbecause of her age, Regine met only three of four qualifications to \napply for citizenship. Had the INS told the Edwards that Regine needed \nto be adopted by the age of 16 in order to qualify for citizenship, the \nEdwards would have expedited the adoption process, and Regine would be \ncloser to her dream of citizenship.\n  This bill, passed during the last Congress by the Senate but not \nacted on by the House, would reclassify Regine as a child pursuant to \nsection 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act, thereby \nallowing the processing of her citizenship application.\n  Regine has stated that it has always been a goal of hers to live in \nthe United States, and to become a citizen of, as she puts it, ``a land \nof freedom and individual opportunity to seek out your dreams and \nrealize them.'' It would be tragic if we were to let a simple mistake \non the part of the INS prevent such a promising young woman from \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. I urge my fellow colleagues to support Regine \nby allowing her to make her dream of U.S. citizenship a \nreality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1020. A bill to amend chapter 1 of title 9, United States Code, to \nprovide for greater fairness in the arbitration process relating to \nmotor vehicle franchise contracts.\n\n\n       Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration fairness Act\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, I am introducing the Motor Vehicle \nFranchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act.\n  Over the years, I have been in the forefront of promoting alternative \ndispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms to encourage alternatives to \nlitigation when disputes arise. Such legislation includes the permanent \nuse of ADR by federal agencies. Last year we also passed legislation to \nauthorize federal court-annexed arbitration. These statutes are based, \nin part, on the premise that arbitration should be voluntary rather \nthan mandatory.\n  While arbitration often serves an important function as an efficient \nalternative to court some trade offs must be considered by both \nparties, such as limited judicial review and less formal procedures \nregarding discovery and rules of evidence. When mandatory binding \narbitration is forced upon a party, for example when it is placed in a \nboiler-plate agreement, it deprives the weaker party the opportunity to \nelect any other forum. As a proponent of arbitration I believe it is \ncritical to ensure that the selection of arbitration is voluntary and \nfair.\n  Unequal bargaining power exists in contracts between automobile and \ntruck dealers and their manufacturers. The manufacturer drafts the \ncontract and presents it to dealers with no opportunity to negotiate. \nIncreasingly these manufacturers are including compulsory binding \narbitration in their agreements, and dealers are finding themselves \nwith no choice but to accept it. If they refuse to sign the contract \nthey have no franchise. This clause then binds the dealer to \narbitration as the exclusive procedure for resolving any dispute. The \npurpose of arbitration is to reduce costly, time-consuming litigation, \nnot to force a party to an adhesion contract to waive access to \njudicial or administrative forums for the pursuit of rights under state \nlaw.\n  I am extremely concerned with this industry practice that conditions \nthe granting or keeping of motor vehicle franchises on the acceptance \nof mandatory and binding arbitration. While several states have enacted \nstatutes to protect weaker parties in ``take it or leave it'' contracts \nand attempted to prevent this type of inequitable practice, these state \nlaws have been held to conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA).\n  In 1925, when the FAA was enacted to make arbitration agreements \nenforceable in federal courts, it did not expressly provide for \npreemption of state law. Nor is there any legislative history to \nindicate Congress intended to occupy the entire field of arbitration. \nHowever, in 1984 the Supreme Court interpreted the FAA to preempt state \nlaw in Southland Corporation versus Keating. Thus, state laws that \nprotect weaker parties from being forced to accept arbitration and to \nwaive state rights (such as Iowa's law prohibiting manufacturers from \nrequiring dealers to submit to mandatory binding arbitration) are \npreempted by the FAA.\n  With mandatory binding arbitration agreements becoming increasingly \ncommon in motor vehicle franchise agreements, now is the time to \neliminate the ambiguity in the FAA statute. The purpose of the \nlegislation Senator Feingold and I are introducing is to ensure that in \ndisputes between manufacturers and dealers, both parties must \nvoluntarily elect binding arbitration. This approach would continue to \nrecognize arbitration as a valuable alternative to court--but would \nprovide an option to pursue other forums such as administrative bodies \nthat have been established in a majority of states, including Iowa, to \nhandle dealer/manufacturer disputes.\n  This legislation will go a long way toward ensuring that parties will \nnot be forced into binding arbitration and thereby lose important \nstatutory rights. I am confident that given its many advantages \narbitration will often be elected. But it is essential for public \npolicy reasons and basic fairness that both parties to this type of \ncontract have the freedom to make their own decisions based on the \ncircumstances of the case.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and myself in \nsupporting this legislation to address this unfair franchise \npractice.\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with \nmy distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the ``Motor \nVehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1999.''\n  While alternative methods of dispute resolution such as arbitration \ncan serve a useful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am \nextremely concerned by the increasing trend of stronger parties to a \ncontract forcing weaker parties to waive their rights and agree to \narbitrate any future disputes that may arise. Earlier this Congress, I \nintroduced S. 121, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, to amend \ncertain civil rights statutes to prevent the involuntary imposition of \narbitration to claims that arise from unlawful employment \ndiscrimination and sexual harassment.\n  It has come to my attention that the automobile and truck \nmanufacturers, which often present dealers with ``take it or leave it'' \ncontracts, are increasingly including mandatory and binding arbitration \nclauses as a condition of entering into or maintaining an auto or truck \nfranchise. This practice forces dealers to submit their disputes with \nmanufacturers to arbitration. As a result, dealers are required to \nwaive access to judicial or administrative forums, substantive contract \nrights, and statutorily provided protection. In short, this practice \nclearly violates the dealers' fundamental due process rights\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nand runs directly counter to basic principles of fairness.\n  Franchise agreements for auto and truck dealerships are typically not \nnegotiable between the manufacturer and the dealer. The dealer accepts \nthe terms offered by the manufacturer, or it loses the dealership. \nPlain and simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the \nstates to pass laws designed to balance the manufacturers' far greater \nbargaining power and to safeguard the rights of dealers. The first \nstate automobile statute was enacted in my home state of Wisconsin in \n1937 to protect citizens from injury caused when a manufacturer or \ndistributor induced a Wisconsin citizen to invest considerable sums of \nmoney in dealership facilities, and then canceled the dealership \nwithout cause. Since then, all states except Alaska have enacted \nsubstantive law to balance the enormous bargaining power enjoyed by \nmanufacturers over dealers and to safeguard small business dealers from \nunfair automobile and truck manufacturer practices.\n  A little known fact is that under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), \narbitrators are not required to apply the particular federal or state \nlaw that would be applied by a court. That enables the stronger party--\nin this case the auto or truck manufacturer--to use arbitration to \ncircumvent laws specifically enacted to regulate the dealer/\nmanufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of these laws \ninequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited acts that \nstate law provides.\n  The majority of states have created their own alternative dispute \nresolution mechanisms and forums with access to auto industry expertise \nthat provide inexpensive, efficient, and non-judicial resolution of \ndisputes. For example, in Wisconsin mandatory mediation is required \nbefore the start of an administrative hearing or court action. \nArbitration is also an option if both parties agree. These state \ndispute resolution forums, with years of experience and precedent, are \ngreatly responsible for the small number of manufacture-dealer \nlawsuits. When mandatory binding arbitration is included in dealer \nagreements, these specific state laws and forums established to resolve \nauto dealer and manufacturer disputes are effectively rendered null and \nvoid with respect to dealer agreements.\n  Besides losing the protection of federal and state law and the \nability to use state forums, there are numerous reasons why a dealer \nmay not want to agree to binding arbitration. Arbitration lacks some of \nthe important safeguards and due process offered by administrative \nprocedures and the judicial system: (1) arbitration lacks the formal \ncourt supervised discovery process often necessary to learn facts and \ngain documents; (2) an arbitrator need not follow the rules of \nevidence; (3) arbitrators generally have no obligation to provide \nfactual or legal discussion of the decision in a written opinion: and \n(4) arbitration often does not allow for judicial review.\n  The most troubling problem with this sort of mandatory binding \narbitration is the absence of judicial review. Take for instance a \ndispute over a dealership termination. To that dealer--that small \nbusiness person--this decision is of commercial life or death \nimportance. Even under this scenario, the dealer would not have \nrecourse to substantive judicial review of the arbitrators' ruling. Let \nme be very clear on this point; in most circumstances an arbitration \naward cannot be vacated, even if the arbitration panel disregarded \nstate law that likely would have produced a different result.\n  The use of mandatory binding arbitration is increasing in many \nindustries, but nowhere is it growing more steadily than the auto/truck \nindustry. Currently, at least 11 auto and truck manufacturers require \nsome form of such arbitration in their dealer contracts.\n  In recognition of this problem, many states have enacted laws to \nprohibit the inclusion of mandatory binding arbitration clauses in \ncertain agreements. The Supreme Court, however, held in Southland Corp. \nv. Keating, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984), that the FAA by implication preempts \nthese state laws. This has the effect of nullifying many state \narbitration laws that were designed to protect weaker parties in \nunequal bargaining positions from involuntarily signing away their \nrights.\n  The legislative history of the FAA indicates that Congress never \nintended to have the Act used by a stronger party to force a weaker \nparty into binding arbitration. Congress certainly did not intend the \nFAA to be used as a tool to coerce parties to relinquish important \nprotections and rights that would have been afforded them by the \njudicial system. Unfortunately, this is precisely the current \nsituation.\n  Although contract law is generally the province of the states, the \nSupreme Court's decision in Southland Corp. has in effect made any \nstate action on this issue moot. Therefore, along with Senator \nGrassley, I am introducing this bill today to ensure that dealers are \nnot coerced into waiving their rights. Our bill, the Motor Vehicle \nFranchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1999 would simply \nprovide that each party to an auto or truck franchise contract would \nhave the choice to select arbitration. The bill would not prohibit \narbitration. On the contrary, the bill would encourage arbitration by \nmaking it a fair choice that both parties to a franchise contract may \nwillingly and knowingly select. In short, this bill would ensure that \nthe decision to arbitrate is truly voluntary and that the rights and \nremedies provided for by our judicial system are not waived under \ncoercion.\n  In effect, if small business owners today want to obtain or keep \ntheir auto or truck franchise, they may be able to do so only by \nrelinquishing their statutory rights and foreclosing the opportunity to \nuse the courts or administrative forums. Mr. President, I cannot say \nthis more strongly--this is unacceptable; this is wrong. It is at great \nodds with our tradition of fair play. I therefore urge my colleagues to \njoin in this bipartisan effort to put an end to this invidious \npractice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 1021. A bill to provide for the settlement of claims of the \nMenominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 MENOMINEE TRIBAL FAIRNESS ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that would give a Congressional ``stamp of approval'' to a \nsettlement for which the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin has long \nawaited--a settlement that, in my opinion and in the opinion of the \nFederal Court that approved it last year, is long overdue.\n  Specifically, this bill--the ``Menominee Tribal Fairness Act of \n1999''--would enforce a settlement owed to the Menominee Tribe by the \nFederal government, whose termination of the Tribe's federal trust \nstatus resulted in enormous damage to the Menominee from 1954 to 1973. \nSix years ago, Congress passed a congressional reference that ordered \nthe U.S. Claims Court to report back regarding what damages, if any, \nwere owed the Tribe. Last year, the Court approved a $32 million \nsettlement, and now that we have settled the merits of the case, we \nsimply need congressional approval to conclude this 45-year-old matter \nonce and for all. Let me tell you why this legislation is crucially \nneeded.\n  When Congress passed the Menominee Termination Act of June 13, 1954, \nit ended the Tribe's federal trust status, effective in 1961. As a \nresult of termination, the Menominee Tribe plunged into years of severe \nimpoverishment and community turmoil. Indeed, according to a 1965 BIA \nstudy of conditions on the former reservation, the economic and social \neffects were disastrous. Unemployment was 26 percent, compared to \nWisconsin's 5 percent rate. The school dropout rate was 75 percent, and \nthe per capita income was less than one-third of the state average. The \nlocal hospital, which was built with tribal funds, was shut down \nbecause it could not meet state standards, effectively eliminating \nlocal health care services which in turn increased mortality rates.\n  Twelve years after termination, Congress recognized the economic and \nsocial devastation this Act had caused for the Tribe by passing the \nMenominee Restoration Act of 1973, which reinstated the Tribe's federal \ntrust status. Clearly, though, BIA mismanagement and termination \nthreatened to devastate the Tribe for generations to\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\ncome, and the Tribe subsequently sought relief for its recuperation.\n  The Menominee Tribe took this matter to the courts, and though it \nobtained favorable trial court judgments on the merits of its claims, \nthe Tribe encountered a series of technical roadblocks that prevented \nit from ever really having its case heard.\n  The Tribe then came to Congress for help. But it was not until 1993 \nthat Congress passed my proposal to settle this matter by sending it to \nthe Court of Claims and ordering the court to report back what damages \nthe Tribe was owed.\n  After extensive negotiation, the Federal government and the Menominee \nTribe agreed upon a settlement of the Tribe's claims for a sum of \n$32,052,547. The Claims Court, on August 12, 1998, reported back to \nCongress, concluding that the Tribe has stated legitimate claims and \nendorsing this settlement.\n  Now, to compensate the Tribe for damages and implement the decision \nof the Court of Claims, we must pass this legislation that authorizes \nthe payment of this agreed-to settlement. And the money does not have \nto be appropriated--it will simply be taken from a Treasury Department \n``judgment fund'' account.\n  Mr. President, the congressional reference procedure is designed so \nthat the court may examine claims against the United States based on \nnegligence or fault, or based on less than fair and honorable dealings, \nregardless of ``technical'' defenses that the United States may \notherwise assert, especially the statute of limitations.\n  In other words, it is to be used for precisely the types of \ncircumstances surrounding the Menominee Tribe. The tribe and its \nmembers suffered grievous economic loss through legislative termination \nof its rights and from BIA mismanagement of its resources. Indeed, the \nFederal governments' actions brought the Menominee Tribe to the brink \nof economic, social, and cultural disaster. In 1973, the tribe was \nrestored to Federal recognition and tribal status by action of the \nCongress. But the Tribe has yet to be compensated for the damages it \nsuffered.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to approve the Court's ruling, \nsupport this bill, and settle this case once and for all. And don't \ntake my word for it--this measure has been endorsed by the Chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and \nRepresentative Mark Green, who represents the district where the \nMenominee reservation is located.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full texts of my bill, the U.S. \nCourt of Federal Claims Report of the Review Panel, Court Order, and \nStipulation for Recommendation of Settlement, along with Chairman \nCampbell's letter of support for this measure, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Resolution requested that the \n     court ``report back to the Senate . . . providing such \n     findings of fact and conclusions that are sufficient to \n     inform the Congress of the nature, extent, and character of \n     the damages referred to in such bill as a legal or equitable \n     claim against the United States or a gratuity, and the \n     amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United \n     States to the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin by reason \n     of such damages.''\n       The proposed bill if enacted would authorize the payment, \n     ``out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not \n     otherwise appropriated,'' of ``a sum equal to the damages \n     sustained by the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin by reason of \n     ``(a) the enactment and implementation of the Act of June 17, \n     1954 (68 Stat. 250), as amended, and (b) the mismanagement by \n     the United States of the Menominee assets held in trust by \n     the United States prior to April 30, 1961, the effective date \n     of Termination of Federal supervision of the Menominee Indian \n     Tribe of Wisconsin.''\n       The Menominee Tribe filed with this court a complaint \n     alleging injury and damages that arose from the enactment and \n     implementation of the Menominee Termination Act, as well as \n     for various acts of mismanagement by the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs (BIA) during the period to Termination, 1951-1961. \n     Specific claims alleged were: Count (I) Congressional Breach \n     of Trust (``Basic'' claim); (II) Forest Mismanagement; (III) \n     Mill Mismanagement; (IV) Loss of Tax Exemption; (V) Loss of \n     Hospital; (VI) Highway Rights-of-Way; (VII) Power Lines; \n     (VIII) Public Water and Sewage Systems; (IX) Mismanagement of \n     Tribal Funds (Accounting); (X) Loss of Government Programs; \n     (XI) Imposition of Bond Debt; and (XII) Loss of Tribal \n     Property.\n       This case has a long history before this court. Many of the \n     claims at issue in this congressional reference were \n     litigated previously before the U.S. Court of Claims in the \n     case of Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, Nos. \n     134-67-A through -I, originally filed in April 1967. The case \n     concerned breach of trust and taking claims related to the \n     Termination of the Menominee Tribe and certain claims for \n     mismanagement of tribal\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\n     assets during the period prior to Termination (1951-1961). It \n     has been the subject of seven trial court decisions and four \n     decisions before the appellate court. Manominee Tribe v. \n     United States, 607 F.2d 1335 (Ct. CL. 1979) (congressional \n     breach of trust or ``Basic'' claim); Menominee Tribe v. \n     United States, 223 Ct. Cl. 632 (1980) (tax exemption statute \n     of limitations); Menominee Tribe v. United States, 726 F.2d \n     712 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (deed restrictions); Menominee Tribe v. \n     United States, 726 F.2d 718 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (forest \n     mismanagement). All of the dockets were ultimately dismissed \n     in 1984, seventeen years after they were filed, on statute-\n     of-limitations and jurisdictional grounds.\n       Relying on the substantial record developed in that earlier \n     case as well as on substantial supplemental evidence in the \n     current case, the parties in the present congressional \n     reference filed briefs with the court on the issue of \n     liability as to the first three counts of the Tribe's \n     complaint, as well as on the issue of whether there was good \n     cause for removing the bar of the statute of limitations. In \n     an opinion dated October 30, 1997, this hearing officer held \n     that the claims for Congressional Breach of Trust and forest \n     Mismanagement were not equitable claims for which damages \n     could be recommended; rather, payment of damages for these \n     claims would constitute a gratuity. See Menominee Indian \n     Tribe v. United States, 39 Fed. Cl. 441, 460-62 (1997). This \n     hearing officer held as to the Mill Mismanagement claim that \n     the issues presented were grounded in equity, but reserved to \n     a later time a decision on the merits and damages, if any, as \n     to each of the particular acts of mill mismanagement alleged \n     by the Tribe. See id. at 471. Finally, the hearing officer \n     held that there was good cause to remove the bar of the \n     statute of limitations, which had barred some of the claims \n     in the earlier case. See id. The Tribe has stated in the \n     stipulation filed by the parties its disagreement with the \n     hearing officer's holdings on the merits of Count I and II \n     and its intention, if the case were not settled, to appeal \n     the ruling to the review panel. The United States has \n     reserved the right to challenge the hearing officer's good-\n     cause ruling.\n       After those decisions were rendered, the parties entered \n     into settlement discussions and on August 11, 1998, the \n     parties filed with the hearing officer for approval a \n     stipulated settlement agreement, attached hereto, asking the \n     hearing officer to report to Congress that it has approved \n     the stipulation and recommends that Congress adopt it.\n       The parties have stipulated that the reference overall \n     includes proper equitable claims appropriate for settlement, \n     and though each side contests certain aspects of the case and \n     aspects of the decisions rendered by this hearing officer, \n     the parties have agreed that the case overall is appropriate \n     for compromise and settlement.\n       The stipulation of the parties, attached hereto, details \n     the claims and the damage award sought by the Tribe in this \n     reference for the twelve claims. The Tribe claims a total \n     value of $141 million on all of its claims. Although the \n     government does not concur in the Tribe's assessment of the \n     individual claims, it has negotiated terms of a settlement \n     with the Tribe that the parties believe to be fair, just, and \n     equitable. Although the parties did not agree on a settlement \n     value to each claim in the case, the parties have stipulated, \n     in compromise and settlement of the reference overall, that \n     the Menominee Tribe should be compensated in the amount of \n     $32,052,547 in total for its claims as a whole.\n       In issuing its opinion in 1997 with respect to the first \n     three counts, this hearing officer read all the findings and \n     conclusions of the prior litigation, as well as the appellate \n     opinions. In addition the hearing officer read all the expert \n     reports, irrespective of whether they were directed solely to \n     issues raised in the first three counts, and reviewed \n     virtually all the remaining documentary and testimonial \n     evidence. Because the settlement agreement encompasses not \n     only the three claims that were the subject of the prior \n     opinion, however, but also the remaining claims that have not \n     yet been heard on the merits in the present case, as well as \n     other claims that could have been alleged in the reference, \n     the hearing officer considered additional documentary \n     evidence and citations to the record as well as other \n     information to satisfy himself that the reference overall \n     includes claims equitable in nature. This evidence includes \n     documentary exhibits and an expert report bearing on the \n     Tribe's claim for mismanagement of funds. The government \n     reviewed this evidence as well and provided to the hearing \n     officer its position as to the claims.\n       Upon careful review of the evidence and consideration of \n     the legal issues, and without withdrawing my 1997 opinion, I \n     am satisfied that the reference overall includes substantial \n     equitable claims appropriate for settlement. I have reviewed \n     the evidence in support of the remaining nine counts, as well \n     as the evidence supporting the damages assertions, and \n     believe that there is ample basis in the record to support a \n     settlement on the grounds that these counts embrace equitable \n     claims that could be the subject of an affirmative \n     recommendation by the hearing officer. I also am satisfied \n     that the amount of the settlement proposed is in line with my \n     assessment of a potential recovery, particularly when \n     recognizing that the tribe does not concede the correctness \n     of the 1997 opinion with respect to counts I and II. Further, \n     while recognizing that the United States disagrees, I \n     conclude that, based on my prior good-cause ruling in this \n     matter, there is a proper basis to find that the bar of the \n     statute of limitations, to the extent applicable, should be \n     removed.\n       Based on the facts presented in the stipulation, and the \n     evidence that the hearing officer has independently reviewed \n     after consideration of the legal issues, the hearing officer \n     hereby reports that:\n       a. The reference overall states equitable claims against \n     the United States as set forth in the bill referred to this \n     court.\n       b. The amount agreed by the parties to be equitably due the \n     Menominee Indian Tribe in full settlement of the aforesaid \n     equitable claims, namely $32,052,547, appears fair and \n     reasonable to the hearing officer, and the hearing officer \n     recommends that Congress appropriate this amount to the \n     Tribe.\n       c. there is good cause to remove the bar of the statute of \n     limitations to the extent it applies to any of the claims.\n       d. The parties have stipulated that they waive the right \n     they would otherwise have under RCFC appendix D, paragraph \n     nine, to a thirty-day period in which to accept or reject \n     this recommendation. They have stipulated to its \n     acceptability. They have also stipulated, in the event that \n     the review panel accepts this recommendation, to waive the \n     right to reconsideration under RCFC appendix D, paragraph \n     eleven.\n                                                 Eric G. Bruggink,\n     Hearing Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         Congressional Reference No. 93-649X (Judge Bruggink)]\n\n  Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, plaintiff, v. United States of \n                           America, defendant\n\n\n              stipulation for recommendation of settlement\n\n       1. On August 6, 1993, the Senate enacted Resolution 137 \n     which referred to this court a proposed bill, S. 1335, for \n     the relief of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, and \n     requested the Chief Judge to proceed in accordance with the \n     provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1492 and 2509 regarding \n     Congressional References. The Resolution requested that the \n     court ``report back to the Senate . . . providing such \n     findings of fact and conclusions that are sufficient to \n     inform the Congress of the nature, extent, and character of \n     the damages referred to in such bill as a legal or equitable \n     claim against the United States or a gratuity, and the \n     amount, if any, legally or equitably due from the United \n     Stats to the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin by reason of \n     such damages.''\n       2. The proposed bill, S. 1335, sets forth the claims \n     Congress requested the court to consider as follows:\n       ``Section 1. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized \n     and directed to pay to the Menominee Indian Tribe of \n     Wisconsin, out of any money in the Treasury of the United \n     States not otherwise appropriated, a sum equal to the damages \n     sustained by the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin by \n     reason of--\n       ``(a) the enactment and implementation of the Act of June \n     17, 1954 (68 Stat. 250), as amended, and\n       ``(b) the mismanagement by the United States of the \n     Menominee assets held in trust by the United States prior to \n     April 30, 1961, the effective date of termination of Federal \n     supervision of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin.\n       ``Section 2. Payment of the sum referred to in section 1 \n     shall be in full satisfaction of any claims that the \n     Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin may have against the \n     United States with respect to the damages referred to in such \n     section.''\n       3. Many of the claims at issue in this Congressional \n     Reference were litigated previously before the United States \n     Court of Claims in the case of Menominee Tribe of Indians v. \n     United States, Dkt. Nos. 134-67 A through I, originally filed \n     in 1967. That case concerned breach of trust and taking \n     claims related to the Termination of the Menominee Tribe and \n     certain claims for mismanagement of tribal assets prior to \n     Termination. It was the subject of seven trial court \n     decisions and four decisions before the appellate court. All \n     of the dockets were ultimately dismissed in 1984, seventeen \n     years after they were filed, on statute of limitations and \n     jurisdictional grounds; none were dismissed on the merits. \n     The Congressional Reference asks this court to make a \n     recommendation under the principles applicable in \n     Congressional Reference cases as to whether the claims are \n     legal or equitable or a gratuity.\n       4. The Tribe has alleged twelve claims in this \n     Congressional Reference as follows:\n       (I) Congressional Breach of Trust.--The Tribe claims that \n     the United States breached its trust duty to the Tribe by \n     enacting and implementing the Termination Act of June 17 \n     1954, which terminated federal supervision over the Menominee \n     Tribe. The nature of the alleged wrong was that the Tribe was \n     not prepared for Termination and that, though Congress has \n     the power to terminate a Tribe, it cannot without breaching \n     its trust responsibilities terminate the Tribe prematurely or\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\n     in a manner that would result in unreasonable harm to the \n     Tribe. The Tribe claims this was the circumstance in 1954 \n     when the Termination Act was enacted and later in 1961 when \n     the Termination Act was implemented. It is alleged that after \n     the Termination Act was implemented, the economy on the \n     reservation collapsed, and tribal members suffered from \n     poverty, serious lack of health care and education, \n     disruption of tribal institutions and customary ways of \n     making a living, causing severe economic and psychological \n     hardship, so that the once thriving Menominee reservation \n     became a pocket of poverty and despair. In the Tribe's view, \n     the loss of tribal status left tribal members disenfranchised \n     and shorn of their tribal identity and culture.\n       The Tribe's federal trust status was later restored in \n     1973. In enacting the Restoration Act, 25 U.S.C. Sec. 903, \n     members of the enacting Congress repudiated the policy of \n     Termination as applied to the Menominee as a ``mistake'', a \n     ``failure'' and ``an experiment that has had tragic and \n     disheartening results.'' 119 Cong. Rec. 34308 (Oct. 16. 1973) \n     (statements of Rep. Froehlich, Nelson and Kastenmeier). \n     President Nixon also stated that ``This policy of forced \n     Termination is wrong . . .  .'' 6 Pres. Doc. 894 (1970), \n     reprinted in, 116 Cong. Rec. S23258-23262 (July 8, 1970).\n       In the original ``Basic'' proceeding the trial court held \n     that the United States had breached its trust duties to the \n     Tribe by terminating it. However,on appeal, the Court of \n     Claims held that the court had no jurisdiction to determine \n     if an act of Congress was a wrong subject to judicial remedy. \n     Menominee Tribe v. United States. 607 F.2d 1335 (Ct. Cl. \n     1979). Following the reasoning of the Court of Claims, the \n     hearing officer in this Congressional Reference has also held \n     that even though ``the decision to end the Government's \n     relationship with the Tribe when it did was a serious mistake \n     of judgment,'' acts of Congress cannot serve as a source of a \n     wrong even as an equitable claim in a Congressional Reference \n     context.\n       Whether this conclusion has been, and remains, correct is a \n     subject of contention between the parties. In any event, the \n     Tribe has the right to seek review of this decision by the \n     Review Panel when it becomes final. The Government agrees \n     with the hearing officer's ruling. Despite their differing \n     positions, the parties nevertheless agree the claim is \n     appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise and \n     settlement of all the Reference claims. The Tribe's valuation \n     of this claim is $60 million.\n       (II) Forest Mismanagement.--This is a claim for beach of \n     trust in the mismanagement of the Menominee Tribe's \n     valuable forest between 1951 and 1961, prior to \n     Termination. The claim springs from the alleged failure of \n     the BIA to seek an amendment to the congressionally \n     imposed but (according to the Tribe) outdated statutory \n     cutting limit which seriously impaired the ability of the \n     agency to properly manage the forest. In the original case \n     the trial court found the BIA had breached its trust duty \n     and awarded damages in the amount of $7.2 million. The \n     decision was overturned when the Federal Circuit ruled the \n     claim was barred by the statute of limitations. Menominee \n     Tribe v. United States, 726 F.2d 718 (Fed. Cir. 1984).\n       In the Congressional Reference action, this claim was \n     briefed before the hearing officer, who held that the claim \n     could not be an equitable one because the Tribe was actually \n     challenging an act of Congress. As such the claim was \n     dismissed for reasons similar to those set forth under Count \n     I--i.e., an act of Congress may not constitute a wrong, even \n     for an ``equitable'' claim. The Tribe strenuously disagrees \n     with that assessment because it believes the wrongdoer was \n     the BIA for not warning Congress of the damage being done by \n     the outmoded cutting limit. The Tribe has the right to review \n     of this decision by the Review Panel when it becomes final. \n     The Government disagrees with the Tribes's legal and factual \n     basis for this claim. Despite their differing positions, the \n     parties nevertheless agree the claim is appropriate for \n     inclusion in an overall compromise and settlement of all the \n     Reference claims. The Tribe's valuation of the Forest claim \n     is $6.6 million.\n       (III) Mill Mismanagement.--This claim is for breach of \n     trust in the mismanagement of the Menominee Mill between 1951 \n     and 1961. In the Tribe's view, the Mill and Forest were the \n     heart of the economy on the Reservation. The claim focuses on \n     the BIA's alleged failure to make repairs and to maintain the \n     Mill, as well as update the equipment to make it efficient \n     and safe. The claim is made up of 13 subclaims which deal \n     with specific acts of mill mismanagement. In the original \n     case, the trial court awarded $5.5 million in damages, but \n     the claim was later dismissed by stipulation based on the \n     Federal Circuit's ruling on statute of limitations in the \n     forest mismanagement case.\n       In this Congressional Reference, the hearing officer ruled \n     that the claim is an equitable claim but has reserved \n     judgment as to liability and damages on each of the 13 \n     subclaims to a later proceeding. The hearing officer also \n     ruled that there is reason to remove the statute of \n     limitations bar. The Government disputes this and has the \n     right to seek review of both rulings. Despite their differing \n     positions, the parties nevertheless agree the claim is \n     appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise and \n     settlement of all the Reference claims. The Tribe's valuation \n     of this claim is $5.9 million.\n       (IV) Tax Exemption Taking.--This claim alleges the taking \n     of the Tribe's tax exemption with the passage of the \n     Termination Act. The Tribe claims that, at the time of \n     Termination, it held a valuable property right in its tax \n     immunity. According to the Tribe, this immunity from taxes \n     was based on (a) the Tribe's political status as a sovereign \n     entity; (b) the related doctrine that a state has no \n     jurisdiction over a tribe; and (c) the Tribe's treaty-\n     guaranteed right that its land would ``be held as \n     Indian lands are held,'' and hence implied tax exemption. \n     Treaty of 1854, 10 Stat. 1065, Art. 2. The Tribe alleges \n     that this immunity from taxation is a property right \n     protected by the Fifth Amendment. See Choate v. Trappe, \n     224 U.S. 665 (1912).\n       When the Termination Act was passed, it envisioned \n     specifically subjecting the assets and income of the Tribe's \n     successor corporation (Menominee Enterprise, Inc. or MEI) to \n     federal and state taxation. 25 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 898, 899. \n     While Congress has the power to take away the Tribe's \n     immunity from tax, the Tribe contends that immunity is a \n     valuable property right and that the Tribe is \n     constitutionally entitled to just compensation for its taking \n     (Choate v. Trappe, supra).\n       In the original case the taking claim was subject to trial \n     and briefing but was ultimately dismissed on statute of \n     limitations grounds. Menominee Tribe v. United States, 223 \n     Ct. Cl. 632 (1980). The Tribe maintains that, as a taking \n     claim, the claim is an equitable one and that there is a \n     substantial argument that the statute of limitations should \n     be removed. The United States does not concur in the Tribe's \n     assessment of this claim. The hearing officer has not heard \n     this claim. The Tribe's valuation of this claim is \n     $12,675,910 including principal and interest.\n       (v) Hospital Breach of Trust.--The Tribe claims that the \n     BIA breached its trust duty in managing tribal funds which \n     were negligently spent by the BIA in remodeling the Tribe's \n     hospital. The Tribe alleges that the BIA was required to \n     ensure that any renovations to the hospital be in the best \n     interest of the Tribe. In the Tribe's view, this necessarily \n     included bringing the hospital up to state standards when the \n     BIA knew that the hospital would become subject to state laws \n     upon Termination. The Tribe alleges that the BIA failed in \n     this duty by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of \n     tribal money on major renovations to the Tribe's hospital, \n     though it knew that the renovations would be inadequate under \n     State codes to allow the hospital to continue operating after \n     Termination. Further, according to the Tribe, the BIA failed \n     to remedy these problems in the months before Termination \n     despite the BIA's actual knowledge that the hospital could \n     not be licensed due to numerous violations of State codes. \n     Allegedly as a result, the hospital was forced to close and \n     the tribal money spent on renovations was wasted.\n       The Tribe alleges that such conduct is a clear violation of \n     the BIA's trust duty to manage tribal funds prudently and is \n     a proper basis for an equitable claim. The original court \n     proceeding did not address this claim directly and it was \n     dismissed by stipulation along with the other unadjudicated \n     claims, in the wake of the unfavorable rulings on the Basic \n     and Forest claims in 1979 and 1984. The Tribe contends that \n     the Court of Claims did however recognize, in dicta, this \n     claim as a potential breach of trust claim. 607 F.2d 1335, \n     1346-47. The hearing officer has not heard this claim. The \n     United States does not concur in the Tribe's assessment of \n     the facts or law underlying this claim. Despite their \n     differing positions, the parties nevertheless agree the claim \n     is appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise and \n     settlement of all the Reference claims. The Tribe's valuation \n     of this claim is $3,952,307 including principal and lost \n     interest.\n       (VI) Road Right-of-Way Taking.--Under the Treaty of 1854, \n     the United States held, in trust for the Menominee Tribe, fee \n     title to all land within the Menominee Reservation. The State \n     of Wisconsin built two highways and smaller roads throughout \n     the reservation in the early 1920's. As the 1961 Termination \n     date approached, the State requested and the BIA agreed that \n     the roads on the reservation be brought up to State standards \n     and transferred to the State, and to the future Menominee \n     Town and County. On April 26, 1961, the United States \n     transferred by quitclaim deed for $1.00, a right-of-way over \n     the existing road system on the Reservation as well as \n     additional acreage for the widening of the roads as requested \n     by the State. The Secretary allegedly obtained no \n     compensation for the transfer of the easement or the timber \n     located on the additional right-of-way, nor did the Secretary \n     reserve to the Tribe the right to log that timber.\n       The Tribe claims that this transfer was a taking under the \n     Fifth Amendment. In the original claim, the trial judge found \n     the transfers were a taking but reserved damages to a later \n     date. The claim was subsequently dismissed by stipulation. As \n     a taking claim, the Tribe maintains that the claim \n     constitutes an equitable claim within the context of the \n     Congressional Reference. The United States does not concur in \n     the Tribe's assessment of this claim. Despite their different \n     positions, the parties nevertheless agree the claim is \n     appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise and \n     settlement of all the Reference claims. The hearing officer \n     has not heard this claim. The Tribe's valuation of this claim \n     is $1,664,996 including principal and interest.\n       (VII) Power Contract and Right-of-Way Breach of Trust.--\n     This claim is properly considered included as one of the \n     subclaims in the Mill Mismanagement (count III) count\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\n     and damages are included in that total figure.\n       (VIII) Water and Sewer Breach of Trust.--This is a claim \n     that BIA failed to ensure that adequate water and sewer \n     facilities were in place on the Reservation between the \n     period 1951 and 1961. In the original claim, the trial judge \n     found the BIA had breached its fiduciary duty to maintain \n     properly and to upgrade these facilities but reserved damages \n     to a later time. The government disagrees with that ruling. \n     Despite their differing positions, the parties nevertheless \n     agree the claim is appropriate for inclusion in an overall \n     compromise and settlement of all the Reference claims. The \n     hearing officer has not yet heard this claim. The Tribe \n     examined the claim in the context of the current case and \n     decided to drop the claim.\n       (IX) Mismanagement of Funds Breach of Trust.--This is a \n     breach of trust claim for the improper expenditure of tribal \n     trust funds by the BIA between 1951 and 1961 and the loss of \n     interest on the money removed from the trust funds. The Tribe \n     claims there were four types of improper expenditure, and \n     asserts the following arguments in support of its position:\n       (1) The BIA used tribal funds to pay for the BIA's own \n     agency administrative expenses. Since administrative expenses \n     are considered to be for the benefit of and therefore the \n     responsibility of the Government, use of tribal funds for \n     these expenses was a breach of the Secretary's trust duty \n     to manage the Tribe's funds as a trustee would. Sioux \n     Tribe v.  United States, 105 Ct.Cl. 725 (1946). Moreover, \n     by expending these funds, the Tribe lost interest it would \n     otherwise have earned.\n       (2) Tribal funds were also used to pay for law and order \n     expenses on the reservation. These expenses are also the \n     responsibility of the Government and not the tribe, and are \n     also not allowed. Blackfeet Tribe v.  United States, 32 Ind. \n     Cl. Comm. 65 (1973); Red Lake Band v.  United States, 17 \n     Ct.Cl. 362 (1989).\n       (3) Tribal funds were used for the expenses of the tribal \n     council in administering Termination. Since Termination was \n     for the benefit of the Government, the Government should have \n     borne the expense based on the same principles stated in (1) \n     and (2) above;\n       (4) Tribal funds were used to pay for tribal health, \n     education, and welfare expenses while the Government \n     routinely paid for these services for other tribes with \n     Government funds. The Tribe alleges that it was a breach of \n     trust to spend the Tribe's money on such expenses \n     particularly when the Tribe's funds were depleted far below \n     the amount necessary for the Tribe to operate its mill and \n     forest profitably before Termination, and to have the \n     necessary capital on hand to make repairs and rehabilitation \n     after Termination.\n       The total amount of funds the Tribe alleges were \n     imprudently spent in these four claims is $2,553,180. Had \n     those funds remained in the Tribe's trust fund, and had the \n     Secretary invested those funds as required by 15 U.S.C. 162a, \n     the Tribe alleges that it would have received additional \n     interest. In the Tribe's view, the lost interest is a valid \n     claim. Cheyenne-Arapahoe Tribes v.  United States, 206 Ct.Cl. \n     340 (1975). The Tribe's valuation of lost interest to date is \n     $27,388,973. Its total valuation on the accounting claim is \n     therefore $29,942,153. The Tribe maintains that the claim for \n     improper expenditures would be an equitable claim within the \n     context of a reference. The government disagrees with the \n     Tribe's assessment of this claim. Despite their differing \n     positions, the parties nevertheless agree the claim is \n     appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise and \n     settlement of all the Reference claims. The hearing officer \n     has not heard this claim.\n       (X) Loss of Government Programs.--The Tribe considers that \n     the damages of this claim are properly included within the \n     damages of Count I. No separate claim is stated herein.\n       (XI) Imposition of Bond Debt.--As part of the Termination \n     Plan approved by the Secretary of the Interior, each tribal \n     member received an income bond at $3,000 face value bearing \n     four percent interest. The Tribe argues that, while normally \n     bonds are issued in return for financial capital, in MEI's \n     case a debt was incurred but it received no corresponding \n     funds or assets. Furthermore, the Tribe argues that there was \n     no practical way for MEI to avoid paying the interest on the \n     bonds even when it did not have the funds to do so. The Tribe \n     argues that, although tribal revenues had been sufficient to \n     make stumpage payments to tribal members before Termination, \n     the Secretary knew that MEI would become subject to a massive \n     tax burden, as well as other new expenses after Termination, \n     and that the Secretary also knew, or should have known, that \n     the imposition of such a massive debt burden in addition to \n     these other expenses would undermine the viability of MEI and \n     cause great hardship to the Menominee.\n       The Tribe argues that the Secretary was required to ensure \n     that the provisions of the Termination Plan which he approved \n     were in the best interest of the Tribe and its members. See \n     Cheyenne Arapaho Tribes v. United States, 512 F.2d 1390, \n     1396 (1975) (BIA required to make ``an independent \n     judgment that the tribe's request was in its own best \n     interest''); Oglala Sioux Tribe v. United States, 21 Cl. \n     Ct. 176, 193 (Cl. Ct. 1990) (BIA not permitted to place \n     responsibility for poor decisions on Tribe, since tribal \n     decisions subject to final BIA approval).\n       For these reasons, the Tribe argues, the Secretary breached \n     his duty to the Menominee Tribe by approving the bond \n     provisions of the Termination Plan. If the Secretary breached \n     his trust duty to the Tribe as alleged, it would, in the \n     Tribe's view, be the proper basis for a equitable claim. The \n     hearing officer has not heard this claim. The United States \n     disputes the legal and factual bases for this claim. Despite \n     their differing positions, the parties nevertheless agree the \n     claim is appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise \n     and settlement of all the Reference claims. The Tribe's \n     valuation of this claim is $20,574,000.\n       (XII) Taking of Tribal Property.--Upon Termination, the \n     tribal office building was transferred to Menominee County by \n     the Secretary of the Interior. The Tribe alleges that The \n     Termination Act, which required the Secretary to approve and \n     put into effect a plan for the management of tribal assets \n     after Termination, contemplated that such transfers of \n     property from control of the Tribe to other entities would \n     take place. The Secretary issued a deed transferring title to \n     the tribal office building to the County. Despite restoration \n     of the Tribe to federal status in 1973, this property was \n     never returned to the Tribe. Further, according to the Tribe, \n     at no time has the Tribe received any compensation for this \n     property taken by the United States, despite the fact that \n     recognized tribal title, including land and buildings, is \n     protected by the Fifth Amendment, and cannot be taken by the \n     Government without just compensation. The United States does \n     not concur in the Tribe's assessment of this claim. Despite \n     their differing positions, the parties nevertheless agree the \n     claim is appropriate for inclusion in an overall compromise \n     and settlement of all the Reference claims.\n       This claim, then an undefined part of the accounting claim, \n     was not heard in the original case and it has not been heard \n     by the hearing officer in this Congressional Reference. The \n     Tribe's valuation of this claim is $87,688 including \n     principal and interest.\n       In summary, the Tribe values its 12 claims at $141 million. \n     The United States does not concur in the Tribe's assessment \n     of the claims. However, as mentioned above, both parties \n     agree that the Reference overall is appropriate for \n     settlement.\n       5. There has been a full and extensive development of the \n     record in the prior adjudication before the Court of Claims \n     as to many of these claims. Further extensive development of \n     the facts occurred before the hearing officer in the present \n     proceeding including the filing of supplemental evidence in \n     the record of additional plaintiff expert reports, \n     affidavits, and depositions. The parties agree that, after \n     over thirty years of dispute, including seventeen years of \n     litigation in the first case and some thirteen more years of \n     seeking and litigating this Congressional Reference, there \n     has been a sufficient development of all of the claims to \n     support a compromise and settlement. Further, while the \n     parties are each confident in their positions, they each \n     recognize that the outcome with respect to each claim, if \n     fully litigated, is not certain.\n       6. The hearing officer issued a detailed opinion on the \n     first three claims as well as on the issue of whether the \n     statute of limitations should be removed. This opinion \n     prompted the parties to enter into extensive settlement \n     negotiations.\n       7. The stipulations herein are based upon an exhaustive \n     review of the evidence by the parties and these stipulations \n     are justified and supported by competent evidence.\n       Now therefore the parties stipulate and agree,\n       (a) That the Congress directed the Court through this \n     Reference to determine whether the Menominee Tribe has legal \n     or equitable claims against the United States as a result of \n     ``(a) the enactment and implementation by the United States \n     of the Menominee assets held in trust by the United States \n     prior to April 30, 1961 . . .'';\n       (b) That this Reference overall is a proper one for \n     compromise and settlement, given the extensive development of \n     the legal and factual record that has already occurred in \n     this and prior litigation between the parties, and given the \n     parties' careful consideration and negotiation of the legal \n     and factual issues in this matter;\n       (c) That, recognizing that the parties reserve their \n     positions on these matters, the legal and factual record \n     developed with respect to the Menominee in this and prior \n     litigation establishes a basis for equitable claims against \n     the United States within the scope of this Reference, \n     including a potential basis for removal of the bar of the \n     statute of limitations;\n       (d) That it would be fair, just, and equitable, under the \n     terms of the Reference, to pay the Menominee Tribe of \n     Wisconsin the sum of $32,052,547 as a final settlement of all \n     claims that the Tribe has stated in this action, and that \n     that amount is supported by the record in this and prior \n     litigation;\n       (e) That, as demonstrated by the record in this and prior \n     litigation, and as acknowledged by President Richard Nixon \n     and members of Congress, the policy of forced termination as \n     applied to the Menominee Tribe, was ``wrong'';\n       (f) That the hearing officer in this matter, the Review \n     Panel, and the Chief Judge should approve this Stipulation \n     and recommend to Congress the above-stated sum as the \n     appropriate amount to be paid to the Menominee Tribe;\n       (g) That the compromise and settlement of these claims \n     include any and all claims which were, or could have been, \n     alleged--either directly or indirectly--pursuant to S.\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n     1355, including, but not limited to, claims for attorney's \n     fees and other expenses;\n       (h) That any and all claims encompassed by S. 1335 will, \n     consistent with Paragraph (i), below, be fully and finally \n     resolved upon a recommendation of payment of $32,052,547 as \n     consistent with the overall merit of the claims;\n       (i) That, upon the tendering of a recommendation by the \n     hearing officer in approving the compromise and settlement of \n     any and all claims encompassed by S. 1335 for the amount \n     agreed to by the parties, and the transmission to Congress by \n     the Chief Judge of the Court's Report to the same effect, the \n     Reference under S. 1335 to the Court of Federal Claims shall \n     be fully and finally resolved; and\n       (j) That this compromise and settlement derives from the \n     unique circumstances of the Menominee Tribe with respect to \n     the Act of June 17, 1954, and the Tribe's continuous effort \n     since 1967 to obtain relief, and that this compromise and \n     settlement shall not be cited for, and does not constitute, \n     precedent in any fashion with respect to any other dispute.\n       (k) That, if this stipulation is accepted by the hearing \n     officer, the parties waive their right under RCFC Appendix D \n     para. 9 to file within 30 days a notice of acceptance or \n     exception to the hearing officer's report. They herewith \n     accept such a report.\n       (l) That, if the hearing officer accepts this stipulation \n     and so reports to the review panel, and if the review panel \n     adopts the report of the hearing officer, the parties waive \n     the right under Appendix D para. 11 to seek rehearing within \n     ten days, and instead request that the matter be promptly \n     filed with the Clerk for transmission by the Chief Judge to \n     Congress.\n       Stipulated and signed this 11th day of August, 1998.\n     Charles A. Hobbs,\n       Attorney for the plaintiff.\n     James Brookshire,\n       Attorney for the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Indian Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy: This letter concerns \n     a Congressional reference made by the United States Senate \n     during the 103rd Congress concerning the Menominee Tribe of \n     Wisconsin. Through Senate Resolution 137, the Senate directed \n     the United States Court of Federal Claims to hear a series of \n     claims of the Menominee Tribe and, based on its findings, \n     make recommendations to Congress.\n       Senator Kohl has indicated that he will soon introduce \n     legislation based upon the findings, recommendations, and \n     conclusions reached by the Court of Federal Claims on August \n     11, 1998. I understand that the proposed legislation would \n     authorize the settlement of all of the claims referred by \n     Congress in return for a payment of approximately $32 \n     million. This settlement amount is based on an agreement \n     reached between the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin and \n     the United States Department of Justice.\n       On August 12, 1998, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims \n     reported to the Senate that it ``recommends that Congress \n     adopted legislation paying to the Menominee Tribe of \n     Wisconsin $32,052,547 in settlement of the claims embraced in \n     this congressional reference.'' It is significant that the \n     hearing officer independently concluded that the settlement \n     was ``fair and reasonable'' and that the Court's Review Panel \n     concluded that ``the stipulated agreement between the parties \n     is a just and equitable resolution of the lengthy dispute \n     that it resolves.\n       Accepting the recommendations of the Court of Claims \n     provides a means for brining closure to this painful chapter \n     in our Nation's treatment of the Menominee Tribe. The \n     legislative and judicial path to restitution has been a long \n     road for this Tribe. This journey can and should be brought \n     to an appropriate conclusion during the 106th Congress.\n       After reviewing this matter, it is clear that the \n     settlement proposal is consistent with past practices and \n     precedents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1022. A bill to authorize the appropriation of an additional \n$1,700,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 for health care for veterans; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n               veterans emergency health care act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this country made a promise years ago to \nthe men and women who risked their lives in defense of this nation. \nThey were promised that their health care needs would be provided for \nby a grateful nation. That promise is not being kept, and it is time to \nstop paying lip service to those who served this country so well.\n  The current state of veterans' health care funding is shameful. \nSpending on veterans' health care has seen no significant increase for \nthree consecutive years, at the very time that more and more of our \nWorld War II and Korean war veterans are relying on the VA health care \nsystem.\n  In a memo to VA Secretary Togo West, Under Secretary for Health Dr. \nKenneth Kizer expressed concern that a fourth year with a stagnant \nhealth care budget ``poses very serious financial challenges which can \nonly be met if decisive and timely actions are taken.'' If increased \nfunding is not secured even deeper cuts will be required such as \n``mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or \nelimination of programs, and possible unnecessary facility closures.''\n  Today, veterans' health care facilities are laying off care-givers \nand other critical staff.\n  It is unlikely that the Senate will increase normal appropriations \nfor veterans health care funding enough to correct three years of \nneglect. That is why Senator Conrad and I are proposing an additional \n$1.7 billion in emergency spending to address the health care needs of \nour country's veterans. We need to keep our promises to those who have \nserved our country and risked their lives to preserve our freedoms. \nThis bill is a step in the right direction.\n  This legislation will help the Veterans' Administration keep up with \nmedical inflation, provide cost of living adjustments for VA employees, \nallow new medical initiatives that the VA wants to begin (Hepatitis C \nscreenings and emergency care services), address long-term health care \ncosts, provide funding for homeless veterans, and aid compliance with \nthe Patients Bill of Rights.\n  In light of other emergency measures this Congress is considering, it \nis our opinion that preventing a health care catastrophe for our \nveterans is of equal, if not greater, importance than funding items \nlike the NATO infrastructure fund and overseas military construction \nprojects. Congress is debating right now, many new emergencies, new \nprograms, and new initiatives. I'm not passing judgment on those \ndecisions.\n  What I am saying, is that because of insufficient funding, and \nunforeseen health care needs, we have an emergency right now, in our \nability to honor our commitment to this nation's veterans. We must not \nbreak our promise.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to swiftly approve this \nlegislation. The veterans who proudly served their country deserve no \nless.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from North Dakota, in introducing legislation to authorize \n$1.7 billion in emergency funding for FY 2000 Veterans Health \nAdministration programs. Since the release of the Administration's FY \n2000 budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have been deeply \nconcerned by the level of funding--$17.3 billion--for the Veterans \nHealth Administration.\n  This concerned was heightened by comments in an internal memo by Dr. \nKenneth Kizer, VA Undersecretary for Health, in February, regarding the \nFY 2000 veterans health care budget. In that memo, Dr. Kizer warned VA \nSecretary Togo West that the Administration budget for FY 2000 ``poses \nvery serious challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely \nactions are taken.''\n  Dr. Kizer went on the say that unless the VA acts soon, ``* * * we \nface the very real prospect of far more problematic decisions, e.g. \nmandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services or \nelimination of programs and possible unnecessary facility closures''\n  Indeed, Mr. President, I can confirm, that concern over VA health \ncare funding in FY 2000, and the possibility of severe curtailment of \nservices, and the furlough VA employees is a very real concern for \nNorth Dakota veterans and DVA officials at the Fargo VA Medical Center \nin North Dakota. Veterans health care funding in FY 2000, and the hope \nthat funding can be authorized this year to under take critical \nenvironmental improvements at the Fargo DVA Medical Center are high \npriorities for North Dakota veterans. These key priorities were \ndiscussed during a visit\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nto the Fargo DVA Medical Center earlier this year, at my request, by \nDeputy Secretary Hershel Gober. In fact, so concerned are members of \nthe Disabled American Veterans nationwide, including North Dakota \nmembers, about funding for VA medical programs, that a rally has been \nscheduled on May 30th at the Fargo DVA Medical Center to heighten \npublic awareness of the FY 2000 budget for veterans medical care and to \npress for additional funds.\n  Mr. President, over the past few months, Members of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs and many of my colleagues have been \nworking hard to increase funding for veterans medical care in FY 2000. \nI have strongly supported these efforts. During consideration of the FY \n2000 budget resolution in committee, and when the resolution was \nreported to the Senate for consideration, I voted to increase funding \nfor VA medical care by $3 billion, the figure recommended in the FY \n2000 Independent Budget supported by the AMVETS, Disabled American \nVeterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica. House and Senate conferees eventually agreed to increase \nveterans health care funding by $1.66 billion in FY 2000. Most \nrecently, I cosigned a letter to Members of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee urging the committee to provide $1.7 billion above the \nadministration's request for the Veterans Health Administration. \nAlthough Senate appropriators have not made a decision on how much to \nincrease funding for veterans medical care, initial reports for a \nsignificant increase are not encouraging.\n  Because of concerns that the FY 2000 appropriations for veterans \nhealth are not expected to be adequate, and may result in unnecessary \nfurloughs and disruptions of health care services for veterans, Senator \nDorgan and I are introducing legislation to provide an emergency \nauthorization of $1.7 billion in funding above the administration's \nrequest for $17.3 billion for the Veterans Health Administration. This \nfigure also represents the level of additional health care funding \nrecommended for the VA to Senate appropriators by Senate Veterans' \nCommittee Chairman Arlen Specter and Ranking Member John D. \nRockefeller. We must make every effort to find these emergency FY 2000 \nfunds for veterans medical care, and to include them in appropriate \nlegislation to avoid disruptions in critical health care. We can do no \nless for our veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Department of Veterans Affairs,\n\n     Date: Feb. 8, 1999\n     From: Under Secretary for Health (10)\n     Subj: FY 99/2000 VHA Budget\n     To: Secretary (00)\n       1. As you know, current VHA program projections indicate \n     that the FY 99 budget is adequate to meet demands. However, \n     the President's FY 2000 requested budget, and especially the \n     1.4 billion of management efficiencies, pose very serious \n     financial challenges which can be met only if decisive and \n     timely actions are taken.\n       2. Strategic planning initiatives undertaken by VHA \n     networks over the past year are culminating in \n     recommendations for a variety of program adjustments, \n     including facility integrations, bed reductions, program \n     consolidations and mission changes, which reflect necessary \n     shifts in patient care service delivery and practices.\n       3. In most cases, these changes are, or will be, \n     accompanied by requests for reductions-in-force and staffing \n     adjustments which will better configure our workforce to meet \n     the changing needs of our patients and programs. While \n     difficult, these changes are absolutely essential if we are \n     to prepare ourselves for the limitations inherent in the \n     proposed FY 2000 budget.\n       4. Please know that I believe we are in a serious and \n     precarious situation and that if we do not institute these \n     difficult changes in a timely manner, then we face the very \n     real prospect or far more problematic decisions, e.g., \n     mandatory employee furloughs, severe curtailment of services \n     or elimination of programs, and possible unnecessary facility \n     closures.\n       5. In short, the earlier we act in this fiscal year to take \n     the necessary steps to position ourselves for next year's \n     budget, the less likely we will be to face far more drastic \n     and untenable actions in FY 2000.\n       6. I therefore request that we quickly establish a protocol \n     for rapidly processing requests for actions to right-size the \n     VHA healthcare system.

Mike Doyle, D-Pa. ``I don't know how we can flat-\n     line a budget from 1997 to 2002 and not expect the system to \n     collapse.''\n       Deputy Under Secretary for Health Thomas Garthwaite said \n     the administration was aware of ``significant financial \n     challenges ahead'' but that plans still was being made to \n     prepare for the possibility that Congress might not add money \n     to the administration's spending request.\n       The veterans' organizations made public an internal \n     Department of Veterans Affairs memo written by Under \n     Secretary Kenneth Kizer, who heads the hospital system.\n       ``I believe we are in a serious and precarious situation \n     and that if we do not institute these difficult changes in a \n     timely manner, then we face the very real prospect of far \n     more problematic decisions, e.g. mandatory employee \n     furloughs, severe curtailment of services or elimination of \n     programs, and possible unnecessary facility closures,'' Kizer \n     wrote.\n       The veterans' groups did not say how they obtained the \n     memo, but Garthwaite did not dispute its authenticity. He \n     said he believed it was intended to outline the importance of \n     moving quickly because ``it will cost more later if we don't \n     take the administrative actions early.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n        Cleland, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 1023.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure the proper payment of approved nursing and allied health \neducation programs under the medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n       nursing and allied health payment improvement act of 1999\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing three \nbills that will provide much needed financial support for America's 144 \naccredited medical schools and 1,250 graduate medical education (GME) \nteaching institutions. These institutions are national treasures; they \nare the very best in the world. Yet today they find themselves in a \nprecarious financial situation as market forces reshape the health care \ndelivery system in the United States.\n  The growth of managed for-profit care combined with GME payment \nreductions under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) have put these \nhospitals in dire financial straits. Hospitals are losing money--\nmillions of dollars every year. And these losses are projected to \nincrease, as additional scheduled Medicare payment reductions are \nphased in. Many of the teaching hospitals that we know and depend on \ntoday may not survive--including those in my state of New York--if \nthese additional GME payment reductions are not repealed.\n  To ensure that this precious public resource is maintained and the \nUnited States continues to lead the world in the quality of its health \ncare system, the three bills I am introducing today --the Graduate \nMedical Education Payment Restoration Act of 1999, the Managed Care \nFair Payment Act of 1999, and the Nursing and Allied Health Payment \nImprovement Act of 1999--will provide critically required funding for \nteaching hospitals.\n  Everyone in America benefits from the research and medical education \nconducted in our medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals. \nThey are what economists call public goods --something that benefits \neveryone but which is not provided for by market forces alone. Think of \nan army. Or a dam.\n  The Medicare program is the nation's largest explicit financier of \nGME, with annual payments of about $7 billion. In the past, other \npayers of health care have also contributed to the costs of GME. \nHowever, in an increasingly competitive managed care health care \nsystem, these payments are being squeezed out.\n  Earlier this year, I reintroduced the Medical Education Trust Fund \nAct of 1999. This legislation requires the public sector, through the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector, through an \nassessment on health insurance premiums, to contribute broad-based and \nequitable financial support for graduate medical education. I hope that \none day Congress will see the wisdom of enacting such a measure. \nHowever, our teaching hospitals need help now.\n  We are in the midst of a great era of discovery in medical science. \nIt is certainly no time to close medical schools. This great era of \nmedical discovery is occurring right here in the United States, not in \nEurope like past ages of scientific discovery. And it is centered in \nNew York City.\n  It started in the late 1930s. Before then, the average patient was \nprobably as well off, perhaps better, out of a hospital as in one. \nProgress since that point sixty years ago has been remarkable. The last \nfew decades have brought us images of the inside of the human body \nbased on the magnetic resonance of bodily tissues; laser surgery; micro \nsurgery for reattaching limbs; and organ transplantation, among other \nwonders. Physicians are now working on a gene therapy that might \neventually replace bypass surgery. One can hardly imagine what might be \nnext--but we do know that much of it will be discovered in the course \nof ongoing research activities in our teaching hospitals and medical \nschools. That is a process which is of necessity unplanned, even \nrandom--but which regularly produces medical breakthroughs. To cite \njust a few examples:\n  At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the world renowned \nteaching hospital in New York City, researchers in 1998 discovered \namong many other things a surgical biopsy technique that can predict \nwhether breast cancer has spread to surrounding lymph node tissue. This \ntechnique will spare 60,000 to 80,000 patients each year from having to \nundergo surgical removal of their lymph nodes.\n  In 1997, at Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center, it was discovered that \nmalignant brain tumors in young children can be eradicated through the \nuse of high-dose chemotherapy and stem-cell transplants.\n  And in May of last year, a doctor at Children's Hospital in Boston \ncreated a global media sensation with his discovery that a combination \nof the drugs endostatin and angiostatin appeared to cure cancer in mice \nby cutting off the supply of blood to tumors. Although the efficacy of \nthis therapy in humans is not yet known, the research holds great \npromise that a cure for cancer may actually be within reach. And it was \ndiscovered in a teaching hospital.\n  The Graduate Medical Education Payment Restoration Act, with a total \nof 15 cosponsors, will freeze the current schedule of BBA reductions to \nthe indirect portion of GME funding. Congressman Rangel today is \nintroducing a similar bill in the House. Under the BBA, the indirect \npayment adjustor is scheduled to be reduced from 7.7 percent to 5.5 \npercent by FY 2001. This bill will maintain the current payment \nadjustor at its current level of 6.5 percent, thereby rolling back \nabout half of the indirect GME funding cuts in the BBA. In total, this \nprovision restores about $3 billion over 5 years and $8 billion over 10 \nyears in indirect GME funding for teaching hospitals.\n  The Managed Care Fair Payment Act, with nine cosponsors, will \nredirect more than $2.5 billion over 5 years of Medicare \nDisproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funds from the Medicare managed \ncare payment rates to the more than 1,900 hospitals that qualify for \nDSH funding. Congressman Rangel introduced a similar bill in the House \nthis past March. More than two-thirds of teaching hospitals also \nqualify for DSH funds. Under the current payment method, payments to \nmanaged care plans include these DSH funds, but unfortunately, these \nfunds are not necessarily passed-on to DSH hospitals. Managed care \nplans often do not contract with DSH hospitals, and when they do the \nnegotiated payment rates often do not include these DSH payments. Like \nGME funding under current law, this bill would carve out DSH funds from \nthe managed care rates and require the Health Care Financing \nAdministration to pass them on directly to qualifying hospitals.\n  The third bill I am introducing today, which has 13 cosponsors, is \nthe Nursing and Allied Health Payment Improvement Act. This bill was \nintroduced by Congressmen Crane and Bentsen on April 20 of this year. \nWhile Congress in the BBA of 1997 recognized the need to carve-out GME \nfunding from managed care rates, it unintentionally did not carve out \nthe funding for the training of nurses and allied health professionals. \nLike DSH funds, without the carve-out, funding for these education \nprograms is unlikely to reach the more than 700 hospitals that provide \ntraining to these vitally important health professionals. This bill \nseeks to correct this problem by carving out the funding for the \ntraining of nurses and other allied health professionals and directing \nthem to the hospitals that provide these training programs.\n  Combined, these three bills will strengthen our nation's teaching \nhospitals and ensure that the United States will continue to be in the \nforefront of developing new cures, new medical technology, and training \nof the worlds finest medical professionals. Without these bills, the \nstate of our nation's teaching hospitals and the delivery of health \ncare will remain in jeopardy.\n  I ask that the text of the bills, along with two articles from the \nNew York Times, be included in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                S. 1023\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Lately, their chief executives carry an air \n     of pleading and alarm. They tend to cross the edges of their \n     palms in an X that symbolizes the crossing of rising costs \n     and dropping payments, especially Medicare payments. And to \n     say they simply cannot go on losing money this way and remain \n     the academic cream of American medicine.\n       Dr. Mitchell T. Rabkin, chief executive emeritus of Beth \n     Israel Hospital, says, ``Everyone's in deep yogurt.''\n       The teaching hospitals here and elsewhere have never been \n     immune from the turbulent change sweeping American health \n     care--from the expansion of managed care to spiraling drug \n     prices to the fierce fights for survival and shotgun \n     marriages between hospitals with empty beds and flabby \n     management.\n       But they are contending that suddenly, in recent weeks, a \n     Federal cutback in Medicare spending has begun putting such a \n     financial squeeze on them that it threatens their ability to \n     fulfill their special missions: to handle the sickest \n     patients, to act as incubators for new cures, to treat \n     poor people and to train budding doctors.\n       The budget hemorrhaging has hit at scattered teaching \n     hospitals across the country, from San Francisco to \n     Philadelphia. New York's clusters of teaching hospitals are \n     among the biggest and hardest hit, the Greater New York \n     Hospital Association says. It predicts that Medicare cuts \n     will cost the state's hospitals $5 billion through 2002 and \n     force the closing of money-losing departments and whole \n     hospitals.\n       Dr. Samuel O. Thier, president of the group that owns \n     Massachusetts General Hospital, says, ``We've got a problem, \n     and you've got to nip it in the bud, or else you're going to \n     kill off some of the premier institutions in the country.''\n       Here in Boston, with its unusual concentration of academic \n     medicine and its teaching hospitals affiliated with the \n     medical schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston Universities, \n     the cuts are already taking a toll in hundreds of eliminated \n     jobs and pockets of miserable morale.\n       Five of Boston's top eight private employers are teaching \n     hospitals, Mayor Thomas M. Menino notes. And if five-year \n     Medicare cuts totaling an estimated $1.7 billion for \n     Massachusetts hospitals continue, Mayor Menino says, ``We'll \n     have to lay off thousands of people, and that's a big hit on \n     the city of Boston.''\n       Often, analysts say, hospital cut-backs, closings and \n     mergers make good economic sense, and some dislocation and \n     pain are only to be expected, for all the hospitals' tendency \n     to moan about them. Some critics say the hospitals are partly \n     to fault, that for all their glittery research and \n     credentials, they have not always been efficiently managed.\n       ``A lot of teaching hospitals have engaged in what might be \n     called self-sanctification--`We're the greatest hospitals in \n     the world and no one can do it better or for less'--and that \n     may or may not be true,'' said Alan Sager, a health-care \n     finance expert at the Boston University School of Public \n     Health.\n       But the hospital chiefs argue that they have virtually no \n     fat left to cut, and warn that their financial problems may \n     mean that the smartest edge of American medicine will get \n     dumbed down.\n       With that message, they have been lobbying Congress in \n     recent weeks to reconsider the cuts that they say have turned \n     their financial straits from tough to intolerable.\n       ``Five years from now, the American people will wake up and \n     find their clinical research is second rate because the big \n     teaching hospitals are reeling financially,'' said Dr. David \n     G. Nathan, president of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute \n     here.\n       In a half-dozen interviews, around the Boston medical-\n     industrial complex known as the Longwood Medical Center and \n     Academic Area and elsewhere, hospital executives who normally \n     compete and squabble all espoused one central idea: teaching \n     hospitals are special, and that specialness costs money.\n       Take the example of treating heart-disease patients, said \n     Dr. Michael F. Collins, president and chief executive of \n     Caritas Christi Health Care System, a seven-hospital group \n     affiliated with Tufts.\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\n       In 1988, Dr. Collins said, it was still experimental for \n     doctors to open blocked arteries by passing tiny balloons \n     though them; now, they have a bouquet of expensive new \n     options for those patients, including springlike devices \n     called stents that cost $900 to $1,850 each; tiny rotobladers \n     that can cost up to $1,500, and costly drugs to supplement \n     the reaming that cost nearly $1,400 a patient.\n       ``A lot of our scientists are doing research on which are \n     the best catheters and which are the best stents,'' Dr. \n     Collins said. ``And because they're giving the papers on the \n     drug, they're using the drug the day it's approved to be \n     used. Right now it's costing us about $50,000 a month and \n     we're not getting a nickel for it, because our case rates are \n     fixed.''\n       Hospital chiefs and doctors also argue that a teaching \n     hospital and its affiliated university are a delicate \n     ecosystem whose production of critical research is at risk.\n       ``The grand institutions in Boston that are venerated are \n     characterized by a wildflower approach to invention and the \n     generation of new knowledge,'' said Dr. James Reinertsen, the \n     chief executive of Caregroup, which owns Beth Israel \n     Deaconess Medical Center. ``We don't run our institutions \n     like agribusiness, a massively efficient operation where we \n     direct research and harvest it. It's unplanned to a great \n     extent, and that chaotic fermenting environment is part of \n     what makes the academic health centers what they are.''\n       ``There wouldn't have been a plan to do what Judah Folkman \n     has done over the last 20 years,'' Dr. Reinertsen said of the \n     doctor-scientist at Children's Hospital in Boston who has \n     developed a promising approach to curing cancer.\n       Federal financing for research is plentiful of late, \n     hospital heads acknowledge. But they point out that the \n     Government expects hospitals to subsidize 10 percent or 15 \n     percent of that research, and that they must also provide \n     important support for researchers still too junior to win \n     grants.\n       A similar argument for slack in the system comes in \n     connection with teaching. Teaching hospitals are pressing \n     their faculties to take on more patients to bring in more \n     money, said Dr. Daniel D. Federman, dean for medical \n     education of Harvard Medical School. A doctor under pressure \n     to spend time in a billable way, Dr. Federman said, has less \n     time to spend teaching.\n       The Boston teaching hospitals generally deny that the money \n     squeeze is affecting patients' care (a denial some patients \n     would question), or students' quality of medical education (a \n     denial some students would question), or research--yet.\n       The Boston hospitals' plight may be partly their fault for \n     competing so hard with each other, driving down prices, some \n     analysts say. Though some hospitals have merged in recent \n     years, Boston is still seen as having too many beds, and \n     virtually all hospitals are teaching hospitals here.\n       Whatever the causes, said Dr. Stuart Altman, professor of \n     national health policy at Brandeis University and past \n     chairman for 12 years of the committee that advised the \n     Government on Medicare prices, ``the concern is very real.''\n       ``What's happened to them is that all of the cards have \n     fallen the wrong way at the same time,'' Dr. Altman said, ``I \n     believe their screams of woe are legitimate.''\n       Among the cards that fell wrong, begin with managed care. \n     Massachusetts has an unusually large quotient of patients in \n     managed-care plans. Managed-care companies, themselves \n     strapped, have gotten increasingly tough about how much they \n     will pay.\n       Boston had already gone through a spate of fat-trimming \n     hospital mergers, closings and cost cutting in recent years. \n     Add to the troublesome complaints that affect all hospitals: \n     expenses to prepare their computers for 2000, problems \n     getting insurance companies and the Government to pay up, new \n     efforts to defend against accusations of billing fraud.\n       But the back-breaking straw, hospital chiefs say, came with \n     Medicare cuts, enacted under the 1997 balanced-budget law, \n     that will cut more each year through 2002. The Association of \n     American Medical Colleges estimates that by then the losses \n     for teaching hospitals could reach $14.7 billion, and that \n     major teaching hospitals will lose about about $150 million \n     each. Nearly 100 teaching hospitals are expected to be \n     running in the red by then, the association said last month.\n       For years, teaching hospitals have been more dependent than \n     any others on Medicare. Unlike some other payers, Medicare \n     has compensated them for their special missions--training, \n     sicker patients, indigent care--by paying them extra.\n       For reasons yet to be determined, Dr. Altman and others say \n     the Medicare cuts seem to be taking an even greater toll on \n     the teaching hospitals than had been expected. Much has \n     changed since the 1996 numbers on which the cuts are \n     based, hospital chiefs say; and the cuts particularly \n     singled out teaching hospitals, whose profit margins used \n     to look fat.\n       Frightening the hospitals still further, President \n     Clinton's next budget proposes even more Medicare cuts.\n       Not everyone sympathizes, though. Complaints from hospitals \n     that financial pinching hurts have become familiar refrains \n     over recent years, gaining them a reputation for crying wolf. \n     Critics say the Boston hospitals are whining for more money \n     when the only real fix is broad health-care reform.\n       Some propose that the rational solution is to analyze which \n     aspects of the teaching hospitals' work society is willing to \n     pay for, and then abandon the Byzantine Medicare cross-\n     subsidies and pay for them straight out, perhaps through a \n     new tax.\n       Others question the numbers.\n       Whenever hospitals face cuts, Alan Sager of Boston \n     University said, ``they claim it will be teaching and \n     research and free care of the uninsured that are cut first.''\n       If the hospitals want more money, Mr. Sager argued, they \n     should allow in independent auditors to check their books \n     rather than asking Congress to rely on a ``scream test.''\n       For many doctors at the teaching hospitals, however, the \n     screaming is preventive medicine, meant to save their \n     institutions from becoming ordinary.\n       Medical care is an applied science, said Dr. Allan Ropper, \n     chief of neurology at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and strong \n     teaching hospitals, with their cadres of doctors willing to \n     spend often-unreimbursed time on teaching and research, are \n     essential to helping move it forward.\n       ``There's no getting away from a patient and their \n     illness,'' Dr. Ropper said, ``but if all you do is fix the \n     watch, nobody ever builds a better watch. It's a very subtle \n     thing, but precisely because it's so subtle, it's very easy \n     to disrupt.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 6, 1999]\n\n                   New York Hospitals Braced for Cuts\n\n                           (By Randy Kennedy)\n\n       The fiscal knife that has begun to cut into teaching \n     hospitals in Boston and other cities has not yet had the same \n     dire effects--layoffs or widespread operating deficits--in \n     hospitals around New York State.\n       But hospital executives and health-care experts alike say \n     that if the Federal cuts to Medicare are not softened, the \n     state will lose much more than any other--$5 billion and \n     23,000 medical jobs--by 2002. And they warn that those cuts, \n     a result of the Balanced Budget Act, pose a huge economic \n     threat to New York, which has the nation's greatest \n     concentration of medical schools and teaching hospitals and \n     trains about 15 percent of the nation's medical residents.\n       ``The carnage which is created by the Balanced Budget \n     Act,'' said Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York \n     Hospital Association, a trade group of 175 hospitals and \n     nursing homes, ``will totally disrupt the health care system \n     in New York when it's fully implemented. It goes at the heart \n     of the infrastructure.''\n       The cuts, now in their second year, come at the same time \n     as sharp increases in uninsured patients and the growing \n     dominance of managed care, which have prompted all hospitals \n     in the New York region to brace for what they say will be one \n     of the most difficult fiscal years ever.\n       But with critics complaining that New York still has too \n     many hospital beds and administrative fat that should be \n     trimmed, those who run the prestigious teaching hospitals in \n     the city find it hard to make their case that the Medicare \n     cuts put them in real peril.\n       ``I know this sounds like wolf, wolf, wolf because of the \n     successes generally in the health care industry,'' said Dr. \n     Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore Hospital in the \n     Bronx, which lost $24 million in Medicare money in fiscal \n     1999. ``But New York teaching hospitals are in trouble.''\n       His own hospital did $750 million in business in 1993 and \n     ended that year with a $3 million profit margin. This year, \n     it will do $1 billion in business and end with a $6 million \n     margin.\n       ``Those are supermarket margins,'' Dr. Foreman said, adding \n     that the hospital has ``managed to keep a razor-thin margin \n     every year by every year cutting costs and cutting again.''\n       ``But you can only cut so far before things begin to \n     happen,'' he said. ``The industry is touching bottom in a lot \n     of areas, and the difference between profit and loss in this \n     atmosphere is an eyelash. This is not the way normal billion-\n     dollar enterprises are conducted.''\n       Because the teaching hospitals have traditionally served a \n     high percentage of poor patients, the threat to their future \n     is even more important, Dr. Foreman and others said.\n       While he and other teaching hospital administrators avoid \n     talking about it, the only way to keep from going into the \n     red is to cut jobs and either shrink or close money-losing \n     departments--which usually means emergency rooms, outpatients \n     clinics, psychiatric and rehabilitation departments and \n     maternity wards, among others.\n       ``The so-called low-hanging fruit has all been picked,'' \n     said Dr. David B. Skinner, the chief executive of New York \n     Presbyterian Hospital, where every department has been asked \n     to cut spending by 5 percent. The Greater New York Hospital \n     Association projects that New York Presbyterian will lose \n     more money over the courts of the Balanced Budget Act than \n     any other American hospital--about $320 million.\n       Dr. Skinner said that as the Hospital plans its year 2000 \n     budget ``we're going to have to look very closely at staffing \n     ratios.''\n       ``Something's got to give here,'' he said. ``You then look \n     at where can you downsize departments that are losing money. \n     And we're looking at that now. I don't want to say which ones \n     because I don't want to unnecessarily panic the troops.''\n       While the refrain in health-care politics in New York is \n     usually for hospitals to cry poverty and many experts and \n     budget analysts\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n     to cry hyperbole, experts said yesterday that the teaching \n     hospitals were probably not exaggerating their problems much.\n       ``This certainly appears to be putting real strains on \n     teaching hospitals throughout the country and especially in \n     New York,'' said Edward Salsberg, director of the Center for \n     Health Workforce Studies at the State University in Albany. \n     ``They seem to be building a case that this year it is more \n     real than other years.''\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the bill introduced today by Senator Moynihan which will \nhelp to reduce some of the financial strain that teaching hospitals are \ncurrently experiencing due to Graduate Medical Education (GME) cuts put \nin place under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA).\n  The teaching hospitals in this nation are the very best in the world. \nThere are over 1,200 teaching hospitals in the United States, 57 of \nwhich are in my own state of Michigan. Although these hospitals are \nproviding excellent care while training residents, they are currently \nfacing dire financial circumstances brought about by the growth of \nmanaged care combined with GME payment reductions. Additional Medicare \npayment reductions are currently scheduled to be phased in as per the \nBBA.\n  A major teaching hospital in my own state, the Detroit Medical Center \n(DMC), trains over 1,100 residents each year. The DMC stands to lose a \ntotal of $53.8 million from IME reductions for Fiscal Years 1998-2002. \nIt is important that we continue to support the DMC and other teaching \nhospitals, not turn our back on them.\n  I believe that the survival of our valuable teaching hospitals is at \nstake if we do not act now which is why I have cosponsored this \nlegislation. This bill will freeze the Indirect Medical Education (IME) \nadjustment factor (the IME is the part of the GME payment that reflects \nthe higher costs, such as more intensive treatments, of caring for \npatients at teaching hospitals) at the FY 1999 level of 6.5 percent, \nthereby rolling back about half of the IME funding cuts in the BBA. In \ntotal, this provision restores about $3 billion over 5 years and $8 \nbillion over 10 years in IME funding for teaching hospitals.\n  Our medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals conduct a great \ndeal of the research and medical education which benefits everyone in \nAmerica. The University of Michigan is one of the most prominent \nteaching institutions in the country. The UM is currently doing \nimportant prostate cancer research while providing health care to \ncitizens from every county in the state. It is imperative that we allow \nthis research to continue while we are on the verge of new discoveries \nin medical science.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will pass this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1027. A bill to reauthorize the participation of the Bureau of \nReclamation in the Deschutes Resources Conservancy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n      deschutes resources conservancy reauthorization act of 1999\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ncosponsored by my colleague from Oregon, to reauthorize participation \nby the Bureau of Reclamation in the Deschutes Resources Conservancy for \nan additional five years.\n  The Deschutes Resources Conservancy, also known as the Deschutes \nBasin Working Group, was authorized in 1996 as a five-year pilot \nproject designed to achieve local consensus around on-the-ground \nprojects to improve ecosystem health in the Deschutes River basin. This \nriver is truly one of Oregon's greatest resources. It drains Oregon's \nhigh desert along the eastern front of the Cascades, eventually flowing \ninto the Columbia River. It is the state's most intensively used \nrecreational river. It provides water to both irrigation projects and \nto the city of Bend, which is one of Oregon's fastest growing cities. \nThe Deschutes Basin also contains hundreds of thousands of acres of \nproductive forest and rangelands, serves the treaty fishing and water \nrights of the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, and has Oregon's \nlargest non-federal hydroelectric project.\n  By all accounts, the Deschutes Basin Working Group has been a huge \nsuccess. It has brought together diverse interests within the basin, \nincluding irrigators, tribes, ranchers, environmentalists, an investor-\nowned utility, local businesses, as well as local elected officials and \nrepresentatives of state and federal agencies. Together, the Working \nGroup was able to develop project criteria and identified a number of \nwater quality, water quantity, fish passage and habitat improvement \nprojects that could be funded. Projects are selected by consensus, and \nthere must be a fifty-fifty cost share from non-federal sources.\n  From October 1998 to March 1999, the Deschutes Resources Conservancy \nhas leveraged 272,180 dollars of its funds to complete 777,680 dollars \nin on-the-ground restoration projects. These projects include: piping \nirrigation district delivery systems to prevent loss; securing water \nrights to be left instream to restore flows to Squaw Creek; providing \nriparian fences to protect riverbanks; working with private timberland \nowners to restore riparian and wetlands areas; and seeking donated \nwater rights to enhance instream flows in the Deschutes River Basin. \nThey have been very successful at finding cooperative, market-based \nsolutions to enhance the ecosystem in the basin.\n  The existing authorization provides for up to one million dollars \neach year for projects. Funding is provided through the Bureau of \nReclamation, the group's lead federal agency. The group did not \nactually receive federal funding until this fiscal year, but it has \nalready successfully allocated these funds. The Deschutes Resources \nConservancy enjoys widespread support in Oregon. It has very committed \nboard members who represent diverse interests in the basin. The high \ncaliber of their work, and their pragmatic approach to ecosystem \nrestoration have been recognized by others outside the region.\n  I am convinced this pilot project needs to continue. That is why the \nlegislation I am introducing today would extend the authorization for \nfederal funds through fiscal year 2006, and increases the authorization \nfor fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to two million dollars each year. I \nurge my colleagues to support this project. Not only is it important to \ncentral Oregon, but the Deschutes Recources Conservancy can serve as a \nnational model for cooperative watershed restoration at the local \nlevel.\n\n

PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Enzi, Mr. McCain, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. \nNickles) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly has decided to \n     convene a special session from June 30 to July 2, 1999, in \n     order to review and appraise the implementation of the \n     Programme of Action of the International Conference on \n     Population and Development;\n       Whereas chapter II of the Programme of Action, which sets \n     forth the principles of that document, begins: ``The \n     implementation of the recommendations contained in the \n     Programme of Action is the sovereign right of each country, \n     consistent with national laws and development priorities, \n     with full respect for the various religious and ethical \n     values and cultural backgrounds of its people, and in \n     conformity with universally recognized international human \n     rights.'';\n       Whereas section 7.12 of the Programme of Action states: \n     ``The principle of informed [consent] is essential to the \n     long-term success of family-planning programmes. Any form of \n     coercion has no part to play.'';\n       Whereas section 7.12 of the Programme of Action further \n     states: ``Government goals for family planning should be \n     defined in terms of unmet needs for information and services. \n     Demographic goals . . . should not be imposed on family-\n     planning providers in the form of targets or quotas for the \n     recruitment of clients.''; and\n       Whereas section 7.17 of the Programme of Action states: \n     ``[g]overnments should secure conformity to human rights and \n     to ethical and professional standards in the delivery of \n     family planning and related reproductive health services \n     aimed at ensuring responsible, voluntary and informed consent \n     and also regarding service provision'';

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Children's Protection Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n      SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n     States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n     lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n     televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n     American home 7 hours every day.\n       (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n     lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n     that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend \n     an average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n       (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n     perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n     behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n       (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n     and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n     children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n     correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n     violence and a number of behavioral and psychological \n     problems.\n       (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n     children who are consistently exposed to violence on \n     television have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and \n     aggressive behavior, both as children and later in life.\n       (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n     violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n     and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n     fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n       (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n     that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n     influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. \n     This research suggests that heavy exposure to programming \n     with strong sexual content contributes to the early \n     commencement of sexual activity among teenagers.\n       (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n     (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of \n     conduct that was based on an understanding of the influence \n     exerted by television and on a widely held sense of \n     responsibility for using that influence carefully.\n       (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense \n     of responsibility as follows:\n       (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, great care \n     must be exercised to be sure that the treatment and \n     presentation are made in good faith and not for the purpose \n     of sensationalism or to shock or exploit the audience or \n     appeal to prurient interests or morbid curiosity.''.\n       (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility toward \n     children. Programs designed primarily for children should \n     take into account the range of interests and needs of \n     children, from instructional and cultural material to a wide \n     variety of entertainment material. In their totality, \n     programs should contribute to the sound, balanced development \n     of children to help them achieve a sense of the world at \n     large and informed adjustments to their society.''.\n       (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may only be \n     projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used \n     exploitatively. Programs involving violence present the \n     consequences of it to its victims and perpetrators. \n     Presentation of the details of violence should avoid the \n     excessive, the gratuitous and the instructional.''.\n       (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and similarly \n     important human relationships, and material with sexual \n     connotations, shall not be treated exploitatively or \n     irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n       (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n     broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which \n     many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic \n     portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of \n     implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and \n     presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.''.\n       (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n     code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n     restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n     Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n     district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n     Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions \n     on those grounds. However, none of the programming standards \n     of the code were challenged.\n       (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n     programming standards were never found to have violated any \n     antitrust law.\n       (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n     abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n     broadcast and cable television have deteriorated \n     dramatically.\n       (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n     public concern about the impact of television on children, \n     and on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls \n     routinely show that more than 80 percent of Americans are \n     worried by the increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, \n     and vulgarity on television and by the amount of programming \n     that openly sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and \n     degrading behavior.\n       (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n     taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n     programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n     industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary \n     guidelines designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive \n     portrayals of violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the \n     broadcast and cable television industries agreed to conduct \n     independent studies of the violent content in their \n     programming and make those reports public.\n       (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n     commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n     programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for \n     children. That system was implemented at the beginning of \n     1999.\n       (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n     about the impact of television on children, millions of \n     Americans, especially parents with young children, remain \n     angry and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n     programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n     and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n     the children and the values of the United States.\n       (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n     indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n     to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines \n     would not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that \n     ``such activities may be likened to traditional standard \n     setting efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition \n     and may have significant procompetitive benefits. . . Such \n     guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n     program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n     Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n     the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n       (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n     437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n     have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n     informational needs of children.\n       (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n     the television broadcasters in the United States have not \n     fulfilled their obligations under the Children's Television \n     Act of 1990 and have not noticeably expanded the amount of \n     educational and informational programming directed at young \n     viewers since the enactment of that Act.\n       (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n     games is growing steadily among children. Although most \n     popular video and personal computer games are educational or \n     harmless in nature, many of the most popular are extremely \n     violent. One recent study by Strategic Record Research found \n     that 64 percent of teenagers played video or personal \n     computer games on a regular basis. Other surveys of children \n     as young as elementary school age found that almost half of \n     them list violent computer games among their favorites.\n       (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n     glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n     shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n     advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n     selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n       (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n     games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n     impressionable children.\n       (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n     of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n     music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n     American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th \n     grades the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock \n     or rap music, just slightly less than the entire number of \n     hours spent in the classroom from kindergarten through high \n     school.\n       (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n     are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n     appear to glamorize violence.\n       (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n     attitudes, and emotional state.

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ALCOHOL PROHIBITIONS \n                   THAT REDUCE JUVENILE CRIME IN REMOTE ALASKA \n                   VILLAGES.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Villages in remote areas of Alaska lack local law \n     enforcement due to the absence of a tax base to support such \n     services and to small populations that do not secure \n     sufficient funds under existing state and federal grant \n     program formulas.\n       (2) State troopers are often unable to respond to reports \n     of violence in remote villages if there is inclement weather, \n     and often only respond in reported felony cases.\n       (3) Studies conclude that alcohol consumption is strongly \n     linked to the commission of violent crimes in remote Alaska \n     villages and that youth are particularly susceptible to \n     developing chronic criminal behaviors associated with alcohol \n     in the absence of early intervention.\n       (4) Many remote villages have sought to limit the \n     introduction of alcohol into their communities as a means of \n     early intervention and to reduce criminal conduct among \n     juveniles.\n       (5) in many remote villages, there is no person with the \n     authority to enforce these local alcohol restrictions in a \n     manner consistent with judicial standards of due process \n     required under the state and federal constitutions.\n       (6) Remote Alaska villages are experiencing a marked \n     increase in births and the number of juveniles residing in \n     villages is expected to increase dramatically in the next \n     five years.\n       (7) Adoption of alcohol prohibitions by voters in remote \n     villages represents a community-based effort to reduce \n     juvenile crime, but this local policy choice requires local \n     law enforcement to be effective.\n       (b) Grant of Federal Funds.\n       (1) The Attorney General is authorized to provide to the \n     State of Alaska funds for state law enforcement, judicial \n     infrastructure and other costs necessary in remote villages \n     to implement the prohibitions on the sale, importation and \n     possession of alcohol adopted pursuant to state local option \n     statutes.\n       (2) Funds provided to the State of Alaska under this \n     section shall be in addition to and shall not disqualify the \n     State, local governments, or Indian tribes (as that term is \n     defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638, as amended; 25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e) (1998)) from federal funds available under other \n     authority.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.\n       (1) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section\n       (A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2001; and\n       (C) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Source of sums.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this subsection may be derived from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5180-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5180-S5181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, early on in this decade The \nCitadel in Charleston, South Carolina was challenged and lost the fight \nfor the admission of women to the Corps of Cadets. It was a stormy \nevent, but on Saturday last with dignity and prestige the first woman \ncadet, Nancy Mace, a gold star honor student, was graduated. The \ncommentator, Pat Buchanan, rendered the graduation address. It was a \nchallenge not only to the graduating class, but for the Nation as well. \nI ask that the Buchanan address be printed now in the Record.\n  The address follows:\n\n                       A Republic, Not an Empire\n\n                        (By Patrick J. Buchanan)\n\n       General Grinalds, distinguished guests, and friends of the \n     Citadel. It is truly an honor to address this last graduating \n     class of the 20th century--and a truly unique class it is, of \n     an institution whose name is synonymous with patriotism, \n     courage, and a code of honor.\n       I must tell you, I was profoundly moved by yesterday's \n     parade, and the Scottish bagpipes playing ``Auld Lang Zyne'' \n     to the Class of '99. I was moved, in part, because we \n     Buchanans are of Scotch ancestry. Indeed, an historian once \n     told me the Buchanans were a Highland warrior clan that had \n     fought at Agincourt, where England's Henry V achieved \n     immortality.\n       And as I was basking in the reflected glory of my \n     ancestors, however, the historian added, ``Unfortunately, \n     Pat, the Buchanans all fought on the side of the French.''\n       Now, as my two great grandfathers on the Buchanan side were \n     from Mississippi, and fought with the Confederacy, we \n     Buchanans have an established tradition of Lost Causes. \n     Unfortunately, in 1992 and 1996, I made my own contributions \n     to that family tradition.\n       My wife Shelley tells me that if I don't win this time, she \n     is going to pack it in--and run for the Senate from New York.\n       This is not my first trip to the Citadel; in 1995, I was \n     invited to address the student body in its lecture series on \n     the great issues of the day. On the bookshelf in my living \n     room, if you come to visit, you will find in a place of honor \n     what is known as the Brick--a miniature replica of the \n     original Citadel.\n       Friends of the Citadel, we live in an age of self-\n     indulgence where the values embodied in your code of honor--\n     ``A cadet does not lie, cheat, or steal, or tolerate those \n     who do,'' are considered by some to be out of fashion.\n       But all over this troubled country of ours, people hunger \n     for a restoration of the values which I believe will soon be \n     both relevant and respected again. For this country is not \n     only about to cross over into a new century, we are entering \n     upon a new and potentially dangerous decade.\n       Indeed, as this era that the historians have already \n     designated ``the American Century,'' approaches an end, it \n     may be instructive to look back to the close of the 19th \n     century, when the British empire was the world's preeminent \n     power.\n       For the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, Rudyard Kipling \n     was asked to pen some verses to the greatness and glory of \n     his nation. As he wrote of Britannia's ``(d)ominion over palm \n     and pine,'' Kipling struck a note of unease, of apprehension, \n     that the mighty empire on which the sun never set might \n     itself also pass away. Let me recite a few lines from his \n     poem ``Recessional'':\n     ``Far-called our navies melt away--\n     On dune and headland sinks the fire--\n     Lo, all our pomp of yesterday\n     Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!\n     Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,\n     Lest we forget, lest we forget.''\n       Kipling proved prophetic. In two decades, the British \n     empire was fighting for its life on the fields of France. In \n     half a century, that empire had vanished from the earth.\n       And so it was with all the great nations that had strode so \n     confidently onto the world's stage at the start of this \n     bloodiest of centuries--all except America. The Austro-\n     Hungarian, German, Russian, and Ottoman empires perished in \n     World War I. Japan's was\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n     destroyed in World War II; the British and French expired \n     soon after.\n       When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, in that triumph of \n     human freedom and American perseverance, the empire of Lenin \n     and Stalin collapsed, leaving the United States as the \n     world's sole superpower. In the phrase of our foreign policy \n     elite, we have become the world's ``indispensable nation.''\n       But it is just such hubristic rhetoric that calls forth \n     apprehension, for it reflects a pride that all too often \n     precedes a great fall.\n       Long ago, Teddy Roosevelt admonished us: ``Speak softly and \n     carry a big stick.'' Today, we have whittled down the stick, \n     even as we raised the decibel count.\n       My apprehension is traceable, too, to a belief that our \n     republic has begun to retrace, step by step, the march of \n     folly that led to the fall of the British and every other \n     great empire.\n       Today, America has become ensnared in a civil war in a \n     Balkan peninsula where no U.S. army ever fought before, and \n     no president ever asserted a vital interest. Daily, we plunge \n     more deeply in.\n       Our motives were noble--to protect an abused people--but \n     most now concede that we failed to weigh the risks of \n     launching this war.\n       Among the lessons America should have learned from Vietnam, \n     said General Colin Powell, is that before you commit the \n     army, you must first commit the nation. We did not do that.\n       Now, it is said that as the credibility of NATO cannot \n     survive defiance by tiny Serbia, we must do whatever needs to \n     be done to win, even if it means ordering 100,000 U.S. ground \n     troops into the Balkans. This sentiment was expressed by a \n     columnist at the New York Times:\n       ``It should be lights out in Belgrade; every power grid, \n     water pipe, bridge, road . . . has to be targeted. Like it or \n     not, we are at war with the Serbian nation . . . and the \n     stakes have to be very clear: Every week you ravage Kosovo is \n     another decade we will set you back by pulverizing you. You \n     want 1950. We can do 1950. You want 1389. We can do 1389 \n     too.''\n       One cannot read that passage without recalling to mind the \n     phrase, ``the arrogance of power.''\n       Now, Milosevic is a tyrant and a war criminal. But does \n     America have the right to ``pulverize'' a nation that never \n     attacked the United States? Did the Founding Fathers dedicate \n     their lives, fortunes and sacred honor to the cause of \n     liberty, so that the republic they would create could emulate \n     the empire they overthrew? Is it America's destiny to be the \n     policemen of the world?\n       In his Farewell Address, our greatest president implored us \n     to stay out of Europe's endless quarrels: ``Why quit our own \n     to stand upon foreign ground?'' Washington asked. ``Why . . . \n     entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European \n     Ambition, Rivalship, Interest, Humour, or Caprice?''\n       When the Greeks rose in rebellion against the Ottoman Turks \n     in a Balkan war, John Quincy Adams, our greatest Secretary of \n     State advocated America's non-intervention.\n       ``Wherever the standard of freedom and independence has \n     been or shall be unfurled,'' said Adams, ``there will \n     [America's] heart, her benedictions, and her prayers be. But \n     she goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy.''\n       Now that America is at war, all of us pray for the success \n     and safe return of the men and women we have sent into \n     battle. They are some of the best and bravest of our young. \n     And no matter our disagreements, those are our sons and our \n     daughters out there. But all of us, as citizens of a \n     republic, must debate the decisions as to when, where, and \n     whether to put their lives at risk.\n       This Balkan war is not the first time America has heard the \n     siren's call to empire. A century ago, we heeded it, and \n     annexed the Philippines. In the fall of 1898, leaders from \n     Grover Cleveland to Sam Gompers implored us to resist the \n     temptation.\n       ``The fruits of imperialism, be they bitter or sweet,'' \n     said William Jennings Bryan, ``must be left to the subjects \n     of monarchy. This is one tree of which citizens of a republic \n     may not partake. It is the voice of the serpent, not the \n     voice of God, that bids us eat.''\n       America did not listen. And hard upon the annexation of the \n     Philippines came the declaration of an Open Door policy in \n     China, that plunged us into the politics of Asia, out of \n     which would come war with Japan, war in Korea, and war in \n     Vietnam.\n       Today, this generation is facing the same question. Quo \n     vadis, America? Whither goest thou, America?\n       Will we conscript America's wealth and power to launch \n     utopian crusades to reshape the world in America's image? Or \n     shall we again follow the counsel of Washington and Adams, \n     and keep our lamp burning bright on the Western shore?\n       Every citizen needs to take part in deciding the destiny of \n     this republic, for we have now undertaken foreign commitments \n     that no empire in history has ever sustained. We have assumed \n     the role of German empire in keeping Russia out of Europe, of \n     the Austrian empire in policing the Balkans, of the Ottoman \n     empire in keeping peace in the Middle East, of the Japanese \n     empire in containing China, of the British empire in \n     patrolling the Gulf and maintaining freedom of the seas.\n       How long can America continue to defend scores of countries \n     around the world on a defense budget that has fallen to the \n     smallest share of the U.S. economy since before Pearl Harbor?\n       As we see a limited air war in the Balkans stretch U.S. \n     power to where F-16s are cannibalized for spare parts, our \n     Air Force runs low on laser-guided munitions, our Apache \n     helicopters take weeks to be deployed, and our Pacific fleet \n     is stripped of carriers, it is clear: The long neglect of \n     America's military must come to an end.\n       We must restore this nation's military power, or we are \n     headed for humiliations such as have marked the fall of every \n     great nation that has ever embarked on the imperial course we \n     now pursue.\n       America must retrench; and America must rearm. To make up \n     for this lost decade, let us restore America's defenses to \n     what they were when the decade began. Let us make our \n     country, again, invincible on land, sea, and air, and build \n     the missile defense that a great president, Ronald Reagan, \n     sought as his legacy to America.\n       To be prepared for war, Washington reminded us, is the best \n     guarantee of preserving peace.\n       But if there is cause for apprehension over what lies \n     ahead, there is also cause for confidence and hope. That \n     confidence, that hope, rests not only on the boundless \n     resources of this providential land, but on the almost \n     infinite capacity of the American people to rise and overcome \n     any challenge with which history confronts them.\n       We, after all, are the heirs of the heroes who launched the \n     world's first revolution for liberty. We are the sons and \n     daughters of the great generation that brought us through the \n     Depression and crushed fascism in Europe and Asia. We are the \n     men and women who persevered and triumphed in a half century \n     of Cold wAr against the most monstrous tyranny mankind has \n     ever known.\n       Now the time of testing is coming for you. The America that \n     this Class of '99 shall inherit is rich and prosperous and \n     powerful, but also envied and resented.\n       And whether America retains into this new century what she \n     carries out of this old on, depends now on your generation. \n     Fifty years from now, at the end of your lives, you will look \n     back, and say one of two things: Yes, we, too, made our \n     contribution to the preservation of the greatest republic the \n     world has ever seen. Or you will say that it was during your \n     custodianship that the lamp began to flicker, that we began \n     to follow inexorably in the footsteps of all the other great \n     nations, down the staircase of history.\n       All, then, will come to depend on the character, and \n     courage of this generation, for, as Churchill said, courage \n     is the greatest of all virtues, because it alone makes all \n     the others possible.\n       Last night at dinner, General Grinald's wife told me that \n     when members of the graduating classes are asked what they \n     will take away from the Citadel, almost invariably they say, \n     ``After going through the Citadel, I believe that I can do \n     anything.''\n       That is the spirit the Citadel instills, and that is the \n     spirit America needs. Because you have gone through this \n     Citadel that has always cherished duty, honor and country, \n     you are more prepared than most of your generation for what \n     lies ahead.\n       And the debt you owe the Citadel, the debt you owe your \n     parents, the debt you owe your teachers, and all those who \n     have gone before, is to be able to say, at the end of your \n     lives: We, too, were faithful to the Citadel; we, too, did \n     our duty; we, too, gave over to our children and their \n     children the greatest country the world has ever known.\n       God bless the Citadel, and God bless the Class of \n     '99.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5182-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5182-S5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A MILESTONE FOR NEW MEXICO ACEQUIAS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since my early days as a Senator, \nI have worked with Northern New Mexicans who have irrigated apple \norchards, chile crops, beans, and other subsistence commodities by \nusing a unique system of irrigation that is native to New Mexico's high \ndesert plateaus of the Rocky Mountains. For hundreds of years, \nHispanics have channeled Rio Grande River water for their crops through \na complex system of ditches. I first started working with these \n``acequia'' associations in 1976, when we first brought their needs to \nthe attention of the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Water from the Rio Grande River has been carefully syphoned off to \nprovide a basis for Hispanic life and culture for centuries. The annual \nrituals of cleaning, operating, and sharing this precious water have \nbecome an integral part of northern New Mexico's cultural life. \nIrrigators have formed alliances and cooperative agreements to meet the \nmany water needs of the area. ``Acequias,'' as they are known in \nSpanish, are the irrigation ditches that have given rise to centuries \nof critical life support systems.\n  Much of the beauty of cottonwood trees and apple orchards between \nEspanola and Taos was created by these man-made acequias. In addition \nto watering the orchards and fields, the acequias are a vital source of \nprecious water for the old trees that also live off this water system.\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\n  The historic value of this system of cooperative watering is well \nknown in northern New Mexico. In fact, when the acequia associations \nand I agreed to improve this system, our suggestions were resisted by \nState of New Mexico agencies on the grounds that concrete lining, for \nexample, would alter the historic value of these acequias.\n  Of course, the state agency did not want to help with the expensive \nand frequent repairs and annual maintenance. They wanted the \nsubsistence farmers to do this themselves, at their own expense.\n  Working with Las Nueve Acequias Steering Committee, and their \nexcellent Chairman Wilfred Gutierrez, we are now celebrating a quarter \ncentury of overcoming bureaucratic barriers and making real \nimprovements to this vast system of acequias. In the past twenty five \nyears, I have been able to convince my colleagues in the Senate of the \nvalue of acequias to the economy and culture of northern New Mexico.\n  The Congress has been accepting of my proposals. At my urging, the \nCongress authorized a special program to make the needed physical \nimprovements to acequias, while maintaining the traditional cooperative \nrelationships. The traditional leader of an acequia is the \n``mayordomo.'' Mike Martinez, the current mayordomo of the Chicos ditch \nin Velarde was on hand to christen the latest section of improvements \nin late April. This event was a milestone that marks a quarter century \nof a vital partnership with the federal government to keep these \nacequias operable for the next century.\n  We are still a couple of years away from completing $30 million worth \nof improvements in the Velarde area of New Mexico. Miles of acequias \nhave been greatly improved in the past quarter century. I have been \nfortunate to have the support of my colleagues for many appropriations \nover all these years. In gratitude for the consistent support of my \ncolleagues for funding these acequia projects, I would like them to see \nthe attached newspaper article from the Rio Grande Sun, May 6, 1999, by \nCynthia Miller, entitled, ``After 25 Years, Acequia Project Finally \nFinished''. This article gives us important insights into the value of \nthe acequias to thousands of northern New Mexicans. After a quarter \ncentury of improvements, the acequia users and associations can \ncontinue to rely on this essential source of water for their \nlifestyles, and their livelihood.\n  I ask that this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Rio Grande Sun, May 6, 1999]\n\n            After 25 Years, Acequia Project Finally Finished\n\n                          (By Cynthia Miller)\n\n       When the Chicos ditch in Velarde was opened April 28 during \n     a ceremony to celebrate the completion of 3000 feet of \n     improvement work, Las Nueve Acequias Steering Committee \n     Chairman Wilfred Gutierrez said he witnessed not only the one \n     ditch's progress that day, but also the past 25 years of \n     progress on a $20 million federal project covering nine \n     ditches in the area.\n       The 3000 feet of concrete piping from a Rio Grande dam up \n     the Chicos marks one of the last stages of the project, \n     Gutierrez said, estimating $15 million in federal funds has \n     been spent on the project so far.\n       He said the ditch was christened by acequia mayordomo Mike \n     Martinez and several federal Bureau of Reclamation officials \n     who gathered April 28 to watch as water was released from the \n     newly lined dam for the first time this spring.\n       The pricey nine-ditch project was initiated in the 1970s, \n     Gutierrez said, when residents of Velarde and surrounding \n     communities rebelled against a $28 million federal plan to \n     build a canal from the Rio Grande to the Santa Cruz River.\n       The group successfully stopped the canal from going in and \n     the community's irrigation water supply from going out, he \n     said, and then members got some ideas of their own. ``People \n     started asking me why couldn't we use some of that money to \n     rehabilitate our acequias?''\n       Gutierrez said the farmers in the area were always putting \n     time, money and labor into rebuilding dams and ditches which \n     were washed away by heavy river flows, and fixing spots where \n     muskrats, crawfish and other wildlife dug holes.\n       Rather then constantly rebuild the acequias just to see \n     them destroyed again, the community members wanted to improve \n     the ditches in a way that would be more permanent and would \n     require less strenuous maintenance efforts, he said.\n       In 1976 officers from the nine acequias organized into the \n     Las Nueve Acequias Steering Committee and asked Gutierrez to \n     serve as chairman, he said. The group then sought U.S. Sen. \n     Pete Domenici's help in securing Bureau of Reclamation funds \n     for their ditch improvement projects.\n       Following a Bureau of Reclamation feasibility study around \n     1980, he said, it was determined that the work would cost \n     about $20 million. Funds began to come in and plans were made \n     to get started.\n       The first and most crucial phase was to build new dams, \n     Gutierrez said. ``Before that, it was just the old ones that \n     the Spanish and the Indians built. Literally, we were just \n     washing money down the river.''\n       With each heavy rain, he said, the dams just washed away \n     and had to be rebuilt.\n       Seven new permanent dams were built by Las Nueve Acequias \n     and the Bureau of Reclamation to replace the nine previous \n     dams, he said, and then work was started on lining ditches \n     and creating other structures.\n       He explained the group is set up so that each ditch has its \n     own officers to make decisions on what work it wants done.\n       ``What's nice about this project is that it's up to the \n     people in the acequias to determine what they want. They have \n     to make the request,'' he said, adding he has served from the \n     start as an at-large representative of the steering \n     committee.\n       He represents no individual acequia, he said, and works \n     instead for the good of all nine.\n       Part of his work has included overcoming obstacles standing \n     in the way of ditch improvements, such as the state \n     Environment Department and the state Game and Fish \n     Department's objections to ditch work, Gutierrez said.\n       The departments wanted the ditches to remain in their more \n     natural states.\n       ``They wanted the acequias to exist like before, but they \n     didn't realize how expensive it was. And they didn't want to \n     help fix them,'' he said. ``They wanted the acequia groups to \n     be burdened with the expense of keeping the acequias as they \n     had existed.''\n       Gutierrez said he was glad to see the project is nearing \n     its completion.\n       ``When we started it, we thought we could finish it in \n     eight years,'' he said, ``and it's taken 25. . . . We'd like \n     to finish this project in the next two years.''\n       Gutierrez said Las Nueve Acequias has plans to do more work \n     on its ditches this fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5183-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AWARD WINNER\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the week of May 9, 1999 is \nNational Hospital Week, when communities across the country celebrate \nthe people that make hospitals the special places they are. This year's \ntheme sums it up nicely: ``People Care, Miracles Happen.'' It \nrecognizes the health care workers, volunteers and other health \nprofessionals who are there 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, curing and \ncaring for their neighbors who need them.\n  An example of this dedication is the Sexual Assault Response of \nAntelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California. The program won the \nAmerican Hospital Association's prestigious Hospital Award for \nVolunteer Excellence for 1999, which highlights special contributions \nof hospital volunteers.\n  The Sexual Assault Response Service is a team of hospital volunteers \nthat offers specialized assistance to sexual assault victims, families, \nhospital personnel and law enforcement agencies. To meet the program's \nhigh standards, volunteers get more than 60 hours of training.\n  Responding to a call from any area hospital emergency department, \nthey provide support to victims while helping to solicit histories, \npreparing evidence collection kits, assisting with medical and legal \nexaminations, and overseeing the completion of state forms. Volunteers \nwork with the district attorney's office throughout the court process \nand offer one-on-one counseling, a referral service, a lending library \nand community education.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Antelope Valley Hospital for \nthis award-winning effort and for their generous contributions to their \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5183-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5183-S5184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF CFIDS AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of Lehigh Valley in \nfighting Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), or \nChronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).\n  Through a tireless effort, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley is \ncommitted to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness and \nproviding support for victims of this disease. Public education is an \nintegral part of the association's mission, and the Lehigh Valley \norganization works to raise awareness through the International CFIDS \nAwareness Day, which\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nis held on May 12 each year. In addition, the Lehigh Valley \norganization is actively involved in CFS-related research and regularly \nparticipates in seminars to train health care professionals. It is also \nimportant to note that the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley received \nthe CFIDS Support Network Action Award in 1995 and 1996 for their \npublic advocacy initiatives.\n  Although some progress has been made in the study of CFIDS, this \ncondition is largely still a mystery. With no known cause or cure for \nthe disease, victims experience a variety of symptoms including extreme \nfatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and neurological \nproblems, tender lymph nodes, nausea and vertigo. The Centers for \nDisease Control has given CFIDS ``Priority 1'' status in the new \ninfectious disease category which also includes cholera, malaria, \nhepatitis C and tuberculosis. The Lehigh Valley organization will \npersistently continue its research and education campaigns until this \ndisease is obliterated.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the \nLehigh Valley organization and in supporting the following \nproclamation:\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, on May 12, 1999 the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) \n     Association of Lehigh Valley joined the Chronic Fatigue and \n     Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) Association of America, \n     the largest organization dedicated to conquering CFIDS, in \n     observing International Chronic Fatigue and Immune \n     Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and\n       Whereas, CFIDS is a complicated disease which is \n     characterized by neurological, rheumatological and \n     immunological problems, incapacitating fatigue, as well as a \n     number of other symptoms that can persist for months or years \n     and can be severely debilitating; and\n       Whereas, estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of \n     American adults already have CFIDS; and\n       Whereas, the medical community, as well as the public \n     should receive more information and develop a greater \n     awareness of the effects of CFIDS. While much has been done \n     at the national, state and local level, more must be done to \n     support patients and their families; and\n       Whereas, research has been enhanced by the efforts of the \n     Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health and other private institutions, the CFS Association of \n     Lehigh Valley recognizes that there is still much more to be \n     done to encourage further research so that the mission of \n     conquering CFIDS and related disorders can be achieved;\n       Therefore, the United States Senate commends the efforts of \n     the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley, as well as those \n     battling the disease and applauds the designation of May 12, \n     1999 as CFIDS Awareness Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5184-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5184-S5185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COLORADO BOYS RANCH\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ndraw attention to an anniversary. Forty years ago yesterday, the \nColorado Boys Ranch Foundation was incorporated. Yesterday they \ncelebrated forty years as a leader in the field of youth work.\n  The Colorado Boys Ranch places emphasis upon youth, especially those \nwho are vulnerable to or troubled by the negative influences and \npressures of our society. Their motto is ``It's easier to build a boy \nthan mend a man.''\n  Thirty eight years ago, my predecessor, Senator John Carroll of \nColorado, spoke on this floor on the merits of the then still new \nRanch, and I am here to echo the spirit of his comments.\n  Colorado Boys Ranch was created through volunteer labor and public \nand private contributions. This ranch is located just north of La \nJunta, Colorado. In 1959 the La Junta Chamber of Commerce and the \nColorado County Judge's Association had a vision to build a treatment \ncenter for wayward youth coming from broken and unloving homes. The \nCity of La Junta had received from the United States Government an \nabandoned WWII air field, and they gave the Foundation the civilian \nhousing area from that field. Businesses and volunteers immediately \ncame forth with offers to help remodel this facility to accommodate \nplans for the Ranch.\n  Of the committee of ten that started the ball rolling, two are still \nalive. Of the four judges that were involved personally, only one \nremains. Their volunteerism inspired others over the past forty years, \nand the overall efforts have been great and still continue strong to \nhelp the Ranch in its great efforts.\n  Over the past forty years, 4,000 plus youth have been treated at \nColorado Boys Ranch and over 85% have continued on to be productive \ncitizens. The Ranch is accredited with commendation by the Joint \nCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, and is \ncertified and licensed by the Colorado Department of Human Services, \nMental Health and Education.\n  The Colorado Boys Ranch program is based upon the following beliefs: \nThat preserving families and family ties takes continual effort and a \nspirit of renewal. That youth require essential life experiences and \nskills to maximize their growth and development. That something special \nhappens when the lives of youth and animals connect. And, that CARING \nBRINGS RESULTS.\n  Recently, the Ranch received the Samaritan Institute Award for \nEthics. This prestigious award is presented annually to a non-profit \norganization that best illustrates the importance of ethical values \nthrough its chartered work and its partnership with the business \ncommunity.\n  I commend the goals of the ranch, and its purpose as a leader in the \nfield of working with vulnerable youth and helping them find their role \nin modern society. I invite you to visit the Colroado Boys Ranch should \nyou ever be in the state--over its forty year history, it has served \nyouth from over twenty states across our nation.\n  Mr. President, the fortieth anniversary of the Colorado Boys Ranch \nFoundation would be special any day that it happened to fall upon, but \ntoday it is especially notable. We debate today on youth violence and \nyouth crime, and ways to curb that horrible scourge. The Ranch has \nfound a solution, a solution that will not perhaps work across the \nwhole nation, but is certainly working for those it serves.\n  Following also in the path of Senator Carroll, I ask that an article \nfrom the Denver Post on the Ranch and its good works be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows.\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Jan. 23, 1999]\n\n                    Boys Ranch Helps Troubled Youth\n\n                           (By Keith Coffman)\n\n       Those seeking testimonials about how the horsemanship \n     program helps troubled youth at the Colorado Boys Ranch don't \n     need to look far. Current ranch residents will gladly oblige, \n     thank you very much.\n       ``Before I came here, I was living on the street, taking \n     drugs and didn't care about anything, even myself,'' said \n     George, a 17-year-old who's been at the ranch for six months. \n     ``Now I've learned responsibility by taking care of my horse \n     and focusing on one objective at a time.''\n       George is one of 60 youth at the ranch, a residential \n     treatment center for troubled boys ages 12 to 18. He was \n     facing jail time for a variety of petty crimes in Nevada. But \n     after six months in Colorado, he now thanks his probation \n     officer for giving him a second chance by suggesting the \n     ranch.\n       ``I still show a little stubbornness, but I've gotten \n     better at listening to people,'' he said.\n       Located on 320 acres near La Junta in southeastern \n     Colorado, the private, nonprofit Colorado Boys Ranch offers \n     therapy, education and pre-vocational training to its \n     residents, many of whom are referred by courts and social \n     service agencies nationwide.\n       A handful of residents and staff participated in several \n     activities at this year's National Western Stock Show and \n     Rodeo as part of the ranch's animal-assisted therapy program.\n       Boys in the program trained three roping, or heading, \n     horses for entries by Colorado Boys Ranch ranch hands in the \n     pre-circuit team roping event earlier in the show. They also \n     showed a 4-year-old donated quarter horse in the halter \n     competition.\n       Although insurance regulations prohibit residents from \n     competing in rodeo and other events, the boys took pride in \n     seeing their contributions to a major event like the National \n     Western, said Jim Kerr, director of the horsemanship program \n     for the Boys Ranch.\n       ``They also get a chance to see our staff and other \n     professionals as positive role models, which I think is very \n     important,'' Kerr said.\n       But the horsemanship program isn't just about playing \n     cowboy, Kerr said. The ranch teaches its charges all facets \n     of horsemanship, from riding to the less-glamorous task of \n     cleaning corrals,. Classroom instruction also is incorporated \n     into real world experience on the ranch.\n       For instance, Kerr said, students apply their math skills \n     to calculate correct feed amounts for the animals they tend, \n     or watch a mare give birth to a foal to get a valuable \n     biology lesson. He said therapists also have found that many \n     boys are more forthcoming in counseling sessions done during \n     a leisurely horseback ride at the ranch, than those held in \n     more formal office settings.\n       For many of the youth, relating to animals often helps them \n     relate to people and prepare them for mainstream society, \n     Kerr said.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n       That's the case for Thurman, 17, who was skipping school \n     and getting into fights in his native Detroit before coming \n     to the ranch 18 months ago.\n       Raising and halter breaking an orphaned filly named Sweet \n     Pea, he said, has taught him to become disciplined enough to \n     get on track for his high school equivalency diploma, with a \n     goal of one day becoming an animal trainer.\n       ``When my mom comes to visit me, she sees how I've \n     changed,'' he said. ``I used to be very angry and aggressive, \n     and couldn't sit still.''\n       But none of the ranch's success stories surprise Kerr, a \n     former public school teacher.\n       ``I witness a miracle a day here,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5185-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ARLENE SIDELL\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

Ms. Sidell is an extraordinary public servant, who has \nconsistently served all the Members and staff on the Committee with \ntotal dedication and commitment.\n  The Commerce Committee, at a recent Executive Session, expressed its \ngratitude to Ms. Sidell for all she has done for the Committee and the \nSenate with extended applause.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of my statement made on Ms. \nSidell's behalf at the Commerce Committee Executive Session held on May \n5, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                    Acknowledgment of Arlene Sidell\n\n       Before we begin to consider items on today's agenda for our \n     Executive Session, I would like to take a moment to \n     acknowledge and extend my heartfelt thanks to Arlene Sidell. \n     Arlene, sitting before us, is the Director of the Commerce \n     Committee Public Information Office, and our official clerk \n     for Committee Executive Sessions. This will be the last time \n     we will see Arlene at one of our mark-ups, as she will soon \n     be retiring from an exemplary career in public service.\n       Arlene began her tenure with the Commerce Committee 36 \n     years ago, in March of 1963.

WILFRID ``BILL'' DESILETS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to pay \ntribute to Lt. Wilfrid Desilets, a U.S. Army Air Corps P-47 pilot from \nWorcester, Massachusetts who was lost over New Guinea on August 18, \n1943. His remains were recently located and identified, and I was \nprivileged and deeply honored to assist his family--including one of \nhis sisters, Therese Auger of Portsmouth, New Hampshire--with efforts \nto bring this case to resolution. I was also proud to attend the \nmilitary funeral for Lt. Desilets this past weekend and to present the \nFlag of the United States to the surviving family members. Lt. Desilets \nwas an American hero and a patriot who loved his country, loved his \nfamily, and loved to fly. He made the ultimate sacrifice for the cause \nof freedom during the Second World War, and I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to recognize his unselfish service to his country.\n  But no words of mine can match the moving eulogy delivered by \nTherese's husband, Lt. Col. Elvin C. Auger, USAF-ret. Mr. President, I \ntherefore ask that a copy of the eulogy, as delivered by Colonel Auger, \nappear in the Record.\n  The eulogy is as follows:\n\n   Flight Officer Wilfrid Desilets: Eulogy by Lt. Col. Ret. Elvin C. \n                           Auger, May 8, 1999\n\n       I would like to welcome all of you here today, a day this \n     family has waited so long for.\n       I want to begin by thanking you, Senator Smith, for all the \n     assistance you have given this family. Senator Bob Smith is \n     from New Hampshire. He's my Senator. We thank you for being \n     here today.\n       I have written this eulogy with the hope that all of you \n     but especially our sons, daughters, and now our grand-\n     children will get to know the Bill that we knew.\n       I would like to start by saying that I did know Bill and \n     his family before he left for the service and I am proud to \n     say that I have been a member of this family for 55 years.\n       Now Bill grew up in this family with both loving and caring \n     parents. He was the only boy with 7 sisters. To put it mildly \n     these 7 sisters simply adored him, or as my wife would say \n     today, ``Bill was simply the best''. Bill was a very handsome \n     young man, very religious, started many a day in the service \n     by going to early Mass. He was a good athlete, loved sports \n     and played most all of them.\n       Now I'm not sure where Bill was on that Sunday, Pearl \n     Harbor Day, but I can tell you for sure where he was very \n     early the next morning. He, with a very good buddy called Kip \n     would be at the Army Recruiting Office to volunteer and \n     serve. Both men knew exactly what they wanted. Bill had to be \n     a pilot and Kip wanted to be a gunner. Hopefully that day \n     they thought Bill's gunner. Incidentally that young man Kip \n     was not only Bills good buddy, he was my big brother.\n       Now Bill was so good at writing letters home that to read \n     them today is like reading a diary of his military career. In \n     fact the first days in the service when he was issued his \n     uniforms he would write, today I am a soldier.\n       Now Bill was off to basic training and as he completed it \n     he would be devastated for the Army was sending him to radio \n     operator school not pilot training. Though you know his heart \n     was broken he would write, at least I'll be flying on a crew. \n     Bill did go and complete radio school but then someone \n     somewhere would decide that this young man should be given \n     a chance for pilot training. Now you can imagine how high \n     the morale would be and how his letters home would sound.\n       Now Bill was off for the pilot training program, preflight \n     primary flying school, basic flying school, and then advance. \n     Now advance being the final phase would terminate with Bill's \n     graduation. We were all so proud of Bill for he was going to \n     be an Army Air Corps pilot.\n       Two of Bill's very pretty younger sisters would go to \n     Florida to be with him. They would be there the night before \n     graduation to attend the squadron dance with Bill and his \n     buddies and be there the following day with him for the \n     ceremonies to pin the bars and coveted silver wings on Bill. \n     I know for sure how very proud Bill felt that day, not only \n     for completing his pilot traing but also for having those two \n     sisters there with him. I know for sure how he felt for in a \n     couple of years later one of those sisters would be my wife \n     and be there with me at my graduation to pin my wings on.\n       Now Bill must have finished high in his class for his first \n     assignment would be to the 342 Fighter Squadron. Here he \n     would be flying the P47 Thunderbolt. At that time it was one \n     of our most modern and powerful fighter aircraft we had. Now \n     what was even nicer, Bill would do his transition flying at \n     the old Bedford Airport just 50 miles from home. This would \n     be the happiest time for Bill and his family for when Bill \n     had a little time off we could drive down and bring him home \n     for visits. He was also close enough that on some of his \n     local flights he might do just a little buzzing. What a \n     thrill it was for me to see Bill and his fighter come \n     screaming in low and pull up and away. At that time I would \n     soon be old enough to join and I made up my mind that I had \n     to be a pilot like Bill.\n       It was a also at this time that Bill would marry his \n     sweetheart Ann. Two short days after the wedding Bill and his \n     squadron would have their orders and be on their way \n     overseas. At the time it seemed like the cruelest, harshest \n     thing that could happen. And it was, but now when I think \n     back I would like to believe that at least Bill had some\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n     days of great happiness and he left knowing that his bride \n     Ann would be here waiting for him to come home. How these had \n     to be wonderful thoughts and memories for Bill to take with \n     him.\n       Now during the war the boys could not tell us where they \n     were stationed overseas but Bill did write he had seen his \n     first Kangaroo. Years later reading a book on Australian \n     airfields during the war I would read where Bill and his \n     squadron with their aircraft would come to Australia by \n     ships. Here the aircraft would be offloaded, reassembled, \n     test flown and on to New Guinea.\n       Now in New Guinea in about one month Bill would fly his \n     last mission. It was a big one. 16 of those fighters were in \n     that formation. They were flying a protective cover for some \n     air transports. That flight would enter into a box canyon \n     where the mountains went up to 10 and 12 thousand feet. The \n     weather deteriorated so badly that the flight could not turn \n     and exit that canyon. The pilots all had to break their \n     formation and climb blindly up through the clouds. Bill never \n     came up. In the days that followed, his good buddy then Capt. \n     Roddy would fly search missions over that area but the jungle \n     was not ready to give up its secret.\n       Now I was with the family that Sunday evening when the \n     notice of a telegram came. You can imagine the thoughts, the \n     fear, and the prayers that went through that family that long \n     night for a war time telegram was most always bad news. Very \n     early the next morning I drove Bill's dad to get that \n     telegram. I will never forget the look on his face and what \n     he said as he came back to the car.\n       He said, ``It's Bill, it's Bill, he is missing in action. \n     This will kill my wife.'' We had to take this news back home. \n     I can still see Mom and all the sisters on the back porch as \n     we drove in the yard. I guess they knew by his face that it \n     was bad news. All that poor man could do was to keep trying \n     to tell them that Bill was not dead, Bill was not dead, Bill \n     was missing in action.\n       Two years later the second telegram came. Bill was presumed \n     dead.\n       In the years that followed we lost Dad, Mom, and a sister, \n     Jean. I can assure you that their thoughts, their hopes and \n     their prayers were that someday Bill would be coming home.\n       Many, many years later while reading a book of the air wars \n     in New Guinea, I would read in this book that Flight Officer \n     Wilfrid Desilets was lost in the jungles of New Guinea \n     forever. That's the way it remained for 53 long years. Then \n     into our lives came the most amazing young man that I have \n     ever had the opportunity to meet and call a friend. He is a \n     successful businessman, a great writer, a fellow pilot but \n     most of all he was an adventurer and a man with a quest. This \n     man's quest was to find an aircraft that a great uncle had \n     been lost in during this war. The uncle's body had been \n     recovered some 14 years later. This man knows well what a \n     family goes through. On his second trip to New Guinea high up \n     in the mountains and deep in the jungle, he, with the \n     natives, would find Bill and his aircraft. Now he notified \n     the proper authorities and he knew that they could take years \n     to make a recovery identification, and then notify a family. \n     And he so rightfully thought that if Bill still had a family \n     that they would be aging and should know. So upon his return \n     he learned that Bill was probably from the Worcester area so \n     he, with his secretary Arlean, started a massive telephone \n     search for the surname Desilets. They were finally successful \n     and notified Yvette, one of the sisters. Now when we first \n     heard what this stranger said he had done it was \n     unbelievable, but we learned he had done it.\n       Now as all of you might well expect there are not adequate \n     words to express the feelings that this family has for this \n     man, the gratitude, the great respect, yes the love we feel \n     for this man. so for today I am simply going to say thank \n     you. Yes, thank you Fred Hagen, for without you we would \n     never have had our day today. I guess Fred it is your day too \n     for I have the feeling that you have adopted this family and \n     I know we have adopted you.\n       We have met and made such wonderful new friends during this \n     time. We have with us Colonel Roddy and a Colonel Benz, two \n     men, fighter pilots who were in that flight with Bill on his \n     last mission. You can imagine the honor it was for me to meet \n     these men and talk and learn of Bill's last mission. We were \n     recently invited to Bill's fighter squadron reunion. We went \n     there as guests and came home honored members. We heard such \n     wonderful stories and memories of Bill. One I would like to \n     share with you today. It is from a letter that a Sergeant \n     Iddings had written to Colonel Roddy when he learned Bill had \n     been found. In his letter he expressed the great sorrow that \n     the maintenance and ground support boys felt when Bill was \n     missing. He also said that in his mind Bill's tombstone \n     should be engraved with a blue ribbon and on it, it should \n     say that Bill was a blue ribbon gentleman and a blue ribbon \n     pilot. How I wish the Sergeant was with us today that we may \n     thank him but he to passed away last year.\n       To you sisters if I may. We have lived with this tragedy \n     most all of our lives. Now that we have what some may call \n     closure I would hope that when you think of Bill or look at \n     his pictures maybe your hearts may be just a little lighter \n     and remember too Bill will always remain that handsome young \n     man. He will never grow old as we have. I know too that each \n     of you have your own special memories of growing up with \n     Bill. Cherish them for they are yours forever.\n       I, for one, will always honor Bill for he was the type of \n     young man who, as his country was going to war, would be \n     among the first to volunteer and serve.\n       Bill was my hero for as a young man watching him fly his \n     fighter made me want to be a pilot like him.\n       Now if we had to lose Bill during this war, then I am \n     grateful that it would be while Bill was fulfilling his \n     greatest dream, for Bill was a fighter pilot.\n       Today from here, Bill will be taken to rest with his Mom \n     and Dad. Bill is no longer lost in that jungle. Bill is now \n     home, home with his family truly forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/12/senate-section/article/S5186-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REREFERRAL OF S. 28\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor, along with my \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, of the amendment he \nhas just introduced, the Children's Protection From Violent Programming \nAct amendment.\n  That is kind of a long title. What it means is Senator Hollings and I \nwould like to restore in television broadcasting a period of time \nduring the evenings when children are likely to be watching television, \nwhere the television programming would not be containing excess \nviolence.\n  The reason we feel that way is study after study, year after year--in \nfact, for decades--studies have shown the excessive violence in \ntelevision programming hurts our children. Yet, if you evaluate \ntelevision programming during what would normally be considered family \nviewing hours in this country, you will find the language has become \nmore coarse, words are used that were previously not used, that are not \nsuitable for children. You will also find substantial amounts of \nprogramming violence, gratuitous violence, during those shows.\n  Some would say, what about censorship? I think there are times when \nit is appropriate for the Federal Communications Commission to \nestablish a family viewing period in the evening where the television \nbroadcasting would be more appropriate, more suitable for our children, \nwhen children are watching those programs. We already have an instance \ndealing with obscenity, and the Supreme Court has upheld the \nopportunity and the responsibility given the Federal Communications \nCommission to carve out a period in which certain kinds of words and \nobscenities cannot be used because it is inappropriate for them to be \nused at a time when we expect children to be watching television.\n  We believe the same ought to be true with respect to television \nviolence. One might say, this is much ado about nothing; television \nviolence is nothing new; it is really not very important. Yet that is \nin defiance of all the conclusions of virtually all the studies. By the \ntime young children graduate from high school in our country, they will \nhave gone to school in classrooms for about 12,500 hours of their \nlives. But they will have watched television for about 20,000 hours. \nThey have sat in a classroom 12,500 hours and sat in front of a \ntelevision set 20,000 hours. Regrettably, too many of them are more a \nproduct of what they have watched than what they have read.\n  What is it they are watching? Some years ago I sponsored a project \nwith a college on the North Dakota-Minnesota border that created a \ntelevision violence report card. Volunteers at that college watched \ntelevision programs for an entire week and cataloged each and every \nprogram and produced a report card on what kind of violence on \ntelevision was being portrayed to our children. If you simply condense \nwhat our children are watching on television--yes, even during what \nwould be considered family viewing hours--it is quite remarkable.\n  Imagine if someone came to your door tomorrow and said: You know, you \nhave two children. They are age 6 and 9. We would like to put on a \ndramatic play for them. We have a group of actors out here in our van \nand we have some stage props. We would like to come into your home, \ninto your living room, and we would like to put on a little play for \nyour children.\n  So they come in. In the living room they put on a play. In this \ndramatic play they shoot each other, stab each other, beat each other \nup. Blood runs freely. There is screaming, there is horror.\n\n  You would probably say to those actors: You are just committing child \nabuse in my living room, doing that in front of my children. What on \nEarth can you be thinking of? Yet that is exactly what happens in our \nliving rooms with that electronic box, with programming coming to our \nchildren at times when children are watching television, programming \nthat is not fit for children.\n  So the response they have is, turn the television set off. Easy to \nsay. Of course, most homes have a good number of television sets, \nprobably two or three in different parts of the homes. In many homes \nthere are circumstances where the parents are attentive parents, good \nparents, who try very hard to supervise the children's viewing habits, \nbut it is very, very hard to do.\n  In fact, if you were watching, one day recently, a television set \nthat depicted the unspeakable horror that was visited upon those \nstudents in Littleton High School, in the middle of the live reports \nwith SWAT teams and students running out of school, with the \nunderstanding that children had been murdered, in the middle of all \nthat one television network took a break and on came a commercial--of \ncourse, louder than everything else because commercials are always \nlouder--advertising that you really needed to pay attention to their \nnext big program. The next program was ``Mr. Murder.'' You really \nneeded to watch ``Mr. Murder'' because this was going to be exciting.\n  All of this, coming at our children in television programming, study \nafter study points out, hurts our children. This is not helpful to \nchildren. It is hurtful to children.\n  Newton Minow, many, many years ago--1961 in fact--said, ``Television \nis a vast wasteland of blood, thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism and \nmurder.'' He said, ``In 1961 I worried that my children would not \nbenefit much from television. But in 1991 I worry that my children will \nactually be harmed by it.''\n  Television executives produce some wonderful programming as well. You \ncan turn to certain programs on television and be struck by the beauty \nand the wonder and the information. I have sat with my children \nwatching the History Channel, for example, or certain programs on the \nDiscovery Channel. I should not begin naming them. There are some \nwonderful, beautiful things from time to time on television. But there \nare some ugly, grotesque things on television as well, some of which \ncome through our television sets during times children are expected to \nbe watching.\n\n  What the Senator from South Carolina proposes is very simple: to go \nback to a time when we had in this country a period described by the \nFCC as a ``family viewing period'' that would be relatively free of \ngratuitous violence being displayed in those programs.\n  Is that so extreme, so radical? Do we really believe that we have to \nhurt our children in order to entertain our adults? I do not think so. \nIt does not make any sense to me. There is plenty of opportunity in a \nlot of areas to entertain adults in this country, but it seems to me \nperfectly reasonable that at certain times when you expect families to \nbe watching with children in the household that we could try to reduce \nthe amount of violence on television.\n  I understand that some will portray this as a terrible idea. They \nwill say we now have some ratings systems, and the ratings will give \nparents the capability of better supervising their children's viewing \nhabits. That is true. I commend the broadcasting industry for having \nratings. Not all do. One of the major networks has declined. The \nratings themselves have not been used very much.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\n  We have a V-chip that is coming in all new television sets. I offered \nthe first V-chip bill in the Senate some years ago. That is now law, \nand that will help parents sort out the programming with certain \nviolent scenes.\n  The fact is, we need to do more. The Senator from South Carolina and \nI have offered an amendment that we think will be helpful. We do not \nbelieve it has constitutional problems. This is not about free speech. \nYou can say pretty much what you want to say and you can depict \nviolence, but we are saying during a certain period of time, you cannot \ndo it in a way that injures children.\n  I thought it might be useful to go over a couple of the pieces of \nevidence that most all of us have become acquainted with in all of the \nstudies and hearings that we have had. I guess I have been involved in \nthis issue for 7, 8 years. We have had hearings in the Commerce \nCommittee and elsewhere.\n  I have a couple of young children who are now age 12 and age 10. We \ntry very hard to make certain that we monitor their viewing habits. Our \n12-year-old said to us: Well, friends of ours are able to go to movies \nthat are PG-13 movies.\n  We say: That might be something their parents let them do, but we \ndon't. We don't want you to see material that is inappropriate.\n  Movies have ratings, and so you make affirmative decisions whether \nyou are going to go out or allow your child to go out with someone else \nand see a movie. But television is different. Television is in our \nfamily rooms, in our homes. When we turn that dial on the television, \nthe programming that is shown on that television set is programming \nthat is offered for entertainment and for profit.\n  The first amendment allows people to produce all kinds of \nprogramming. As I mentioned before, there are some wonderful, wonderful \nthings on television. There is also some trash on television. It seems \nto me it would be helpful for parents to have the assistance of the \nFederal Communications Commission and broadcasters in complying with an \namendment of this sort adopted by the Congress that will give parents \nthe feeling that during certain periods, they will not have to worry \nabout what kind of violent scenes are going to be displayed to their \nchildren on that television set.\n\n  I have a fair amount of things I want to say about the amendment in \naddition to this, but we have a conference committee meeting. The \nappropriations conference committee is ongoing in the basement of this \nbuilding, and I am a conferee, so I must return. I know Senator \nHollings and I will be back on the floor tomorrow morning and will be \nspeaking on behalf of this amendment.\n  My hope is between now and then we will be able to encourage other \nMembers of the Senate to be supportive of this amendment. I know others \nhave come out. I have been in the conference committee, and I have not \nbeen here for much debate on the juvenile justice bill.\n  Also tomorrow, I want to take a moment to describe a visit I just \nmade to the Oakhill Detention Center in Laurel, MD. I went out there \nbecause I wanted to sit down and talk with juvenile offenders. I wanted \nto try to understand from judges who were there, from prosecutors and \nfrom public defenders, and from the juvenile offenders themselves: What \nis going on?\n  I sat with a young boy who had been in a gang and shot three times \nand sold drugs at age 12.\n  I sat with a girl who was 15 years old. She had a baby 2 years \nprevious to that. She was abused by her mother. She sold drugs at age \n13.\n  I sat with another young boy who was selling drugs at age 12 who had \nbeen involved with guns and very serious offenses.\n  These are kids who shot people, kids who committed armed robbery, \nkids who were in a lot of trouble.\n  One of the boys said something that was quite remarkable--most all of \nthem came from circumstances of really difficult conditions, no \nparental supervision. In fact, the young girl said her mother was a \ndrug addict and told her, from the moment she was able to understand \nwhat her mother was saying, that she would never amount to anything. \nShe told this girl: You will never amount to anything and I never \nwanted you in the first place. That was from a drug-addict mother. This \nyoung girl is now locked up and has been convicted of selling drugs and \nother criminal acts. She has a baby and is only 15 years old.\n  We talked about supervision, how do you get your life straight? Who \ncares about you? Somebody said: But you need to have a parent check up \non you once in a while, don't you?\n  This young boy said: No, you don't need a parent to check up on you \nonce in a while. That's the problem.\n  If you have maybe a grandparent or uncle and aunt and someone checks \nin once in a while, once in a while is not enough for children. \nChildren need help, need parental supervision, not once in a while.\n  I spent a half day out at the Oakhill Detention Center just talking \nwith kids to try to understand. I should also say--I will talk a bit \nabout it tomorrow--there is another part of that Oakhill Detention \nCenter that left me feeling a little buoyant and hopeful.\n  There were some young men--in this case it was older young boys, some \nyoung boys who had committed horrible crimes, who had been drug addicts \nfrom age 12 on to about 17, 18, young boys in a program to shed \nthemselves of their drug addiction and to turn their lives around. One \nyoung boy was going to be released the Friday I was there. This is a \ncouple weeks ago, and he had a job. He had gone out for an interview \nand had gotten himself a job.\n\n  This young guy had gone through the drug program. He has become \nstraight. It is fascinating to listen to him describe his background, \nwhere he wants to go, and what he now knows he needs to do to get his \nlife back in order.\n  The reason I want to talk about it is part of this issue of juvenile \njustice is, yes, detention and protection and law enforcement, and \nanother part of it is to say there is something else here that we need \nto do to help. I know that is a debate that has occurred on this floor \nnow for many, many hours. But mentoring programs, afterschool \nprograms--there are a lot of programs that can make a difference in \nyoung people's lives, especially programs dealing with drugs. Drugs \nwere at the root of a lot of the troubled lives of the young children \nwhom I saw at this detention center.\n  I hope we can come back tomorrow and talk a little bit about the \nJuvenile Justice Act.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is wonderful that the Senator has \ndone that. I feel as if we are two trains passing in the night on this \nbill. I hope the Senator will understand something that is extremely, \nextremely important: that the juvenile accountability block grant--\nwhich has been referred to as nothing but a ``lock them up'' program \nand that what we need is prevention money--is to encourage just the \nkind of situation the Senator is talking about because had those \nchildren just been released again, and not been sent to a well-run, \nwell-organized drug treatment school, detention facility, in which they \nwere removed from their community, they probably would be on the \nstreets now, maybe committing a more serious crime or a victim \nthemselves of a serious crime.\n  So I think there is a false contrast between what is prevention and \nwhat is not. I would say that a child who is already running into \ntrouble with the law--as these children are--has to be confronted. \nThere has to be an effective intervention in a life going wrong. And \nthese kinds of facilities are going on around the country.\n  I visited one in Illinois. Judge Grossman gave us a tour. The county \nand the State, and some Federal moneys, have helped create a panoply of \noptions when a young person comes before him for sentencing. He has a \nnumber of options. Instead of the juvenile going to where there are a \nfew bed spaces in the State pen or released with nothing, the judge has \na series of things right there in the community he can do. The \naccountability block grant, with graduated sanctions, provides that \nopportunity.\n  So I would hope the Senator, as he studies this, would realize that \nthe prevention money that we put in would not go to support that, but \nthe block grant accountability money would support the judiciary as it \nseeks to intervene.
