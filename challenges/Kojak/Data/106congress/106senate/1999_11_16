Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Federal \nDeath Penalty Abolition Act of 1999, a bill I introduced last \nWednesday. This bill will put an immediate halt to executions and \nforbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence for violations \nof Federal law.\n  Since the beginning of this year, this Chamber has echoed with debate \non violence in America. We have heard about violence in our schools and \nneighborhoods. But I am not so sure that we in Government don't \ncontribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and \ndeath. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution \ncarried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both \nthe State and Federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. \nWith each person executed, we are teaching our children that the way to \nsettle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human \nlife.\n  Those who favor the death penalty should be pressed to explain why \nfallible human beings should presume to use the power of the state to \nextinguish the life of a fellow human being on our collective behalf. \nThose who oppose the death penalty should demand that explanation \nadamantly, and at every turn. But only a zealous few try. We should do \nbetter. And we should use this moment to do better as we step not only \ninto a new century but also a new millennium, the first such landmark \nsince the depths of the Middle Ages.\n  Across the globe, with every American who is executed, the entire \nworld watches and asks, How can the Americans, the champions of human \nrights, compromise their own professed beliefs in this way? A majority \nof nations have abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Even \nRussia and South Africa--nations that for years were symbols of \negregious violations of basic human rights and liberties--have seen the \nerror of the use of the death penalty. Next month, Italy and other \nEuropean nations--nations with which the United States enjoys its \nclosest relationships--are expected to introduce a resolution in the \nU.N. General Assembly calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death \npenalty.\n  So why does the United States remain one of the nations in the \ndistinct minority to use the death penalty? Some argue that the death \npenalty is a proper punishment because it is a deterrent. But they are \nsadly, sadly mistaken. The Federal Government and most States in the \nUnited States have a death penalty, while our European counterparts do \nnot. Following the logic of death penalty supporters who believe it is \na deterrent, you would think that our European allies, who don't use \nthe death penalty, would have a much higher murder rate than we do in \nthe United States. Yet, they don't; and it is not even close. In fact, \nthe murder rate in the United States is six times higher than the \nmurder rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times \nhigher than in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden.\n  But we don't even need to look across the Atlantic to see that \ncapital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. Let's compare \nWisconsin and Texas. I am proud of the fact that my great State, \nWisconsin, was the first State in this Nation to abolish the death \npenalty completely, when it did so in 1853. So Wisconsin has been death \npenalty-free for nearly 150 years. In contrast, Texas is the most \nprodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 192 people since \n1976. So let's look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and in Texas. \nDuring the period from 1995 to 1998, Texas has had a murder rate that \nis nearly double the murder rate in Wisconsin. This data alone calls \ninto question the argument that the death penalty is a deterrent to \nmurder.\n  I want to be clear. I believe murderers and other violent offenders \nshould be severely punished. I am not seeking to open the prison doors \nand let murderers come rushing out into our communities. I don't want \nto free them. But the question is, Should the death penalty be a means \nof punishment in our society?\n  The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is \ndisturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the \nStates' and the Federal Government's use of the death penalty is often \nnot consistent with the principles of due process, fairness and \njustice.\n  It just cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to \ndeath. Since\n\n[[Page S14597]]\n\nthe modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we have released \n82 men and women from death row. Why? Because they were innocent. \nThat's one death row inmate found innocent for every seven executed. \nOne in seven! That's a pretty poor performance for American justice.\n  Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the specter of \nracism in our criminal justice system. Even though our nation has \nabandoned slavery and segregation, we unfortunately are still living \nwith vestiges of institutional racism. In some cases, racism can be \nfound at every stage of a capital trial--in the selection of jurors, \nduring the presentation of evidence, and sometimes during jury \ndeliberations.\n  After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the \ndeath penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the \nfederal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since \nthat time, numerous additional federal crimes have become death \npenalty-eligible, bringing the total to about 60 statutes today. At the \nfederal level, 21 people have been sentenced to death. Of those 21 on \nthe federal government's death row, 14 are black and only 5 are white. \nOne defendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 21 \npeople on federal death row are minorities. That's just over 75%. And \nthe numbers are worse on the military's death row. Seven of the eight \nmen, or 87.5%, on military death row are minorities.\n  One thing is clear: no matter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the \ninevitable fallibility of being human. That fallibility means that we \nwill not be able to apply the death penalty in a fair and just manner.\n  At the end of 1999, at the end of a remarkable century and millennium \nof progress, I cannot help but believe that our progress has been \ntarnished with our nation's not only continuing, but increasing use of \nthe death penalty. As of today, the United States has executed 585 \npeople since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976. In those \n23 years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of executions. This \nyear the United States has already set a record for the most executions \nin our country in one year, 85--the latest execution being that of \nRicky Drayton, who was executed by lethal injection just last Friday by \nthe state of South Carolina. And the year isn't even over yet. We are \non track to hit close to 100 executions this year. This is astounding \nand it is embarrassing. We are a nation that prides itself on the \nfundamental principles of justice, liberty, equality and due process. \nWe are a nation that scrutinizes the human rights records of other \nnations. We are one of the first nations to speak out against torture \nand killings by foreign governments. It is time for us to look in the \nmirror.\n  Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. In 1994, Justice \nHarry Blackmun penned the following eloquent dissent:\n\n       From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the \n     machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have \n     endeavored--indeed, I have struggled--along with a majority \n     of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules \n     that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to \n     the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle \n     the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has \n     been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel \n     morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede \n     that the death penalty experiment has failed. It is \n     virtually self-evident to me now that no combination of \n     procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save \n     the death penalty from its inherent constitutional \n     deficiencies.\n\n  Similarly, after supporting Supreme Court decisions upholding the \ndeath penalty, Justice Lewis Powell in 1991 told his biographer that he \nnow thought capital punishment should be abolished. After sitting on \nour nation's highest court for over 20 years, Justices Blackmun and \nPowell came to understand the randomness and unfairness of the death \npenalty. It is time for our nation to follow the lead of these \ndistinguished jurists.\n  The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong \nand it is immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right,'' could \nnot be more appropriate here. Our nation has long ago done away with \nother barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off the ears of \nsuspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these punishments \nas contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to abolish the death \npenalty as we enter the next century. The continued viability of our \njustice system as a truly just system requires that we do so.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great nation. Last week, I introduced a bill \nthat abolishes the death penalty at the federal level. I call on all \nstates that have the death penalty to also cease this practice. Let us \nstep away from the culture of violence and restore fairness and \nintegrity to our criminal justice system. As we head into the next \nmillennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I wanted to take some time, since we have \na little on our hands this morning, to talk about an issue that \ncontinues to be very important for our part of the country, the West. \nThe Presiding Officer comes from a State that is similar to Wyoming. \nThe ownership of land by the Federal Government continues to be an \nissue, and I think it is more of an issue now than it has been in the \npast, largely because of some of the actions in recent times by the \nadministration of not only obtaining more land for the Federal \nGovernment but also changing some of the management techniques.\n  This issue, of course, has been one of controversy for a long time \nwithin the West. The West has large amounts of land that belongs to the \nFederal Government. So when you develop the economy of your State, \nmanagement of the lands has a great deal to do with it. In Wyoming, for \nexample, the three leading economic activities are agriculture, \nminerals, and tourism, all of which have a great deal to do with public \nresources, with lands. So it is one of the most important issues with \nwhich we deal.\n  It is interesting to see the percentages of Federal land holdings by \nState. As shown on this chart, you can see that here in the East \ngenerally 1 to 5 percent of the lands are federally owned. When you get \nto the West, it becomes 35 to 65 percent and as high as 87 percent in \nsome States. So when you talk about how you operate an economy in New \nJersey or in North Carolina, it is quite different. When you talk about \npublic lands, it is seen quite differently. The impact in States such \nas that is relatively minor, where the impact in the West is much \ngreater. Look at Alaska, for example. It makes a great deal of \ndifference.\n  There are several kinds of lands, of course, and nobody argues with \nthe idea that the purpose of dealing with these public lands is to \npreserve the resources. All of us want to do that. The second purpose, \nhowever, is to allow for its owners, the American people, who use them, \nto have access to these lands for hunting, fishing, grazing, timber--\nall of the things that go with multiple use and healthy public lands. \nReally, that is where we are. No one argues about the concept of these \nresources, but there is great argument about the details of how you do \nit.\n  One of the things that is happening now--and part of it is in the \nappropriations bills that will be before us tomorrow--relates to the \npurchase of lands and changing some of the management techniques so the \nlands become less accessible to the people who live there, less a part \nof the society of these States.\n  It is difficult to see on this chart, but this is Wyoming, where over \n50 percent of the land belongs to the Federal Government. The green \ncolors are Forest Service lands which were set aside by action of the \nCongress, action of the\n\n[[Page S14598]]\n\nFederal Government, for specific purposes, and we still fulfill those \npurposes.\n\n  Some of the lands were set aside as wilderness. When the wilderness \nwas set aside, others were proclaimed to be for multiple use. Before \nthat changed from multiple use to wilderness, it said specifically in \nthe Wyoming wilderness bill that Congress had to act on it. The red \narea is Federal lands, Indian reservations. Yellow is the BLM lands. \nThe light green in the corners is national parks which were set aside \nfor a very specific purpose. That purpose continues to be one that is \nvery close to the hearts of the American People. I happen to be \nchairman of the parks subcommittee and work on those very much. The \nyellow--the majority of the public lands in our State, as is the case \nwith most other Western States--is Bureau of Land Management lands. \nInterestingly enough, when the Homestead Act was in place and people \nwere taking homesteads in the West, BLM lands were basically residual \nlands, not set aside for any particular purpose. They were simply there \nwhen the homestead expired, and they are there now to be managed for \nmultiple use.\n  Let me go back to the notion that this is what has created some of \nthe current controversy--the fact that these lands change when they are \nused differently. Congress should have a role in this. This is not a \nmonarchy, a government where the President can decide suddenly he is \ngoing to acquire more lands without the authority of the Congress. That \nis kind of where we are now. There are several of these programs that \nare threatening to the West, including the concept of the Federal \nGovernment's intrusion into the whole of society in States in the West.\n  A number of things are happening. One is the so-called ``land \nlegacy'' that the administration is pushing. It is an idea presented by \nthe President--I think largely by Vice President Gore--that the Federal \nGovernment somehow should own a great deal more land than it owns now. \nIndeed, they have asked for a set-aside from the offshore royalties of \na billion dollars a year to acquire more lands. In many cases, their \nidea is not to have any involvement of the Congress at all but simply \nto allow them to have this money set aside, without the appropriations \nprocess, so that they can purchase additional lands each year. A \nportion of that is in this year's Interior program, but the big one, of \ncourse, is still controversial in the Congress, and it was being dealt \nwith in the House last week or the week before.\n  So the question is, if there is to be more Federal land, where should \nit be? The other is, if there is to be more, what is the role of \nCongress to authorize it and appropriate funds for that as opposed to \nhaving a sort of monarchy set-aside to do that.\n  The other, of course, in my view, has to do with the use of these \ndollars. We talked about the parks. That is one of the things. We have \n378 parks, or units, managed by the Park Service in this country; they \nare very important to Americans. The infrastructure in many of them \nneeds to be repaired and updated. I argue this money that might be \navailable from these kinds of sources ought to be used for the \ninfrastructure of these parks so that we can continue to support the \nmaintenance and availability of enjoyable visits for the American \npeople. I believe we need to do that.\n\n  Another that has come along more recently is a pronouncement by the \nForest Service that they would like to set aside 40 million acres in \nthe forest as ``roadless.'' Nobody knows what ``roadless'' means. Is \nthat a synonym for wilderness? We don't know. We had a hearing to try \nto get that answered by the Secretary of Agriculture and by the Chief \nof the Forest Service. We were unable to do so. Many people I know \nbelieve that would limit the access and would not allow people to hunt, \nfor example, in places where they aren't able to walk because they are \nelderly, or whatever the reason, and that it will be most difficult to \nhave a healthy forest, where you cannot remove some of the trees that \nare matured and, rather, let them die or let insects infect them. These \nare the kinds of things that are of great concern.\n  There is also what is called an action plan, the conservation of \nwater action plan, which seems to be put forth by EPA and other \nagencies more to control management of the land than clean water. The \nclean water action plan says you can do certain things and you cannot \ndo certain things. The key is there needs to be participation by people \nwho live there. There needs to be some participation in cooperating \nagencies, participation with the State, participation with the agencies \nthere, so we can work together to preserve the resource but also \npreserve access to those resources and continue to allow them to be \npart of the recreational economy in our States.\n  There are other programs that also put at risk the opportunity to use \nthese lands, such as endangered species, about which there is a great \ncontroversy in terms of whether there is a scientific basis for the \nlisting of endangered species, whether there are, in fact, ways to \ndelist endangered species when it is proven there has been a recovery \nin terms of numbers. You can argue forever about that. These all go \ntogether to make public lands increasingly more difficult for owner \nutilization.\n  I guess one of the reasons that is difficult--and people who work \nwith these problems are basically in the minority--is that the Western \nStates are the ones that have almost all Federal ownership.\n  With respect to some of the things we might do with regard to the \nland legacy and the idea of putting money aside for public land \npurchase, we are prepared to try to put in this bill some sort of \nprotection and say we ought not, in States that have more than 25 \npercent of their surface owned by the Federal Government, to have any \nnet gain--that there may be things the Federal Government ought to \nacquire because they have a unique aspect to them, but they can also \ndispose of some so that there is no net increase. I think that is a \nreasonable thing to do and one we ought to pursue.\n  In terms of endangered species, it is very difficult to do anything \nwith a law that has been in place for 20 years. We have 20 years of \nexperience as to how to better manage it. Everyone wants to preserve \nthese species. But they shouldn't have to set aside private and public \nlands to do that. We believe if we would require more science in terms \nof nomination and listing--and indeed, when a species is listed, to \nhave a recovery plan at the same time--that would be very important.\n  One of the other activities is the Natural Environmental Protection \nAct, NEPA, a program in which there are studies designed to allow \npeople to participate in decisions. Is that a good idea? Studies could \nabsolutely go on forever.\n  We are faced currently, for example, with the problem in grazing. \nObviously, you have a renewable resource, grass. It is reasonable to \nhave grazing. You have that on BLM forest lands. Now we find in this \ncase that, under BLM, you can get through the NEPA process to renew a \ncontract, and they say: Too bad; your contract is dead, unless we can \nget to it, and we can't.\n  We are trying to change that. It is an unreasonable thing to do. If \nthere is all of this difficulty with the agency, we ought to change \nthat. Indeed, there is language in this year's appropriations bill to \ndo something about it.\n  I think we are faced with trying to find the best way to deal in the \nfuture with public lands. In States where there is 50 percent or more \nof land in Federal ownership, there is no reason we can't continue to \nprotect those resources; that we can't continue to utilize those lands \nin a reasonable way; that we can't involve people locally in the States \nin making these decisions and making shared judgments. We can do that.\n  Unfortunately, we find this administration moving in the other \ndirection--moving further way from working with NEPA. We hear about all \nof these kinds of partnerships. A partnership means there is some \nequality in working together. That is not the kind of partnership we \nhear a lot about from the Federal agency. I am hopeful that there can \nbe.\n  We are very proud of these resources: Yellowstone Park, Devil's \nTower--all kinds of great resources in Wyoming. Here is where I grew \nup, near the Shoshone Forest. I am delighted there is a forest there. \nIt should be, and it should continue to be there. But we need to have a \ncooperative management process to do that. I am committed. I am\n\n[[Page S14599]]\n\nalso committed to working toward that in the coming session.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on October 31 of this year, I saw yet \nanother example of the challenges we are facing in our National Park \nSystem.\n  Two weekends ago, I visited Bandelier National Monument in New \nMexico, located about 1 hour west of Santa Fe.\n  Bandelier National Monument was claimed a national monument under the \njurisdiction of the Forest Service in 1916. In 1932, it was transferred \nto the National Park Service.\n  Bandelier contains 32,737 acres, of which 23,267 acres are designated \nas wilderness. It is a park that is intended to preserve the cliff \nhouses of the Pueblo Indian.\n  I draw your attention to this photograph taken near the entrance to \nBandelier National Monument. One of the cliff homes can be seen at the \nbase of this large cliff which forms the most dramatic signature of \nBandelier National Monument. This photograph gives some idea of the \nmagnitude of the cultural resources which are located in this park.\n  In addition to the preservation of the cultural resource of the \nmonument, the outstanding superintendent at Bandelier, Mr. Roy Weaver, \nalso contends with preservation of historical resources such as 1930s \nCCC buildings which were constructed in order to properly present the \npark to its many visitors but which have fallen into a sad state of \ndisrepair.\n  Using funds from the recreation fee demonstration program, Bandelier \nNational Monument has refurbished several of these existing structures \nto a functional condition. This park, as many of our Nation's parks, is \nfaced with a degradation of its core resources. One of the significant \nchallenges is the unnatural pace of erosion within the monument's \nwilderness area.\n  This problem is in part due to intense grazing which occurred prior \nto the designation of the lands as a national monument in 1916. This \nactivity ended over 60 years ago but is still impacting the resources \nand the health of the park. The heavy grazing prior to 1916 reduced the \nunderbrush, allowing the pinon tree to take over the landscape. This \ntree is now firmly established and has prevented the growth of other \nnatural species in the canyon of Bandelier. Without the diverse plant \nspecies in the forest to retain the soil, erosion occurs at a much more \nrapid pace. This erosion is one of the principal reasons why the \narcheological sites for which the monument was established are now \nseverely threatened. We are in grave danger of losing artifacts, \nstructures, and information about a people who spent hundreds of years \nbuilding a society in the Southwest.\n\n  In addition to cultural resource damage to the unnatural state of the \nenvironment at Bandelier, human behavior has also had negative impacts. \nOne of the first areas visitors to Bandelier approach, and just off the \nmain trail, is a series of cave dwellings. Ascending the ladder into \nthe cave is stepping back hundreds of years into a different culture. \nOne arrives at the cave only to find the stark realities of \ncontemporary America by a desecration of these caves with graffiti. \nThis photograph showing an example of that desecration speaks a \nthousand words about the level of respect which we as a society have \npaid to our national treasures over the years.\n  There is some hope. In 1998, the Congress and the administration \nestablished a program at the suggestion of the National Park Service. \nIt is called Vanishing Treasures. This program was the brain child of \nthe national park superintendents from Chaco Culture National Historic \nSite, Aztec Ruins National Monument, and the Salinas Pueblo Missions \nNational Monument.\n  The Vanishing Treasure Program seeks to restore the ruins to a \ncondition where maintenance scheduled at regular intervals rather than \nlarge-scale restoration projects will be sufficient to keep the ruins \nin good condition. The program also has another very significant \nobjective: Training the next generation of preservation specialists who \ncan perform this highly specific, complex craftsmanship of maintaining \nnational treasures such as these caves at Bandelier National Monument.\n  The original outline of the Vanishing Treasures Program called for \n$3.5 million in the first year, increasing by $1 million per year until \nit reached $6 million in the year 2001, after which it would decrease \nslightly until the year 2008. We hoped during that time period to have \nbeen able to have dealt with the residue of issues such as the \ndesecration of the caves at Bandelier.\n  Unfortunately, beginning in fiscal year 1998, the funding was not at \nthe recommended $3.5 million level but, rather, was at $1 million. In \nfiscal year 1999, it was increased to $1.3 million. The current \nInterior appropriations bill, which has been passed by both the House \nand the Senate, contains $994,000 for the Vanishing Treasures Program.\n  At this level of funding distributed throughout the entire Southwest, \nsome 41 national park sites benefit from this program. At that level of \nfunding, we cannot possibly come close to meeting the needs for the \nprotection of our cultural treasures in the Southwest. We are \neffectively making the decision that we are prepared to see these \ncultural and historic treasures lost before we make funds available for \ntheir preservation.\n  We are at a crossroads in our Nation's historical efforts to protect \nand preserve those national treasures which are the responsibility of \nthe National Park Service. The history of our Nation is marked by \nactivism on public land issues. The first full century of the United \nStates' existence--the 19th century--was marked by the Louisiana \nPurchase which added almost 530 million acres to the United States, \nchanging America from an eastern coastal nation to a continental \nempire.\n  One hundred years later, President Theodore Roosevelt set the tone \nfor public land issues in the second full history in our Nation's \nhistory. He did it both in words and action. President Theodore \nRoosevelt stated:\n\n       Conservation means development as much as it does \n     protection. I recognize the right and duty of this generation \n     to develop and use the natural resources of our land; but I \n     do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by \n     wasteful use, the generations that will come after us.\n\n  Roosevelt took action to meet these goals. During his administration, \nthe United States protected almost 230 million acres of lands for \nfuture public use. The question for us as we commence the third full \ncentury, the 21th century of the United States, is, can we live up to \nthis example? Can we be worthy of the standards of Thomas Jefferson at \nthe beginning of the 19th century and Theodore Roosevelt at the \nbeginning of this century?\n  I have discussed today the issues I witnessed at Bandelier National \nMonument and the small efforts being made to rectify this situation. \nEstimates of the maintenance backlog throughout the National Park \nService system range from $1.2 billion to over $3.5 billion, depending \non the calculation method.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the \nconclusion\n\n[[Page S14600]]\n\nof my remarks an article which appeared in the Wall Street Journal of \nNovember 12 of this year entitled ``Montana's Glacier Park Copes With \nBig Freeze On Funds To Maintain Its Historic Structures.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The National Park Service this year requested $194 \nmillion for its operation and maintenance. In this year's \nappropriations process, the House and Senate had the good judgment to \nactually increase the National Park Service request to $224.5 million. \nThis is a good step forward, and I commend the Appropriations Committee \nfor having taken it.\n  However, if we are to prevent the existing backlog from growing, we \nmust support periodic maintenance on the existing facilities in the \nPark System. I see we have now as our Presiding Officer a person who \nhas probably studied more, thought more, and done more to deal with \nthis problem than any Member of the Congress, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to commend the Presiding Officer for \nhis efforts in the program of the demonstration recreational fee in the \nPark System. I showed a moment ago a photo of a portion of some \nbuildings at Bandelier National Park in New Mexico which were in \nserious disrepair. Largely because of the ability to direct some of \nthose national park demonstration funds to their rehabilitation, they \nare now being saved and will serve for many years to come. It is a very \nconstructive role in this national monument as well as protecting other \nvaluable historic structures within the national monument.\n  I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Wyoming for the \nleadership he has given in that regard.\n  I am sad to report that the Interior conference report, which will \nprobably soon be before us, has recommended a reduction in the cyclical \nmaintenance of the National Park System and repair and rehabilitation \naccounts. While these reductions are relatively small--$3 million in \nthe case of cyclic maintenance and $2.5 million in repair and \nrehabilitation--failure to meet these basic annual maintenance \nrequirements will only add to our backlog of unmet needs. We cannot \nmake the progress we must make in protecting our national treasures \nwith these Band-Aid solutions.\n  I suggest, building on the leadership you provided through the \nDemonstration National Park Fee Program, and the changes that were made \nin the relationship of the parks to their concessionaires, that we can \ngo further in assuring the long-term well-being of our National Park \nSystem.\n  In my judgment, what the National Park Service needs is a sustained, \nreliable, adequate funding source that will allow the Park Service to \ndevelop intelligent plans based on a prioritization of need, with \nconfidence the funds will be available as needed to complete the plans. \nThis approach will allow common sense to prevail when projects are \nprioritized for funding.\n  In some cases, such as one with which I am personally very familiar, \ncommitted, and engaged--the Florida Everglades and the Everglades \nNational Park--natural resource projects can be compared to open heart \nsurgery. You simply cannot begin the operation, open the patient, and \nthen fail to complete the operation if the money runs out before the \nsurgery is finished. To do so is to assure the patient will die in the \nsurgery suite.\n  In cases such as Bandelier National Monument and the Ellis Island \nNational Monument, another great national treasure, which I visited on \nSeptember 27 of this year, we are in a race to complete a known cure \nbefore the patient is lost. Bandelier's superintendent, Roy Weaver, is \ntaking every effort he can to preserve the resources in his park. He is \nfocusing the park entrance fees on repairing and maintaining historical \nstructures. He is using funds available through the Vanishing Treasures \nProgram to restore the multitude of cultural resources in the monument.\n\n  Mr. Weaver is a superintendent whose knowledge of the history of the \npeople who resided in this area of the country hundreds of years ago \nand whose desire to preserve their culture are evident even in a brief \nvisit. Mr. Weaver's enthusiasm and dedication embody the conservation \nethic of President Theodore Roosevelt and the National Park Service. It \nis our responsibility to give Mr. Weaver and his colleagues across \nAmerica the tools they need to put their enthusiasm to work. It is time \nto take the next step.\n  Earlier this year, with Senators Reid and Mack, I introduced S. 819, \nthe National Park Preservation Act. This act would provide dedicated \nfunding to the National Park Service to restore and conserve the \nnatural resources within our Park System. This legislation seeks to \naddress the long-term efforts required to truly restore and protect our \nnatural, cultural, and historic resources in the National Park System. \nThis legislation would allocate funds derived from the use of a \nnonrenewable national resource--offshore drilling in the Outer \nContinental Shelf for oil and gas--to a renewable resource, restoration \nand preservation of natural, cultural, and historic resources in our \nNational Park System.\n  At the beginning of this century, in a time of relative tranquility, \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt managed to instill the Nation with a \ntradition of conservation. He did so with this simple challenge: Can we \nleave this world a better place for future generations?\n  We are at the end of this century and at the end of the first half of \nthe 106th Congress. As we embark on the third century of our Nation's \nadventure and the second half of the 106th Congress, let us keep the \nvision of Theodore Roosevelt in mind. Let us take action to protect our \nNational Park System.\n  In the words of President Theodore Roosevelt:\n\n       The conservation of natural resources is the fundamental \n     problem. Unless we solve that problem, it will avail us \n     little to solve all others.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 12, 1999]\n\n Montana's Glacier Park Copes With Big Freeze On Funds To Maintain Its \n                          Historic Structures\n\n                          (By John J. Fialka)\n\n       Glacier National Park, Mont.--Few places on earth are as \n     legally protected as this park. The United Nations deems it a \n     ``World Heritage site.'' Under U.S. law, 350 buildings in the \n     park are registered historic structures. Four hotels and the \n     road spanning this spectacular, million-acre chunk of America \n     are ``national historic landmarks.''\n       So why are many of these buildings and the road literally \n     falling apart?\n       Over the past 30 years, as lawmakers and park officials \n     have heaped praise and protected status on Glacier, they have \n     consistently failed to provide the money to maintain it. The \n     current bargaining between Congress and the White House on \n     the shape of the next budget doesn't seem likely to change \n     that. The upshot: Much of the man-made part of this \n     mountainous park has evolved into a kind of dangerous \n     national antique.\n       Among the park's most endangered attractions:\n       Many Glacier Hotel. It may look the same as it did when it \n     was built in 1915, but underneath its newly painted wooden \n     facade, tired old timbers are beginning to shift. That makes \n     hallways bend this way and that, windows that won't open and \n     doors that won't close. The steam heating system, \n     unaccustomed to such action, springs six leaks a night.\n       Going-To-The-Sun Road. An engineering marvel, built to \n     cross the park and climb the Continental Divide in 1932, is \n     now marvelous to engineers because it hasn't yet succumbed to \n     the force of gravity. But two-inch cracks are appearing in \n     its pavement. Many of its retaining walls lean recklessly out \n     into space. Melting snow is washing away the road's \n     foundation, creating odd voids that need filing.\n       The ``Jammers.'' The park's much-loved fleet of buses, \n     built in the late 1930s to ply the road, were condemned in \n     August. Their engines, brakes and transmissions had been \n     replaced, but metal fatigue and cracks in their frames raise \n     new safety and liability problems.\n       ``This is the oldest fleet of vehicles in the world,'' says \n     Larry Hegge, the chief mechanic for the buses, who discovered \n     the cracks. Now the 34 red buses with shiny, chrome-toothed \n     radiators and pull-off canvas tops sit nose-to-tail in a \n     damp, dimly lit shed. Mr. Hegge worries that the termites \n     there are eating upper parts of the jammers' frames, which \n     are made of oak.\n\n\n                          no solution in sight\n\n       At the moment, no one knows how to fix these problems. \n     Glacier Park Inc., the park's main concessionaire, owns the \n     buses and the hotels. It's questioning a variety of experts \n     to see what might be done and at what cost. The departing \n     park superintendent, David A. Mihalic, recently apointed a \n     17-member committee to advise him about the road.\n       The numbers they're looking at aren't encouraging. It could \n     cost at least $100 million\n\n[[Page S14601]]\n\n     to restore four major wooden hotels. Estimates for rebuilding \n     the road start at $70 million and climb steeply. The park's \n     annual budget is $8 million. ``Glacier has never had the \n     money to keep up with maintenance and repair,'' shrugs John \n     Kilpatrick, the park's chief engineer.\n       For Superintendent Mihalic, who has just been transferred \n     to Yosemite, running Glacier has been an eerie flashback to \n     1972, when he took his first job there as a park ranger. He \n     came back as superintendent in 1994 to find ``nothing had \n     changed. We had the same old sewer systems, the same roads, \n     the same hotels, the same visitor accommodations.''\n\n\n                            using a `facade'\n\n       Mr. Mihalic had to resort to what some park experts call \n     ``management by facade.'' Visible things get fixed. Less \n     visible things get deferred. ``If we're having trouble \n     getting the money to just fund the big-ticket items, like \n     roads and sewage and water systems, a lot of public services, \n     such as trail maintenance and back-country bridges, never \n     make it to the top of the list,'' he says.\n       To be sure, Mr. Mihalic isn't the only park superintendent \n     to wrestle with this. The Interior Department's U.S. Park \n     Service places the bill for deferred maintenance and \n     construction needed to fix time-worn facilities in its 378 \n     parks at around $5 billion. ``Culturally, we try to hide the \n     pain in the Park Service,'' explains Denis Galvin, the \n     service's deputy director.\n       The day is coming when hiding the pain here may no longer \n     be possible. Last year the Park Service proposed that the \n     cheapest and quickest way to deal with the crumbling, much-\n     patched Going-To-The-Sun road would be to close it for four \n     years and rebuild it. That produced a furor among people in \n     the business community surrounding the park.\n       They're now part of the advisory committee struggling to \n     come up with ways to keep it open and fix it at the same \n     time.\n\n\n                         rules for restoration\n\n       As for the Many Glacier Hotel, the latest estimates are \n     that it would cost $30 million to $60 million to bring it \n     back to the glory days when guests arrived by railroad and \n     received world-class accommodations. ``We could never recover \n     that. You would be talking about renting rooms for $400 to \n     $500 a night,'' says Dennis Baker, director of engineering \n     for the concessionaire Glacier Park, a subsidiary of Phoenix-\n     based Viad Corp. Park rules currently limit hotel room rates \n     to $120. The park's season lasts only about 100 days.\n       As for Mr. Hegge, keeper of the park's bus fleet, he's \n     looking for experts to tell him how to refit his buses with \n     new chassis or to build replicas. Because they are federally \n     registered historic landmarks, the road and the hotels also \n     must be restored to the way they were with the same \n     materials, adding many millions more to the cost.\n       Just where the millions will come from to fix Glacier and \n     many other maintenance-starved parks is, of course, the \n     biggest question. Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida has \n     introduced legislation to earmark $500 million a year from \n     federal offshore oil royalties for buying park land and \n     fixing parks.\n       Over time, he's sure it would save money, ``That would \n     allow them to plan more than a year ahead. They could let \n     contracts for multiple buildings at a time,'' explains the \n     senator, who says support for the measure has been slow but \n     is growing.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and \nthe administration on reaching an agreement this week with China on WTO \naccession. This demonstrates that a policy of ``engagement with a \npurpose'' works. I believe the Chinese leadership, in particular \nPremier Zhu Rongji and President Jiang Zemin, have shown foresight, \ncourage, and vision in making the commitments necessary to conclude \nthis bilateral agreement. I am also glad President Clinton worked so \ndiligently over the last several months to finalize the arrangement.\n  I believed in April that the April 8 arrangement with China was a \ngood one. My preliminary evaluation of this week's agreement is that it \ngoes beyond the April 8 agreement and provides further benefits to \nAmerican economic interests.\n  There are still several steps before China can accede to the WTO.\n  China must complete other bilateral agreements, in particular with \nthe European Union. Next, the protocol of accession must be completed. \nThen, the focus of attention will turn to us in the Congress.\n  In order to receive the benefits we negotiated with China, the United \nStates has to grant China permanent normal trade relations status. To \ndo this, Congress has to amend the Jackson-Vanik amendment.\n  I am confident that a majority in both Houses will vote to amend \nJackson-Vanik. But it will take a lot of work. The administration, the \nagriculture, manufacturing, and service industries, and those of us in \nthe Congress who have followed these negotiations and the U.S.-China \nrelationship closely over the years, must educate and explain to our \ncolleagues about the benefits of the agreement reached this week and \nthe advantages to the United States of having China in the WTO.\n  As we in the Congress begin to think about this issue and deliberate \non it next year, I see four principal benefits to the United States.\n  First, this week's agreement opens up new markets in China, with its \npopulation of 1.3 billion, for American farmers, manufacturers, and \nservice industries. This will help sustain American economic growth.\n  Second, the agreement gets China into the global trading system, \nwhich forces them to play by the rules of international trade.\n  For perhaps the first time in history, China will be accountable for \nits behavior to the outside world. The dispute settlement system at the \nWTO is far from perfect, but it forces a country to explain actions \nthat other members believe violate the global rules. And, when a \nviolation is found, it puts pressure on that country to comply with the \nrules. In addition, there is a little known feature of the WTO called \nthe Trade Policy Review Mechanism, the TPRM. Every few years, a \ncountry's entire trade system is reviewed by all other members. Again, \nthis type of scrutiny of China is virtually unprecedented.\n  Third, the agreement will help strengthen the economic reformers in \nChina, especially Premier Zhu Rongji who has clearly been in a weakened \nposition this year. Economic reform, moving to a market economy, \ntransparency--that is, opening up, less secrecy--direct foreign \ninvestment, listing of companies on overseas markets--progress in all \nthese areas is of vital importance to the United States as they relate \nto stability in China, as they relate to accountability, and as they \nrelate to a growing middle class.\n  Fourth, Taiwan, the 12th-largest economy in the world, has almost \ncompleted its WTO accession process. Yet it is a political reality \ninternationally that Taiwan cannot join the WTO before China. So, with \nChina's admission to the WTO, Taiwan will follow very quickly. All of \nus should welcome that.\n  The Congress has been concerned about many aspects of the U.S.-China \nrelationship: espionage allegations, nuclear proliferation, human \nrights, and Taiwan. These are all serious issues, and we must confront \neach one head on.\n  But, I, and I believe most Members of Congress, are able to look at \neach issue on its own merits. When Congress examines closely the \narrangement for Chinese accession to the WTO, I am confident that \nMembers will conclude that extending permanent normal trade relations \nstatus to China is now in the best interest of the United States.\n  I don't want to sound pollyannaish about this. Once China is a member \nof the WTO and the United States has granted permanent NTR status, the \nreal work of implementation begins. We have learned over the years that \nimplementation of trade agreements takes as much effort, or even more \neffort, than the negotiations themselves. The administration will have \nto provide us with a plan about implementation. We in the Congress will \nhave to devote additional resources and energy to ensuring full Chinese \nimplementation.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill to establish a Congressional \nTrade Office to provide the Congress with additional resources to do \nexactly that. I hope my colleagues will look at that proposal and give \nit their support. In addition, I will be introducing some measures to \nhelp ensure that the administration--this one as well as future \nadministrations--never deviates\n\n[[Page S14602]]\n\nfrom the task of full implementation of agreements with China.\n  In conclusion, this is a good agreement.

Mr. President, last week there was a terrible tragedy \naffecting the United Nations' World Food Program. This occurred when \none of their planes crashed in Kosovo on an errand of mercy.\n  Since its inception in 1963, the World Food Program has been the \nUnited Nations' front line for fighting hunger throughout the world. It \nis the world's largest food aid organization.\n  Last year, the World Food Program assisted 75 million people in 80 \ncountries around the world. This summer I observed their operations in \nKosovo. In fact, at one point I was invited to fly on the same plane \nthat crashed, to go and see what they were doing.\n  The World Food Program's mission is to eradicate hunger. I think that \nin the last seven years it has moved closer and closer to accomplishing \nthis goal under the leadership of Executive Director Catherine Bertini. \nI was very proud to support Catherine when she was appointed to be \nexecutive director in 1992, during the administration of President \nBush. She became the first woman to head the World Food Program. I have \nbeen a strong supporter for her ever since. She has done a great job as \nexecutive director, and I am glad that she continues to lead the World \nFood Program today.\n  For many, the World Food Program is known for its emergency response \nefforts. It was one of the first organizations to move into the Balkan \nregion when the conflict in Kosovo began.\n  As I mentioned earlier, during the August recess I visited the World \nFood Program and met with Catherine Bertini and talked to her about how \ntheir efforts were going. I believe they are doing a great job. Areas \nwhich had previously been empty fields have been transformed into \nmakeshift cities where thousands of people seeking safety, food and \nshelter have found relief, thanks to the efforts of the World Food \nProgram, Catholic Relief Services and other international \norganizations.\n  But emergency relief efforts such as this reflect only a portion of \nthe World Food Program's responsibilities. The World Food Program's \nFood for Work programs feed millions of chronically hungry people \nworldwide. They contribute more grants to developing countries than any \nother United Nations agency. That is why so many people around the \nworld felt the same degree of sadness that I and others in the Senate \ndid when we learned of the plane crash on Friday in which a World Food \nProgram plane, en route from Rome to Pristina, crashed into a mountain \nridge just miles from their destination, killing all 24 people aboard \nthe plane.\n\n  The passengers aboard this plane were an international group of aid \nworkers. They were all headed to Kosovo to become part of the \nhumanitarian mission there. In a war-torn area, these were 24 people \ngoing to bring solace, aid, and help to people who have seen so little \nof it over the years. They were people who were motivated by the \ngreatest sense of charity and giving to their fellow human beings. They \nworked for U.N. agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and government \nagencies, all united by a sense of humanitarianism.\n  The loss of these individuals is going to be felt throughout the \nworld. They were people who demonstrated over and over again that their \nfellow human beings were the most important things in their lives. \nTheir deaths are a major loss to their families, as well as the \norganizations, including the World Food Program, for which they worked.\n  I send my sincere condolences to the families of those killed in this \ntragic crash, and I hope the world will understand they have lost 24 of \ntheir finest people.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 1924 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14602-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I hope that the leadership will soon bring \nup for a vote the conference report regarding the Satellite Home \nViewers Act and the Patent Reform Act. This legislation passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 411-8. According to an informal \nwhip count, if it came to a vote in the Senate, it would pass by \nsomething like 98-2, and no worse than 95-5. So we ought to bring it up \nfor a vote.\n  I don't know when I have gotten so much mail on any subject as I have \non satellite home viewing. If you come from a rural area, you know how \nimportant this legislation is. If we do not pass the Satellite Home \nViewers Act, on December 31 hundreds of thousands--maybe millions--of \nsatellite viewers will find that a number of their channels will be \nsimply cut off, especially in rural areas.\n  So when we have something that could easily be passed, we ought to do \nit. The patent legislation is supported--the so-called Hatch-Leahy \nbill--by most businesses I know. It would be a tremendous step forward \nin helping us to be competitive with the rest of the world in our \npatent legislation. It is also the second time in history that we have \nlowered the cost of patent registration to the taxpayers. So I urge \nthat when we have a piece of legislation like this, which has passed \nthe House of Representatives 411-8, which would pass overwhelmingly in \nthe Senate, that the Republican leadership bring it up. Passing this \nbill will give some aid to many businesses throughout the country, \nincluding some of the finest technological businesses in the world.\n  And on the satellite front, this bill will allow the many individuals \nwho rely on satellite dishes because they live in rural areas to be \nable to continue to get their television.\n  I think of States like my own State of Vermont, such as the State of \nMontana, the State of Texas, the State of Wyoming, and the State of \nNevada, to name a few, where because of our rural nature, people are \nvery dependent on satellite dishes. These satellite dish owners are \njustifiably concerned that on December 31, many of their channels are \ngoing to go dead. We can stop that by passing this legislation this \nweek.\n  The Satellite Home Viewers Act conference report will soon be before \nus. It\n\n[[Page S14603]]\n\npassed overwhelmingly in the House, as it will here. I only know of two \nor three people who are opposed to it. That should not be enough to \nstop this bill.\n  In fact, I will join with the majority leader if he wants to bring \nthe satellite bill up and instantly file cloture. I could get him the \nnecessary signatures in 20 seconds. I can guarantee him that if it was \nnecessary--and I hope that it would not be--to vote cloture, he would \nget far more than the 60 votes necessary for it; 90 to 95 Members of \nthe Senate want to pass this. I hope the distinguished majority leader \nwill allow it to come to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have introduced a piece of legislation \nin the Senate with my colleagues, Senator Ashcroft from Missouri, and \nSenator Leahy from Vermont. I have written this legislation with their \nassistance to deal with a problem that could cause and will cause and \nperhaps has caused significant jeopardy to Americans, American families \nand others.\n  Let me describe the circumstance. There is a young girl from North \nDakota named Jeanna North. Jeanna was a wonderful 11-year-old young \ngirl from Fargo, ND, who was brutally murdered by a man named Kyle \nBell. Kyle Bell had previously been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \nassaulting three other girls, had been convicted of violent acts, and \nthen sentenced to life in prison for murdering this 11-year-old girl, \nJeanna North, in Fargo, ND.\n  This convicted child murderer and violent offender, after being \nconvicted and sentenced in the courts of North Dakota, was being \ntransported to prison in another state. Apparently, folks who molest \nchildren and are convicted of crimes against children sometimes are put \nin prisons elsewhere because they run into problems in prison. Even in \nthat culture they are not considered very good people, so child \nmolesters are sent to other prisons for their own safety. This fellow \nnamed Kyle Bell, who killed young Jeanna North, was being transported \nto a prison in the State of Oregon.\n  This convicted child killer was being transported by a private \ncompany which was contracted by the State of North Dakota. Apparently--\nand I wasn't aware of this--there are transport companies that hire \nthemselves to State and local governments to transport prisoners and \ncriminals around the country. The private company's name was Transcor.\n  Kyle Bell was on a bus with more than a dozen other prisoners. The \nbus stopped in New Mexico at a gas station. One guard got out of the \nbus to fill the bus with some fuel, a second guard got out of the bus \nand went into the service station apparently to buy a hamburger or \nwhatever one was going to buy at the food station, and two other guards \nfell asleep on the bus. The other guards slept on the bus.\n  Kyle Bell, a convicted child killer, in handcuffs and shackles--with \none guard putting gas in the bus, the second guard buying food in the \ngas station, and the other two asleep in the front seat--Kyle Bell took \na key he had in his shoe, took off his shackles and climbed out the \nventilator, the roof of the bus. That bus then continued on its route. \nIt wasn't for 9 hours, when the bus was already in Arizona, that the \nguards discovered this convicted child killer had escaped. Nine hours \nlater they finally discovered he had escaped. Two hours after that, the \nguards finally notified law enforcement authorities.\n  Today this man is somewhere in this country. ``America's Most \nWanted'' did a story last Saturday, the second they have done. Now over \na month has gone by and this violent child killer is somewhere on the \nloose.\n  Why? Because a private company that is required to meet no standards \nat all hired itself out to haul violent criminals. If you hire yourself \nout to haul toxic waste interstate, I will tell you one thing: you are \ngoing to have to meet standards. If you are going to haul toxic waste, \none State to another, you have to comply with reasonable standards for \npublic safety. The same is true if you haul circus animals. The same is \ntrue if you are trucking cattle across the country. But if you truck \nconvicted killers across the country--no standards at all. If you want \nto be in that business, get your cousin, your brother-in-law, maybe a \ncouple sons, buy a minivan and you are in business. Contract with a \nState or local government and you can haul violent criminals through \nArizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, New Hampshire, anywhere. You do not \nhave to meet any minimum standards. There is something wrong with that.\n  Senator Ashcroft and I and Senator Leahy are introducing a piece of \nlegislation saying: If you are holding yourself out to do business \nhauling violent criminals interstate in this country, then you must \nmeet some reasonable minimum standards.\n  When Kyle Bell walked away from that rest stop, he was wearing \ncivilian clothes. Apparently, he walked into a parking lot, they think, \nof a shopping center. But he wouldn't have been noticed as a convicted \nchild killer because he was wearing civilian clothes. One would ask the \nquestion: if you are hauling a convicted killer across this country, \nwhy would you not have that convicted killer in an orange suit that \nsays ``prisoner'' on it? Instead, he was sitting on that bus with a key \nin his shoe and civilian clothing, so when he slipped out of that bus \nwhen the guards were asleep and walked into a shopping center parking \nlot, apparently no one noticed. So over a month has gone by and people \nin this country are at risk because this convicted killer is on the \nloose.\n  This young girl, Jeanna North, who died, you can imagine how her \nfolks feel. I talked to her folks last week. The aunt and uncle of Kyle \nBell, this murderer, are worried as well because he has threatened his \nown relatives.\n  The point is this: All of this has happened because a private company \ndecides it is going to hire itself out to haul killers around the \ncountry, but there are no standards to be met. Senator Ashcroft and I \nand Senator Leahy believe the Justice Department ought to write \nstandards--no tougher than they themselves will follow in the Federal \nBureau of Prisons or the U.S. Marshals Service. Incidentally, they do \ntransport killers all across the country. The U.S. Marshals Service has \ndone it for years; so has the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We believe \nthere ought to be some minimum standards that apply to these companies. \nThe Justice Department ought to be able to establish those standards \nthat are no greater than the standards that will be complied with by \nthe Federal agencies themselves.\n  Is this, this escape of Kyle Bell, some sort of strange and unusual \noccurrence? No, regrettably it is not. Let me give a few examples.\n  Although there are no reporting requirements for private companies \nthat haul convicted prisoners across this country, media reports \nindicate that in the last 3 years alone, 21 violent convicted prisoners \nhave escaped during transport by private companies. No\n\n[[Page S14604]]\n\nFederal Bureau of Prisons prisoners have escaped during transport--\nnone. U.S. Marshals Service--it has been years and years since the \nMarshals Service has had anyone escape from their custody during \ntransport. But private companies that are unregulated and have no \nrequirements to meet?\n  July 24, 1999: Two men convicted of murder escaped while being \ntransported from Tennessee to Virginia. Two guards went into a fast \nfood restaurant to get breakfast for the convicts. When they returned, \nthey didn't notice the convicts had freed themselves from their leg \nirons. While one guard returned to the restaurant, the other stood \nwatch outside the van, but he forgot to lock the door. The inmates \nkicked it open and fled. One was caught 45 minutes later; the other \nstole a car and was free for 8 hours before being apprehended.\n\n  July 30, 1997: Convicted rapist and kidnaper Dennis Glick escaped \nwhile being transported from Salt Lake City to Pine Bluffs, AR--again \nby a private company. While still in the van, Glick grabbed a gun from \na guard who had fallen asleep. He took seven prisoners, a guard, and a \nlocal rancher hostage, and led 60 law enforcement officials on an all-\nnight chase across Colorado before being recaptured the next morning.\n  November 30, 1997: Whatley Rolene was being transported from New \nMexico to Massachusetts. He was able to remove his handcuffs and grab a \nshotgun while one guard was in a gas station and the other slept in the \nfront seat. He later surrendered after a showdown with the Colorado \nState Patrol and a local sheriff's office.\n  December 4, 1987: During transport, 11 inmates escaped from a private \ncompany after overpowering a guard in the van. Among the escapees was \nconvicted child molester Charles E. Dugger and convicted felon and \nformer jail escapee Homer Land. Apparently, they shed their shackles by \neither picking their locks or using a key. The guard in the van opened \nthe van doors to ventilate it while the other guard was inside the \nBurger King. The guard in the van had been on the job less than a \nmonth.\n  The man named Dugger was apprehended a short time later, but Homer \nLand forced his way into the home of a couple in Owatonna, MN, held \nthem hostage for 15 hours, and forced them to drive into Minneapolis \nwhere they escaped when Land went into a store to buy cigarettes. He \nwas later apprehended on a bus headed to Alabama.\n  August 28, 1986: A husband-and-wife team of guards showed up at an \nIowa State Prison to transport six inmates, five of them convicted \nmurderers, from Iowa to New Mexico. When the Iowa prison warden saw \nthere were only two guards, a husband and wife, to transport six \ndangerous inmates, five of them convicted murderers, he responded, \n``You've got to be kidding me.'' Despite his concerns, the warden \nreleased the prisoners to the custody of the guards when he was told \nthe transport company had a contract to move these prisoners.\n  Despite explicit instructions not to stop anywhere but a county jail \nuntil reaching their destination, the guards decided to stop at a rest \nstop in Texas. During the stop, the inmates slipped out of their \nhandcuffs and leg irons and overpowered the two guards. The six inmates \nstole the van and led police on a high-speed chase before being \ncaptured.\n  The escape was not even reported to the local police by the guards \nwho were at fault but instead by a tourist who witnessed the incident.\n  There is clearly something wrong here. I mentioned a few of these \nexamples. Violent prisoners are being hauled across this country, \ninterstate transportation, without the kind of basic precautions you \nwould expect. Again I say if you want to haul toxic waste interstate \nyou must meet specific safety criteria. But that is not the case if you \nwant to haul violent criminals.\n  What if you or your family were to drive up to a gas station and stop \nnext to a minivan that is holding three convicted murderers being \ntransported by some guy and his two sons-in-law to a prison in \nCalifornia? Is that something you would worry about? I would. People in \nthis country ought to worry about that. There ought to be standards.\n  It is interesting that most of these escapes occurred when a private \ncompany stopped at a fast food place or to get fuel. Do you know what \nfederal agencies do when they need to stop someplace? They try to only \nstop at a police station or jail or prison so they have decent help in \nmaking certain these folks are not going to escape during a stop.\n  None of this makes any sense. All of us know this is not the way to \ndo business. The Kyle Bell escape is just the most recent. God forbid \nthat this man should murder someone while he is out. God forbid someone \nis injured, hurt, or murdered during this person's escape.\n  This story of Kyle Bell's escape was on ``America's Most Wanted,'' \nlast Saturday night. I don't know whether he will be apprehended, when \nhe will be apprehended, where he might be apprehended. But this country \nand its law enforcement authorities should not be having to go through \nthis. This person should be in a maximum security prison in the State \nof Oregon right now. That is where he was headed. He should be serving \nlife in prison for the killing of this 11-year-old girl. Instead, he is \nsomewhere out there in this country, a danger to the American people \nbecause we have private transport companies that are required to meet \nno regulations, no minimum standards.\n  The legislation I have introduced is rather simple. With my colleague \nfrom the State of Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, and my colleague, Senator \nLeahy, from Vermont, I have introduced legislation that will say the \nJustice Department shall establish minimum standards and minimum \nrequirements a business must meet in order to transport violent \noffenders. I am only talking about violent offenders. Among those would \nbe the requirement of certain kinds of handcuffs and shackles, the \nrequirement for violent offenders to wear easily recognized, bright \nclothing identifying them as prisoners, and a range of other sensible \nideas.\n  The bill does not allow the Justice Department to impose requirements \non the private sector that exceed the requirements the U.S. Marshals \nService or the Federal Bureau of Prisons themselves will meet as they \ntransport prisoners. But it seems to me reasonable, and it does to my \ncolleagues as well, that we ought to require some basic, thoughtful, \ncommonsense standards to be met on the part of these private companies.\n  I should also say that some of the companies themselves believe this \nis a reasonable thing to do. Some of the transport companies themselves \nsay there needs to be some set of standards. Because when anyone can \nget into this business without taking reasonable precautions, we will \nhave convicted murderers escaping and the American public will be at \nrisk.\n  This legislation is supported by a wide range of organizations: The \nNational Sheriffs Association, the American Jail Association, the \nCalifornia Correctional Peace Officers Association, the New York \nCorrectional Officers and Police Benevolent Association, the North \nDakota Chiefs of Police Association, the North Dakota Fraternal Order \nof Police, the Victims Assistance Association in my State, the Klaas \nKids Foundation in California, the Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, and \nothers.\n  We call this bill Jeanna's bill. It is called Jeanna's bill in the \nhopes that the memory of this 11-year-old girl, Jeanna North, might \nserve for the Congress to pass good legislation that will impose \nsensible, commonsense requirements on private companies transporting \nviolent criminals so some other family will not have to go through the \nagony, the heartbreak, and the sheer terror that has visited the North \nfamily--first because of the murder of their daughter, then the trial \nof the murderer, and now the murderer's escape.\n  Let us hope Congress can pass this kind of legislation and we will \nnot in the future be seeing stories about private companies allowing \nconvicted killers to escape while they are being transported to their \nlife in prison in a maximum security institution.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I am on the floor today principally to \ncontinue to battle for our Wisconsin dairy industry and Wisconsin dairy \nfarmers. As I was here today, I had a chance to reflect on something \nelse about Wisconsin that we will be bragging about today. I come here \nas a proud alumnus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Of course, I \nam talking about the new career rushing record in college football just \nset by one of the greatest Badgers of all time, Ron Dayne.\n  Ron Dayne rushed his way into football glory on Saturday. After \nrushing for an incredible 6,181 yards in his career, he needed only 99 \nyards to break the record set last year by Texas's Ricky Williams.\n  Short runs throughout the first half brought him within yards of the \nrecord and helped his team build an early lead. Then, with 5 minutes \nleft in the second quarter, he broke the record on a 31-yard sprint and \nwent on to rush a total of 216 yards to help catapult the Badgers--with \nmy apologies to my colleagues from the Hawkeye State--to a crushing 41-\n3 victory against Iowa.\n  I quote from Matt Bowen, a leading tackler for the University of \nIowa, on the difficulty of stopping University of Wisconsin running \nback Ron Dayne.

Mr. President, the amendment is a small matter in the \nlarger context of the legislation we are dealing with, but a very large \nmatter to the people we are talking about who are low-income debtors. \nThis addresses two aspects of the bill that have disproportionate \nnegative impacts on low-income debtors.\n  The first aspect concerns consumer debt and cash advances. The second \nrelates to debt incurred to pay nondischargeable debt. By \nnondischargeable debt, we mean the debt a consumer has to repay even if \nthey declare bankruptcy. There are very common-sense provisions in our \nbankruptcy laws that say if you acquire a large debt in a short period \nbefore declaring bankruptcy, there is some presumption that you knew \nwhere you were heading and you were taking advantage of the bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  Under current law, consumer debts owed to a single creditor--\nexcluding ``goods or services reasonably necessary''--of more than \n$1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy and cash advances of more \nthan $1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy are presumed to be \nfraudulent and thus nondischargeable.\n  S. 625 seeks to expand the circumstances under which such \ntransactions would be considered fraudulent in two ways: First, by \nlowering the threshold amount that would trigger the fraudulent \npresumption to $250 for consumer debts and $750 for cash advances; and, \nsecond, by increasing the number of days prior to bankruptcy during \nwhich debt incurred and cash advances obtained would be presumed \nfraudulent--to 90 days for consumer debts and to 70 days for cash \nadvances.\n  Under this amendment, the new threshold amounts of money and numbers \nof days proposed in S. 625 would apply to debtors whose total monthly \nincome is greater than the median monthly income, but they would not \napply to low-income debtors. Low-income debtors do not have much money \nand, at times, need to charge certain items or to take a cash advance \nto buy necessary goods, such as clothing. It is wrong--or so I \nbelieve--to assume these people acted fraudulently. They acted of \nnecessity--or I believe that is a fair assumption. They did what they \nneeded to do to get by. The thresholds as they exist under current law \nwould continue to apply to median and below-median income families.\n  I will make the point that we are, by this amendment, not changing \ncurrent law. We are not introducing a novel concept into bankruptcy \nproceedings. We are providing for low-income persons to continue to \nhave the same presumptions in their favor, or against them, that we \nhave lived with for many years, with fair success, as I understand it.\n  S. 625 adds a new exception to discharge for debt incurred to pay \nnondischargeable debt and creates a presumption of nondischargeability \nfor debts incurred to pay such debt within 70 days of filing the \nbankruptcy petition. This amendment would retain the current state of \nthe law as to debt incurred to pay nondischargeable debt for median and \nbelow-median income families.\n  I do believe this is a worthy amendment. I commend it to my \ncolleagues. I have had the opportunity to have worked through this, and \nI express my own gratitude that in many years distant past I did not \ndecide to become a bankruptcy lawyer. That would have been a complexity \nbeyond my capacity.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for his courtesy and the Senate for \nits equal attention. I commend this matter. I think it is something we \nwould be wise to do. The essence of the proposal is: For low-income \ndebtors, don't change the rules. They are not the problem. Don't create \nproblems for them.\n  A well-documented and prevalent form of abuse by some creditors is \nthe filing of unfounded complaints alleging that debtors committed \nfraud, or the use of the threat of such a complaint, to coerce debtors \ninto giving up valuable bankruptcy rights, typically by agreeing that \nall or part of the debt is not discharged.\n  Such threats are especially potent against low-income debtors. That \nis why the safe harbor in my amendment is necessary. These debtors \noften do not have lawyers, and they certainly do not have the funds to \npay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to defend against creditor \nlitigation. When a creditor threatens to or actually files a complaint \nalleging fraud, the debtor has to choose either to pay to defend \nagainst the complaint (requiring a lump sum payment to an attorney of \nat least several hundred dollars and usually more) or to make a deal \nwith the creditor (who will offer to take a reaffirmation or settlement \nwith ``low monthly payments'' of perhaps $50). Most cash-strapped \ndebtors will take the ``low monthly payment'' option, often the only \nthing they can afford, regardless of whether the creditor has a good \ncase.\n  This scenario is played out already, in the area of dischargeability \nlitigation. Several courts have found practices of creditors filing \n``fraud'' dischargeability cases, for which there is no factual basis, \nsimply to coerce reaffirmations, and actually dropping those cases when \nthey are defended. Most of these cases are in fact settled through \nreaffirmations, because the debtors have no choice but to take the \n``low monthly payment'' option.\n  The new presumptions of fraud proposed in S. 625, against debtors who \nhave charged as little as $250 on a credit card, and under the \namorphous standard that a debt was incurred to pay another debt, will \nembolden creditors to file many more of these complaints. My amendment \nto S. 625 addresses these presumptions. I will explain how.\n  First, under current law, consumer debts owed to a single creditor \n(excluding ``goods or services reasonably necessary'') of more than \n$1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy and cash advances of more \nthan $1,075 obtained within 60 days of bankruptcy are presumed to be \nfraudulent, and thus nondischargeable. S. 625 seeks to expand the \ncircumstances under which such transactions would be considered \nfraudulent in two ways: first, by lowering the threshold amount that \nwould trigger the fraud presumption to $250 for consumer debts and to \n$750 for cash advances; and, second, by increasing the number of days \nprior to bankruptcy during which debt incurred and cash advances \nobtained would be presumed fraudulent (to 90 days for consumer debts \nand to 70 days for cash advances).\n  Under my proposed amendment, the threshold amounts of money and \nnumbers of days triggering a presumption of fraud in S. 625 would only \napply to debtors whose total monthly income is greater than the median \nmonthly income, while the current thresholds would continue to apply to \nmedian and below-median income families.\n  Second, S. 625 adds a new exception to discharge for debt--a loan or \ncredit card debt--incurred to pay nondischargeable debt with the intent \nto discharge such debt in bankruptcy; it also creates a presumption of \nnondischargeability for debts incurred to pay nondischargeable debt \nwithin 70 days prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. My proposed \namendment would retain the current state of the law as to debt incurred \nto pay nondischargeable debt for median and below-median income \nfamilies.\n  Nothing in the amendment would prevent a creditor with evidence of \nfraud from pursuing a case against a low-income debtor. However, the \ncreditor would not be entitled to the benefit of a presumption to make \nits case. And low-income debtors would not be forced to spend money \nthey don't have to defend against an expanded presumption of their \ndishonesty.\n  The filing of abusive dischargeability complaints is not a new \nphenomenon in bankruptcy law. It was the subject of legislation when \nthe Bankruptcy Code\n\n[[Page S14607]]\n\nwas first passed in 1978. At that time, a strong attorney's fee \nprovision was added to the Code to deter such creditor tactics. The \nHouse Judiciary Committee report (95-595, p.131) found the problem \nprevalent at that time:\n\n       The threat of litigation over this exception to discharge \n     and its attendant costs are often enough to induce the debtor \n     to settle for a reduced sum, in order to avoid the costs of \n     litigation. Thus, creditors with marginal cases are usually \n     able to have at least part of their claim excepted from \n     discharge (or reaffirmed), even though the merits of the case \n     are weak.\n\n  Unfortunately, in 1984 Congress weakened the attorney's fees \nprovision and added, for the first time, a presumption of fraud based \non purchases in the period immediately before bankruptcy. Then the \nconcerns of the House Judiciary Committee proved prescient. Creditors \nbegan filing fraud complaints in large numbers, and courts have found \nthat most debtors settle those complaints, regardless of how weak they \nare, rather than incur the expense of litigation.\n  The amendment before us is a very modest one. It does not return to \nthe law the strong attorney's fee provision enacted in 1978. It does \nnot eliminate the presumptions of fraud that were added in 1984 and \nmade more expansive in 1994. It does not even completely eliminate the \nadditional presumptions of fraud added by this bill, or the new \nexceptions to discharge. The only thing my amendment does is to make \nthese new presumptions of fraud inapplicable to families below median \nincome--those who would have the most difficulty affording a defense \nagainst unfounded fraud complaints.\n  The amendment will not shelter anyone who commits fraud. The current \nfraud provisions of the Bankruptcy Code will continue to apply to them. \nThose provisions already clearly deem fraudulent any debt that is \nincurred with no intent to pay it or with an intent to discharge it in \nbankruptcy. My amendment merely requires that a creditor produce \nmeaningful evidence to establish fraud, rather than rely on S. 625's \nnew presumption of fraud, at least in cases filed by low-income \nfamilies who are most vulnerable to, and least able to afford the \nexpenses associated with, creditor-initiated litigation.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \npendency of this amendment, Kathleen McGowan of my staff be allowed \nprivileges of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that tomorrow, \nimmediately following the Wellstone amendment, there be a vote on the \nMoynihan amendment, except for 4 minutes in between to be evenly \ndivided for the proponents and the opponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that no amendments would be in order to the Moynihan \namendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New York is very \nsincere about the amendment he has proposed. I know he is cognizant of \na discussion on a similar subject that we had on the amendment by the \nSenator from Connecticut last week. I think in a good-faith effort he \ncomes in with something that does not go quite as far as Senator Dodd's \namendment goes. But I still think, for the very same reasons I \nexpressed opposition to the Dodd amendment last week, I must express \nopposition to the Moynihan amendment.\n  In addition, I think perhaps by setting up one category for people \nwho are in bankruptcy court who are below the national average and \nallowing a certain behavior on their part that you don't for people \nabove the national average of income sets up a double standard that is \nnot justified.\n  I oppose this amendment for pretty much the same reasons I opposed \nthe Dodd amendment--that Congress needs to be very careful to fight \nagainst fraud and abuse and to say no to fraud and no to this financial \nabuse whenever we can. It seems to me it is a standard of ethic that is \njustified--being against fraud and abuse and treating it the same \nwherever it might happen.\n  One type of fraud and abuse involves loading up on debt right before \nbankruptcy and then discharging that debt. It doesn't seem to me we \nneed to allow that above the limits of our legislation. The bill before \nus now contains provisions limiting the amount of debt incurred to \npurchase luxury goods within 90 days of declaring bankruptcy.\n  Senator Moynihan's amendment would let people below the median income \nload up on more debt than higher income people. This lets people at low \nincome levels get away with fraud and more fraud. I think this is not a \nvery good idea. I respectfully oppose this amendment with obvious good \nintentions. I have never known Senator Moynihan to have anything but \ngood intentions, but this is one amendment that could bring about very \nunfair results as we allow people at a lower income get away with more \nfraud and abuse than we would people with higher income.\n  I oppose the amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to engage my friend on the bill generally, \nwe have been working with the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Daschle's floor staff, and Senator Grassley and his \nstaff during all or parts of the day. We are in a position now where \nthis bill can be completed in a relatively short period of time. We \nhave worked with Members on this side of the aisle, and with the \ncooperation of the manager of this bill there is a tentative agreement \nto accept about 10 amendments that the Democrats have offered. They may \nwant to change the amendments in some fashion. We have been able to \nwork on a finite number of hours that would be left in those \namendments, with the exception of one Senator.\n  In short, for notice to the other Members of the Senate, with a \nlittle bit of luck we can finish this bill relatively shortly. I hope \nthe majority allows Members to continue to work on this bill to \ncomplete it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, responding to the Senator from Nevada \nand going back to his efforts of last Wednesday before we adjourned for \nthe national Veterans Day holiday, I can say that on that day as well \nas other periods of time over the weekend, and even as late as \nyesterday, between his efforts working with me and the efforts of our \nrespective staffs, I have found the Senator from Nevada very \ncooperative. As a result of his cooperation, what we thought was an \nimpossible amount of amendments to work our way through to bring this \nbill to finality has been dramatically reduced. The Senator needs to be \ncredited with that extra effort.\n  I encourage Members on my side of the aisle to reach agreement. There \nmay be one or two items that are above my pay grade, maybe even above \nthe pay grade of the Senator from Nevada, that will have to be decided \nby leadership, but except for those items, we are making tremendous \nprogress. I want to work in that direction, and I assure the Senator \nfrom Nevada of my efforts in that direction.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, we have made \ngreat progress. Originally, the bill had about 320 amendments. We are \nnow down to no more than 15 amendments. Of those amendments, some can \nbe negotiated. There are some that will require votes.\n  As I indicated, there is only one Senator, who has two amendments, \nwho hasn't agreed on time for those amendments. Of course, if everyone \nis serious about completing the bankruptcy bill, going from 320 \namendments to approximately 15 amendments says it all. We should \ncomplete this bill. Significant progress has been made.\n  I acknowledge there are a couple of issues that will be more \ndifficult. However, people on our side--even on those two amendments--\nhave agreed to times. One Senator has agreed to a 30-\n\n[[Page S14608]]\n\nminute time agreement; the other Senator has agreed to a 70-minute time \nagreement. As contentious as these two amendments might be, we \nrecognize we are in the minority. We are willing, in spite of our being \nin the minority, to agree to a time limit to let the will of this body \nwork. We would agree to a way of disposing of those. Two Senators feel \nvery strongly that they deserve a vote on these two amendments.\n  Other than those two amendments, I think we should be able to go \nthrough this bill at a relatively rapid rate. From all I have been able \nto determine, we are not going to be leaving here tomorrow anyway. We \nshould try to complete this bill if at all possible. It would be a \nshame if cloture were attempted to be invoked on this bill, after \nhaving gone from 320 amendments to a mere handful. I think that would \nleave a pretty good argument on the side of the minority not to go \nalong with cloture. We have done everything we can to be reasonable. A \nfew Senators desire to offer amendments. They should have the right to \noffer those amendments.\n\n  I have appreciated the cooperation of the Senator from Iowa, the \nmanager of this bill, and his staff. They have been very easy to work \nwith and very understanding of what we have been trying to accomplish.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I add to what the Senator from Nevada \nhas said about bringing this bill, hopefully, to finality within just \nthe last few days of this session, and I remind everybody that should \nbe possible because of the bipartisan cooperation we had in drawing up \nthe bill that brought the Senate to this point, as well as the fact \nthat similar legislation passed last year on a vote of 97-1, I believe.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending Moynihan amendment aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2529 And 2478, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to modify amendments 2529 and \n2478, and I send the modifications to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to discuss two \nimportant provisions that were added to the bankruptcy reform bill by \nunanimous consent. The first provides that bankruptcy attorneys who \nrepresent debtors will be liable for paying certain attorneys' fees \nonly if their own actions are ``frivolous''--the bill had originally \nrequired these attorneys to pay fees for merely losing the argument on \na motion to remove a case from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13. The second of \nthese provisions empowers judges to waive the bankruptcy filing fee for \nindividuals who cannot afford to pay it, even in installments. I have \nfought for these two provisions, together with Senator Feingold, since \nthis bill first came before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nCongress, and I believe their inclusion in the bill is a significant \nimprovement that will ensure sufficient access to justice for all who \nseek relief in our bankruptcy courts.\n  As originally drafted, the bankruptcy bill provided that if a debtor \nfiles in Chapter 7, and a bankruptcy trustee prevails on a motion to \nremove the debtor to Chapter 13 because the debtor is found to have the \nability to pay at least 25% of his debts, then the debtor's attorney \nmust pay the reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by the \ntrustee in filing and arguing the removal motion.\n  This was an inappropriate provision. We would have had attorneys \nbeing penalized not because they were bad actors, but because they \nengaged in zealous advocacy on behalf of clients and happened to lose \nthe argument. This would have had an enormous chilling effect on \ndebtors' attorneys. In all cases where the outcome was less than \ncertain, lawyers would have been inclined to file their clients in \nChapter 13, even if they truly believe that the clients belong in \nChapter 7, in order to avoid the penalty.\n  When the bill came before the Senate Judiciary Committee last \nCongress, I offered an amendment together with Senator Feingold to \nprovide that the debtors' attorneys should pay these fees only if their \nactions in filing in Chapter 7 were ``frivolous.'' Our amendment was \ndefeated by a roll call vote of 9-9. We then offered our amendment on \nthe Senate floor, where it was tabled by a vote of 57-42.\n  As the result of our efforts last Congress, the attorneys' fees \nstandard was improved when the bill was re-introduced this Congress. \nThe current version of the bill provides that lawyers must pay these \nfees only if their actions in filing in Chapter 7 were not \n``substantially justified.'' Still, I believe that this standard is too \nbroad and will still chill attorneys from zealous advocacy. As in every \nother area of the law, lawyers must be punished only if their actions \nare ``frivolous'' or in\n\n[[Page S14609]]\n\nbad faith. I am glad that this is the standard that is now in the bill.\n  A second problem with the bankruptcy bill as originally drafted was \nthat it did not permit bankruptcy judges to waive the bankruptcy filing \nfee for indigent individuals. Individuals who petition for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy must pay a filing fee of approximately $175. There are many \nindividuals who are so indigent by time they decide to seek the relief \nof bankruptcy, however, that they cannot even afford this relatively \nsmall fee. As a result, some individuals are actually too poor to go \nbankrupt. This is an absurd result. In such limited cases, we must \nempower a judge to decide that the filing fee can waived.\n  Many individuals opposed to waiving the filing fee have argued that \ndoing so would open the door to an enormous increase in the number of \nindividuals taking advantage of the bankruptcy system. The idea is that \n``free'' bankruptcies will lead to a bankruptcy bonanza.\n  Unfortunately, these individuals have failed to look at the record. \nIn the appropriations bill for FY `94, Congress authorized a pilot in \nforma pauperis program in six federal judicial districts, including \nEastern District of Pennsylvania, for three years. These pilots \ndemonstrated that the program worked as intended, and did not \nsignificantly change the number or nature of bankruptcy filings.\n  In the six pilot districts, waivers were requested in only 3.4% of \nall non-business Chapter 7 cases, and waivers were granted in only 2.9% \nof all non-business Chapter 7 cases. This number was small enough that \nit did not lead to a significant increase in the number of overall \nChapter 7 filings or a significant loss in revenue to the courts.\n  When the bankruptcy bill was before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nlast Congress, I offered an amendment to permit the waiver of filing \nfees together with Senator Feingold. Our amendment was defeated in \nCommittee by a vote of 9-9. When we introduced our amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate, however, the motion to table the amendment was \nrejected by a vote of 47-52, and the amendment was accepted into the \nbill. I am glad that this Congress our waiver provision has been \nincluded without the necessity of a vote.\n  Taken together, these two provisions ensure that all who are in need \nwill have access to our bankruptcy courts and will enjoy the benefits \nof zealous advocacy on their behalf that is the cornerstone of our \nlegal system. They are valuable improvements, and I commend Senators \nGrassley, Leahy, Torricelli and Feingold for their inclusion in the \nbill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14609-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14609-S14610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ROBERT M.

Mr. President, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is \nperhaps the most renown and respected law enforcement agency in the \nworld.

Today, I rise to pay tribute to an individual \nwho has given much to the FBI and the nation, Robert M. ``Bear'' \nBryant, who will retire from his position as the Deputy Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation on November 30th.\n  Bear Bryant's career as a Special Agent began in 1968, when he hit \nthe foggy and mean streets of Seattle, Washington, a distinctly \ndifferent environment than his native Missouri. The atmosphere in \nSeattle, and across the nation, was combustible and there was just the \nright amount of tension to spur extensive criminal and violent \nactivities. Without question, it was a busy and dangerous time to be \nmaking one's living as a lawman, and it was in such an environment that \nSpecial Agent Bryant cut his teeth in law enforcement and made a \nlifelong commitment to the Bureau.\n  Though he certainly had no inkling as a young Special Agent that his \ncareer would take him to the most senior levels of the FBI, Robert \nBryant would spend three decades criss-crossing the United States as \nhis career moved progressively forward and up the FBI chain of command. \nSubsequent assignments to Dallas, Headquarters in Washington, Salt Lake \nCity, and Kansas City, as well as promotions to Supervisor, Permanent \nInspector, and Special Agent in Charge, all helped to prepare Bear for \nhis ultimately taking the second-in-command slot in the Bureau.\n  Surely one of the most rewarding assignments Bear had during his \ncareer was the time he spent as Special Agent in Charge of the \nWashington Field Office. When he took that job in 1991, the Capital was \na violent city as a result of ``crack wars'' that were breaking out in \nurban areas from coast to coast. As the Special Agent in Charge of the \nWashington Field Office, Bear Bryant was responsible for establishing \nthe ``Bureau Safe Streets'' program, which directed significant FBI \nresources toward combating street-level organized crime. The success of \nMr. Bryant's efforts and leadership are evident. Thanks to his efforts, \nin conjunction with other agencies including the Metropolitan Police, \ncrime is down in this city today, especially those offenses associated \nwith the crack trade. This program was so successful in the District of \nColumbia, it was adapted as a tactic for reducing violent crime in \nother cities and there are currently more than 160 taskforces in \noperation throughout the United States making streets safe again.\n  Those familiar with the FBI will tell you that service as the Special \nAgent in Charge of the Washington Field Office is an indication that \nsomeone is on their way to assuming one of the senior positions within \nthe leadership of the Bureau, and in 1993, SAC Bryant was tapped for \nthe very critical post of Assistant Director of the National Security \nDivision. This segment of the Bureau is responsible for battling the \nconsiderable threats to national security from both outside and within \nthe borders of the United States. During his tenure of the head of the \nNational Security Division, Mr. Bryant was responsible for supervising \nand directing investigations that represented some of the most serious \nacts of espionage, treason, and terrorism that law enforcement has had \nto deal with in recent years including, the Oklahoma City bombing, the \nbombing of the Al-Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia, as well as the \nespionage cases of Aldrich Ames, Earl Edwin Pitts, and Harold \nNicholson.\n  Two-years-ago, Director Louis Freeh needed a new Deputy Director and \ngiven his considerable experience as an investigator, supervisor, and \nadministrator, it came to no one's surprise that it was Bear Bryant who \ntook the co-pilot's chair.

In addition to assuring the smooth running of this global \nagency that is always on duty, Deputy Director Bryant was also tasked \nwith drafting the Bureau's strategic plan for the next five years, a \ndocument which has been described as a ``sea change'' in FBI policy for \nit included a major reassessment of how resources are allocated and how \nthe Bureau is going to do its job.\n  Robert ``Bear'' Bryant has had a career of impressive achievement and \nunflagging service.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the importance \nof the Refugee Protection Act of 1999 and to honor those most affected \nby this legislation.\n  The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 will continue a tradition that is \nas old as the United States itself. Our great country was founded by \nmen and women who left their homeland for a better life in the new \nworld. Many of these individuals escaped persecution in their home \ncountries, made the difficult decision to leave what they knew behind \nand to take their chances in a new country where many did not know the \nlanguage and customs or have friends or family. The Refugee Protection \nAct helps to continue this tradition by ensuring that those who seek \nentrance to the United States as refugees are given fair consideration \nand due process.\n  The Refugee Protection Act of 1999 would reinstate important \nprotections against the deportation and refusal of refugees and asylum \nseekers who enter the United States from countries in which they face \ndanger and persecution, whether it is due to ethnic, religious or \npolitical beliefs. Over the past few years Vermont has seen an increase \nin the number of refugees who have come to live in our great state. \nThese refugees are well served by a number of agencies in Vermont which \nprovide them help and promote their interests, including the Vermont \nRefugee Resettlement Program, the Tibetan Resettlement Project, the \nTibetan Association of Vermont and Vermont Refugee Assistance. The \nRefugee Protection Act of 1999 will continue the example set in the \nstate of Vermont, by welcoming refugees to our country and ensuring \nthat all are given the full extent of protection they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14610-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1501, the \nMotor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. During the Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation hearing on this \nbill, I brought the attention of the entire room to a deadly tractor \ntrailer accident that occurred in Atlanta in the early morning hours of \nAugust 31, 1999. Two lives were lost as a result of that accident, but \nif the incident would have occurred at a busier time of day, I shudder \nto think of the fatalities that could have resulted.\n  In 1998, 221 people were killed in Georgia as a result of truck \nrelated crashes, and thousands more were injured. Recently, I met with \ntwo people who lost their families in truck related accidents. These \nstories are ones which I hope will become less frequent as a result of \nthe action we are taking in S. 1501. This bill has the opportunity to \nimprove safety for drivers and truckers.\n  S. 1501 would make the Office of Motor Carrier a separate office \nwithin the Department of Transportation (DOT), as opposed to being \nwithin the Federal Highway Administration as it is now. This action \nwill allow Congress to statutorily mandate safety as the main focus of \nthe office. Additionally, it promotes enforcement as a main goal and \nprovides some teeth to this new agency's punitive actions.\n  However, there are some areas within the legislation that I believe \nneed attention as we work to form a final bill. For example, I believe \nthat a conflict of interest provision should be included. Without such \na provision, the new agency could continue to award contracts to the \nvery industry that operates under the federal motor carrier safety \nregulations the new agency will administer. An unbiased, multifaceted \npanel would be a better option to conduct sensitive research with \nfederal money.\n  In fact, the DOT's Inspector General (IG) released a report to \nCongress that cites the too close relationship between the industry and \nthe regulators who oversee it:\n\n       [A collaborative, educational, partnership-with industry] \n     is a good approach for motor carriers that have safety as a \n     top priority, but it has gone too far.

A bill to authorize the placement within the site of the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial of a plaque to honor Vietnam veterans who \ndied after their service in the Vietnam war, but as a direct result of \nthat service; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              THE VIETNAM VETERANS RECOGNITION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould create a plaque honoring those Vietnam veterans who died as a \nresult of the war but who are not eligible to have their names placed \non the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The ``Vietnam Veterans Recognition \nAct of 1999'' would authorize the placement of a plaque within the \nsight of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor those Vietnam veterans \nwho died after their service in the Vietnam War, but as a direct result \nof that service. This bill is similar to H.R. 3293, which was \nintroduced by my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman \nGallegly.\n  Deadly war wounds do not always kill right away. Sometimes these \nfatal\n\n[[Page S14613]]\n\nwar wounds may linger on for many years after the fighting is done. \nSometimes these wounds are clearly evident from the time they are \ninflicted, sometimes they are not. The terrible toll that Agent Orange \nhas taken on our Vietnam veterans stands as one stark example. What we \ndo know is that all too often these war wounds eventually take the \nlives of many of our brave Vietnam veterans.\n  Even though these veterans may not have been killed in action while \nthey served in the tropical jungles of Vietnam, in the end they too \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Like their brothers and \nsisters who died on the field of battle, they too deserve to be duly \nrecognized and honored.\n  Mr. President, duly honoring the men and women who made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country should always be a priority. Unfortunately, \nthe service and sacrifices made by some Vietnam veterans is still not \nbeing fully recognized since their names are not included on the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial Wall.\n  This bill recognizes the sacrifices made by these Vietnam veterans by \nauthorizing a plaque that will be engraved with an appropriate \ninscription honoring these fallen veterans.\n  Since no federal funds will be used for the plaque, it will be up to \nour nation's leading veteran's organizations and individual Americans \nto demonstrate their commitment to honoring these fallen veterans \nthrough charitable giving to help make it a reality. The American \nBattle Monument Commission will lead the effort in collecting the \nprivate funds necessary.\n  It is vital for us to have a place to honor all the men and women who \nhave served and died for their country. It is also important for the \nfamilies of these fallen heroes to have a place in our nation's capital \nwhere their loved one's sacrifice is honored and recognized for future \ngenerations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ADDITION OF A COMMEMORATIVE PLAQUE ON THE SITE OF THE \n                   VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL.\n\n       Public Law 96-297 (16 U.S.C. 431 note), which authorized \n     the establishment of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for modifications to intercity buses required under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  tax credit for modifications to intercity buses required under the \n                    americans with disabilities act\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto give privately owned, over-the-road bus operators, the assistance \nthey need to equip their buses with wheelchair lifts. These operators \nprovide vital intercity bus services to millions of Americans who have \naccess to no other form of public transportation, most particularly in \nrural areas. The legislation I am introducing today passed the Senate \nearlier this year as part of a larger tax bill and enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport. Indeed I am delighted that Senator Grassley has agreed to join \nme as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  In keeping with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Department \nof Transportation (DOT) is requiring that a wheelchair lift be \ninstalled on every new over-the-road bus operating intercity bus \nservice. In addition, comparable requirements are being imposed on over \nthe road buses providing charter service. This largely unfunded mandate \nis estimated to cost the industry $25 million a year in acquisition and \ntraining costs alone. In some years, that $25 million figure is \nexpected to exceed the entire profit for the industry.\n  DOT's new requirement serves the important public purpose of ensuring \nthat disabled persons in wheelchairs will have access to over-the-road \nbuses. Yet the cost of this requirement poses a significant threat to \nthe continuation of this service for millions of rural and low-income \nAmericans. Over-the-road buses serve roughly 4,000 communities that \nhave no other form of intercity public transportation. Additionally, \nwith an average fare of $34, they are the only form of affordable \ntransportation available for millions of passengers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today provides over-the-road bus \noperators with a 50-percent tax credit for the unsubsidized costs of \ncomplying with the DOT requirement. This tax credit gives them the \nsupport that they need to ensure both that disabled people in \nwheelchairs have access to over-the-road bus service and that that \nservice remains available to the millions of passengers who rely on \nthat service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK.\n  S. 1923. A bill to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission \nfrom applying spectrum aggregation limits to spectrum assigned by \nauction after 1999; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               the third-generation wireless internet act\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Third-\nGeneration Wireless Internet Act of 1999, a bill to prevent the FCC \nfrom applying the current spectrum cap imposed upon commercial mobile \nwireless services to new spectrum auctions.\n  Mr. President, the popularity of wireless services has far exceeded \nexpectations. More people purchase wireless phones every month, and the \nduration of calls is growing rapidly as per-minute rates decline.\n  Mr. President, while the popularity of wireless has increased, the \nInternet has become a mass-market phenomenon. Flat-rate Internet-usage \nplans have lured millions of Americans online. Broadband services have \nincreased the Internet applications available to consumers and \ndrastically reduced the amount of time necessary to access information \nonline.\n  Now, we are witnessing the marriage of the wireless and Internet \ncrazes. Wireless Internet access presents consumers with the \nopportunity to access the Internet anywhere and anytime.\n  With wireless access, consumers will no longer be dependent upon \npersonal computers to reach the Internet. However, wireless Internet \naccess will only\n\n[[Page S14614]]\n\nbecome a mass-market phenomenon when consumers can obtain wireless \nbroadband services that provide the bandwidth necessary to download \ninformation from the Internet on a hand-held device at reasonable \nspeeds.\n  Third-generation wireless services represent the first wave of truly \nbroadband mobile services. Third-generation services should enable \nwireless users to achieve speeds of up to 384 kilobits per second. But, \nMr. President, to ensure the rapid deployment of third-generation \nservices, Congress needs to provide wireless carriers with the ability \nto purchase additional spectrum at future FCC auctions, which many \ncarriers cannot do under the current FCC policy.\n  Manufacturers are hesitant to produce equipment for third-generation \napplications, and wireless carriers are unable to roll out third-\ngeneration services, because wireless carriers do not have enough \nspectrum to offer true third-generation services. Consumers have an \nopportunity to have wireless high-speed access to the Internet. But \nuntil there is regulatory certainty that carriers will be able to \nobtain the spectrum necessary to offer third-generation services, \nconsumers will have to wait before they can have a mobile on-ramp to \nthe information superhighway.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Third-Generation Wireless \n     Internet Act.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Mobile telephony has been one of the fastest growing \n     industries of the telecommunications sector, offering \n     consumers innovative services at affordable rates.\n       (2) Demand for mobile telecommunications services has \n     greatly exceeded industry expectations.\n       (3) Mobile carriers are poised to bring high-speed Internet \n     access to consumers through wireless telecommunications \n     devices.\n       (4) Third Generation mobile systems (hereinafter referred \n     to as ``3G'') are capable of delivering high-speed data \n     services for Internet access and other multimedia \n     applications.\n       (5) Advanced wireless services such as 3G may be the most \n     efficient and economic way to provide high-speed Internet \n     access to rural areas of the United States.\n       (6) Under the current Federal Communications Commission \n     rules, commercial mobile service providers may not use more \n     than 45 megahertz of combined cellular, broadband Personal \n     Communications Service, and Specialized Mobile Radio spectrum \n     within any geographic area.\n       (7) Assignments of additional spectrum may be needed to \n     enable mobile operators to keep pace with the demand for 3G \n     services.\n       (8) The application of the current Commission spectrum cap \n     rules to new spectrum auctioned by the FCC would greatly \n     impede the deployment of 3G services.\n\n     SEC. 3. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.\n\n       Section 332(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     332(c)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following:\n       ``(9) Non-Application of spectrum aggregation limits to new \n     auctions.--\n       ``(A) The Commission may not apply section 20.6(a) of its \n     regulations (47 C.F.R. 20.6(a)) to a license for spectrum \n     assigned by initial auction held for after December 31, 1999.\n       ``(B) The Commission may relax or eliminate the spectrum \n     aggregation limits of section 20.6 of its regulations (47 \n     C.F.R. 20.6), but may not lower these limits.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 1924. A bill to ensure personal privacy with respect to financial \ninformation, to provide customers notice and choice about how their \nfinancial institutions share or sell their personally identifiable \nsensitive financial information, to provide for strong enforcement of \nthese rights, and to protect States' rights; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n           the financial information privacy and security act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Financial \nInformation Privacy and Security Act of 1999. I am pleased that \nSenators Bryan, Harkin, Durbin, and Feingold are original cosponsors of \nthis legislation to protect the financial privacy of all Americans.\n  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by \nthe Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people \nare growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their \npersonal privacy.\n  New technologies, new communications media, and new business services \ncreated with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also \npose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, and to \nlive, work and think without having personal information about us \ncollected without our knowledge or consent.\n  This incremental invasion of our privacy has happened through the \nlack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information, \nwhich can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong \nhands with the push of a button or click of a mouse.\n  Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in \nthe information age. The digitalization of information and the \nexplosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer \ntremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct \ncommerce, and interact with their government.\n  It makes it possible for me, sitting in my farmhouse in Vermont, to \nconnect with any Member of Congress or friends around the world, to get \ninformation with the click of a mouse on my computer.\n  But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual \nprivacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms \nunder which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used.\n  Just last week, President Clinton signed into law the landmark \nFinancial Modernization Act of 1999, which updates our financial laws \nand opens up the financial services industry to become more \ncompetitive, both at home and abroad. I supported this legislation \nbecause I believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It will \nmake it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms to \nconsolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at a \nlower cost to all. But it also raises new concerns about our financial \nprivacy.\n  New conglomerates in the financial services industry may now offer a \nwidening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to \nprovide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in \nthe new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial \nconglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the \ncustomer thought he or she was providing it.\n  For example, the new law has no requirement for the consumer to \nconsent before these new financial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, \nshare, or publish information on savings account balances, certificates \nof deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases \nand sales, life insurance payouts or health insurance claims.\n  That is wrong. You shouldn't be able to have that information and go \naround to anybody who wants to use it to pitch you some new product or \nscare you into cashing in life savings or anything else.\n  As President Clinton recently warned:\n\n       Although consumers put a great value on privacy of their \n     financial records, our laws have not caught up to \n     technological developments that make it possible and \n     potentially profitable for companies to share financial data \n     in new ways. Consumers who undergo physical exams to obtain \n     insurance, for example, should not have to fear the \n     information will be used to lower their credit card limits or \n     deny them mortgages.\n\n  I strongly agree. If we had this information in a desk drawer at \nhome, nobody could come in and just take it. Instead, it is in the \nelectronic desk drawer of one of the companies we have given it to, and \nthey can share it with anybody they want within their organization.\n  Mr. President, the Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of \n1999 offers this Congress the historic opportunity to provide \nfundamental privacy of every American's personal financial information. \nThis bill would protect the privacy of this financial information by \ndirecting the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly to \npromulgate rules requiring the financial\n\n[[Page S14615]]\n\ninstitutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers about what \ninformation may be disclosed, and under what circumstances, including \nwhen, to whom and for what purposes; (2) allow customers to review the \ninformation for accuracy; (3) establish safeguards to protect the \nconfidentiality of personally identifiable customer information and \nrecords to prevent unauthorized disclosure; and (4) for new customers, \nobtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing \ncustomers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to \ndisclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential \ncustomer information from other entities only if the entities provides \ntheir customers with similar privacy protections.\n  In addition, this bill provides individuals the civil right of action \nto enforce their financial privacy rights and to recover punitive \ndamages, reasonable attorneys fees, and other litigation costs. Privacy \nrights must be enforceable in a court of law to be truly effective.\n  To be sure, this legislation would not affect any state law which \nprovides greater financial privacy protections to its citizens. Some \nstates have already recognized the growing need for financial privacy \nprotections. For example, I am proud to say that Vermont instituted \ncutting edge financial privacy laws five years ago. This bill is \nintended to provide the most basic rights of financial privacy to all \nAmerican consumers. They deserve nothing less.\n  When President Clinton signed the financial modernization bill last \nweek, he directed the National Economic Council to work with the \nTreasury Department and Office of Management and Budget to craft \nlegislative proposals to forward to Congress next year to protect \nfinancial privacy in the new financial services marketplace. I believe \nthe Financial Information Privacy and Security Act of 1999, which we \nare introducing today, should serve as the foundation for the \nAdministration's financial privacy bill.\n  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this \nburgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their \nfinancial information.\n  The Financial Information Privacy and Security Act updates United \nStates privacy laws to provide these fundamental protections of \npersonal financial information in the evolving financial services \nindustry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  On privacy, in Vermont we care greatly about this. I have been in \npublic life for a long time. During that time, I have only clipped and \nactually saved and framed a couple articles about me from the press.\n  My distinguished friend from Nevada, who is on the floor, like me \nlives in a rural area--he in Searchlight, I in Middlesex, VT. I live on \nthis dirt road. I look down this valley, 35 miles down a valley, \nmountains on either side. I literally cannot see another house from my \nfront yard. It is a beautiful spot, this place my parents got when I \nwas a teenager just for a summer home. Marcelle and I have made a year-\nround place out of it. There is a neighboring farm family who, for 40 \nyears, have hayed the fields and done work around there. They have \nknown me since I was a teenager. The article I cut from the papers was \nfrom one of our largest newspapers. It was a sidebar. Here is almost \nverbatim the way it went.\n  The out-of-State reporter drives up to a farmer who is sitting on his \nporch along the dirt road. He says to the farmer, ``Does Senator Leahy \nlive up this road?'' The farmer said, ``You a relative of his?'' He \nsaid, ``No, I am not.'' He says, ``You a friend of his?'' He said, \n``Not really.'' He says, ``Is he expecting you?'' The reporter says, \n``No.'' The farmer looks him right in the eye and says, ``Never heard \nof him.''\n  Now, we Vermonters like our privacy. This was a Saturday, and the \nfarmer wasn't about to tell somebody where I lived and direct him down \nthe dirt road to it. It is a humorous story, but I kept that over the \nyears because it reminds me of other ways to protect our privacy. By \nthe same token, I would not want--whether it is that reporter or \nsomebody I never met--to go onto a computer and find my bank \nstatements, my medical records, my children's medical records, or my \nspouse's, and find out whether we have applied for a mortgage or not, \nor find out whether we have bought life insurance or cashed in life \ninsurance. So I think we have to ask ourselves as we go into the new \nmillennium, one where information will flow quicker and in more detail \nthan could have even been conceived a generation ago--it could not have \nbeen conceived at the time my parents purchased that beautiful spot in \nVermont. Ten years from now, we will move faster and with more \ncomplexity than we could even think of today.\n  So I think the Congress, if it is going to fulfill its responsibility \nto the American people, has to do more and more to protect our privacy \nand allow technology to move as fast as it can, but not at the price of \nour individual privacy. We all know basically what we, our friends, \nneighbors, families, would want to give up of their personal privacy--\nnot very much. Think to yourself, if this was something you had in the \ntop drawer of your desk at home, knowing nobody could get it, they \nwould need search warrants or they would break the law by coming in and \ntaking it. That is all the more reason why on somebody's computer they \nshould not be allowed to take it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \n        Bryan):\n  S. 1925. A bill to promote environmental restoration around the Lake \nTahoe basin; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                     the lake tahoe restoration act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in June, joined by Senators Reid, \nBoxer, and Bryan, I introduced the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act (S. 1192) \nwhich would jump start the process of cleaning up Lake Tahoe.\n  Lake Tahoe, one of the largest, deepest, clearest lakes in the world \nis in the midst of an economic crisis. Water clarity is declining at \nthe rate of more than 1 foot each year; more than \\1/3\\ of the trees in \nthe forest are either dead or dying; and sediment and algae-nourishing \nphosphorus and nitrogen continue to flow into the lake from a variety \nof sources.\n  Over the last few months, I worked with the Congressmen from the \nTahoe areas, Representative Doolittle and Representative Gibbons to \ncraft a House version of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act that could \ngarner bipartisan support. I am pleased that we've been able to build \non S. 1192 and develop a compromise bill which I am introducing today.\n  Like S. 1192, this bill first and foremost authorizes the necessary \nfunding to clean up and restore Lake Tahoe. This bill includes two \nmajor changes:\n  First, to address the problem of MTBE in the Lake Tahoe basin, I \nadded a section that provides $1 million to the Tahoe Regional Planning \nAgency and local utility districts to clean up contaminated wells and \nsurface water.\n  Second, to help local governments who would otherwise be burdened by \nrelocation costs that may be needed to clean up the basin, this bill \npromises that the federal government will pay \\2/3\\ of any needed \nrelocation costs.\n  I believe these provisions improve on the original bill and increase \nthe breadth of support for this bill.\n  The bill requires the Forest Service to develop an annual priority \nlist of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $200 million \ndollars over 10 years to the forest service to implement these projects \non federal lands. The list must include projects that will improve \nwater quality, forest health, soil conservation, air quality, and fish \nand wildlife habitat around the lake.\n  In developing the environmental restoration priority list, the Forest \nService must rely on the best available science, and consider projects \nthat local governments, businesses, and environmental groups have \ntargeted as top priorities. The Forest Service also must consult with \nlocal community leaders.\n  The bill requires the Forest Service to give special attention on its \npriority list to five key activities: acquisition of environmentally \nsensitive land from willing sellers, erosion and sediment control, fire \nrisk reduction, cleaning up MTBE contamination, and traffic and parking \nmanagement, including promotion of public transportation.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act also requires that an additional $100 \nmillion be authorized over 10 years be as payments to local governments \nfor erosion\n\n[[Page S14616]]\n\ncontrol activities on non-federal lands. These payments will help local \ngovernments conduct soil conservation and erosion mitigation projects, \nrestore wetlands and stream environmental zones, and plant native \nvegetation to filter out sediment and debris.\n  I spent my childhood at Lake Tahoe, but I had not been back for a \nnumber of years until I returned for the 1997 Presidential summit with \nPresident Clinton. I saw things I had never seen before at Lake Tahoe.\n  I saw the penetration of MTBE in the water and learned that 30 \npercent of the South Lake Tahoe water supply has been eliminated by \nMTBE. I observed gasoline spread over the water surface. I noticed that \na third of the magnificent forest that surrounds the lake was dead or \ndying. I saw major land erosion problems that were bringing all kinds \nof sediment into the lake and which had effectively cut the lake's \nclarity by thirty feet since the last time I had visited. And then I \nlearned that the experts believe that in 10 years the clouding of the \namazing crystal water clarity would be impossible to reverse and in 30 \nyears it would be lost forever.\n\n  The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that it will cost $900 \nmillion over the next 10 years to restore the Lake.\n  For me, that was a call to action and prompted me to sponsor this \nbill which will authorize $300 million of Federal moneys on a matching \nbasis over 10 years for environmental restoration projects at Lake \nTahoe to preserve the region's water quality and forest health. Put \nsimply, this crown jewel deserves the attention, and the fact that the \nfederal government owns 77 percent of that troubled area makes the \nresponsibility all so clear.\n  Through funding over the past few years we have already begun to make \nsome early strides such as the purchase of important pieces of land \nlike the Sunset Ranch and the planning for a Coordinated Transit \nSystem.\n  Already, California and Nevada have begun contributing their portion \nof the restoration efforts.\n  California is in the second year of a ten year $275 million \ncommitment through the California Tahoe Conservancy, Caltrans, and the \nParks Service.\n  Nevada has authorized the issuance of bonds that will constitute an \n$82 million contribution over an 8-year period.\n  Local governments and private industry have also agreed to commit \n$300 million. The Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality Coalition, a \ncoalition of 18 businesses and environmental groups, including Placer \nCounty, El Dorado County, the city of South Lake Tahoe, Douglass County \nin Nevada, and Washoe County in Nevada have all agreed. This is an \nextraordinary commitment for a region with only 50,000 year-round \nresidents.\n  President Clinton took an important first step in 1997 when he held \nan environmental summit at Lake Tahoe and promised $50 million over 2 \nyears for restoration activities around the lake. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's commitments lasted for only 2 years, so important areas \nlike land acquisition and road decommissioning were not funded at the \nlevels the President tried to accomplish. What is needed is a more \nsustained, long-term effort, and one that will meet the federal \ngovernment's $300 million responsibility to save the environment at \nLake Tahoe.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act will build upon the President's \ncommitment to Lake Tahoe and authorize full funding for a new \nenvironmental restoration program at the lake.\n  I am also grateful to the Lake Tahoe Transportation and Water Quality \nCoalition, a local consensus group of 18 businesses and environmental \ngroups, who has worked extremely hard on this bill.\n  Thanks in large part to their work, the bill has strong, bipartisan \nsupport from nearly every major group in the Tahoe Basin.\n  The bottom line is that time is running out for Lake Tahoe. We have \n10 years to do something major or the water quality deterioration is \nirreversible.\n  I am hopeful that Congress will move quickly to consider the Lake \nTahoe Restoration Act. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Reid, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Bryan, Congressman Doolittle, Congressman \nGibbons, Congresswoman Eshoo, and me in preserving this national \ntreasure for generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 1926. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to improve student achievement by helping local educational \nagencies improve the quality of, and technology training for, teachers, \nto improve teacher accountability, and to enhance the leadership skills \nof principals; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\nquality and accountability are best for children act (quality abcs act)\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill entitled \nthe ``Quality and Accountability Are Best for Children Act.'' Every \nchild in every classroom in America deserves to have a fully-qualified \nteacher; this legislation takes a comprehensive approach to helping \ncommunities make that a reality. The bill should be seen as \ncomplementary to the professional development sections of last year's \nHigher Education Act, and to the professional development sections of \nS. 7, the Public Schools Excellence Act. It should also be seen as part \nof a comprehensive strategy to forge a strong partnership on education \nbetween the Congress and the teachers, families, and students in \ncommunities across America which it serves.\n  While my efforts today are to address educator quality issues, I also \nrecently introduced S. 1773, the Youth and Adult School Partnership Act \nof 1999, and S. 1772, the Family and School Partnership Act of 1999. In \naddition, I have been working for some time to pass S. 1304, the Time \nfor Schools Act. All these efforts work in concert, to address the very \nreal needs of our local schools when it comes to investing in the \nstrategies that work, and in making it possible to involve all the \nnecessary members of our local school communities in the decisions that \naffect them.\n  I have spoken before about what I have heard from the literally \nthousands of families and students and educators and community leaders \nI have met. I have spoken about how most Americans want an increased \nbut appropriate federal role in education. They want decisions about \nhow to help students achieve at higher levels to be made in the local \nschool, but they also want increased federal funds--help where help is \nneeded--to support their local efforts. Most people are shocked to \nlearn that their federal government only devotes 1.6 percent of overall \nspending to education.\n  I have spoken before about how the federal class size reduction \ninitiative has at its core a streamlined funding mechanism that targets \nfunds to a goal and then holds the school accountable to the local \ncommunity for making progress toward that goal. I have talked about how \nimportant I feel this funding mechanism can be as a way for us to look \nat other federal programs in education. I have spoken about the \nimportance of keeping the federal role firmly in mind: to ensure \nopportunity on the one hand, and to fund shared national priorities on \nthe other. In addition, we must ensure accountability for results at \nevery step along the way.\n  We need to remember that what families and students and educators and \ncommunity leaders have asked us for is targeted help and support, to \nfund such efforts as reducing class size, and providing for special \neducation students, and after-school programs, and school \nmodernization, and education technology, and school safety and other \nefforts. Our responsibility is to give them the help they have sought, \nand no topic is more important to them than funding the necessary steps \nit will take to help local schools improve the quality of their corps \nof educators. We must rethink how educators are taught, and how we \nsupport their learning of the new skills it takes to teach students the \nbasics and ``new basics'' that it will take for them to succeed in \ntoday's complex world.\n\n  In addition, we must fund local schools' efforts to recruit, retain \nand reward the world's finest corps of educators. And assure that their \nlocal communities can hold them accountable for doing so.\n  Today I introduce the Quality and Accountability are Best for \nChildren Act, or Quality ABCs Act. This bill will help school districts \nimprove the quality of their educator corps, and help\n\n[[Page S14617]]\n\ncommunities hold schools accountable for results. Since all communities \nare struggling to improve the quality of their teaching force, funds \nare provided at a level that allow all school districts to participate. \nIt will authorize an additional formula grant, based on enrollment, in \nthe amount of $2 billion per year for teacher quality improvement, plus \n$100 million per year for principal professional development. Funds \nwill supplement current federal, state, and local professional \ndevelopment efforts, and school districts are encouraged to use \nexisting law, waivers, of Ed Flex authority to coordinate activities at \nthe local level.\n  With the goal of reducing paperwork and avoiding lengthy program \ndescriptions, my legislation is based on the bipartisan mechanism \nagreed to under the fiscal year 1999 Appropriations Class Size \nReduction Initiative. Applications are streamlined, school districts \ncan use money flexibly at the local level, as long as they target funds \nto improving educator quality in at least one of three subject areas \n(recruitment, retention, and rewards) and school districts are \naccountable to the local community in the form of a report card \ndescribing district efforts to improve teacher quality.\n  School district are required to use funds to improve educator \nquality, but have a broad range of options to do so.\n  To recruit new teachers, school districts may use tools such as the \nfollowing:\n  Establishing or expanding teacher academies, teachers-recruiting-\nfuture-teacher programs, and programs to encourage high school and \nmiddle school students to pursue a career in teaching;\n  Establishing or expanding para-professional training programs, \nparaeducator-to-teacher career ladders or other efforts to improve the \ntraining and supervision of para-educators;\n  Establishing or expanding programs for mid-career professionals to \nbecome certificated teachers;\n  Reaching out to communities of color or other special populations to \nmake the teaching corps more reflective of current and future student \ndemographics:\n  Placing advertisements, attending college job fairs, offering signing \nbonuses, and other recruitment efforts;\n  Embarking on and coordinating with other activities to help recruit \nthe best quality teaching corps, such as: offering forgivable loans; \nassisting new hires to reach higher levels of state certification or to \nbecome national board certified teachers; recruiting new teachers in \nspecific disciplines including math and science;\n  In addition, the Secretary of Education will be authorized directly, \nor by creating programs at the state or local level to:\n  Offer incentives for teachers to achieve national board \ncertification;\n  Create forgivable loan programs under the current student aid \nprograms;\n  Report on successful efforts and take part in dissemination \nactivities;\n  Provide technical assistance to states and school districts to assist \nthem to use technology in recruitment, processing, hiring, and \nplacement of qualified teaching candidates.\n  To retain teachers, school districts may:\n  Use funds to offer or stipends or bonuses to educators to seek \nfurther subject matter endorsements, advanced levels of state \ncertification or national board certification. These retention efforts \ncan also fund other local initiatives specifically designed, such as \nmentor teacher programs, to retain teachers in the first 5 years of \nteaching;\n  Local education agencies can use funds, within district criteria for \nmentor or master teacher criteria, for a range of retention activities: \nmentor and/or master teacher job classification/career ladders; \nsabbatical/research activities such as the Fulbright program, or \nworking in industry/non-profit world to improve teacher education; or \nother activities that keep teachers fresh while preserving their job \nslot/pay/benefits. These retention efforts can also fund other local \ninitiatives specifically designed to retain experienced teachers, \nbeyond the first five years of teaching;\n  To reward teachers:\n  School districts can reward elementary and secondary schools, based \non improvement in the proportion of highly qualified teachers or other \nmeasures of teacher quality--improved recruiting, retention, improved \n``in endorsement'' ratio, higher percentage of certificated staff, \nhigher levels of certification, professional development curricular \nimprovement;\n  School districts can provide teachers with a one-time bonus/reward of \n$5,000 for achieving national board certification;\n  Each state will receive $100,000 to support the McAuliffe awards and \nNational Teacher of the year awards to create additional forms of \nconferring respect and recognition upon distinguished educators.\n\n  The bill requires school district report cards to contain information \nabout efforts they have undertaken to improve the recruiting, \nretention, rewarding, and accountability for teachers. Reports include \nwhich programs were offered locally, how much of the funding was spent \non which efforts, and what results were achieved in terms of measurable \nimprovements to teacher quality and student achievement.\n  Each report card shall include information about how parents and \nother community members can access processes under school district \npolicies regarding teacher accountability.\n  The bill includes an effort to provide, on a statewide basis, \nprofessional development services for public elementary school and \nsecondary school principals designed to enhance the principals' \neducational leadership skills.\n  The programs will provide principals with:\n  Knowledge of effective instructional leadership skills and practices;\n  Comprehensive whole-school approaches and programs that improve \nteaching and learning;\n  Improved understanding of the effective uses of educational \ntechnology, including best practices for incorporating technology into \nthe instructional program and management of the school;\n  Increased knowledge of State content and performance standards, and \nappropriate related curriculum;\n  Assistance in the development of effective programs, and strategies \nfor assessing the effectiveness of such programs;\n  Training in effective, fair evaluation and supervision of school \nstaff, and training in improvement of instruction;\n  Assistance in the enhancement and development of the principals' \noverall school management and business skills;\n  Knowledge of school safety and discipline practices, school law, and \nschool funding issues.\n  The bill also includes the K-12 school sections of my teacher \nTechnology Training Act. Last year, I included in the Higher Education \nAct provisions to improve pre-service teacher training offered by \nuniversities, by including technology in teacher training. The Quality \nABCs Act will take the relevant steps to integrate technology into the \nprofessional development offered by school districts.\n  This bill is only one step but it is a necessary one. We cannot \nsucceed in improving student learning if we do not also invest in the \nquality of our educators. We must assure that schools can use all the \ntools at their disposal to do what's necessary, and the Quality ABCs \nAct funds the recruitment, retention, rewards and accountability \nmeasures essential to their success.\n  In all these pieces of legislation, whether I am a sponsor or a \ncosponsor, my approach is to offer help where help is needed. Schools \nface increasing challenges and higher expectations from their \ncommunities and from all Americans.\n\n  Now is not the time for easy answers. Too many have suggested that \nit's all about paperwork or all about trust or all about bureaucracy. \nWe must take steps to squeeze the most out of every dollar, and make \nthings more efficient, but, as we've seen with the funding mechanism \nunder the class size reduction initiative, local flexibility, targeted \nto a specific purpose, with local accountability built in, can work \nvery well.\n  But even that approach is only a partial answer. Helping all our \nschools perform for all students now and into the next century is a \nmonumental task. None of these challenges is easy. The kind of student \nsuccess we are hoping for will not happen without an actual, working \npartnership among local\n\n[[Page S14618]]\n\nschools and school districts, state and regional education agencies, \nand the federal government. The success will not happen without a \npartnership between educators and families and young people and \ncommunity leaders.\n  No person, school, or government entity has the resources, the \nresearch, the leadership, the experience, or the capability to go it \nalone. People cannot succeed in a global economy without an education \nthat is world-class, relevant, and sufficiently funded. We all must \nwork together as a nation if we want to succeed as a nation in a \ncomplex world. We owe this kind of perspective to our children and to \nour future. We must all strive to find the areas where we agree. Only a \nshared vision of the future of education will help us all to move \ntoward our destination. Let us take that first step together.\n  Mr. President, the drafting of these bills would have been impossible \nwithout the efforts of two legislative fe3llows in my office, Ann Mary \nIfekwunigwe and Peter Hatch. I thank them for their work.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quality and Accountability \n     are Best for Children Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Except as otherwise expressly provided, whenever in this \n     Act an amendment or repeal is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to, or repeal of, a section or other provision, the \n     reference shall be considered to be made to a section or \n     other provision of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Academically qualified, highly trained and professional \n     teachers are a critical component in children's educational \n     success.\n       (2) The Department of Education has reported that our \n     Nation will need to hire 2,200,000 more teachers during the \n     10-year period beginning in fiscal year 2000.\n       (3) Newspaper accounts from the 18th century described \n     teachers as well-respected, but ill-rewarded.\n       (4) In 1999, because many individuals view teaching as a \n     thankless profession which garners little respect, little \n     support, and little money, nearly 50 percent of those who \n     enter teaching leave the profession within 5 years.\n       (5) Sixty-three percent of parents and teachers believe \n     that accountability systems with financial rewards are a good \n     idea, and would motivate teachers to work harder to improve \n     student achievement.\n       (6) Paying professional salaries is integral to teacher \n     retention. The State of Connecticut, for example, has been \n     able to improve student achievement, eliminate its teacher \n     shortage, and retain highly qualified teachers by offering \n     the highest salaries in the Nation (an average of $51,727 per \n     year).\n       (7) Dissemination of information regarding the teacher \n     corps working at individual elementary schools and secondary \n     schools, and accountability procedures enforced by the local \n     educational agency can provide an important tool for parents \n     and taxpayers to measure the quality of the elementary \n     schools or secondary schools and to hold the schools and \n     teachers accountable for improving student performance.\n       (8) Although elementary school and secondary school \n     teachers need the most up-to-date skills possible to ensure \n     that students are equipped to deal with a complex economy and \n     society, less than 50 percent of such teachers report that \n     they are competent in using technology effectively in the \n     classroom.\n       (9) Although principals and other administrators are the \n     educational leaders and chief executive officers of our \n     Nation's elementary schools and secondary schools, and \n     research strongly suggests that strong leadership from the \n     principal is the single most important factor in effective \n     schools, research also has revealed that the characteristics \n     of a good principal are not necessarily those things for \n     which principals are trained and rewarded.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recruit the best and the brightest candidates to \n     teach in public elementary schools and secondary schools by \n     looking to young people, people from special populations, \n     mid-career professionals, and others as potential new \n     teachers;\n       (2) to offer retention incentives to highly qualified \n     teachers to keep the teachers in the classroom;\n       (3) to reward elementary schools and secondary schools \n     that, and teachers in such schools who, succeed in improving \n     student achievement;\n       (4) to hold elementary school and secondary school teachers \n     accountable for achieving high levels of professionalism, \n     including possessing expert knowledge and skills in the \n     subject areas in which the teachers teach, being actively \n     involved in all aspects of the school community, and being \n     committed to the academic success of students, by providing \n     parents and the school community with specific information \n     about the qualifications of the local teaching corps;\n       (5) to improve teacher professional development in the uses \n     of technology in teaching and learning and in the study of \n     technology, and to help local communities to use technology \n     as a vehicle to improve teacher professional development; and\n       (6) to improve the professional development of elementary \n     school and secondary school principals and other \n     administrators to ensure that the principals and \n     administrators are the community's educational leaders, and \n     have sophisticated knowledge about student achievement, \n     school safety, management, evaluation, and community \n     outreach.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement \nAct to revise and extend such Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n  Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act Reauthorization of 1999\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize and extend the provisions of the Native Hawaiian Health \nCare Act. I am joined in the sponsorship of this measure by my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Daniel Akaka.\n  Although the act was enacted into law in 1988, appropriations to \nimplement these critically-needed health care programs and services \nwere not forthcoming for several years. As a result, the Native \nHawaiian Health care Systems are still struggling to address the \noverwhelming need for health care services that are designed to improve \nthe health status of the native people of Hawaii.\n  Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State \nof Hawaii, as well as the highest years of productive life lost from \ncancer. Native Hawaiians also have the highest mortality rates in the \nState of Hawaii from diabetes mellitus--130 percent higher than the \nstatewide rate for all other races. The death rate from heart disease \nis 66 percent higher amongst Native Hawaiians than for the entire State \nof Hawaii. The Native Hawaiian mortality rate associated with \nhypertension is 84 percent higher than that for the rest of the State. \nThese are just a few of the health status indicators at which the \nhealth care programs and services authorized by the Native Hawaiian \nHealth Care Improvement Act are targeted.\n  Through the training of Native Hawaiian health care professionals, \nand the assignment of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, \nand traditional healers to serve the needs of the Native Hawaiian \ncommunity, we anticipate that the objectives established by the Surgeon \nGeneral--the Healthy People 2010 goals--as well as kanaka maoli health \nobjectives--will be attained. But to do so will require a sustained \neffort and a continuity of authorization and support for health care \nservices provided to our most needy population.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this measure \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) General Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians begin their story with the Kumulipo \n     which details the creation and inter-relationship of all \n     things, including their evolvement as healthy and well \n     people.\n       ``(2) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago and have a distinct \n     society organized almost 2,000 years ago.\n       ``(3) Native Hawaiians have never directly relinquished to \n     the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty \n     as a people or over their national lands, either through \n     their monarchy or through a plebiscite or referendum.\n       ``(4) The health and well-being of Native Hawaiians are \n     intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and attachment to \n     their lands and seas.\n       ``(5) The long-range economic and social changes in Hawaii \n     over the 19th and early 20th centuries have been devastating \n     to the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(6) The Native Hawaiian people are determined to \n     preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their \n     ancestral territory, and their cultural identity in \n     accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, \n     customs, practices, language, and social institutions. In \n     referring to themselves, Native Hawaiians use the term \n     ``Kanaka Maoli'', a term frequently used in the 19th century \n     to describe the native people of Hawaii.\n       ``(7) The constitution and statutes of the State of \n     Hawaii--\n       ``(A) acknowledge the distinct land rights of Native \n     Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust; \n     and\n       ``(B) reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native \n     Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and \n     religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language.\n       ``(8) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous \n     people in Hawaii in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in \n     a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistence social \n     system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated \n     language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(9) A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawaii.\n       ``(10) Throughout the 19th century and until 1893, the \n     United States--\n       ``(A) recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Nation;\n       ``(B) extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to \n     the Hawaiian Government; and\n       ``(C) entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, \n     1842, 1849, 1875 and 1887.\n       ``(11) In 1893, John L. Stevens, the United States Minister \n     assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawaii, \n     conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the \n     Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to \n     overthrow the indigenous and lawful government of Hawaii.\n       ``(12) In pursuance of that conspiracy, the United States \n     Minister and the naval representative of the United States \n     caused armed naval forces of the United States to invade the \n     sovereign Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the \n     indigenous and lawful Government of Hawaii and the United \n     States Minister thereupon extended diplomatic recognition of \n     a provisional government formed by the conspirators without \n     the consent of the native people of Hawaii or the lawful \n     Government of Hawaii in violation of treaties between the 2 \n     nations and of international law.\n       ``(13) In a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, then \n     President Grover Cleveland reported fully and accurately on \n     these illegal actions, and acknowledged that by these acts, \n     described by the President as acts of war, the government of \n     a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown, and the \n     President concluded that a ``substantial wrong has thus been \n     done which a due regard for our national character as well as \n     the rights of the injured people required that we should \n     endeavor to repair''.\n       ``(14) Queen Lili`uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawaii, \n     and the Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the \n     aboriginal citizens of Hawaii, promptly petitioned the United \n     States for redress of these wrongs and for restoration of the \n     indigenous government of the Hawaiian nation, but this \n     petition was not acted upon.\n       ``(15) Further, the United States has acknowledged the \n     significance of these events and has apologized to Native \n     Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii with the participation \n     of agents and citizens of the United States, and the \n     resulting deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to \n     self-determination in legislation in 1993 (Public Law 103-\n     150; 107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(16) In 1898, the United States annexed Hawaii through \n     the Newlands Resolution without the consent of or \n     compensation to the indigenous people of Hawaii or their \n     sovereign government who were thereby denied the mechanism \n     for expression of their inherent sovereignty through self-\n     government and self- determination, their lands and ocean \n     resources.\n       ``(17) Through the Newlands Resolution and the 1900 Organic \n     Act, the Congress received 1,750,000 acres of lands formerly \n     owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom and \n     exempted the lands from then existing public land laws of the \n     United States by mandating that the revenue and proceeds from \n     these lands be ``used solely for the benefit of the \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other \n     public purposes'', thereby establishing a special trust \n     relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of \n     Hawaii.\n       ``(18) In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 which designated 200,000 acres of the \n     ceded public lands for exclusive homesteading by Native \n     Hawaiians, thereby affirming the trust relationship between \n     the United States and the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by \n     then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane who was cited \n     in the Committee Report of the Committee on Territories of \n     the House of Representatives as stating, ``One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     islands . . . for whom in a sense we are trustees, are \n     falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in \n     poverty.''.\n       ``(19) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Native Hawaiian people by including in the Act \n     of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781 et seq.), a provision to lease \n     lands within the extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area ``only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance''.\n       ``(20) Under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship which existed between the United States and the \n     Native Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to \n     enforce the trust, including the power to approve land \n     exchanges, and legislative amendments affecting the rights of \n     beneficiaries under such Act.\n       ``(21) Under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for administration over portions of the ceded \n     public lands trust not retained by the United States to the \n     State of Hawaii but reaffirmed the trust relationship which \n     existed between the United States and the Native Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the legal responsibility of the State for \n     the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians under \n     section 5(f) of such Act.\n       ``(22) The authority of the Congress under the Constitution \n     to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or \n     indigenous peoples of the United States includes the \n     authority to legislate in matters affecting the native \n     peoples of Alaska and Hawaii.\n       ``(23) Further, the United States has recognized the \n     authority of the Native Hawaiian people to continue to work \n     towards an appropriate form of sovereignty as defined by the \n     Native Hawaiian people themselves in provisions set forth in \n     legislation returning the Hawaiian Island of Kaho`olawe to \n     custodial management by the State of Hawaii in 1994.\n       ``(24) In furtherance of the trust responsibility for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United \n     States has established a program for the provision of \n     comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention \n     services to maintain and improve the health status of the \n     Hawaiian people. This program is conducted by the Native \n     Hawaiian Health Care Systems, the Native Hawaiian Health \n     Scholarship Program and Papa Ola Lokahi. Health initiatives \n     from these and other health institutions and agencies using \n     Federal assistance have begun to lower the century-old \n     morbidity and mortality rates of Native Hawaiian people by \n     providing comprehensive disease prevention, health promotion \n     activities and increasing the number of Native Hawaiians in \n     the health and allied health professions. This has been \n     accomplished through the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of \n     1988 (Public Law 100-579) and its reauthorization in section \n     9168 of Public Law 102-396 (106 Stat. 1948).\n       ``(25) This historical and unique legal relationship has \n     been consistently recognized and affirmed by Congress through \n     the enactment of Federal laws which extend to the Native \n     Hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to \n     American Indian,\n\n[[Page S14622]]\n\n     Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities, including the \n     Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 2991 et \n     seq.), the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996), the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.), and the Native American Graves \n     Protection and Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.).\n       ``(26) The United States has also recognized and reaffirmed \n     the trust relationship to the Native Hawaiian people through \n     legislation which authorizes the provision of services to \n     Native Hawaiians, specifically, the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), the Developmental Disabilities \n     Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987, the \n     Veterans` Benefits and Services Act of 1988, the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.), the \n     Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579), \n     the Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988, the \n     Nursing Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of \n     1988, the Handicapped Programs Technical Amendments Act of \n     1988, the Indian Health Care Amendments of 1988, and the \n     Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990.\n       ``(27) The United States has also affirmed the historical \n     and unique legal relationship to the Hawaiian people by \n     authorizing the provision of services to Native Hawaiians to \n     address problems of alcohol and drug abuse under the Anti-\n     Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-570).\n       ``(28) Further, the United States has recognized that \n     Native Hawaiians, as aboriginal, indigenous, native peoples \n     of Hawaii, are a unique population group in Hawaii and in the \n     continental United States and has so declared in Office of \n     Management and Budget Circular 15 in 1997 and Presidential \n     Executive Order No. 13125, dated June 7, 1999.\n       ``(29) Despite the United States having expressed its \n     commitment to a policy of reconciliation with the Native \n     Hawaiian people for past grievances in Public Law 103-150 \n     (107 Stat. 1510) the unmet health needs of the Native \n     Hawaiian people remain severe and their health status \n     continues to be far below that of the general population of \n     the United States.\n       ``(b) Unmet Needs and Health Disparities.--Congress finds \n     that the unmet needs and serious health disparities that \n     adversely affect the Native Hawaiian people include the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Chronic disease and illness.--\n       ``(A) Cancer.--\n       ``(i) In general.--With respect to all cancer--\n\n       ``(I) Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality \n     rates in the State of Hawaii (231.0 out of every 100,000 \n     residents), 45 percent higher than that for the total State \n     population (159.7 out of every 100,000 residents);\n       ``(II) Native Hawaiian males have the highest cancer \n     mortality rates in the State of Hawaii for cancers of the \n     lung, liver and pancreas and for all cancers combined;\n       ``(III) Native Hawaiian females ranked highest in the State \n     of Hawaii for cancers of the lung, liver, pancreas, breast, \n     cervix uteri, corpus uteri, stomach, and rectum, and for all \n     cancers combined;\n       ``(IV) Native Hawaiian males have the highest years of \n     productive life lost from cancer in the State of Hawaii with \n     8.7 years compared to 6.4 years for other males;

A bill to provide a more just and uniform procedure for \nFederal civil forfeitures, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   civil asset forfeiture reform act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I are introducing a \ncivil asset forfeiture reform bill.\n\n  First and foremost, I want to emphasize that civil asset forfeiture \nis an important tool in America's fight against crime and drugs. Last \nyear, the federal government seized nearly $500 million in assets. It \nis vitally important that the fruits of crime and the property used to \ncommit crimes are forfeited to the government. In recent years, \nhowever, there have been numerous examples of civil asset forfeiture \nactions that should not have been taken. While the vast majority of \ncivil asset forfeiture actions are justified, there have been cases in \nwhich government officials did not use good judgment. Some would even \nsay that civil asset forfeiture has been abused in some instances by \noverzealous law enforcement officials.\n  I will mention just a few examples of such imprudent civil forfeiture \nactions. In United States v. $506,231, 125 F.3d 442 (7th Cir. 1997), \nthe court dismissed a forfeiture action involving $506,231 and scolded \nthe government for its conduct. In this case, state authorities \nobtained a warrant to search a pizzeria for stolen goods. During the \nsearch of the restaurant, authorities did not find any stolen goods, \nbut they did discover a large amount of currency. Criminal charges were \nnot filed against the owners of the restaurant. Nevertheless, alleging \nthat the currency was related to narcotics, the federal government \nfiled a civil complaint for forfeiture of the $506,231.\n  Four years after the money was seized, the court dismissed the \nforfeiture complaint and returned the currency to its owner. The court \nfound that the evidence ``does not come close to showing any connection \nbetween the money and narcotics,'' that ``there is no evidence that \ndrug trafficking was going on at the pizzeria,'' and that ``nothing \nties this money to any narcotics activities that the government knew \nabout or charged, or to any crime that was occurring when the \ngovernment attempted to seize the property.'' At the conclusion of the \ncase, the court stated that ``we believe the government's conduct in \nforfeiture cases leaves much to be desired.''\n\n[[Page S14629]]\n\n  Even more disturbing is United States v. $14,665, 33 F. Supp. 2d 47 \n(D. Mass. 1998). In this case, airline officials informed the police \nthat a passenger, Manuel Espinola, was carrying a large amount of \ncurrency in a briefcase. The police questioned Espinola about the \n$14,665 in cash. Espinola, a 23-year-old man who purchased the plane \nticket in his own name, told the police that he and his brother earned \nthe money selling personal care products for a company called Equinox \nInternational. When the police asked Espinola what the money was going \nto be used for, he stated that he was planning to move to Las Vegas and \nintended to use the cash as a down payment on a home. Espinola told \npolice that he did not deposit the currency in a bank because he was \nafraid that it might be attached due to a prior credit problem. \nEspinola also gave the police a pager number of a co-worker who he said \ncould verify his employment and his plans in Las Vegas.\n\n  Based on Espinola's explanation, the police officer seized the money \nbecause the officer believed it was related to purchase narcotics. The \nofficer did not arrest Espinola, who had no criminal record.\n  After the seizure, in an attempt to get his money back, Espinola \nsubmitted documents that largely confirmed his explanation of the \ncurrency, including receipts for personal care products from Equinox \nInternational and copies of a settlement check from a personal injury \nclaim. By contrast, the government offered no additional evidence that \nthe currency was related to drugs and was subject to forfeiture.\n  The court granted summary judgment to Espinola and, in its order, \nharshly criticized the forfeiture action. The court stated: ``Even in \nthe byzantine world of forfeiture law, this case is an example of \noverreaching. The government's showing of probable cause is completely \ninadequate, based on a troubling mix of baseless generalizations, leaps \nof logic or worse, blatant ethnic stereotyping.'' Nearly two years \nafter the police seized his money without any evidence it was related \nto narcotics, the court returned the currency to Espinola.\n  Other federal courts have also criticized federal civil forfeiture \nactions. For example, in 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nstated: ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's \nincreasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes \nand the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.''\n  While I believe that these and other cases prove the need for some \nreform of civil asset forfeiture law, I want to take this opportunity \nto praise federal law enforcement officials. Federal law enforcement \ndoes an outstanding job fighting crime under the most difficult \ncircumstances. In short, Mr. President, I believe that the problems \nwith civil asset forfeiture have much more to do with defects in the \nlaw than with the character or competency of federal law enforcement \nofficials. Senator Leahy and I drafted this bill to improve civil asset \nforfeiture law and ensure the continued use of civil asset forfeiture \nin appropriate cases.\n  The Hatch-Leahy bill makes important improvements to existing law. I \nwill describe a few of these improvements today. The first major reform \nplaces the burden of proof in civil asset forfeiture cases on the \ngovernment throughout the proceeding. Under current law, the government \nis only required to make an initial showing of probable cause that the \nproperty is connected to criminal activity and is thus subject to \nforfeiture. After the government makes this modest showing, the burden \nthen shifts to the property owner to prove that the property was not \ninvolved in criminal activity. Not surprisingly, the fact that the \nproperty owner bears the burden of proving the property is not subject \nto forfeiture has been extensively criticized by the federal judiciary \nand numerous legal commentators. As one federal court that has been \nparticularly critical of civil asset forfeiture noted, placing the \nburden of proof on the property owner is a ``constitutional anomaly.'' \nUnited States v. $49,576, 116 F.3d 425 (9th. Cir. 1997). The court \nin $49,576 even questioned whether requiring a property owner to bear \nthe burden of proof in a civil forfeiture action is constitutional: \n``We would find it surprising were the Constitution to permit such an \nimportant decision to turn on a meager burden of proof like probable \ncause.''\n\n  I, too, believe that placing the burden of proof on the property \nowner contradicts our nation's traditional notions of justice and \nfairness. Under the Hatch-Leahy bill, the government will have the \nburden in civil forfeiture actions to prove by the preponderance of the \nevidence that the property is connected with criminal activity and is \nsubject to forfeiture.\n  Another major reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill involves what is known \nas the cost bond. Under current civil forfeiture law, a property owner \nmust post a cost bond of the lessor of $5,000 or 10 percent of the \nvalue of the property seized in order to contest a seizure of property. \nIt is important to note that the cost bond merely allows the property \nowner to contest the forfeiture. It does not entitle the property owner \nto the return of the property pending trial.\n  I believe that it is fundamentally unfair to require a person to post \na bond in order to be allowed to contest the seizure of property. For \nexample, what if the government required persons who were indicted to \npost a bond to contest the indictment? Such a requirement would be \nunconstitutional under the Sixth Amendment. I believe that requiring a \nproperty owner to post a bond to contest the seizure of property is no \nless objectionable. Such a requirement, Mr. President, seems un-\nAmerican. The framers of our Constitution would be appalled to know \nthat the federal government, after seizing private property, required \nthe property owner to post a bond in order to contest the seizure.\n  The Justice Department argues that the cost bond requirement reduces \nfrivolous claims. To address this concern, the Hatch-Leahy bill \nrequires that a person who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim \nto the property under oath, subject to penalty of perjury. I predict \nthat eliminating the cost bond will produce, at most, minor \ninconveniences because persons who file frivolous claims will be \ndeterred by the substantial legal fees and costs incurred in contesting \nthe forfeiture. After all, who is willing to hire counsel and pay other \nexpenses to litigate a frivolous claim, especially when subject to \npenalty of perjury?\n  Another reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill addresses the situation in \nwhich the government's possession of seized property pending trial \ncauses hardship to the property owner. Under current law, the \ngovernment maintains possession of seized property pending trial even \nif it causes hardship to the property owner. A common example of such \nhardship is where the government seizes an automobile, and the seizure \nprevents the property owner or members of the property owner's family \nfrom getting to and from work pending the forfeiture trial. The Hatch-\nLeahy bill changes current law to allow, but not require, the court to \nrelease property pending trial if the court determines that the \nhardship to the property owner of continued possession by the \ngovernment outweighs the risk that the property will be damaged or \nlost. This is a common sense reform that allows the court to release \nproperty in appropriate cases.\n  Another reform in the Hatch-Leahy bill involves reimbursement of \nattorney fees. The Hatch-Leahy bill awards attorney fees and costs to \nproperty owners who prevail against the government in civil forfeiture \ncases. The costs of contesting a civil forfeiture of property can be \nsubstantial. The award of attorney fees and costs to property owners \nwho prevail against the government in civil forfeiture cases is \njustified because unlike criminal forfeiture actions, the property \nowner is not charged with a crime. Instead, the government proceeds \n``in rem'' against the property. Given that the government does not sue \nor indict the property owner, it is unfair for the property owner to \nhave to incur attorney fees and costs when the government does not \nprevail in civil forfeiture actions.\n\n  The award of attorney fees is also justified because the government \nonly has to prove its case against the property by a preponderance of \nthe evidence. By contrast, the government must prove beyond a \nreasonable doubt that property is subject to forfeiture in\n\n[[Page S14630]]\n\ncriminal forfeiture actions. If the government decides to pursue a \ncivil forfeiture action instead of the more difficult to prove criminal \nforfeiture action, it should be obligated to pay the attorney fees and \ncosts of the property owner when the property owner prevails.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that while the Hatch-Leahy \nCivil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act contains important reforms; it \nretains civil forfeiture as an important tool for law enforcement. In \nfact, the Hatch-Leahy bill is a cautious, responsible reform. Some \nwould even argue that this bill is too modest.\n  A comparison of the reforms enacted by the State of California in \n1993 is instructive. For example, California changed its civil \nforfeiture law to require the government to prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt and achieve a related criminal conviction in most civil asset \nforfeiture cases. The exception to this rule in California involves \nseizures of currency in excess of $25,000. In these cases, the State \nmust prove the currency is subject to forfeiture by clear and \nconvincing evidence. Also, California abolished the cost bond in civil \nforfeiture cases.\n  In short, California's reforms go far beyond anything in the Hatch-\nLeahy bill, but these reforms have not undermined civil asset \nforfeiture as a law enforcement tool. The modest reforms in the Hatch-\nLeahy bill will add much needed protections for property owners at no \nsignificant costs to law enforcement. By making these needed reforms, \nthe Hatch-Leahy bill will preserve civil forfeiture as a law \nenforcement tool for the future.\n  Lastly, I would like to thank Senator Leahy and his staff for their \ntireless effort on this legislation. Senator Leahy has been an advocate \nfor civil asset forfeiture reform for many years. He is one of the \nleading champions of civil liberties in the Senate. This legislation \nwould not have occurred without his interest and persistence, and I \nthank him for his efforts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Among other things, the bill (1) places the \n     burden of proof in civil forfeiture proceedings upon the \n     government, by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) allows \n     for the provision of counsel to indigent claimants where the \n     property at issue is the claimant's primary residence, and \n     where the claimant is represented by court-appointed counsel \n     in connection with a related criminal case; (3) requires the \n     government to pay attorney fees, costs and interest in any \n     civil forfeiture proceeding in which the claimant \n     substantially prevails; (4) eliminates the cost bond \n     requirement; (5) creates a uniform innocent owner defense; \n     (6) allows property owners more time to challenge a seizure; \n     (7) codifies existing practice with respect to Eighth \n     Amendment proportionality review and seizures of real \n     property; (8) permits the pre-adjudication return of property \n     to owners upon a showing of hardship; and (9) allows property \n     owners to sue the government for any damage to their \n     property.\n\n\n                       section-by-section summary\n\n     SEC. 2. CREATION OF GENERAL RULES RELATING TO CIVIL \n                   FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS.\n\n       Creates a new section in federal criminal code (18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 981A) that establishes general rules for virtually all \n     proceedings under a federal civil forfeiture statute.\n       Notice; claim; complaint. Subsection (a) establishes \n     general procedures and deadlines for initiating civil \n     forfeiture proceedings.\n       Paragraph (1) provides that, in general, a Federal law \n     enforcement agency has 60 days to send notice of a seizure of \n     property. A court shall extend the period for sending notice \n     for 60 days upon written ex parte certification by the \n     seizing agency that notice may have an adverse result. If the \n     government fails to send notice, it must return the property, \n     without prejudice to the right of the Government to commence \n     a forfeiture proceeding at a later time.\n       Paragraph (2) allows property owners more time to challenge \n     a seizure. Any person claiming an interest in seized property \n     may file a claim not later than the deadline set forth in a \n     personal notice letter, except that if such letter is not \n     received, then a claim may be filed not later than 30 days \n     after the date of final publication of notice of seizure. \n     Claims shall be made under oath, subject to penalty of \n     perjury. No cost bond need be posted.\n       Paragraph (3) allows the government 90 days after a claim \n     has been filed to file a complaint for forfeiture or return \n     the property, except that a court may extend the time for \n     filing a complaint for good cause shown or upon agreement of \n     the parties. If the government does not comply with this \n     rule, it may not take further action to effect forfeiture of \n     the property.\n       Paragraph (4) provides that any person claiming an interest \n     in seized property must file a claim in court not later than \n     30 days after service of the government's complaint or, where \n     applicable, not later than 30 days after final publication of \n     notice of seizure. A claimant must file an answer to the \n     government's complaint within 20 days of the filing of such \n     claim.\n       Appointment of counsel. Subsection (b) permits a court to \n     appoint counsel to represent an indigent claimant in a \n     judicial civil forfeiture proceeding if the property subject \n     to forfeiture is real property used by the claimant as a \n     primary residence, or the claimant is already represented by \n     a court-appointed attorney in connection with a related \n     Federal criminal case.\n       Burden of proof. Subsection (c) shifts the burden of proof \n     in civil asset forfeiture cases to the government, by a \n     preponderance of the evidence. It also makes clear that the \n     government may use evidence gathered after the filing of a \n     complaint to meet that burden of proof.\n       Innocent owner. Subsection (d) codifies a uniform innocent \n     owner defense. With respect to a property interest in \n     existence at the time the illegal conduct giving rise to \n     forfeiture took place, ``innocent owner'' means an owner who \n     did not know of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture or who, \n     upon learning of such conduct, did all that reasonably could \n     be expected under the circumstances to terminate such use of \n     the property. With respect to a property interest acquired \n     after the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture has taken \n     place, ``innocent owner'' means a person who, at the time \n     that person acquired the interest in property, was a bona \n     fide purchaser or seller for value and reasonably without \n     cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture \n     or, in limited circumstances involving a principal residence, \n     a spouse or legal dependent.\n       Motion to set aside declaration of forfeiture. Subsection \n     (e) provides that a person who was entitled to notice of a \n     nonjudicial civil forfeiture who did not receive such notice \n     may file a motion to set aside a declaration of forfeiture \n     with respect to his or her interest in the property. This \n     subsection codifies current case law holding that such motion \n     must be filed not later than 6 years after the date that the \n     claimant discovered or had reason to discover that the \n     property was forfeited, but in no event more than 11 years \n     after the government's cause of action in forfeiture \n     accrued. The common law doctrine of laches applies to any \n     motion made under this subsection. If such motion is \n     granted, the government has 60 days to reinstitute \n     proceedings against the property.\n       Release of property to avoid hardship. Subsection (f) \n     entitles a claimant to immediate release of seized property \n     in certain cases of hardship. Among other things, the \n     claimant must have sufficient ties to the community to \n     provide assurance that the property will be available at the \n     time of the trial, the claimant's likely hardship from such \n     continued possession outweighs the risk that the property \n     will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred \n     if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the \n     preceding. Hardship return of property does not apply to \n     contraband, currency, electronic funds, property that is \n     evidence of a crime, property that is specially designed to \n     use in a crime, or any other item likely to be used to commit \n     additional crimes if returned.\n       Proportionality review. Subsection (g) implements United \n     States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321 (1998), which held that a \n     punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause of \n     the Eighth Amendment if it is grossly disproportionate to the \n     gravity of the offense.\n\n     SEC. 3. COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGE TO SEIZED PROPERTY.\n\n       Amends the federal Tort Claims Act to apply to claims based \n     on injury or loss of property while in the possession of the \n     government, if the property was seized for the purpose of \n     forfeiture but the interest of the claimant was not \n     forfeited.\n\n     SEC. 4. ATTORNEY FEES, COSTS AND INTEREST.\n\n       Amends 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2465 to provide that, with limited \n     exceptions, in any civil proceeding to forfeit property in \n     which the claimant substantially prevails, the United States \n     shall be liable for (1) reasonable attorney fees and other \n     litigation costs reasonably incurred by the claimant; (2) \n     post-judgment interest; and (3) in cases involving currency, \n     negotiable instruments, or the proceeds of an interlocutory \n     sale, any interest actually paid to the United States, or \n     imputed interest (except where the property was in use as \n     evidence or for testing).\n\n     SEC. 5. SEIZURE WARRANT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981(b) to require that seizures be \n     made pursuant to a warrant obtained in the same manner as \n     provided for a search warrant under the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure, with limited exceptions.\n\n     SEC. 6. CIVIL FORFEITURE OF REAL PROPERTY.\n\n       Implements United States v. James Daniel Good Real \n     Property, 510 U.S. 43 (1993), which held that real property \n     may not be seized, except in exigent circumstances, without \n     giving a property owner notice of the proposed seizure and an \n     opportunity for an adversarial hearing. All forfeitures of \n     real property must proceed as judicial forfeitures. Real \n     property may be seized before entry of an order of forfeiture \n     only if notice has been served on the property owner and the \n     court determines that there is probable cause for the \n     forfeiture, or if the court makes an ex parte determination \n     that there is probable cause for the forfeiture and exigent \n     circumstances justify immediate seizure without a pre-seizure \n     hearing.\n\n     SEC. 7. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       Provides that all changes in the bill apply prospectively.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, asset forfeiture is a powerful crime-\nfighting tool. It has been a particularly potent weapon in the war on \ndrugs, allowing the government to take the cars and boats and stash \nhouses amassed by drug dealers and put them to honest use. Last year \nalone, the government was able to seize nearly half a billion dollars \nworth of assets, cutting a big chunk out of criminals' profit stream \nand returning it to the law-abiding community.\n  Unfortunately, our nation's asset forfeiture is not fail-safe; it can \nbe abused. In hearings on this issue, the Judiciary Committee has heard \nexamples of what happens when prosecutorial zeal skirts the boundaries \nof due process, leading to the taking of private property regardless of \nwhether the owner is innocent of, or even cognizant of, the property's \nuse in an illegal act.\n  In recent years, our nation's asset forfeiture system has drawn \nincreasing and exceedingly sharp criticism from scholars and \ncommentators. Federal judges have also added their voices to the \ngrowing chorus of concern. In 1992, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nstated, ``We continue to be enormously troubled by the government's \nincreasing and virtually unchecked use of the civil forfeiture statutes \nand the disregard for due process that is buried in those statutes.'' \nFour years later, the Eighth Circuit rebuked the government for \ncapitalizing on the claimants' confusion to forfeit over $70,000 of \ntheir currency, and expressed alarm that:\n\n       the war on drugs has brought us to the point where the \n     government may seize . . . a citizen's property without any \n     initial showing of cause, and put the onus on the citizen to \n     perfectly navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth in order to \n     liberate what is presumptively his or hers in the first \n     place. . . .\n\n[[Page S14634]]\n\n     Should the citizen prove inept, the government may keep the \n     property, without ever having to justify or explain its \n     actions.\n\n  Similarly, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed its belief that \n``the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be \ndesired,'' and ordered the return of over $500,000 in currency that had \nbeen improperly seized from a Chicago pizzeria.\n  Civil asset forfeiture rests upon the medieval notion that property \nis somehow guilty when it causes harm to another. The notion of \n``guilty property'' is what enables the government to seize property \nregardless of the guilt or innocence of the property owner. In many \nasset forfeiture cases, the person whose property is taken is never \ncharged with any crime.\n  The ``guilty property'' notion also explains the topsy-turvy nature \nof today's civil forfeiture proceedings, in which the property owner--\nnot the government--bears the burden of proof. Under current law, all \nthe government must do is make an initial showing of probable cause \nthat the property is ``guilty'' and subject to forfeiture; it is then \nup to the property owner to prove a negative--that the property was not \ninvolved in any wrongdoing.\n\n  It is time to reexamine the obsolete underpinnings of our civil \nforfeiture laws and bring these laws in line with more modern \nprinciples of due process and fair play. We must be especially careful \nto ensure that innocent property owners are adequately protected.\n  The Hatch-Leahy Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act provides greater \nsafeguards for individuals whose property has been seized by the \ngovernment. It incorporates all of the core reforms of H.R. 1658, which \npassed the House of Representatives in June by an overwhelming \nbipartisan majority. The Hatch-Leahy bill also includes a number of \nadditional reforms which, among other things, establish a fair and \nuniform procedure for forfeiting real property, and entitle property \nowners to challenge a forfeiture as constitutionally excessive.\n  During our hearing this year on civil asset forfeiture reform, the \nJustice Department and other law enforcement organizations expressed \nconcern that some of the reforms included in the House bill would \ninterfere with the government's ability to combat crime. The bill we \nintroduce today addresses the legitimate concerns of law enforcement. \nIn particular, the bill puts the burden of proof on the government by a \npreponderance of the evidence, and not by clear and convincing \nevidence. The preponderance standard is used in virtually all other \ncivil cases, and we believe it is sufficient to protect the interests \nof property owners.\n  We have also removed provisions in H.R. 1658 that would allow \ncriminals to leave their ill-gotten gains to their heirs, and would bar \nthe government from forfeiting property if it inadvertently sent notice \nof a seizure to the wrong address. These provisions did little more \nthan create procedural ``gotchas'' for criminals and their heirs, and \nare neither necessary nor desirable as a matter of policy.\n  The Hatch-Leahy bill also differs from the House bill in its approach \nto the issue of appointed counsel. Under H.R. 1658, anyone asserting an \ninterest in seized property could apply for a court-appointed lawyer. \nThere is no demonstrated need for such an unprecedented extension of \nthe right to counsel, nor is there any principled distinction between \ndefendants in civil forfeiture actions and defendants in other federal \nenforcement actions who are not eligible for court-appointed counsel. \nMoreover, property owners who are indigent may be eligible to obtain \nrepresentation through various legal aid clinics.\n  The Hatch-Leahy bill authorizes courts to appoint counsel for \nindigent claimants in just two limited circumstances. First, a court \nmay appoint counsel in the handful of forfeiture cases in which the \nproperty at issue is the claimant's primary residence. When a \nforfeiture action can result in a claimant's eviction and homelessness, \nthere is more at stake than just a property interest, and it is fair \nand just that the claimant be provided with an attorney if she cannot \notherwise afford one. Second, if a claimant is already represented by a \ncourt-appointed attorney in a related federal criminal case, the court \nmay authorize that attorney to represent the claimant in the civil \nforfeiture action. This is both fair and efficient, and eliminates any \nappearance that the government chose to pursue the forfeiture in a \ncivil proceeding rather than as part of the criminal case in order to \ndeprive the claimant of his right to counsel.\n\n  For claimants who were not appointed counsel by the court, the Hatch-\nLeahy bill allows for the recovery of reasonable attorney fees and \ncosts if they substantially prevail in court. The bill also makes the \ngovernment liable for post-judgment interest on any money judgment, and \nimputed interest in certain cases involving currency or negotiable \ninstruments.\n  Another core reform of the Hatch-Leahy bill is the elimination of the \nso-called ``cost bond.'' Under current law, a property owner that seeks \nto recover his property after it has been seized by the government must \npay for privilege by posting a bond with the court. The government has \nstrongly defended the ``cost bond,'' not as a device for ensuring that \nits court costs are covered, but as a way of deterring frivolous \nclaims. Of course, we are all in favor of deterring frivolous claims, \nbut there are ways to deter frivolous claims without offending the \nfundamental principle of equal and open access to the courts, a bedrock \nof our American system of justice. The Hatch-Leahy bill provides that a \nperson who challenges a forfeiture must file his claim on oath, under \npenalty of perjury. Claimants also remain subject to the general \nsanctions for bad faith in instituting or conducting litigation. \nFurther, most claimants will continue to bear the substantial costs of \nlitigating their claims in court. The additional financial burden of \nthe ``cost bond'' serves no legitimate purpose.\n  Under current law, a property owner has only 20 days from the date of \nfirst publication of the notice of seizure to file a claim challenging \nan administrative forfeiture, and only 10 days to file a claim \nchallenging a judicial forfeiture. It is therefore unlikely that anyone \nwho misses the first of three published notices will be able to file a \ntimely claim. The Hatch-Leahy bill extends the property owner's time to \nfile a claim following administrative and judicial forfeiture actions \nto 30 days. The bill also codifies current Department of Justice policy \nwith respect to the time period for sending notice of seizure, and \nestablishes a 90-day period for filing a complaint. The bill leaves \nundisturbed current laws and procedures with respect to the proper form \nand content of notices, claims and complaints.\n  Finally, the Hatch-Leahy bill will allow property owners to hold on \nto their property while a case in process, if they can show that \ncontinued possession of the government will cause substantial hardship \nto the owner, such as preventing him from working, and that this \nhardship outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed or \nconcealed if returned to the owner during the pendency of the case. \nUnlike H.R. 1658, the Hatch-Leahy bill adopts the primary safeguards \nthat the Justice Department wanted added to the provision--that \nproperty owners must have sufficient ties to the community to provide \nassurance that the property will not disappear and that certain \nproperty, such as currency and property particularly suited for use in \nillegal activities, cannot be returned. As amended, the hardship \nprovision in the Hatch-Leahy bill is substantially similar to the \nhardship provision in another civil asset forfeiture bill, S. 1701, \nwhich the Justice Department has endorsed.\n  The fact is, the Justice Department has endorsed most of the core \nreforms contained in the Hatch-Leahy bill. Indeed, the Department has \nalready taken administrative steps to remedy many of the civil \nforfeiture abuses identified in recent years by the federal courts. For \nthis, the Department is to be commended. But administrative policy can \nbe modified on the whim of whoever is in charge, and the law remains \nsusceptible to abuse.\n  It is time for Congress to catch up with the Justice Department and \nthe courts on this important issue. Due to internecine fighting among \nlaw enforcement officials whose views Congress always wants to take \ninto consideration, action on civil forfeiture reform has been delayed \nfor far too long. The Hatch-Leahy bill strikes the appropriate middle \nground between the\n\n[[Page S14635]]\n\nHouse bill and S. 1701, providing comprehensive and meaningful reform \nwhile ensuring the continued potency of civil asset forfeiture in the \nwar on crime.\n  Senator Hatch and I share a longstanding and deeply-held appreciation \nfor law enforcement and the officers who work on the front lines to \nprotect our families and communities, and we have worked together on a \nnumber of crime-related issues in the past. I want to commend him for \nhis commitment, not just to law enforcement, but to the rights of all \nAmericans. It has been my pleasure to work with him on this issue, to \nbring balance back in the relationship between our police forces and \nthe citizens of this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1932. A bill to amend the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act of \n1998 to revise and extend certain provisions; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   the ricky ray fairness act of 1999\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, last year Congress passed and the \nPresident signed a significant measure that will, as funds are \nprovided, provide compassionate compensation payments to hundreds of \nindividuals. Public Law 105-369, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act of \n1998, authorizes payments for hemophiliacs treated with blood products \ninfected with HIV during the 1980s as well as their infected spouses \nand children. Last year, Mr. President, you and I, and all of our \ncolleagues gave our unanimous consent to this measure because we all \nknew it was the right thing to do. But we accomplished only part of the \njob. We provided compassionate compensation to only a portion of the \nAmericans who, through indecisiveness and inaction on the part of \nfederal government, became infected with HIV. So today I am introducing \nlegislation that will set the record straight and finish what needs to \nbe done, and I hope that our colleagues will once again in the name of \nfairness and compassion give this measure their unanimous support.\n  I am on the floor today to introduce legislation that will bring much \nneeded fairness to hundreds of our citizens. This bill, the Ricky Ray \nFairness Act of 1999 will finally include those people, other than \nhemophiliacs, who were infected with HIV and contracted AIDS through \nHIV contaminated blood products or tissues.\n  The blood crisis of the 1980s resulted in the HIV infection of \nthousands of Americans who trusted that the blood or blood product with \nwhich they were treated was safe. The tragedy of the blood supply's \ncontamination has brought unbearable pain to families all over the \ncountry. I have heard from dozens over the past months. These are \npeople like any of us--like our children and our grandchildren--who \nwent to hospitals for standard procedures, emergency care, or were \ntransfused due to complications in childbirth. Many children and adults \nwere secondarily infected: children through childbirth or HIV-infected \nbreast milk and adults through their spouses. Lives were lost and \nfutures were ruined. Not only were there physical and emotional costs, \nbut there exists a tremendous drain on personal finances as a result of \nlost income and extreme medical expenses. In the minds of these and in \nthe minds of members who advocated for the Ricky Ray bill, the federal \ngovernment played the determining role in the tragedy.\n  Mr President, these people were infected with HIV because the federal \ngovernment failed to protect the blood supply during the mid-1980s when \nit did not use its regulatory authority to implement a wide range of \nblood and blood-donor screening options recommended by the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention. Had the federal government taken the \nrecommendations of the CDC, thousands of American men, women and \nchildren would not have contracted AIDS through HIV-contaminated blood \nand blood products.\n  Sadly, and unfairly, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund Act as \npassed last year does not include all victims of the blood supply \ncrisis. I feel strongly that the Act must be amended to include \ncompensation for not only hemophiliacs, but also people who received a \nblood transfusion or blood product in the course of medical treatment. \nThough it was right for us to pass the Ricky Ray Act last year, it \nremains an inequity and a tragedy that the federal government did so \nwithout including victims of transfusion-associated AIDS.\n  Unlike a few individuals, most people infected with HIV through blood \nand blood products have been unable to track the source of their \ninfection; nor have they been able to obtain some judicial relief \nthrough the courts. The community hit by this tragedy has found it \nnearly impossible to make recovery through the courts because of blood \nshield laws in most states that raise the burden of proof for product \nliability claims for blood and blood products. In addition, all States \nhave statutes of limitations that prohibit litigation if the suit was \nnot filed within a certain period of time.\n  I am introducing today what can be the final chapter in our Country's \nresponsibility for not adequately protecting the blood supply during \nthe 1980s. The Ricky Ray Fairness Act of 1999 provides compassionate \npayments to those infected with HIV contaminated blood, blood \ncomponents, or human tissues. While the change to include transfusion \ncases increases the cost of this bill, many have already noted that \nthis bill is not about money, it's about fairness. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in recognizing the terrible tragedy the blood supply crisis \nof the 1980s cast upon all of its victims.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1934. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for business-provided student education and training; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       THE BUSINESSES EDUCATING STUDENTS IN TECHNOLOGY (BEST) ACT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, that addresses the \nserious shortage of students graduating from our nation's colleges and \nuniversities with technology-based education and skills.\n  Technology is reshaping our world at a rapid pace. Competition to \nmeet the needs, wants, and expectations of businesses and consumers has \naccelerated the rate of technological progress to a level inconceivable \neven a few years ago. Today, technology is playing an increasingly \nimportant role in the lives of every American and is a key ingredient \nin sustaining America's economic growth. It is the wellspring from \nwhich new businesses, high-wage jobs, and a rising quality of life will \nflow in the 21st century.\n  This profound technological change, coupled with a period of \nsustained fiscal discipline in the federal government, has led to an \nunprecedented period of economic growth in our nation. For the first \ntime in three decades, we are enjoying the prospect of budget surpluses \nthat could total one trillion dollars over the next ten years. We have \nthe lowest unemployment in 29 years. Inflation has fallen to its lowest \nrate in almost 30 years. Our economy has created 20 million new jobs in \nthe last seven years.\n  If we want to build on this progress, we must encourage people to \ndevelop and use emerging technologies. Technological progress has \nbecome the single most important determining factor in sustaining \neconomic growth in our economy. It is estimated that technological \ninnovation has accounted for as much as half the nation's long-term \neconomic growth over the past 50 years and is expected to account for \nan even higher percentage in the next 50 years.\n  And yet, there is growing evidence that we are not doing enough to \nprepare people to make the most of this emerging ``New Economy.'' The \nexplosive growth in the technology industry has resulted in a growing \nshortage of qualified and educated workers with skills in computer \nscience and other technologically advanced systems. For example, more \nthan 350,000 information technology positions are currently vacant \nthroughout the United States. That is an astounding statistic. While we \nhave managed to erase the budget deficit, our nation faces a rising \nknowledge deficit that could just as readily impede economic growth.\n  At this moment, there is little sign that this technology deficit \nwill be erased. The supply of technology-savvy U.S. college graduates \nappears to be on the wane. In my home state of Connecticut, public and \nprivate colleges\n\n[[Page S14636]]\n\ncombined produced only 297 computer and information science graduates \nin 1997, a 50 percent decline since 1987. The decline in students \nreceiving engineering degrees is even more troubling. From 1989 to \n1999, the number of Connecticut students graduating in this field has \ndecreased by 65 percent.\n  This trend is not limited to any one state; it is nationwide in \nscope. The number of graduates receiving bachelor of science degrees in \nengineering has fallen to a 17-year low of 19.8 percent. Between 1990 \nand 1996, the number of students obtaining high-tech degrees declined \nby 5 percent. These are clearly trends that must be reversed if we wish \nto continue building upon the technological achievements we have \nalready made and ensure that our economy can continue to grow and \ncreate jobs to its full potential.\n\n  Indeed, at large and mid-sized companies, there is already one \nvacancy for every 10 information technology jobs, and eight out of 10 \ncompanies expect to hire information technology workers in the year \nahead. Over the next decade, the Department of Commerce estimates that \n1.3 million new jobs will be created for systems analysts, computer \nengineers, and computer scientists. Moreover, by 2006, nearly half of \nthe U.S. workforce will be employed by industries that are either \nproducers or significant users of technology products and services.\n  Clearly, we must do more to eliminate this shortage of \ntechnologically skilled workers. Some have suggested stop-gap measures \nsuch as extending more visas to foreign nationals who possess the \nskills most in demand here in the United States. More important than \nsteps such as this are efforts to promote technology-based learning \namong American students. In Connecticut, many businesses are making \nsuch efforts. They are establishing scholarships, donating lab \nequipment and computers, planning curricula, and sending employees into \ncolleges and universities to instruct and help prepare students for \ntechnology-based jobs.\n  For instance, one Connecticut company, the Bayer Corporation, has \ncommitted $1.1 million to the University of New Haven over six years to \nhelp increase the effectiveness of its science curriculum. This \npartnership includes the donation of equipment, scholarships, \ninternships, and other efforts that seek to engage students more \nactively in science and technology.\n  Another positive example of cooperation between business and academic \ninstitutions in Connecticut is the support provided to the \nbiotechnology program at Middlesex Community-Technical College by the \nBristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute and the Curagen \nCorporation. These companies, too, have established scholarships, \ndonated lab equipment, and encouraged their research scientists to give \nlectures to students.\n  While these partnerships do exist in Connecticut, and indeed, across \nthe country, businesses and academic institutions should not be left to \ntackle alone the challenge of helping students obtain the technological \nlearning and skills they need to succeed in the new century. The Senate \nhas before it the opportunity to assist in this effort, to encourage \nthe growth of innovation and education, and to address the shortage of \nskilled high-tech workers so vital to our continued technological and \neconomic growth.\n  That is why I am pleased to have the opportunity today to introduce \nlegislation that will encourage businesses to form partnerships with \ninstitutions of higher learning in order to improve technology-based \nlearning so that more of our nation's students will be better prepared \nto fill the jobs of the 21st century.\n  The ``Businesses Educating Students in Technology,'' or BEST Act, \nwill give a tax credit to any business that joins with a university, \ncollege, or community-technical school to support technology-based \neducational activities which are directly related to the purpose of \nthat business. The legislation would allow businesses to claim a tax \ncredit for 40 percent of these educational expenses, up to a maximum of \n$100,000 for any one company.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that this tax credit will provide the \nincentive for more of our country's corporate leaders to take a more \nactive role in the technological education, training, and skill \ndevelopment of our nation's most valuable resource--its students.\n  If businesses take advantage of this credit, they will help create a \nlarger pool of skilled workers to draw from and, in turn, help our \nnation foster a better educated population that possesses the knowledge \nto succeed in the information-based economy of the future.\n  I hope my colleagues join me and Senator Bennett in supporting this \nimportant legislation. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Businesses Educating \n     Students in Technology (BEST) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Technological progress is the single most important \n     determining factor in sustaining growth in the Nation's \n     economy. It is estimated that technological innovation has \n     accounted for as much as half the Nation's long-term economic \n     growth over the past 50 years and will account for an even \n     higher percentage in the next 50 years.\n       (2) The number of jobs requiring technological expertise is \n     growing rapidly. For example, it is estimated that 1,300,000 \n     new computer engineers, programmers, and systems analysts \n     will be needed over the next decade in the United States \n     economy. Yet, our Nation's computer science programs are only \n     graduating 25,000 students with bachelor's degrees yearly.\n       (3) There are more than 350,000 information technology \n     positions currently unfilled throughout the United States, \n     and the number of students graduating from colleges with \n     computer science degrees has declined dramatically.\n       (4) In order to help alleviate the shortage of graduates \n     with technology-based education and skills, businesses in a \n     number of States have formed partnerships with colleges, \n     universities, community-technical schools, and other \n     institutions of higher learning to give lectures, donate \n     equipment, plan curricula, and perform other activities \n     designed to help students acquire the skills and knowledge \n     needed to fill jobs in technology-based industries.\n       (5) Congress should encourage these partnerships by \n     providing a tax credit to businesses that enter into them. \n     Such a tax credit will help students obtain the knowledge and \n     skills they need to obtain jobs in technology-based \n     industries which are among the best paying jobs being created \n     in the economy. The credit will also assist businesses in \n     their efforts to develop a more highly-skilled, better \n     trained workforce that can fill the technology jobs such \n     businesses are creating.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of community attendant services and supports under \nthe Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       the medicaid community attendant services and support act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Arlen Specter, I \nam introducing the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports \nAct. Our bill allows people to have a real choice about where they \nreceive certain types of Medicaid long term services and supports. It \nalso provides grants to the States to assist them as they redirect \nMedicaid resources into community-based services and supports.\n  We all know that given a real choice, most Americans who need long \nterm services and supports would rather remain in their own homes and \ncommunities than go to a nursing home. Older people want to stay in \ntheir homes; parents want to keep their children with disabilities \nclose by; and adults with disabilities want to live in the community.\n  And yet, even though many people prefer home and community services \nand supports, our current long term care program favors institutional \nprograms. Under our current Medicaid system, a person has a right to \nthe most expensive form of care, a nursing home bed, because nursing \nhome care is an entitlement. But if that same person wants to live in \nthe community, he or she is likely to encounter a lack of available \nservices, because community services are optional under Medicaid. The \ndeck is stacked against community living, and the purpose of our bill \nis to level the playing field and give people a real choice.\n  Our bill would allow any person entitled to medical assistance in a \nnursing facility or an intermediate care facility to use the money for \ncommunity attendant services and supports. Those services and supports \ninclude help with eating, bathing, brooming, toileting, transferring in \nand out of a wheelchair, meal planning and preparation, shopping, \nhousehold chores, using the telephone, participating in the community, \nand health-related functions like taking pills, bowel and bladder care, \nand tube feeding. In short, personal assistance services and supports \nhelp people do tasks that they would do them selves, if they did not \nhave a disability.\n  Personal assistance services and supports are the lowest-cost and \nmost consumer friendly services in the long-term care spectrum. They \ncan be provided by a variety of people, including friends and neighbors \nof the recipient. In many instances, with supervision, the consumer can \ndirect his or her own care and manage his or her own attendants. This \ncuts down on expensive administrative overhead and the current practice \nof relying on medical personnel such as nurses to coordinate a person's \ncare. States can save money and redirect medically-oriented care to \nthose who need it most.\n  Not only is home and community-based care what people want, it can \nalso be far less expensive. There is a wide variation in the cost of \nsupporting people with disabilities in the community because \nindividuals have different levels of need. But, for the average person, \nthe annual cost of home and community based services is less than one-\nhalf the average cost of  institutional care. In 1997, Medicaid spent \n$56 billion on long term care. Out of that $56 billion, $42.5 billion \nwas spent on nursing home and institutional care. This paid for a \nlittle over 1 million people. In comparison, only $13.5 billion was \nspent on home and community-based care--but this money paid for almost \n2 million people. Community services make sound, economic sense.\n\n  In fact, the States are out ahead of us here in Washington on this \nissue. Thirty States are now providing the personal care optional \nbenefit through their Medicaid programs. Almost every State offers at \nleast one home and community based Medicaid waiver program. Indeed, \nthis is one of Senator Chafee's most important legacies. He was ahead \nof his time.\n  The States have realized that community based care is both popular \nand cost effective, and personal assistance services and supports are a \nkey component of a successful program.\n  And yet there are several reasons why we have to do more.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus that Americans \nwith disabilities should have the equal opportunity to contribute to \nour communities and participate in our society as full citizens. \nInstead, our current Federal Medicaid policy favors exclusion over \nintegration, and dependence over self-determination. This legislation \nwill bring Medicaid policy in line with our broader agreement that \nAmericans with disabilities should have the chance to move toward \nindependence. This bill allows people to receive certain types of \nservices in the community so that they don't have to sacrifice their \nfull participation in society simply because they require a catheter, \nassistance with medication, or some other basic service.\n  Take the example of a friend of mine in Iowa. Dan Piper works at a \nhardware store. He has his own apartment and just bought a VCR. He also \nhas Down's syndrome and diabetes. For years Dan has received services \nthrough a community waiver program. But, he recently learned that he \nmight not be\n\n[[Page S14638]]\n\nable to receive some basic services under the waiver. The result of \nthis decision? He may have to sacrifice his independence for services. \nToday, Dan works and contributes to the economy as both a wage earner \nand a consumer. But, tomorrow, he may be forced into a nursing home, \nfar from his roommate, his job, and his family.\n  In addition, our country is facing a long-term care crisis of epic \nproportions in the not-too distant future. We all talk about the coming \nSocial Security shortfall and the Medicare shortfall, but we do not \ntalk about the long-term care shortfall. The truth is that our current \nlong-term care system will be inadequate to deal with the aging of the \nbaby boom generation, the oldest of whom are now turning 60. Our bill \nhelps to create the infrastructure we will need to create the high-\nquality, community based long term care system of the future. And it \nwill give families the small amount of outside help they need to \ncontinue providing care to their loved ones at home.\n  And, finally, in a common sense decision last June, the Supreme Court \nfound that, to the extent Medicaid dollars are used to pay for a \nperson's long term care, that person has a right to receive those \nservices in the most integrated setting. States must take practical \nsteps to avoid unjustified institutionalization by offering individuals \nwith disabilities the supports they need to live in the community. We \nin Congress have a responsibility to help States meet the financial \ncosts associated with serving people with disabilities that want to \nleave institutions and live in the community, and the bill I am \nintroducing will provide that help.\n  And so I call upon my colleagues for your support. Millions of \nAmericans require some assistance to help them eat, dress, go to the \nbathroom, clean house, move from bed to wheelchair, remember to take \nmedication, and to perform other activities that make it possible for \nthem to live at home. These Americans live in every State and every \ncongressional district. Most of these people have depended on unpaid \ncaregivers--usually family members--for their needs. But a number of \nfactors have affected the ability of family members to help. A growing \nnumber of elderly people need assistance, and aging parents will no \nlonger be able to care for their adult children with disabilities.\n  But they all have one thing in common with every American. We all \ndeserve to live in our own homes, and be an integral part of our \nfamilies, our neighborhoods, our communities. Community attendant \nservices and supports allow people with disabilities to lead richer, \nfuller lives, perhaps have a job, and participate in the community. \nSome will become taxpayers, some will do volunteer work, some will get \nan education, some will participate in recreational and other community \nactivities. All will experience a better quality of life, and a better \nchance to take part in the American dream.\n  I urge my colleagues and their staff to study our proposal over the \nbreak. I hope there will be hearings and action on this bill next year. \nAnd, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, along with letters \nin support of the bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1935\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicaid Community Attendant \n     Services and Supports Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many studies have found that an overwhelming majority \n     of individuals with disabilities needing long-term services \n     and supports would prefer to receive them in home and \n     community-based settings rather than in institutions. \n     However, research on the provision of long-term services and \n     supports under the medicaid program (conducted by and on \n     behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has \n     revealed a significant bias toward funding these services in \n     institutional rather than home and community-based settings. \n     The extent of this bias is indicated by the fact that 75 \n     percent of medicaid funds for long-term services and supports \n     are expended in nursing homes and intermediate care \n     facilities for the mentally retarded while approximately 25 \n     percent of such funds pays for services in home and \n     community-based settings.\n       (2) Because of this bias, significant numbers of \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages who would prefer to \n     live in the community and could do so with community \n     attendant services and supports are forced to live in \n     unnecessarily segregated institutional settings if they want \n     to receive needed services and supports. Benefit packages \n     provided in these settings are medically-oriented and \n     constitute barriers to the receipt of the types of services \n     individuals need and want. Decisions regarding the provision \n     of services and supports are too often influenced by what is \n     reimbursable rather than by what individuals need and want.\n       (3) There is a growing recognition that disability is a \n     natural part of the human experience that in no way \n     diminishes an individual's right to--\n       (A) live independently;\n       (B) enjoy self-determination;\n       (C) make choices;\n       (D) contribute to society; and\n       (E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the mainstream \n     of American society.\n       (4) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     medicaid program must meet the evolving and changing needs \n     and preferences of individuals with disabilities, including \n     the preferences for living within one's own home or living \n     with one's own family and becoming productive members of the \n     community.\n       (5) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     individuals with disabilities with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize social functioning in \n     the home and community.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To provide that States shall offer community attendant \n     services and supports for eligible individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States to support \n     systems change initiatives that are designed to assist each \n     State in developing and enhancing a comprehensive consumer-\n     responsive statewide system of long-term services and \n     supports that provides real consumer choice and direction \n     consistent with the principle that services and supports \n     should be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate \n     to meeting the unique needs of the individual.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that all \n     programs, projects, and activities receiving assistance under \n     this Act shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the \n     following principles:\n       (1) Individuals with disabilities, or, as appropriate, \n     their representatives, must be empowered to exercise real \n     choice in selecting long-term services and supports that are \n     of high quality, cost-effective, and meet the unique needs of \n     the individual in the most integrated setting appropriate.\n       (2) No individual should be forced into an institution to \n     receive services that can be effectively and efficiently \n     delivered in the home or community.\n       (3) Federal and State policies, practices, and procedures \n     should facilitate and be responsive to, and not impede, an \n     individual's choice in selecting long-term services and \n     supports.\n       (4) Individuals and their families receiving long-term \n     services and supports must be involved in decisionmaking \n     about their own care and be provided with sufficient \n     information to make informed choices.\n\n     SEC. 3.

TASK FORCE ON FINANCING OF LONG-TERM CARE SERVICES.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish \n     a task force to examine appropriate methods for financing \n     long-term services and supports. The task force shall include \n     significant representation of individuals (and \n     representatives of individuals) who receive such services and \n     supports.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Council on\n\n\n                                           Independent Living,\n\n                                 Arlington, VA, November 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, The National Council on Independent \n     Living (NCIL) applauds your leadership in introducing the \n     Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act \n     (MiCASSA).\n       NCIL is the national membership organization for centers \n     for independent living and people with disabilities. Our \n     membership includes individuals and organizations from each \n     of the 50 states. As a leading national, cross-disability, \n     grassroots organization run by and for people with \n     disabilities, NCIL has been instrumental in efforts to \n     advance the rights and opportunities for all Americans with \n     disabilities.\n       The members of NCIL have wholeheartedly endorsed MiCASSA, \n     have selected its passage as one of our top priorities. We \n     join with our colleagues from ADAPT, who are leading the \n     national effort to pass MiCASSA. There is nothing more \n     important to our members than real choice for people with \n     disabilities. Passage of MiCASSA will create the critical \n     systems change needed for people with disabilities to enjoy \n     the freedom of real choice in services and supports. This \n     will allow people with disabilities to finally enjoy their \n     civil right to live in their own homes, free from isolation \n     and segregation in nursing homes and institutions.\n       We thank you for your vision and for your willingness to \n     lead the effort to achieve freedom for our people. You can \n     count on NCIL to work alongside you as we give our finest \n     efforts towards passage of MiCASSA at the very beginning of \n     the new millennium.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n     Paul Spooner,\n       President.\n     Mike Oxford,\n     Vice President and Chair, Personal Assistance Services Sub-\n     Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       The Association of Programs\n\n\n                                 for Rural independent Living,\n\n                                      Kent, OH, November 12, 1999.\n     Senator Tom Harkin, Iowa,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Honorable Senator, It is my understanding that the \n     Community Attendant Services and Support Act (MiCASA) is \n     about to be introduced by you, into Congress on Monday, \n     November 15, 1999. On behalf of the Governing Board of the \n     Association of Programs for Rural Independent Living (APRIL) \n     I want to wholeheartedly endorse your efforts to pass this \n     important piece of legislation.\n       APRIL is a national network of over 150 members, primarily \n     rural centers for independent living (CILs), CIL satellite \n     offices and statewide independent living councils (SILCs), as \n     well as other related organizations and individuals concerned \n     about people with disabilities living and working in Rural \n     America. We are a nonprofit group, who for the past twelve \n     years, has continued to grow in both numbers and in our \n     efforts to bring to light the myriad of issues facing our \n     rural constituents. Our membership in turn, represents \n     thousands of consumers, many of whom still remain confined to \n     rooms in their homes, or in institutions due to lack of \n     community supports.\n       MiCASA is a Bill that has been long in coming and APRIL has \n     joined with it's national colleagues throughout the years to \n     urge that such a consumer-directed, community-based model of \n     attendant services and support be implemented throughout the \n     United States. Let's hope that as the new millennium draws \n     near, that mandatory institutionalization will be \n     unnecessary, and that the long-standing bias toward these \n     institutions will have ended.\n       As you well know, coming from the rural state of Iowa, \n     there are too many barriers for people with disabilities--\n     from lack of transportation, housing, job opportunities, \n     personal attendants, financial resources, community access \n     and outdated, limiting attitudes. All these obstacles are \n     compounded in the isolation of rural America. The passage of \n     MiCASA would eliminate of one of the greatest barriers that \n     people face. Your record of supporting the rights of our \n     people, is solid. Our continued support of you and your \n     efforts is assured. Please let us know, as the legislation \n     begins it's journey towards passage, how we may help assure \n     it's success.\n       As always, our thanks to ADAPT and the others who work so \n     steadfastly on our behalf.\n                                                   Linda Gonzales,\n     National Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America (PVA), I want to thank you for introducing ``The \n     Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act of \n     1999.'' This bill will allow qualified individuals with \n     disabilities the option of receiving long term services and \n     supports including personal assistant services in a home and \n     community based settings rather than in institutions.\n       PVA has been a long time advocate for consumer-directed \n     personal assistant services (PAS). Attendants providing PAS \n     perform activities of daily living (ADLs) for people with \n     disabilities including feeding, bathing, toileting, dressing, \n     and transferring. With PAS, many PVA members and thousands of \n     people with disabilities across the country are able to live \n     independent and active lives at home or in a community \n     setting.\n       Historically, long term services for people with \n     disabilities have been provided in nursing homes and in \n     institutional settings. However, your bill will provide funds \n     to States to support systems change initiatives that are \n     designed to assist each State in developing a comprehensive \n     consumer responsive state wide system of long term services \n     and supports that will provide real consumer choice and \n     direct in an integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n     the individual.\n       PVA has long recognized that disability is a natural part \n     of life. People with disabilities have the right to live \n     independently, enjoy self-determination, make independent \n     choices, contribute to society and enjoy full inclusion and \n     integration into the mainstream of American society. This \n     legislation will help advance this cause and PVA stands ready \n     and willing to work with you and your staff to ensure passage \n     of the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and Supports Act \n     of 1999.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John C. Bollinger,\n     Deputy Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                      The Arc,\n\n                                 Arlington, TX, November 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Harkin,\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Harkin and Specter: On behalf of The Arc of \n     the United States, I wish to express our strong support for \n     introducing the Medicaid Community Attendant Services and \n     Supports Act (MiCASSA). MiCASSA represents an important step \n     in reforming our long-term care policy by helping to reduce \n     the institutional bias in our long-term care services system. \n     By doing so, MiCASSA would help individuals with mental \n     retardation live quality lives in the community.\n       Created over thirty years ago, our long-term care service \n     system is funded mainly by Medicare and Medicaid dollars. \n     Today, over 75 percent of Medicaid long-term care dollars are \n     spent on institutional services, leaving few dollars for \n     community-based services. A national long-term service policy \n     should not favor institutions over home and community-based \n     services. It should allow families and individuals real \n     choice regarding where and how services should be delivered.\n       People with mental retardation want to live, work and play \n     in the community. MiCASSA would help keep families together \n     and would prevent people with mental retardation from being \n     unnecessarily institutionalized. Community services have also \n     shown on average to be less expensive than institutional \n     services.\n       MiCASSA complements the 1999 Supreme Court decision in \n     Olmstead, by providing a way for states to meet their \n     obligations under the decision. It would also help reduce the \n     interminable waiting lists for community-based services and \n     supports.\n       The Arc of the Untied States, the largest national \n     voluntary organization devoted solely to the welfare of \n     people with mental retardation and their families, stands \n     ready to assist you in any way to move this important piece \n     of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brenda Doss,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Justin Dart, Jr.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: I know that the great majority of 54 \n     million Americans with disabilities join me in congratulating \n     you and Senator Spector on introducing the Medicaid Community \n     Attendant Services and Supports Act of 1999.\n       The passage of this law will be a landmark progress for \n     free-enterprise democracy. It will pave the way for \n     liberating hundreds of thousands of Americans from \n     institutions by providing the simple services they need to \n     live in their homes and participate in their communities.\n\n[[Page S14642]]\n\n       I urge every member of Congress to support this historic \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Justin Dart,\n     Justice For All.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Spinal Cord\n\n\n                                           Injury Association,\n\n                             Silver Spring, MD, November 16, 1999.\n     Hon.

It \n     has been demonstrated repeatedly that community-based \n     services are better, more cost effective and preferred.\n       We thank you for your support for people living with spinal \n     cord injury and disease and for your willingness to lead the \n     effort to offer real choices for people with disabilities. \n     You can count on NSCIA's support in the effort to pass \n     MiCASSA.\n           Sincerely Yours,\n                                           Thomas H. Countee, Jr.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to join \nSenator Tom Harkin, my colleague and distinguished ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, which I chair, in introducing the Medicaid Attendant Care \nServices and Supports Act of 1999. This creative proposal addresses a \nglaring gap in Federal health coverage, and assists one of our Nation's \nmost vulnerable populations, persons with disabilities. I would also \nnote that a similar version on this bill was included in the Health \nCare Assurance Act of 1999 (S. 24), which I introduced on January 19, \n1999.\n  In an effort to improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those \nwith long-term disabilities, this vital legislation would allow for \nreimbursement for community-based attendant care services, in lieu of \ninstitutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such \nservices based on functional need, without regard to the individual's \nage or the nature of the disability. The most recent data available \ntell us that 5.9 million individuals receive care for disabilities \nunder the Medicaid program. The number of disabled who are not \ncurrently enrolled in the program who would apply for this improved \nbenefit is not easily counted, but would likely be substantial given \nthe preference of home and community-based care over institutional \ncare.\n  Under this proposal, States may apply for grants for assistance in \nimplementing ``systems change'' initiatives, in order to eliminate the \ninstitutional bias in their current policies and for needs assessment \nactivities. Further, if a state can show that the aggregate amounts of \nFederal expenditures on people living in the community exceeds what \nwould have been spent on the same people had they been in nursing \nhomes, the state can limit the program, perhaps by not letting any more \npeople apply; no limiting mechanism is mandated under this bill. And \nfinally, States would be required to maintain expenditures for \nattendant care services under other Medicaid community-based programs, \nthereby preventing the states from shifting patients into the new \nbenefit proposed under this bill.\n  Let me speak briefly about why such a change in Medicaid law is so \ndesperately needed. Only a few short months ago, the Supreme Court held \nin Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999), that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) requires States, under some circumstances, to \nprovide community-based treatment to persons with mental disabilities \nrather than placing them in institutions. This decision and several \nlower court decisions have pointed to the need for a structured \nMedicaid attendant-care services benefit in order to meet obligations \nunder the ADA. Disability advocates strongly support this legislation, \narguing that the lack of Medicaid communty-based services options is \ndiscriminatory and unhealthful for disabled individuals. Virtually \nevery major disability advocacy group supports this bill, including \nADAPT, the Arc, the National Council on Independent Living, Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, and the National Spinal Cord Injury Association.\n  Senator Harkin and I recognize that such a shift in the Medicaid \nprogram is a huge undertaking--but feel that it is a vitally important \none. We are introducing this legislation today in an attempt to move \nahead with the consideration of crucial disability legislation and to \nprovide a starting point for debate. Mr. President, the time has come \nfor concerted action in this arena.\n  I urge the congressional leadership, including the appropriate \ncommittee chairmen, to move forward in considering this legislation, \nand take the significant next step forward in achieving the objective \nof providing individuals with disabilities the freedom to live in their \nown communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith or Oregon):\n  S. 1936. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to sell or \nexchange all or part of certain administrative sites and other National \nForest System land in the State of Oregon and use the proceeds derived \nfrom the sale or exchange for National Forest System purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the bent pine nursery land conveyance act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation that \nwill allow the Forest Service to sell an abandoned facility to the city \nof Bend, OR, to be used for recreational purposes. The idea for this \nlegislation came from the citizens of Bend themselves. They worked with \nForest Service personnel in the adjacent Deschutes National Forest and \ncrafted a win-win solution to different problems. What others might \nhave seen as a problem, namely the shutdown of the Pine Nursery \nfacility, they saw as an opportunity--the opportunity to provide a \nrecreational complex for the community and to generate funding for \nneeded facilities in the Deschutes Forest. This legislation would allow \nthem to implement this creative idea.\n  Faced with the inevitable sale, trade or development of the Forest \nService's Bend Pine Nursery, which supplied seedlings for five decades \nof reforestation work, last spring I met with representatives from the \nBend Metro Parks and Recreation District; the city of Bend; the Bend \nSchool District; folks from the soccer and Little League baseball \nprograms; and others who are concerned about central Oregon's youth and \nadults having adequate recreational facilities.\n  What these folks asked me to do was very straightforward: if the \nForest service is going to sell, exchange, or otherwise develop the \nformer Bend Pine Nursery, the community wanted the opportunity to \nacquire the property for the development of a sports complex, playing \nfields and other facilities.\n  My bill simply creates an opportunity for the Bend Metro Parks and \nRecreation District to work with the people of Bend on whether or not \nto purchase this property. It does not require purchase by the \ncommunity, it simply gives the community a right of first refusal to \nbuy the property at fair market value.\n  At the same time, this legislation allows the Deschutes National \nForest to address its need for a new administrative site. Currently, \nthe Deschutes pays approximately $725,000 per year in annual lease and \nutility costs. This is \\3/4\\ of a million dollars that is not being \nspent on the ground, improving the quality of Deschutes National Forest \nfacilities, lands and resources. It is a credit to the leadership of \nthe Deschutes National Forest that they seek a way out from this \nunnecessary, unproductive and recurring expense.\n  My bill will enable the Deschutes to use the money raised from the \nsale of the nursery and other surplus properties in Oregon toward the \nacquisition--and ownership--of a new administrative site. The cost of a \nnew building is estimated to be about $7 million; as my colleagues can \nsee, the forest is paying almost a million dollars in rent each year. \nIn the words of an ad from today's ``Bend Bulletin'', and I quote: \n``Tired of throwing away thousands on rent? Think you can't buy? think \nagain. If you're stuck in the renter rut, try it our way.''\n  I look forward to a hearing next year on this bill in the Energy and \nNatural Resources Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, \nof which\n\n[[Page S14643]]\n\nI am ranking member.

PETRINA\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, occasionally in Washington, an \nindividual crosses our paths whose talents go beyond legal and \ngovernment relations skills or polished representation of political and \npolicy issues, and extend to an elusive higher level. At this level, we \nthink of him not as a creature of the policies he advocates but as a \nperson--a man of integrity and decency. Mike Petrina is such a man. \nGenerous and unfailingly courteous, Mike has represented the Cosmetic, \nToiletry, and Fragrance Association with intelligence, savvy, and \ncharm. In doing his job well, he also has achieved what is often very \ndifficult in this town--an excellent reputation as a genuinely nice \nguy.\n  Before he joined CTFA, Mike worked as legislative counsel to the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, as an attorney \nboth in private practice and in community legal services, and as a \nlegislative assistant to the late Representative Silvio Conte. In each \nof these capacities, his watchword was integrity and his purpose was to \nachieve the goal without compromising either his own principles or the \ncredibility of his employer.\n  It is clear that among the defining moments of Mike's life--those \nmoments that signaled how successful he would be here in wonk universe, \nwere his quiz show triumphs. If winning on Jeopardy doesn't tell us \nanything else about a person, it tells us that he will always be able \nto produce an obscure fact and that he can react instantaneously to a \ntotally unexpected question or comment. Surely those two skills suited \nMike superbly for his fruitful Washington career.\n  Mike has chosen to retire early in the year 2000, when he is young \nenough to enjoy his retirement and to have a long time to do it. I wish \nhim well, and want him to know that many of us here will miss him. With \nMike and CTFA president Ed Kavanaugh, the industry made a lasting mark \non the Utah Children's Charities through contributions of products to \nour golf tournament each August. I have been grateful for the \ncontribution and, more importantly, for the spirit of good will that \nalways characterized my interactions with CTFA and with Mike.\n  Mike illustrated, through effective use of his talents, the sense of \nhumor that always tided him over the tough moments, and his gentle \napproach to people, what the poet and artist J. Stone once said: ``the \nmost visible creators I know of are those artists whose medium is life \nitself . . . They neither paint nor sculpt--their medium is being. \nWhatever their presence touches has increased life.''\n  I am sure I speak for all those who worked with Mike in thanking him \nfor all he did here to make our work together so pleasant and \nproductive. I wish Mike Petrina a long and enjoyable retirement, and \nurge him to remember always the words of Robert Browning: ``The best is \nyet to be, the last of life for which the first was made.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14645-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14645-S14646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS OF SOUTHEASTERN CONNECTICUT\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that I \nrise today to celebrate the 90th Anniversary of the American Red Cross \nof Southeastern Connecticut. Since 1909, victims of war, strife and \nnatural disaster have been given the gift of hope and the means of\n\n[[Page S14646]]\n\nsurvival by the selfless men and women who make up the Red Cross' \nSoutheastern Connecticut Chapter. Indeed, for nine decades, the \nSoutheastern Connecticut Chapter has provided assistance to those in \nneed in Connecticut, across the United States and around the world--\ntruly exemplifying the ideals of the American Red Cross--offering aid \nand support during periods of acute emergency and prolonged rebuilding \nalike.\n  The Red Cross itself has a long and distinguished history in the \nUnited States. In 1881, the American Red Cross was founded by Clara \nBarton and dedicated to the basic principles of service to humanity, \nindependence, voluntary service, unity and universality. President Taft \ndescribed the American Red Cross as ``the only volunteer society now \nauthorized by this government to render aid to its land and naval \nforces in times of war,'' for that was its original intent, to aid the \ncasualties of war. As we all know, the organization's peace-time role \ngrew rapidly, however, and at the turn of the century, new leadership \nbrought new goals and expanded the services of the American Red Cross.\n  The growth of the American Red Cross was made possible by the success \nof regional chapters and the dedication of countless volunteers. The \nRed Cross was entirely staffed by volunteers until 1941, and today, \nvolunteers still make up ninety-eight percent of all Red Cross \npersonnel. When membership drives were initiated by the Southeastern \nConnecticut Chapter, residents of that area answered the call. Citizens \nfrom all walks of life--businesses, mills, farms, schools, churches and \nhospitals--donated their time, skill and money to the organization. \nOver the years, the Southeastern Chapter has been able to generate the \never-increasing support required to meet developing demands because of \nthe sacrifice of their volunteers and the generosity of their \nneighbors.\n  Over the last 90 years, this generosity and self-sacrifice has \nproduced a remarkable track record. Historically speaking, the Red \nCross organization in Southeastern Connecticut was active even before \nits formal charter was granted on November 1, 1909. The founding \nmembers began organizing at the Park Congressional Church in Norwich, \nConnecticut in October, 1905. They played a role in the relief efforts \nfollowing the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and in 1906 helped survivors \nof the San Francisco earthquake and fire. Back home in Connecticut, the \nchapter also moved rapidly to combat a growing tuberculosis epidemic in \nits early days.\n  As the world braced for war in August, 1914, the Chapter prepared for \nits own humanitarian campaign. The Chapter's members opened their \nhearts and homes to the work at hand. Preparations were carried out in \nhomes, offices, social clubs, church societies and any other available \nspace. The spirit of the Red Cross in Southeastern Connecticut was \ntruly embraced by the community as a whole. The Honor Roll Committee, \nthe Home Service Section, the Motor Corps and the Junior Red Cross were \nall formed in the endeavor to relieve those affected by war.\n  During the latter decades of the century, the Chapter, and the Red \nCross in general, made great strides in the field of blood donation. \nConnecticut Chapters contributed to the Blood Services of the war in \nVietnam by sponsoring ``Operation Helpmate\" in which each Chapter \nsupplied a mobile blood unit in Mekong, Vietnam. Relentless in their \nselfless devotion to humanitarianism worldwide, Southeastern \nConnecticut Red Cross has provided a safety net for the 20th Century.\n  While most of us think of the Red Cross as an international force for \ngood, the presence of the American Red Cross in Connecticut has been \nimportant, as well. When the deadliest hurricane to ever hit New \nEngland slammed into Eastern Connecticut on September 21, 1938, the \nDisaster and Civil Preparedness Committee of the Southeastern Chapter \nresponded to the emergency situation immediately, helping countless \nlives. And the Chapter led the effort to rebuild once the storm had \npassed. Had it not been for the preparedness of the Chapter in disaster \nsituations, the damage and loss of life sustained would have been far \ngreater.\n  More recently, the state's organization has created what is now \nhailed as a model program for preventing the spread of HIV throughout \nthe state. This program has become highly successful, and is partly the \nreason why cases of new infections have dropped significantly.\n  Just this year, the destruction brought by hurricane Floyd was \nmitigated by the Southeastern Red Cross. While parts of Connecticut \nwere so badly soaked by floods that they were declared federal disaster \nareas, the Southeastern Connecticut American Red Cross was assisting \nlocal hospitals and rescuing those in need.\n  At the turn of the millennium, the American Red Cross faces new \nchallenges. Cultural and national conflicts, natural disasters and acts \nof nature have caused unimaginable human suffering in recent memory. \nAfter each calamity, however, the Red Cross and its volunteers have \nbeen there to pick up the pieces. Volunteers from Connecticut have \nplayed an active role both around the world and at home over the last \n90 years and I rest easier knowing they will continue to play a vital \nrole well into the next century.\n  So, it is with great pride and gratitude, Mr. President, that I stand \non the floor of the Senate today to recognize the accomplishments of \nthe Southeastern Connecticut American Red Cross over these past 90 \nyears. I know I speak for many Connecticut residents in expressing \ncongratulations for achieving this milestone, and best wishes in coming \nyears for continued service to those in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14646-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IMAM VEHBI ISMAIL PROCLAMATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday and honor Imam Vehbi Ismail for his fifty years of dedicated \nservice to the Islamic community.\n  The Imam has been an instrumental force in the Albanian American and \nIslamic communities in Michigan. Originally, from Albania he emigrated \nto the United States in 1949 after studying theology in Egypt. Through \nhis spiritual leadership the Imam set himself on a path to improve the \nAlbanian American community. One of his greatest accomplishments was \nthe establishment of the Albanian Islamic Center where he served as the \nSenior Cleric.\n  What is truly remarkable about this extraordinary individual is his \nwork in the areas of democratic and human rights. The Imam has been the \ndriving force in the Michigan community, raising awareness for human \nrights for Albanians world wide.\n  The Imam has proudly served as one of the longest active Clerics in \nthe country. His family and the Albanian American community look to him \nas the elder statesman and guiding spirit for their community.\n  Mr. President it is with sincere joy and appreciation that I honor \nthe Imam Vehbi Ismail. He is truly an example of unselfish charity and \nan inspiration to many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14646-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14646-S14647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JERRY DAVIS, JR., TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today \nto pay tribute to a dear friend, Jerry Davis, Jr. Jerry and I first met \nin the Army when we were stationed in New Jersey together before we \nheaded to Vietnam. Jerry is a man with an extraordinary story and I am \nproud to be among his circle of friends.\n  Jerry was born on January 2, 1925 in Terry, Louisiana--a humble \nbeginning for a sharecropper's son destined for the cover of FORTUNE \nMagazine (October, 1975). Jerry was a man committed to a life of \nservice and his family, his church, his community and his country. A \ngenerous, loving and forgiving spirit, a respect for order and \ntradition and a legendary helping hand were the hallmarks of his life.\n  After graduating first in his class from the Magnolia Training \nSchool, he cut his formal education short , despite receiving a \nscholarship from Southern University, by enlisting in the U.S. Army. \nJoining the all African-American 94th Engineer Construction Battalion \nat the end of World War II, he began his military career as an enlisted \nman in Paris. Seven years later he completed Officer Training School in \nFort Benning, Georgia and as a new 2nd Lieutenant was company commander \nin the Korean War. In 1967, he returned to combat as one of two \nAfrican-American battalion commanders in Vietnam. After 26 years of \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S14647]]\n\nservice, Lieutenant Colonel Davis retired.\n  From there, Jerry went on to accomplish many great things. Among them \nwere, being Chairman of the Board of M.U.S.C.L.E.--a non-profit \norganization providing low income housing in Southwest Washington--and \nserving as a trustee for the retirement fund of the Washington Suburban \nSanitation Commission. In the early 1970's, Jerry founded Unified \nServices Inc., a successful building service management company and was \nChairman of the Board and CEO of Unibar Maintenance in Ann Arbor, \nMichigan. Jerry was also a delegate to the 1980 White House Conference \non Small Business.\n  While on a business trip to Portland, Oregon with a friend, he met \nJean Cotton Simmons and swept her off her feet. They married and \nshortly after created a family whose dimensions extend miles beyond \ntheir shared hearth with a tradition of hospitality, humor and huge \nholiday celebrations.\n  Jerry fills his free time with the sounds of Duke Ellington, Frank \nSinatra and Miles Davis, and when his wife isn't looking, it's long \ncigars and the Redskins. And I can't forget our shared love of \nWesterns, especially ``Gunfight at the OK Corral.'' Countless people \nhave had life defining moments with this ordinary man who produced \nextraordinary results, leaving behind an enduring legacy of living life \nto its unreasonable fullest. As Jerry and his family battle against his \ncancer, I applaud the courage and determination he has shown throughout \nhis life.\n  As George Bernard Shaw once said, ``The reasonable man adapts himself \nto the conditions that surround him. The unreasonable man adapts \nsurrounding conditions to himself. Our progress depends on the \nunreasonable man.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14647-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO HENRY VOGT HEUSER, SR.\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, a successful businessman, and community leader, the late \nHenry Heuser, Sr. I also would like to extend my condolences to his two \nsons, Henry, Jr. and Marshall.\n  Henry has made it easy for us to remember him--leaving behind an \nimpressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to \nachieve in their lifetime. Henry will be remembered for many different \nreasons, not least of which is his generosity to the Louisville \ncommunity. Henry gave much of his time, energy and monetary resources \nto benefit others. Aware that he had resources which not everyone was \nprivileged to have, he shared his wealth both of knowledge and of money \nwith the city over his lifetime. Henry often gave to charity and \ncommunity groups that needed support, including a recent $1 million \ndonation to the Louisville Deaf Oral School for a much-needed expansion \nproject. He made the donation in memory of his late wife, Edith, who \nvolunteered for and supported the school for many years.\n  Henry also will be remembered as a dedicated civic leader for \nLouisville--Henry had a heart for the city of Louisville, and a vision \nfor its bright future. Henry was a founder of Leadership Louisville, a \ngroup of community leaders that were committed to making a difference \nin the city. Henry also was very involved in the religious community of \nLouisville, and even led the effort to bring the Presbyterian Church's \nheadquarters to the city several years ago. Another of the legacies \nHenry leaves behind is that of ``The Derby Clock,'' as it has come to \nbe known. Henry was an integral part of the planning and design for the \nclock, and I know I will think of him when I see it repaired, \nreassembled, and prominently displayed in our city.\n  Henry also will be remembered for his success in business, with the \nHenry Vogt Machine Company and his more recent enterprises, Unistar and \nEquisource. Henry's sharp mind and innate common sense clearly served \nhim in the business world and in the community.\n  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Henry Heuser, Sr. has \nleft will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully \nit will be a comfort to the family and friends he leaves behind to know \nthat his efforts to better the community will be felt for years to \ncome. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I offer my deepest \ncondolences to Henry's loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he \ncontributed to Jefferson County, the State of Kentucky, and to our \ngreat nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14647-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PFIZER'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nPfizer, Inc. on its 150th anniversary. As one of the global leaders of \nthe important pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer has helped to improve the \nhealth of men, women and children around the world for the last century \nand a half. The company employs 4,939 men and women in its Groton, CT \nresearch facility, which lies in my home state.\n  Pfizer is committed to helping people live better lives--not only by \nbringing best-in-class medicines to market, but also by working with \npatients and physicians to develop comprehensive disease management \nprograms that educate people about ways to better control their \nillness, rather than letting their illness control them.\n  Pfizer's long history is full of adventure, daring risk-taking, and \nintrepid decision-making. Founded by German immigrant cousins Charles \nPfizer and Charles Erhart in 1849, Pfizer has grown from a small \nchemical firm in Brooklyn, NY to a multinational corporation, which \nemploys close to 50,000 people.\n  Pfizer has a long tradition of developing innovative drugs to combat \na variety of illnesses. In 1944, Pfizer was the first company to \nsuccessfully mass-produce penicillin, a breakthrough that led to the \ncompany's emergence as a global leader in its industry. Since then, \nPfizer has marketed dozens of effective medicines designed to fight \nconditions like arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, and infections. \nNearly all of the major medicines marketed by Pfizer are No. 1 or No. 2 \nin their categories\n  In addition, Pfizer provides a wide range of assistance to those in \nneed. The desire to live a healthy life is universal. But for millions \nof people around the world, access to high quality health care remains \nout of reach. Pfizer is committed to bringing their medicines to those \nin need. Through Sharing the Care, a program started in 1993, Pfizer \nhas filled more than 3.0 million prescriptions for its medicines--\nvalued at over $170 million--for more than one million uninsured \npatients in the United States. The program was cited by American \nBenefactor, a leading philanthropy journal, in selecting Pfizer as one \nof America's 25 most generous companies for 1998.\n  As you can see, Pfizer has made innumerable contributions to our \nnation and our world, and its accomplishments should be applauded as it \ncelebrates its 150th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14647-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14647-S14648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SHARED APPRECIATION AGREEMENTS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, shared appreciation agreements have \nthe potential to cause hundreds of farm foreclosures across the nation, \nand especially in my home state of Montana. Ten years ago, a large \nnumber of farmers signed these agreements. At that time they were under \nthe impression that they would be required to pay these back at the end \nof ten years, at a reasonable rate of redemption.\n  However, that has not proved to be the case. The appraisals being \nconducted by the Farm Service Agency are showing increased values of \nridiculous proportions. By all standards, one would expect the value to \nhave decreased. Farm prices are the lowest they have been in years, and \nthere does not seem to be a quick recovery forthcoming. Farmers cannot \npossibly be expected to pay back a value twice the amount they \noriginally wrote down. Especially in light of the current market \nsituation, I believe something must be done about the way these \nappraisals are conducted.\n  USDA has proposed rules and regulations but farmers need help with \nthese agreements now. This legislation mandates these important \nregulations. It will exclude capital investments from the increase in \nappreciation and allow farmers to take out a loan at the ``Homestead \nRate'', which is the government's cost of borrowing.\n  Farmers should not be penalized for attempting to better their \noperations. Nor can they be expected to delay capital improvements so \nthat they will\n\n[[Page S14648]]\n\nnot be penalized. It will be necessary for most of these agricultural \nproducers to take out an additional loan during these hard times. It is \nimportant that the interest rate on that loan will accommodate their \nneeds. The governments current cost of borrowing equals about 6.25 \npercent, far less than the original 9 percent farmers and ranchers were \npaying.\n  I look forward to working with members in other states to alleviate \nthe financial burdens imposed by shared appreciation agreements. I hope \nthat we may move this through the legislative process quickly to \nprovide help as soon as possible to our farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14648-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JOHN A. SACCI\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to \none of my constituents, the late John A. Sacci, who was a resident in \nmy home county of Bergen. John Sacci served with distinction as a \nhistory teacher in the Hoboken Public Schools until his untimely death \nin 1997. The good citizens of Hoboken will dedicate a playground in the \nhistoric Columbus Park in honor of his memory, and I join his family, \nfriends and colleagues in paying tribute to a man who inspired so many \nyoung people.\n  John Sacci lived a short life, but it was not without ample \nachievements and success. Mr. Sacci helped to shape the minds of our \nchildren and did so with his unique brand of humor. His approach to \nteaching was filled with a refreshing attitude that won him the \naffection of countless students. Mr. President, above all, John Sacci \nwas a committed and dedicated teacher and servant of the people.\n  Mr. Sacci lent his support to countless causes, including the \nimplementation of Advanced Placement courses and the International \nBacculauralate programs at Hoboken High School, creating scholarship \nopportunities for students, and initiating professional learning \nopportunities like the Academic Bowl and Mock Trial providing for \nHoboken's students to be among the brightest in Hudson County. \nAdditionally, John served as the Girl's Softball Team Coach and helped \nto build young women's self-esteem through leadership and team work.\n  When it came time to assist students with the college application \nprocess, John Sacci was the one hundreds of students turned to for \nassistance because they knew he cared. Indeed, John Sacci's efforts \nmade it possible for hundreds of students to go on and become \nproductive citizens. In fact, John Sacci helped and inspired a member \nof my own staff, George A. Ortiz, who serves as my press secretary. He \nwas a vital asset to the success of Hoboken High School and his loss is \nprofoundly felt. For all who ever crossed his path and benefitted from \nhis intrinsic commitment to helping shape the future of America, we are \nall the better for it today.\n  Mr. President, I have stood on the floor of this great chamber time \nand again to urge the imperative need for meaningful gun control. On \nFebruary 17, 1997 the tragedies that have struck in places like \nLittleton, Jonesboro and Columbine were all too familiar to the small \ncommunity of Hoboken, as John Sacci's life was tragically cut short by \ngun violence. To all of my constituents in New Jersey who have died \nfrom gun violence, like John Sacci, I commit to fighting so that their \nmemories and untimely deaths are not forgotten.\n  In conclusion, I want to express my personal condolences to John \nSacci's family and friends. To his wife, Kathy, his children, Carla, \nChristi, Jenna and Elaina, though nothing I can say today will change \nthe pain you feel, but take pride in your husband and father John \nSacci. He was, indeed, a man of courage, inspiration and above all, he \ncared enough to want to make a difference.\n  Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect that today, \nTuesday, November 23, 1999, family, friends and countless students \ngathered together in the City of Hoboken, in Hudson County in my great \nstate of New Jersey to dedicate a playground in the living memory of \nJohn A. Sacci, an accomplished teacher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14648-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LA SALLE COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL FATHER/SON BANQUET\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to call to your \nattention a special event which will be occurring in Wyndmoor, \nPennsylvania on Thursday, November 18, 1999. La Salle College High \nSchool will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of their Father/Son \nBanquet, sponsored by the ``Men of La Salle,'' otherwise known as the \nFather's Club.\n  La Salle College High School is a private, independent Catholic \ncollege preparatory school for young men of varied backgrounds and \nabilities. La Salle is dedicated to providing a challenging and \nnurturing environment for learning, inspired by Saint John Baptist De \nLa Salle, and seeks to empower each student to accept responsibility \nand achieve his fullest potential. La Salle is committed to Christian \nvalues, academic excellence, spiritual fulfillment, cultural \nenrichment, and physical development. The Lasallian experience prepares \nyoung men who are dedicated to leadership, achievement, and service to \nhelp build a society that is more human, more Christ-like, and more \njust.\n  The Father's Club has a long history of doing good for the La Salle \nCollege High School and its families. Much of the money raised by the \nMen of La Salle College High School and its families. Much of the money \nraised by the Men of La Salle, for example, goes to help students at La \nSalle who find themselves in financial difficulties as a result of the \ndeath of an employed parent. This scholarship fund makes it possible \nfor students who go through a family tragedy to stay at La Salle, and \nhelps to foster a family-like atmosphere. The Father's Club also \ncontributes to the financial growth and stability of La Salle, and \nprovides a wholesome social climate through its various events and \nactivities.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate La Salle College High School \nand the Men of La Salle for the 50th anniversary of their Father/Son \nbanquet, and thank them for the great work which they are doing. They \nare a tribute to Pennsylvania and should be recognized as a model \norganization to be emulated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14648-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14648-S14649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DAVID AND ANN CANNON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I raise today to honor the enduring \nunion of David and Ann Cannon and the legacy of accomplishment that \ntheir partnership has produced. On December 19, 1999, they will retire \ntogether, 35 years to the day after David was ordained as a priest and \nthe two began their work at the St. James Episcopal Church in the \nVillage of Poquetanuck, Connecticut, located in the greater Norwich \narea of my home state.\n  For these past three and a half decades, David and Ann have been \npillars of the Norwich community. Through their unflagging commitment \nto improving the lot of those in need, they have touched the lives of \ncountless neighbors and set an impressive example for the rest of us to \nfollow. Specifically, their work on behalf of the homeless of Martin \nHouse and Thames River Family Program has given dignity and hope to \nthose who previously had little of either.\n  Individually, each has many accomplishments for which to be proud. \nDavid has been a faithful pastor and a caring leader for his parish. He \nhas dedicated himself to increasing access to quality higher education \nand ensuring compassionate care for the ill and infirm. To her great \ncredit, Ann has worked tirelessly to shape a more responsive local \ngovernment and to conserve the history of the community for generations \nto come.\n  But the sum of this pair's worth is well beyond the measure of its \ndistinguished parts. Perhaps it is the love and good humor these two \nshare with themselves and others, their common zeal for hard work, and \ntheir joint commitment to excellence that is most memorable about them. \nPerhaps, as well, it is their unbending faith and their untempered \ncompassion for their neighbors, and their talent for simply caring \nabout others that has magnified their impact. All these traits have \ndefined David and Ann for the many years I have known them and \nundoubtedly long before.\n  While I merely scratch the surface of their many virtues and \naccomplishments here today, I would be remiss not to mention David and \nAnn's three most remarkable accomplishments--David, Andrew and Ruth, \ntheir three wonderful and loving children.\n\n[[Page S14649]]\n\n  Through 42 years of marriage, 35 years of selfless dedication to \ntheir parish and community, and 3 wonderful children, David and Ann \nCannon have remained the central characters in a wonderful life story. \nI know I speak for countless others in the Norwich area in wishing that \nthe next chapter in their remarkable life story be one of many \nrewarding years filled with love and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14649-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DUTCH AMERICAN HERITAGE DAY\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, on November 17, 1776 a small American \nwarship, the Andrew Doria, sailed into the harbor of the island of \nSaint Eustatius in the West Indies. Only 4 months before, the United \nStates had declared its independence from Great Britain. The American \ncrew was delighted when the Governor of the island, Johannes de Graaf, \nordered that his fort's cannons be fired in a friendly salute. The \nfirst ever given by a foreign power to the flag of the United States, \nit was a risky and courageous act. The British seized the island a few \nyears later. De Graff's welcoming salute was a sign of respect, and \ntoday it continues to symbolize the deep ties of friendship that exist \nbetween the United States and the Netherlands.\n  After more than 200 years, the bonds between the United States and \nthe Netherlands remain strong. Our diplomatic ties, in fact, constitute \none of the longest unbroken diplomatic relationships with any foreign \ncountry.\n  Fifty years ago, during the second world war, American and Dutch men \nand women fought side by side to defend the cause of freedom and \ndemocracy. As NATO allies, we have continued to stand together to keep \nthe transatlantic partnership strong and to maintain the peace and \nsecurity of Europe. In the Persian Gulf we joined as coalition partners \nto repel aggression and to uphold the rule of law.\n  While the ties between the United States and the Netherlands have \nbeen tested by time and by the crucible of armed conflict, Dutch \nAmerican Heritage is even older than our official relationship. It \ndates back to the early seventeenth century, when the Dutch West India \nCompany founded New Netherland and its main settlements, New Amsterdam \nand Fort Orange--today known as New York City and Albany.\n  From the earliest days of our Republic, men and women of Dutch \nancestry have made important contributions to American history and \nculture. The influence of our Dutch ancestors can still be seen not \nonly in New York's Hudson River Valley but also in communities like \nHolland, Michigan and Pella, Iowa where many people trace their roots \nto settlers from the Netherlands.\n  Generations of Dutch immigrants have enriched the United States with \nthe unique customs and traditions of their ancestral homeland--a \ncountry that has given the world great artists and celebrated \nphilosophers.\n  On this occasion, we also remember many celebrated American leaders \nof Dutch descent. Three presidents, Martin Van Buren, Theodore \nRoosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt, came from Dutch stock.\n  Our Dutch heritage is seen not only in our people but also in our \nexperience as a Nation. Our traditions of religious freedom and \ntolerance, for example, have spiritual and legal roots among such early \nsettlers as the English Pilgrims and the French Huguenots, who first \nfound refuge from persecution in Holland. The Dutch Republic was among \nthose systems of government that inspired our Nation's Founders as they \nshaped our Constitution.\n  In celebration of the long-standing friendship that exists between \nthe United States and the Netherlands, and in recognition of the many \ncontributions that Dutch Americans have made to our country, we observe \nDutch American Heritage Day on November 16.\n  I salute the over eight million Dutch Americans and the sixteen \nmillion people of the Netherlands in the celebration of this joyous \noccasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14649-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           USE OF SECRET EVIDENCE IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on November 6, Nat Hentoff \ndevoted his ever insightful column to the Kafka-like use of secret \nevidence by our Federal government in deportation proceedings. Once \nagain, Mr. Hentoff has highlighted yet another distressing aspect of \nthe 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. I ask that Mr. \nHentoff's column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 6, 1999]\n\n                        Prosecution in Darkness\n\n                            (By Nat Hentoff)\n\n       Around the country, 24 immigrants, most of them Muslim or \n     of Arab descent, are being detained--that is, imprisoned--by \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which intends to \n     deport them.\n       None of them, nor any of their lawyers, has been allowed to \n     see the evidence against them or to confront their accusers. \n     This denial of fundamental due process is justified on the \n     grounds of national security.\n       In 1996, the president signed the Anti-Terrorism and \n     Effective Death Penalty Act, which authorized secret \n     evidence. A federal district judge in Newark, N.J., William \n     Walls, has now described this as ``government processes \n     initiated and prosecuted in darkness.'' (The use of secret \n     evidence, however, goes back to the 1950s).\n       Although many active lawsuits, in various stages, are \n     attacking this use of secret evidence, Judge Walls is the \n     first jurist to flatly declare the use of such evidence \n     unconstitutional.\n       His decision was in the case of Hany Mahmoud Kiareldeen, a \n     Palestinian who has been in this country for nine years, \n     managed an electronics store in New Jersey and is married to \n     an American citizen.\n       First arrested for having an expired student visa, he later \n     was accused of meeting in his New Jersey home, a week before \n     the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, with one of the men \n     convicted in that attack. He also was accused of threatening \n     to kill Attorney General Janet Reno.\n       The source of this classified evidence is the FBI's Joint \n     Terrorism Task Force. But, as Judge Walls has noted, the INS \n     failed to produce any witnesses--either from the FBI or from \n     the INS--or ``original source material'' in support of these \n     charges. Therefore no witnesses could be cross-examined at \n     the hearings.\n       At the hearings, Kiareldeen produced witnesses and other \n     evidence that he was not living in the town where he is \n     supposed to have met with bombing conspirators. And an expert \n     witness, Dr. Laurie Myleroie, appeared for him. She is \n     described by James Fox, former head of the FBI's New York \n     office, as ``one of the world-class experts regarding Islam \n     and the World Trade Center bombing.'' She testified that no \n     evidence showed that the accused had any connection with that \n     bombing.\n       The government's evidence, said the judge, failed ``to \n     satisfy the constitutional standard of fundamental \n     fairness.'' The INS--part of the Justice Department--denied \n     Kiareldeen's ``due process right to confront his accusers . . \n     . even one person during his extended tour through the INS's \n     administrative procedures.''\n       These due process protections, declared the judge, ``must \n     be extended to all persons within the United States, citizens \n     and resident aliens alike. . . . Aliens, once legally \n     admitted into the United States are entitled to the shelter \n     of the Constitution.'' The judge went even farther. Even if \n     the government's reliance on secret evidence has been \n     provably based on a claim of national security, Judge Walls--\n     quoting from a District of Columbia Court of Appeals \n     decision, Rafeedie v. INS--asked ``whether that government \n     interest is so all-encompassing that it requires that the \n     petitioner be denied virtually every fundamental feature of \n     due process.''\n       In Rafeedie, Judge David Ginsburg noted in 1989 that the \n     permanent resident alien in That case, in this country for 14 \n     years, was ``like Joseph K. in Kafka's `The Trial' in that he \n     could only prevail if he ware able to rebut evidence that he \n     was not permitted to see.''\n       Kiareldeen is now free after 19 months, but Judge Walls's \n     decision that secret evidence is unconstitutional applied \n     only to the state of New Jersey. The INS did not pursue its \n     appeal because it wants to avoid a Supreme Court decision. \n     The INS continues to insist it will keep on using secret \n     evidence.\n       One of the victims of these prosecutions in darkness still \n     in prison is Nasser Ahmed, who has been in INS detention for \n     3\\1/2\\ years.\n       Congress has the power to bring in the sunlight by passing \n     the Secret Evidence Repeal Act of 1999 (H.R. 2121)--\n     introduced in June by Rep. David Bonior (D-Mich.). It would \n     ``abolish the use of secret evidence in American courts and \n     reaffirm the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that no person shall \n     be deprived of liberty without due process.''\n       Will a bipartisan congress vote in favor of the \n     Constitution? And then, will the president allow the removal \n     of the secret evidence provisions of his cherished 1996 Anti-\n     Terrorism Act?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14649-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14649-S14650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY PERRY, GEORGIA\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on the eve of its one hundred and \nseventy-fifth birthday, I rise today to recognize a most charming and \nprosperous town, Perry, GA. When the first settlers came to the fertile \nplains of central Georgia, they found a wealth of natural\n\n[[Page S14650]]\n\nresources that promised prosperity. The land proved not only beautiful, \nbut also perfectly suited for agriculture. The town's initial successes \nattracted entrepreneurial citizens who contributed greatly to Perry's \nstrong industrial and agricultural presence in Georgia which continues \nto grow to this day.\n  Perry is the seat of Houston County, and is blessed with a rich \nabundance of natural, historic and cultural diversity. Formerly known \nas Wattsville, Perry became the first official town in the county on \nNovember 25, 1824. Perry is named after Commodore Oliver Perry, who \nbecame famous for a battle on Lake Erie during the war of 1812. During \nthe battle of September 10, 1813, Perry defeated and captured a \nflotilla of six large British frigates with an improvised fleet of nine \nAmerican vessels and in so doing neutralized the British naval presence \non Lake Erie.\n  For as long as anyone can remember, Perry has been a favorite place \nfor tourists to stop. Known as the ``Crossroads of Georgia,'' Perry is \nlocated in the geographic center of the state where U.S. Highways 341 \nand 41 and the Golden Isles Parkway intersect with Interstate 75. With \nan ideal location along I-75, Perry has long enjoyed the distinction as \nGeorgia's halfway point to Florida. As a result, snowbirds and \nvacationers of every type have recognized Perry as a pleasant place to \nstop and rest, grab a bite to eat at one of Perry's many restaurants, \nincluding one of my favorites, The New Perry Hotel, or simply to enjoy \nthe peacefulness of the small town. Combined with the graciousness with \nwhich they are received by Perryans, many have found it difficult to \nleave!\n  For festival-goers, Perry's warm climate and 628-acre events complex \nprovide ample opportunity for fun and entertainment. Perry is home to \nGeorgia's National Fair, a much-anticipated, 10-day extravaganza held \neach October. Activities at the fair are reminiscent of county fairs of \nold, revolving around livestock and horse shows, FAA and FHA events, \nhome and fine arts displays, as well as the ever-popular baking and \nquilting competitions. This year marked the 10-year anniversary of the \nfair. The 628-acre complex is the largest of its kind, and the events \nhosted at the Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter have an \nestimated economic impact of $30 million annually.\n  For about two weeks starting in mid-March, the Peach Blossom Trail on \nU.S. 341 north of Perry is lined with pink and white blossoms. From \nmid-May through mid-August, an abundance of fresh peaches can be found \nfor sale at roadside stands. Dogwoods and azaleas bloom profusely \nduring the spring and camellias brighten the landscape during the \nwinter. The dogwood has been adopted as the city's official tree. \nPerry's downtown has been maintained as a colonial-style village with \nspecialty shops and restful atmosphere.\n  More than the festivals, beauty, history or industry, it is the \nwonderful people of Perry who make it such a unique place. Perry \nmanages to maintain a less hectic pace and small town friendliness that \nhas become a rarity in today's hustle-bustle society. There is an \nextremely strong sense of community in Perry as is evident in the \nstrong church attendance, school participation, civic activism and \nneighborhood involvement among Perry's citizens. Additionally, Perry \ncan be claimed as home by such noted national leaders as General \nCourtney Hodges of World War II fame, former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, and \nthe late former Congressman Richard Ray.\n  Mr. President, I warmly request that you and my colleagues join me in \npaying tribute to a jewel of a town, Perry, GA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14650-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            JOHN GIOVANNINI\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ngenuine hero, who paid the ultimate price so that a loved one might \nlive.\n  John Edward Giovannini, born in 1958, was an employee of US Airways \nand a member of the Pennsylvania Air National Guard, stationed in \nHarrisburg, PA. He served in the Marines from 1976 to 1980, and joined \nthe Air National Guard in 1985.\n  On September 13, 1999, while vacationing with his girlfriend and her \nfamily in Ocean City, Maryland, John was faced with a fateful decision. \nWhile enjoying a relaxing day on the beach, the calm was suddenly \nshattered by desperate cries from Kim, the 21-year-old daughter of \nJohn's girlfriend. Kim was swimming in the ocean when a riptide \nthreatened to carry her out to sea. Without concern for his own safety, \nJohn immediately swam out to reach Kim before the current could carry \nher away. Being an exceptionally strong swimmer, John was able to reach \nKim despite the riptide, and began towing her toward the beach. Before \nreaching shore, John became overwhelmed with exhaustion from fighting \nthe strong current. He continued to struggle toward shore, and when \nunable to swim any further, John fought with all his might to keep Kim \nabove water as he cried out for help. Kim's grandmother, Deanna, swam \nout to the pair and successfully helped Kim back to shore. Meanwhile \nJohn's friend, Ron, came to his aid and pulled John the remaining \ndistance to the beach. By the time John reached shore, he was \ncompletely incapacitated, having expended all of his energy in his \neffort to save Kim. The lifeguard and medical technicians were unable \nto revive John, and he died while being transported to the hospital. If \nnot for John's quick actions and refusal to put his own life before \nKim's, she would surely have been swept away.\n  Words can not begin to adequately describe the ultimate sacrifice \nJohn made on that fateful September day. His selfless courage is rarely \ndemonstrated today apart from storybooks and movies. John Giovannini is \ntruly an American hero, and as I extend my heartfelt condolences to \nJohn's loved ones for their tragic loss, I would also like to express \nmy sincere admiration for the courage which John displayed throughout \nthis tragic event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14650-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF CAPTAIN JAMES L. CARDOSO\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nCaptain James L. Cardoso, a native of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, as he \nreceives the Silver Star for gallantry from the United States Air \nForce. Captain Cardoso's daring rescue of a downed F-117 ``Stealth \nFighter'' pilot makes him more than worthy of this prestigious honor. \nIt is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments.\n  On March 27, Captain Cardoso led his helicopter unit through Serbian \nair defenses within 25 miles of Belgrade. His extraordinary effort is \neven more remarkable considering the low visibility and the minimal air \nsupport his unit received in the rescue. He fearlessly led his \nformation, at great personal risk to himself and his crew, in \npenetrating an extremely formidable Serbian air defense system which \nknew of the rescue. In the process, Captain Cardoso successfully \navoided Serbian ground forces located a mere 10 miles away.\n  Despite these difficulties, Captain Cardoso's unit was able to rescue \nthe downed pilot within 45 seconds of landing. He narrowly escaped \nencroaching Serbian forces.\n  Having learned of Captain Cardoso's heroic leadership, I am pleased \nto recognize his efforts. Captain Cardoso's actions saved an American \npilot from enemy hands at a critical time in the Kosovo campaign. By \nhis gallantry and sense of duty, Captain Cardoso has proven a great \ncredit to himself, the State of New Jersey and to the country.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary Vermonter, a gifted parliamentarian, and a true friend, \nRobert Gibson. Bob Gibson served the Vermont Legislature for over 35 \nyears, first as Assistant Secretary of the Senate, and then as \nSecretary of the Senate. In these positions, he provided invaluable \nadvice and counsel to every Senator who has served Vermont, from 1963, \nuntil his death in October.\n  Bob Gibson was born in Brattleboro in 1931, into one of Vermont's \nmost distinguished families, a family dedicated to serving the public \ngood. Bob's grandfather, Ernest Gibson, was president of the state \nSenate in 1908, a U.S. Congressman and a U.S. Senator. His father, \nErnest Gibson, Jr., was an appointed U.S. Senator, Governor of\n\n[[Page S14651]]\n\nVermont, a U.S. District Court judge, a decorated war hero and a close \nfriend of my father. And both of Bob's brothers are exceptional \ncitizens and public servants. His brother, Ernest III, is a former \nVermont Supreme Court Justice and his other brother, David, is a former \nstate's attorney for Windham County.\n  Both Bob Gibson and his father helped me immeasurably in my early \nyears as a lawyer and a legislator. I clerked for Bob's father after \nlaw school, and was impressed by his vast knowledge of and respect for \nour laws, and his dedication to making Vermont a better place. And when \nI was elected to my first public office in 1967, as a Senator from \nRutland County, it was Bob who steered me through the legislative \nprocess and set a standard of bipartisanship that has guided me \nthroughout my career.\n  With a rare sense of fairness and a vast knowledge of the Vermont \nLegislature, Bob extended the same helping hand to every Senator that \nserved in the Chamber during his tenure. Current Vermont State Senator \nfrom Caledonia County, Robert Ide, recently stated, ``Bob Gibson's \nreputation for fairness and honesty was above reproach from any member \nof the Senate. His guidance and respect from the leadership of both \nparties was unparalleled in the Vermont statehouse. He was a true \nfriend and mentor for everyone who served in his classroom, and he will \nbe sorely missed.''\n  Bob Gibson was a positive force in the Senate, who kept lawmakers \nmoving forward in an orderly fashion. He was a positive force in his \nnative Brattleboro, serving the community in a variety of ways before \nmoving to Montpelier and becoming Assistant Secretary. He was a \npositive force in his family, dedicated to his wife, daughters, parents \nand brothers. And he was a positive force to all those who had the \nprivilege of calling him a friend.\n  I pay tribute today to a man who paid tribute every day, to the \nvalues that Vermont holds dear--hard work, honesty and fairness. We \nhave lost a Vermont institution, but Bob Gibson's legacy lives on in \nthe laws he helped to enact and the lives that he touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14651-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nbegin the final hour of debate on the Wellstone amendment at 9:30 a.m. \non Wednesday. By previous consent, the Senate will proceed to a vote on \nthe amendment following the use or yielding back of all the time. A \nvote on the Moynihan amendment, No. 2663, has been ordered to occur \nimmediately following the vote on the Wellstone amendment.\n  Therefore, Senators may expect two back-to-back votes at \napproximately 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. If my plans work out, I prefer to \nhave a third vote immediately afterwards on an amendment on which we \nare working to try to get consent. Then, in addition, other votes may \nbe anticipated during tomorrow's session in an effort to complete the \nfirst session of the 106th Congress.\n  Therefore, Senators should adjust their schedules for the possibility \nof votes throughout the day and also into the evening on Wednesday. The \nleader appreciates the patience and cooperation of all of our \ncolleagues as we attempt to complete the appropriations process.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to renew what I said earlier today. \nWe have taken this bankruptcy bill a long way. When the bill started, \nwe had 320 amendments that had been filed. We are down now to a handful \nof amendments, literally--12 to 15 amendments.\n  I suggest to the majority, after we complete our votes in the \nmorning, we should go immediately to offering some of these amendments. \nI think, without a lot of work tomorrow, we can complete this bill. \nThere is no reason at this stage to even consider invoking cloture; we \nare so close to being able to complete this bill. I can't speak for the \nentire minority, but if a cloture motion were filed at this late day, I \nam confident it would not be passed.\n  I think we should do everything within our power to complete this \nbill before we adjourn.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I don't take exception to anything the \nSenator from Nevada stated. I simply add, we have been on this very \nimportant bankruptcy reform legislation over a week and we have gotten \nto where we are on this legislation only because we have had an extreme \namount of bipartisan cooperation, starting with the introduction of the \nbill by Senator Torricelli and myself, getting it out of the Judiciary \nCommittee in April by a vote of 14-4, awaiting our place in line to \ncome up on the floor of the Senate, and having had considerable success \neliminating a lot of amendments and hoping to get it to conference \nbefore we adjourn for the first session of the 106th Congress.\n  We have had that bipartisan cooperation. I expect to continue to work \nwith the Senator from Nevada; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee; and Senator Torricelli, my \npartner on the subcommittee, to bring this bill to finality.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree there has been bipartisan \nparticipation to this point. However, the majority of the time that has \nbeen spent on this bill has been in quorum calls and other matters. \nRather than being involved in quorum calls, we should proceed on this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/16/senate-section/article/S14651-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
