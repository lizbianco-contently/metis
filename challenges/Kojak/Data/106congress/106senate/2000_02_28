Mr. President, older Americans pay the highest prescription \ndrug costs in the entire world. Because of the high cost and the lack \nof coverage, many of our seniors are being forced to make tough \nchoices. In fact, one in eight seniors is forced to choose between \nbuying food and buying medicine. Many seniors simply do not take drugs \ntheir doctors prescribe because they cannot afford them. Some seniors \ndo not fill one or more of their prescriptions. Others divide their \npills in half. Others, instead of taking half a pill a day, skip days \nand take them every other day. Some older Americans do not buy their \nown prescription medicine so they can buy the prescription medicine \ntheir spouse needs.\n  In a country that is blessed with the economy that we have, and some \nof the best medical researchers in the world, it is disgraceful that \nlifesaving drugs are not being made accessible to our seniors. \nPrescription drugs are a necessary component of modern medicine, and \nour seniors are dependent on them to maintain healthy lives.\n  It used to be, before Medicare came into being, that 4 out of every \n10 seniors who were hospitalized had no health insurance. Now virtually \nall have health insurance. At the time we started Medicare, it was not \nnecessary that we have a prescription drug benefit. Thirty-five years \nlater, it is absolutely important.\n  I have in hand a couple of communications I have received from people \nfrom Nevada. Let me share with you what Michael Rose said:\n\n       I am aware that Medicare reform will be the congressional \n     agenda this year and I would like to share my thoughts with \n     you.\n\n  Skipping one paragraph and getting to the meat of this communication:\n\n       I cannot afford the 5 medications that I currently take if \n     I have to get care elsewhere. Although I will be on the \n     Medicare rolls as of January 2000, I will still not be able \n     to afford my meds. As a manic-depressive, this means that I \n     cannot afford sanity and I am scared beyond your wildest \n     dreams about what will happen to me when the medications run \n     out because I can't afford them.\n       Please vote in favor of including prescription drugs in any \n     Medicare reform package that is considered by the Senate.\n\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, I repeat what he says: I will not be able to afford \nsanity. He takes pills to keep himself sane.\n  I have a communication from Gail Rattigan, who is a registered nurse. \nShe lives in Henderson, NV.\n\n       Senator Reid: I am a [registered nurse] who recently cared \n     for an 82 year old woman who tried to commit suicide because \n     she couldn't afford the medications her doctor had told her \n     were necessary to prevent a stroke. It would be much more \n     cost effective for the government to pay for medications that \n     prevent these serious illnesses than expensive \n     hospitalizations. These include but are not limited to blood \n     pressure medications, anti-stroke anticoagulants, and \n     cholesterol medications. The government's current policy of \n     paying for medications only in the hospital is backward. Get \n     into health promotion and disease promotion and save money. \n     Please share this message with your republican colleagues. \n     Thanks for your support. Sincerely, Gail Rattigan.\n\n  She is right. We need to move on and do something about giving senior \ncitizens who are on Medicare prescription drug benefits. We need to do \nthat at the earliest possible time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I would like to respond to comments made \nover the past week in the press and elsewhere questioning Vice \nPresident Gore's support of the superb agreement negotiated by \nAmbassador Barshefsky with China as part of the WTO accession process. \nI have spoken with the Vice President. I am totally confident that he \nfully supports the Administration's position. He believes that the \nbilateral agreement is an excellent one. He believes that it is vital \nthat the Congress approve permanent normal trade relations status as \nearly as possible this year.\n  The Vice President sent a letter outlining his position to Jerry \nJasinowski, President of the National Association of Manufacturers, on \nFebruary 18. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                February 18, 2000.\n     Mr. Jerry Jasinowski,\n     President, National Association of Manufacturers, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Jerry: As our country turns its attention to the issue \n     of trade, and whether Congress should approve permanent, \n     normalized trade relations with China, I want to share my \n     views.\n       As I have said publicly and privately, I support the \n     agreement reached by our Administration on the terms under \n     which China will be permitted to accede to the World Trade \n     Organization. This agreement was negotiated in order to \n     secure economic and security benefits. Specifically, this \n     agreement obtains meaningful benefits for American workers \n     and companies by expanding and opening the Chinese market. \n     Moreover, this agreement will advance our goal of opening up \n     China to the world. I believe that Congress should enact \n     legislation to secure these goals--in the form in which they \n     have been negotiated--this year.\n       I want you to also understand that I firmly believe in fair \n     and balanced trade agreements. And I agree with President \n     Clinton that future trade negotiations ought to include in \n     the fabric of the agreement both labor and environmental \n     components. Moreover, as I have publicly said to both \n     business and labor audiences, in the future I will insist on \n     the authority to enforce workers' rights and environmental \n     protections in those agreements.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Al Gore.\n\n  In this letter, the Vice President made his position clear: ``I \nbelieve the Congress should enact legislation to secure these goals--in \nthe form in which they have been negotiated--this year.'' A simple, \nunambiguous, clear, and direct statement.\n  I don't understand what the ruckus is all about, and why this issue \ntook on such undue proportions at the Senate Finance Committee hearing \nlast Wednesday. The Vice President's remarks were clear. Ambassador \nBarshefsky's explanation of the Vice President's position was equally \nclear.\n  As far as I am concerned, this issue is closed. Those of us leading \nthe effort in the Congress to secure passage of PNTR this year know \nthat the Vice President will be fully engaged on this issue, along with \nthe President, Ambassador Barshefsky, Secretary Daley, and other \nmembers of the Cabinet.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleagues who have been talking over this past week or so about one of \nthe most critical issues facing America today relative to health care, \nand that is the lack of affordability and lack of access to \nprescription drugs for all of our citizens, but particularly for \nseniors in America.\n  As I go home across my State of South Dakota, one of the issues I \nhear the most about in every community I go to--large and small--is the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  Medicare was created by President Lyndon Johnson as one of the Great \nSociety programs back in the 1960s. At that time, the great unmet \nhealth care need for American seniors was the cost of hospitalization. \nMedicare is not a perfect program, but it has gone a long way toward \nsolving the enormous problem seniors faced at that time--the cost of \nhospitalization. But no prescription drug benefit was added back then, \nand medicine has changed radically over the course of the last 35 \nyears. There is a greater reliance on prescription drugs now. Drugs \nhave become increasingly sophisticated. People are living longer. The \nquality of their lives have been enhanced by the availability--where \nthey can afford it--of prescription drugs. But now the cost of \nprescription drugs is the highest expenditure and highest financial \nburden of all on seniors' health care needs next only to the cost of \nhealth insurance premiums themselves. Yet while there is a great deal \nof rhetoric around Washington, there has been too little action up \nuntil now on this profound issue.\n\n  I wind up talking to a great many seniors in particular on this \nissue. In my home State of South Dakota where we have a lot of people \nwho are former farmers, ranchers, small business people, and employees \nof small business who had no deluxe pension plan or health plan to fall \nback on, for a great many of them Social Security is their lion's share \nif not their total retirement benefit. Medicare is their key health \ncare benefit.\n  Thirty-five percent of seniors in America today have no Medigap \ncoverage whatsoever. In South Dakota that rate would be even higher, \nand people wind up caught in a terrible predicament. It has put a \ntremendous financial burden on a great many people who very frequently \nhave hundreds of dollars a month in prescription drug costs. But the \nproblem is all the more challenging for the great many South Dakotans I \ntalk to who have no Medigap policy, who cannot afford that, and then \nwho wind up literally choosing between groceries and staying on their \nprescriptions. What happens then is all too often they either don't \nfill the prescription or they take half of the pills or they don't take \nthe pill until they become ill again at which time again they show up \nat the emergency room with an acute illness. Then Medicare picks up the \ntab. Then the taxpayers pick up that cost at a much higher cost than \nwould have been the instance if they had been able to stay on \nprescription drugs in the first place.\n  We wind up with a growing problem, which is the inflationary rate for \nthe cost of prescription drugs. They are going up far higher than the \nrate of inflation for the rest of the economy. People are on relatively \nfixed incomes. They are on Social Security and do not have the means \noftentimes to pay for any of these bills at all, or pay for enough of \nthem. All too often what little COLA--cost-of-living adjustment--comes \nalong with Social Security is either consumed entirely by the Medicare \npremium increase or other cost-of-\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nliving increases before they even get to deal with the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  I was in a community in South Dakota not too long ago talking to some \nseniors at a senior center. This is a phenomenon I had never heard ever \nbefore, frankly, where they were telling me--these are some seniors who \nare a little better off than many of the people I talked to; they have \na little more financial means--they were going to Texas and to Arizona \nto snowbird during the winter, but they are paying for the entire cost \nof their snowbird expense by going across the line to Mexico and buying \ntheir prescription drugs for less than half of what they were paying in \nthe United States. The prescription drugs they are buying in foreign \ncountries for half the price are the same branded FDA-approved drugs \nthat people buy in the U.S.\n  It is an outrage when you think about American citizens having to go \nto Canada, having to go to Mexico, and going other places to get their \nmedication cheaper. It seems sometimes that nobody in the \nindustrialized democratic world pays bills anything like our seniors \npay or our citizens in general pay for prescription drugs because it \nisn't only seniors, although clearly seniors who comprise about 12 \npercent of the United States population consume well over a third of \nthe prescription drugs. That isn't surprising given the fact that as \npeople grow older they run into health care problems that are more \nintense and that will require the attention of prescription drugs. But \nthere has to be a remedy for this.\n\n  I appreciate we are talking now about a Medicare benefit that would \ninclude prescription drugs. But, frankly, the bipartisan agreement \nisn't there yet. I am hopeful it will be during the course of this \nshort legislative year.\n  There are a lot of people out there who I think are cynical about how \nmuch Congress is going to accomplish this year given the fact it is a \nPresidential year, and all too often time is spent trying to paint \ndifferences, drawing lines and drawing the parties apart than coming \ntogether in a bipartisan kind of cooperation that I think the American \npublic deserve and what they want to see happen. I think most Americans \nare not left- or right-wingers, but they want the Government to work \nfairly efficiently and come together on these key issues.\n  This is one where I believe we can find some common ground on--not \nnecessarily with huge public expenditures, although if we are going to \nhave a Medicare benefit in the end some additional budgetary \nimplications are certainly involved. And, yes, I think it can be \naddressed without some massive bureaucracy. We can do that as well, \nalthough I worry some when I see these ``Flo ads'' on TV paid by the \npharmaceutical industry having to hire an actress to portray a senior \nby the name of Flo who then goes on about her worries that somehow the \nGovernment might do something about prescription drugs and that would \nbe having the Government enter the medicine chest. This is a fear \ntactic. It is designed to make people worry that if Congress does \nanything about the cost of prescription drugs somehow that will involve \nsome sort of intrusive federalization of our health care. That is a \nfoolish argument and, unfortunately, one that is backed by millions of \ndollars of TV ads and one that I think is cynical in terms of trying to \ndissuade people from believing that there are steps we can take so the \nUnited States no longer is the only democracy in the world paying the \nkind of bills that we pay.\n  I had a study done by one of our committees in the other body to look \nat the prescription drug costs in South Dakota, and to also look at \ncosts around the world. This is no surprise. I have long heard talk \nabout going to Winnipeg and going to Mexico to buy drugs for less. I \nthought perhaps that was anecdotal, and that perhaps it was a systemic \nsituation, but in fact it is reality.\n  The recent studies indicate that if you go to Canada, or to Mexico, \nor to France, or to Britain, or to Germany, or to Italy, or to \nvirtually any other industrialized democracy, the cost of prescription \ndrugs is about half what it is in the United States. Nobody pays the \nkind of bills we pay in the United States. We pay about double what \nanybody else in the industrialized world pays. That to me is so utterly \nunacceptable and unfair. This all comes at a time of great national \nprosperity overall--though you wouldn't always know that in rural \nAmerica. The great pharmaceutical industry is making profits running \nabout three times higher than any other sector of the American economy. \nThey are enormous profits. Of course, we always hear pleas that if we \nhad to develop drugs at a reasonable price, as everything else in the \nworld, that would negatively impact our ability to do research. It is \nnonsense. The profits being earned are far higher than a research \nbudget. We want the pharmaceutical industry to make a reasonable \nprofit. We want them to invest money in research. But they make money \noff research. That is what gives them new things to sell.\n  I don't think that some reduced cost for American citizens in line \nwith what everyone else in the world is paying is going to have some \nsort of catastrophic consequence with the pharmaceutical industry at \nall. All we are looking at is a fair deal, one more consistent with \nwhat everybody else gets.\n  There are a couple of ways to approach this. Keeping in mind that if \nwe do nothing not only is the current severe problem going to grow even \nworse, it is going to grow worse because the inflationary numbers for \nprescription drugs are increasingly going up far higher than the rate \nof inflation.\n  There are a couple of different responses that I think we could take \nin this that do not require us to wait around until we reach some sort \nof grand, bipartisan compromise under the entire revamping of Medicare. \nSomething is going to have to be done long term about Medicare. We all \nknow that. I am not sure if this is the year it is likely to happen as \nwe get into sort of a Presidential-politics-strewn year and it doesn't \neven happen. We don't have to wait until then to do something.\n  I sponsored, with my colleague Senator Kennedy, S. 731, the \nPrescription Drug Fairness For Seniors Act. There is a corresponding \nbill in the House of Representatives, H.R. 664, with over 140 \ncosponsors.\n\n  This legislation simply says to the pharmaceutical industry that we \nwill not set prices, we will not have a bureaucracy sitting in the \nbasement of a building in Washington trying to figure out a fair \nprofit. Some suggest that is what we ought to do. We have done that \nwith utilities. Many States have public utility commissions. \nRecognizing there is no competition in certain sectors of America's \neconomies, they set what a fair profit is and what the prices and \nprofit will be. That is not where I am going with this legislation \ndespite the fact many other countries do.\n  This legislation is consistent with free market. It is \nnonbureaucratic. It simply says to the pharmaceutical industry, if this \nindustry is going to sell their products to other favored buyers, then \ncut Medicare beneficiaries, seniors and the disabled on Medicare, in on \nthe deal, too. Right now a large HMO or Federal agency, is buying \nprescription drugs at 40 percent to 50 percent less than what everybody \nelse in the U.S. is paying.\n  This proposal does not provide free drugs for anyone, but it does put \nAmerican seniors and those disabled individuals on Medicare, who are \nthe ones that purchase the majority of prescription drugs in this \ncountry, on the same playing field as citizens of other nations, who \npay less. When the pharmaceutical industry sells their products to \nfavored customers such as large HMOs, Federal agencies, or other \ncountries for that matter, they are not selling the drugs at a loss. \nThey are making a very handsome profit. We are suggesting if that is \nenough profit for the industry from those customers, why not the same \nfor American citizens? Why not give the same price system to American \ncitizens?\n  Perhaps their negotiated price will go up; it cannot go higher than \nwhat it already is for American citizens. We are suggesting, do not \ndiscriminate against American citizens, and certainly not against \nAmerican seniors. This legislation involves no price fixing, it \ninvolves no bureaucracy, it involves no tax dollars.\n  I am pleased in my home State of South Dakota, we now have over 5,000 \ncitizens who have written to me asking to be named as ``Citizen \nCosponsors''\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nmy legislation, S. 731, the Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act. \nI invite other people and my fellow colleagues who believe we need to \ndo something about this issue now, who believe there should be no \ndiscrimination against American seniors, to join me as a Citizen \nCosponsor. Contact me at my office in Washington. I am happy to sign \ncitizens and my colleagues on. We will indicate to the world this is \nnot an issue that will go away. It is an issue that has enormous grass \nroots support and one that we can do something now about to help with \nthe skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs.\n  We have a second bill, as well, that Senator Dorgan, my colleague \nfrom North Dakota, has been the principal sponsor of that takes a \nsomewhat similar tact--again, involving no bureaucracy, no tax dollars. \nI call it ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander'' \nlegislation, but the formal name of the bill is the International \nPrescription Drug Parity Act, S. 1191.\n  This legislation says if companies sell these drugs to Canada, \nMexico, or elsewhere, allow our pharmacies to reimport these drugs back \ninto the United States. Currently, a citizen can go to these other \ncountries and pick up about a month's supply of drugs for their own \npersonal use, but that is it.\n  We would monitor the drugs to make sure they are not tampered with; \nthat is not an insurmountable problem.\n  In effect, every other country in the Western World seems to have \nfound a way to address this issue, except the U.S. The world's greatest \ndemocracy, the world's greatest economic and military power, is the \nonly country that seems not to have found something to address these \ncosts. We say let the drugs be imported back into the United States. We \nwill ride piggyback on the progressive policies of other countries \nwhere the drugs have been sold for profit, but are branded FDA-approved \ndrugs; bring them back into the United States. Why should South \nDakotans have to get on a bus and go to Winnipeg? Why should they have \nto take a side trip during the wintertime to Mexico? Why should any of \nthis be necessary? This is foolishness. We deserve far better.\n\n  There are some who say this is common sense; why is there any \ncontroversy? The resistance to some of this legislation has been \nfierce. The pharmaceutical industry has been running attack ads against \nmy colleagues in the other body who have sponsored this legislation. \nTelevision ads, radio ads, and print ads can be intimidating. I am \nhopeful we can sit down at the table together.\n  I don't want to demonize or villainize the pharmaceutical industry. \nWe are proud of the research and development that they do. We want them \nto continue doing that. We want them to continue to make a profit. This \nis not some sort of confiscatory plan. We want them to sit down in good \nfaith. If not, we will proceed anyway. This issue has become too \nserious. It has to do with the health care integrity of our Nation.\n  I believe we can make progress with these two middle-of-the-road kind \nof bills, while at the same time working with the President who, to his \ngreat credit, has been talking about ways we can add Medicare \nprescription drug coverage to our health care system in this country. \nIf we do that, we will have resolved one of the most severe problems \nour country faces this year.\n  We need to go on to broader range Medicare reforms. There are things \nthat will have to happen with Social Security, as well. We all know \nthat and hopefully we can reach some bipartisan resolution of those \nissues. In the meantime, every single day that goes by, there are South \nDakota seniors and disabled individuals with high prescription drug \nbills, seniors from all over the country, who are skipping meals, who \nare not taking the drugs they should be taking, who are making terrible \nchoices that the citizens of the world's richest democracy should not \nbe compelled to make. It is just unconscionable that people are given \nthese choices. We should not have to make those decisions. We should \nnot have people showing up with acute illnesses in our emergency room \nwhere taxpayers then pick up the tab because they were not able to \nafford the prescription drugs they need.\n  There are a great many core issues we need to debate this year, from \nworld trade issues to the scope and the nature of the Federal budget, \nto education and so on. However, I submit that among the very top tier \nof issues we need to resolve before this Congress goes home this fall, \nbefore it returns to more politics and campaigning, is to take up these \ntwo bills and to pass needed legislation to address the issue of \nprescription drug affordability.\n  I have no ego involved in the sponsorship here. We need to deal \nconstructively now, this year, with the cost of prescription drugs, \ncertainly for seniors, and hopefully for the entire American public. If \nwe do that, this will have been a year well spent.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S840-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S840-S841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE REACH INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about one of the hot \ntopics in the world of health care--health care access. Many people see \nthis as the biggest problem in health care today.\n  Part of the problem, and the part that has received the most \nattention, is that too many Americans lack health insurance--about 44 \nmillion Americans are not covered by any type of health plan. But an \nequally serious part of the problem is many people's simple inability \nto get access to a health care provider. Even if they have insurance, a \nyoung couple with a sick child is out of luck if they cannot get in to \nsee a pediatrician or another health care provider. And in too many \nurban and rural communities across the country, there just are not \nenough doctors to go around.\n  Several plans have been proposed recently on how to deal with the \nhealth care access problem. Senator Bradley has a plan. The Vice \nPresident has one. There's also a bipartisan proposal for tax credits \nto help people buy health insurance. All of these plans have at least \nthree things in common:\n  First, they all address a worthwhile goal. I think we all want to see \nthat people have access to good health care, even if we might disagree \non how to get there.\n  Second, they are all very ambitious. Senator Bradley in fact is \nbasically proposing to use close to the entire $1 trillion surplus to \nprovide people with health insurance.\n  The third thing these plans have in common--and perhaps the most \nimportant thing--is that it will be difficult or impossible for them to \nbecome law this year. Whether because of policy differences or \npolitical differences, it is just not likely that they will pass.\n  So last week, we launched a bipartisan effort--along with Senators \nHollings, Cochran, Lincoln, Hatch, Hutchinson of Arkansas, I and other \nSenators--called the REACH Initiative, that does have a chance this \nyear. There is no need to wait for an election, we can do it now.\n  Our proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as \ncommunity health centers have been doing to ensure better access to \nhealth care. Health centers are private nonprofit clinics that provide \nprimary care and preventive health care services in medically-\nunderserved urban and rural communities across the country. Partially \nwith the help of Federal grants, health centers provide basic care for \nabout 11 million people every year, 4 million of whom are uninsured.\n  The goal of the REACH Initiative is simple--to make sure more people \nhave access to health care. We plan to achieve this by doubling Federal \nfunding for community health centers over a period of 5 years. We \nbelieve this will allow up to 10 million more women, children, and \nothers in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful \nwith the REACH Initiative, we can practically double the number of \nuninsured and underinsured people cared for at health centers.\n  I am pleased that 12 colleagues--led by my good friend from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings--have joined me to introduce this resolution \ncalling for doubled health center funding over 5 years.\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\n  The REACH Initiative basically recognizes the key contributions that \ncommunity health centers have already made in addressing the health \ncare access problems. But there is so much more that can still be one.\n  Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, \nwhy are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for \nadditional funding?\n  No. 1, they are building on an existing program that produces \nresults. Too many health care proposals want to start practically from \nscratch, and make breathtakingly revolutionary changes. When I look at \nthe health system and its admittedly huge problems, I sometimes think \nthat might not be a bad idea. But it is also extremely risky. We need \nto remember that despite the many flaws in our health system, many \npeople are pleased with it. We should be wary about making too radical \nchanges that could interfere with what is right in our system. Instead, \nwe can expand an existing part of the system that has been proven to \nprovide cost-effective, high-quality care.\n  No. 2, health centers play a crucial role in health care, and are \nvastly underappreciated. It is amazing to me how few people know what \ncommunity health centers are. After all, health centers care for close \nto one out of every 20 Americans, one out of every 12 rural residents, \none out of every 6 low-income children, and one of every 5 babies born \nto low-income families.\n  No. 3, health centers truly target the health care access problem. By \ndefinition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' \ncommunities--which simply means places where people have serious \nproblems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the \nproblem right at its source. Unlike other health care proposals, the \nREACH Initiative does not create problems of ``crowding out'' private \ninsurance by replacing private dollars spent on health insurance with \nFederal dollars. The health centers are partially funded by those \npatients who do have health insurance.\n  No. 4, they are relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary \nand preventive care for one person for less than $1 per day--about $350 \nper year. That's just about the best value you will ever see in health \ncare. Even better, health centers are able to leverage each grant \ndollar from the Federal Government into additional funding from other \nsources--meaning they can effectively turn one grant dollar into \nseveral dollars that can be used to address health care problems. With \nan extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH Initiative in \nits fifth year--health centers could be caring for an additional 10 \nmillion people.\n  No. 5, this initiative is not a government takeover of health care. \nAdmittedly, our plan calls for more government spending. This is of \ncourse true for most plans that try to deal with health access \nproblems. But this new funding would not go to create a huge new \nbureaucracy. Instead, the REACH Initiative would invest additional \nfunds into private organizations that have consistently proven \nthemselves to be efficient, high-quality, and cost-effective health \ncare providers.\n  To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need \nfor drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers \nare already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can \nstill help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who \ndesperately needs care.\n  Simply put, we must reach the goal of the REACH initiative--doubled \nfunding for health care centers within 5 years--and we can and should \nmake it happen.\n  Let me close with what this means in human terms.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure that a young woman who has \njust found out she is pregnant but does not have health insurance has a \nplace to get prenatal care so she does not risk her health and the \nbaby's health by waiting until late in the pregnancy.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure that a 6-year-old boy who is \nliving in a deep rural Missouri community, a community that otherwise \nwould not have any health care providers at all, has a place to get \nregular checkups so he can stay healthy at home and in school.\n  The REACH initiative will help make sure a young couple without \nanyplace to go will be able to get their infant daughter immunized to \nprotect her from a variety of dreaded diseases.\n  The REACH initiative will make sure Americans like Denise Hall, a \nWashington, DC, resident, and her children have a place to get needed \ncare. Denise joined us for our announcement last week and talked about \nher reliance on health care centers. The REACH initiative will make \nsure she and her children have a place to get needed care. Denise, at \nour press conference kicking off the REACH initiative, said she is an \nout-of-work mother of two who is working to improve her job skills so \nshe can rejoin the workforce. But for the moment, she and her children \nsimply have nowhere to go for health care needs other than a local \ncommunity health center.\n  These Americans, and millions like them, are the reasons why we must \nmake the REACH initiative--doubled funding for community health \ncenters--become a reality. I invite my colleagues to join me and 12 \nothers who cosponsored this resolution, and 29 distinguished health \ncare organizations, in support of the REACH initiative. If we work \ntogether, we can make a difference and serve those who are in the \ngreatest need of access to health care and who, without community \nhealth centers, will not have that access.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have seen in the last several months, \nand I suspect we will continue to see from now until the end of this \nadministration, a considerable effort to implement programs that bypass \nthe Congress, programs that, indeed, bypass public input into those \nprograms.\n  We have seen a great many Executive orders regarding regulations that \nhave had limited, if any, public input. We have seen the use of the \nAntiquities Act and a number of other activities of this kind.\n  It is important that we remember the constitutional requirements of \nthis Government, that there is a division within Government. That is \nwhat the legislative, executive, and judicial branches were designed to \ndo, and they were purposely put in place to ensure that none of the \nthree branches developed a domineering position and became a czar of \nthe Government.\n  It is terribly important we take a look at this in Congress; that we \nensure, to the extent we can, that this does not happen; that there is, \nindeed, as we move forward with various programs--whether they be \nregulatory, whether they be legislative--an opportunity for people to \nparticipate.\n  The current regulatory system encompasses more than 50 Federal \nagencies, more than 126,000 workers, and annual spending of more than \n$14 billion in the area regulations.\n  From April 1, 1996, until March 31, 1999, Federal agencies issued \nnearly 13,000 final rules. Of these, 188 were major final rules that \neach carried an annual cost of more than $100 million in our Nation's \neconomy.\n  The paperwork burden of these Federal regulations is approaching $190 \nbillion annually. A recent study by the American Enterprise Institute \nconcluded that all EPA rules promulgated between mid-1982 and mid-1996 \nunder environmental statutes such as Superfund, the Clean Water Act, \nToxic Substances Control Act, and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide \nand Rodenticide Act, have had negative net benefits; that is, they hurt \nmore than they helped.\n  When these regulations come into place, we hear that there is going \nto be a partnership, a partnership between the communities, a \npartnership between the State, a partnership with the Federal \nGovernment. Unfortunately, it has been our experience, particularly in \nthe area of public lands, the partnership is a little one sided, a one-\nhorse, one-dog arrangement, not an equal partnership.\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\n  One example is the clean water action plan, an Executive order \nestablishing 111 key actions designed to improve the Nation's remaining \nwater impairment problems. Everyone wants to do that. Imagine putting \ninto place in one move 111 different regulatory actions, done without \nthe NEPA process, without the process of input, without the process of \nhaving public discussion.\n  The administration has requested roughly $2 billion annually since \n1998 for implementation. It has been an interesting process, \nparticularly with EPA and the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, which is taking a strong look at this and, in one instance, \ndeclared this agency had gone beyond its statutory authority.\n  One of the difficulties is, first of all, the nonpoint source idea \nwhich was never authorized in the Clean Water Act. It was only point \nsources which were authorized.\n  What is happening now is they have moved toward an implementation of \nthe plan that is designed more to control the land use than, in fact, \nto control nonpoint source water.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency structured the plan around data \nthat the GAO, the Government auditing organization, has criticized. In \n1999, GAO cautioned the methodology used in determining both impairment \nlevels and impacts from nonpoint source was underfunded and, \nconsequently, results were very possibly inaccurate.\n  Specifically, GAO highlighted concerns relating to how the agency \nidentified waters polluted by nonpoint sources, the need for more data \nto develop cost estimates, and the extent to which the Federal \nGovernment contributes to water pollution.\n  Instead of pulling back, having found out this information, EPA is \nmoving forward with the implementation of the program. States and \nimpacted industries have complained to EPA through the Congress, \nthrough the committees, that EPA's plan places a financial burden and \namounts to an unfunded mandate.\n  This could be reasonable, if they went through the process of \ninvolving people before putting the regulations in place. But when the \nregulations are put there by fiat, certainly that is not something we \nexpect to happen and should not allow to happen in our system of \ngovernment.\n  Even USDA wrote a letter, saying when they were doing these \nactivities in the old Soil Conservation Service, they were much more \nefficient. When we questioned EPA about that, they got the Secretary of \nthe Department of Agriculture to change his mind and say: I really did \nnot mean that at all.\n  Of course, 2 weeks ago I was in Wyoming for a week. Half of Wyoming \nbelongs to the Federal Government. Much of our State is in public \nownership. The use of those lands is vital to the economy. A multiple-\nuse concept is what has made these lands useful, not only to preserve \nthe environment, which can be done, but as well to be able to use them \nfor hunting, recreation, grazing, mineral production--all the things \nthat go together to make up an economy in the West.\n  Now we are faced with some other propositions. In this case, the \nForest Service has declared by regulatory fiat that there would be 40 \nmillion acres dedicated to roadless areas. Of course, we have roadless \nareas in the public lands. We have wilderness that has been set aside \nby congressional action. By the way, when it was set aside in Wyoming, \nthe statute also said there would be no more wilderness set aside \nunless Congress made that proposal.\n  It has been very difficult. We have had several hearings with the \nSecretary of Agriculture and the Chief of the Forest Service to \ndetermine what ``roadless'' means, whether or not it is another way of \nhaving wilderness areas. The interesting part of it is, most of the \nlands that have been structured in this plan for roadless areas have \nroads on them; they are not roadless at all. But the Forest Service has \ndone nothing to identify or solicit cooperating non-Federal agencies in \nthe EIS.\n  Several of our States have asked to be cooperating agencies, which is \nwhat the Environmental Quality Group in the White House has said they \nare going to implement in all these kinds of programs, but the Forest \nService has said: No, we are not going to have the States; we are not \ngoing to have the counties; we are not going to have these non-Federal \nagencies participate.\n  Hearings were held. Actually, they were not hearings; they were \ninformation systems. People were invited to come, but there was no \ninformation there. They were asked to respond to something without \nknowing what was being done. So there was really not public involvement \nof that kind.\n  The other thing is that we already have forest plans in place. Each \nforest is required to have a forest plan. I have no objection to the \nidea of limited roads, but it ought to be done in a way in which people \ncan participate, and it ought to be done in a way in which Congress can \nparticipate. We are finding more and more of that happening in this so-\ncalled land legacy that is being put forth by the administration.\n  Last week, the Secretary of the Interior announced there would be \nliterally millions of acres of Bureau of Land Management lands that \nwould be set aside simply for their scenic value. That is very \nimportant to western public land States, where much of that land is \npart of our economy. It can be preserved for the environment. However, \nwe also have to have multiple use. Those things will go together.\n  The Antiquities Act is another. In 1996, we put into law the \nCongressional Review Act which requires regulations be submitted to the \nCongress. They are interpreted by OMB. Those that have over $100 \nmillion of value or cost are submitted to the Congress, with an \nopportunity to take a look--oversight--to see if those regulations are \ncarrying out the spirit of the legislation which authorized them or, \nindeed, to see if in some cases they are being put into place without \nany statutory or regulatory authority.\n  Unfortunately, it has not worked well. The idea was to have it come \nto the Congress. It has to go through OMB first to decide whether it \nhas the $100 million impact. Then it comes to the Congress, but the \nCongress has not had an opportunity to deal with it.\n  Unfortunately, from April 1 of 1996 until March 1 of 1999, Federal \nagencies issued, as I said before, 13,000 final rules. And 188 fell \nwithin this category of $100 million. Unfortunately, not one has been \nchanged by the Congress because this bill is not workable.\n  We have to make it work. We need to create a congressional regulatory \nanalysis group that has the opportunity to look into these bills. Much \nlike CBO, Congress needs an entity to take a look at them. Right now, \nunfortunately, it does not work. I think certainly we have to do \nsomething to keep this administration from running roughshod over my \nconstituents' interests, the Presiding Officer's constituents' \ninterests, and others. There needs to be this balance. I think the \nCongressional Review Act could be that balance, if it has some changes.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Utah for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to note two events, one historic \ntoday and one somewhat historic tomorrow--one looking a little bit back \nwith some nostalgia and the other looking back with some degree of \nfinality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S842-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S842-S844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today, the 28th of February, is the 150th \nanniversary of the founding of the University of Utah. We look back \nwith nostalgia but also look forward with great excitement at the \nfuture of that particular university.\n  It is a university to which I am attached both in personal life and \nby legacy. Both of my parents graduated from the University of Utah. My \ntwo brothers and two sisters attended the University of Utah. I \ngraduated from the University of Utah. My wife attended the University \nof Utah. We are a Utah family.\n  The university started on the 28th of February, 1850. For those who \nunderstand Utah history, they will realize that the State, at least to \nthe degree it is now, began on the 24th of July, 1847. So for those who \nfounded the State, to focus on the creation of the University of \nDeseret, as they then called it, so quickly after they arrived in Salt \nLake Valley is a testimony to their vision and their determination to \nmake higher education a very key part of their lives.\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\n  At that time, there was no infrastructure in the community. There \nwere barely farmhouses and farms that had been created. The first \nclasses of the University of Deseret were held in private homes.\n  The university has come a long way since that time. It is now \nrecognized as one of the premier universities in the United States in a \nnumber of areas. The one that they are perhaps best known for is in \nmedicine. The University of Utah is the site of the first artificial \nheart. It has been the site of other medical breakthroughs. It is \ncurrently the home of the Huntsman Cancer Center--a $100 million gift \nfrom the Huntsman family to fight cancer in the United States. The \nHuntsman family decided that the medical school at the University of \nUtah was sufficiently in the forefront that it would be the place they \nwould have the Huntsman Cancer Center.\n  One other interesting thing that goes back to the founding of the \nUniversity of Deseret that I think we need to recognize with respect to \nwhat the University of Utah is and can do in the future is its physical \nproximity to the genealogical records that are maintained by the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n  A few months ago, I had a medical researcher come into my office in \nSalt Lake City, a man who by virtue of his credentials could have gone \nvirtually anywhere in the world, to tell me how excited he was to be at \nthe University of Utah.\n  His specialty, an area of greatest medical concern, is dealing with \nthe disease of diabetes. He went on to point out to me how diabetes \nmany times is the disease that then causes other diseases. He said, \nstatistically people may die from something other than diabetes but, in \nfact, it was the diabetes in the first instance that caused them to get \nwhatever it was to which they were recorded as having succumbed. He \nsaid: The reason I am excited about being at the University of Utah is \nthat the records available in the family history library of the Church \nof Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints make it possible for researchers \nat the University of Utah to trace the family history of people with \nthis particular disease in a way no other body of data can. It is a \nunique experience to be here where you have that kind of link.\n\n  Of course, when the University of Deseret was founded, it was founded \nwith the full support and, indeed, almost sole support of the leaders \nof the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. So it is \nappropriate even now, as the university has become a State institution, \ncertainly separate from the church and any of its hierarchy, that there \nis still the kind of intellectual synergy that can come out of the \nproximity of the university and the work the church is doing in another \narea.\n  The University of Utah stands as the flagship research school in my \nState and, if I may be parochial a little, perhaps for a large part of \nthe West. There are many things done at the University of Utah that \nradiate beyond our State borders, not only in medicine but in other \nfields as well. We have a first-class law school to go with the medical \nschool. We give Ph.D. degrees in a wide variety of subjects. The \nUniversity of Utah is proud to have been in this business for 150 \nyears. I am proud, as a Utah man, to stand on the floor of the Senate \nand pay tribute to the university and to those farsighted individuals \nwho founded it 150 years ago today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I would like to offer congratulations \nto the University of Utah on the 150th anniversary of its founding.\n  In 1850, just three years after the pioneers reached the dusty and \ndesolate Salt Lake Valley, the General Assembly of the State of Deseret \npassed an ordinance to create the first university to be established \nwest of the Missouri. Despite some stressful financial times, it \npersevered; and, in 1892, the territorial legislature changed its name \nto the University of Utah.\n  The Utah pioneers began an institution that would serve as the \nintellectual and cultural cornerstone for the state of Utah and for the \nWest. With its humble beginnings in a private home, the University of \nUtah has become the embodiment of the pioneering spirit that conceived \nit.\n  The University of Utah--the ``U''--has led the way in a number of \nareas, including research, teaching, and public service.\n  Academically, the University makes significant contributions in the \nWest and in the nation. The Honors Program is the third oldest in the \nnation. The graduate school of Architecture has the Intermountain \nWest's only program in historical preservation. The College of \nHumanities has the Intermountain West's only joint master of public \nadministration in Middle East studies.\n  Additionally, the University of Utah's work in health sciences, where \nthe first artificial heart was developed, in supercomputing and \ncomputer modeling, and in cosmic-ray research, where the U is home to \nthe one-of-a-kind ``Fly's Eye,'' has contributed significantly to the \nUniversity's growing reputation both nationally and internationally. \nThe University of Utah currently ranks in the first tier of American \nresearch institutions according to the Carnegie Foundation.\n  Henry Eyring, a world renowned chemist and professor noted in 1946 \nthat, ``the stature of the university would rise through advancements \nof science and technology.'' And so it has. The faculty and students \nrepresenting all 50 states and 102 foreign countries have built the U \ninto a premier research institution.\n  A pioneer in computer graphics, David Evans, after studying \nelectrical engineering at the University, became chair in 1965 of the \nfledgling department of computer science. He oversaw the education of \nindividuals who went on to groundbreaking careers in computing \nincluding, Alan Kay, vice president of Disney Imagineering; Jim Clark, \nfounder of Silicon Graphics, Inc.; John Warnock, co-founder of Adobe \nSystems; and, Edwin Catmull: co-founder of Pixar.\n  The medical school, started in 1905, has made great strides in \nmedicine that are recognized throughout the world. Dr. Philip Price, \nformer chair of the Department of Surgery said, ``The essence of the \npioneer spirit as I see it, is the courage to tackle an un-ideal \nsituation, trying hard with faith and intelligence to build something \nideal out of it. That's what I would like to see done, and have a part \nin.''\n  In 1946, the U.S. Public Health Service awarded its first grant to a \nmedical school so that the University of Utah could study muscular \ndystrophy. The receipt of this first grant for medical research set the \nstage for the University's subsequent success in medical research.\n  Dr. Willem Kolff began the division of Artificial Organs and the \nInstitute for Biomedical Engineering in 1967. His pioneering work on \nboth an artificial kidney and heart led to a number of medical \nbreakthroughs, including the world's first artificial heart \ntransplanted into Dr. Barney Clark in 1982.\n  That was a great thrill for all of us from Utah.\n  More recently, there have been a number of major leaps taken in \ngenetic research at the Eccles Institute of Human Genetics. Scientists \nhave found dozens of genes for human diseases including cancer, heart \ndisease, neurological conditions, birth defects, and blindness. And, \nthe Huntsman Cancer Institute is becoming an international leader in \nthe discovery of new ways to diagnose, treat, cure, and prevent cancer.\n  The University of Utah has also played a central role in the \ndevelopment of Utah in the arts and athletics. In 1948, the Utah \nSymphony was invited to make its home on the campus, establishing the \nUniversity as home for various cultural events for the public. For the \npast decade, the Modern Dance Department ranks among the top three in \nNorth America along with the ballet program, which is the nation's \nfirst college ballet degree program.\n  The University of Utah's skiing and women's gymnastics programs have \neach won ten national titles, and the Runnin' Utes basketball team made \nit to the NCAA national championship finals in 1998. The football team \nhas made numerous bowl game appearances.\n  Of course, to me, as an alumnus of BYU, the best thing to come out of \nthe University of Utah was in 1875 when the University's Provo branch \nwas split off to become the Brigham Young Academy and eventually \nBrigham Young University. It would be impossible for any Utahn not to \nat least mention this historic rivalry.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  It is difficult to do justice to the myriad of accomplishments of the \nUniversity of Utah's faculty and alumni in this brief statement.\n  Suffice it to say that, after 150 years, the University of Utah still \ndraws on the courageous and adventurous spirit of Utah's pioneers. The \nachievements and ideas of the faculty and graduates have multiplied \nacross the geographic and academic frontiers of our country. The \nUniversity's proud heritage and traditions have established its values \nand lighted the path; but, without a doubt, the trail is still being \nblazed.\n  I might add that as a young boy living in Pittsburgh, PA, wanting to \nsupport anything from Utah, I can remember the great University of Utah \nchampionship basketball teams with Arnie Ferrin, Vern Gardner, Wat \nMisaka, and others who were terrific athletes who made the University \nof Utah a household name in basketball during those years. Of course, \nthey have been an inspiration to me ever since. In fact, it has been a \nthrill for me to meet some of those people, and especially become a \nfriend of the great Arnie Ferrin who was the University of Utah's great \nAll American during those years and later played professional \nbasketball as well.\n  Again, my congratulations to the students, alumni, faculty, and \nadministrators of the University of Utah on reaching this significant \nmilestone. It is a great university. I support it very strongly, and I \nthink everyone in Utah does as well. I am grateful to be able to make \nthis statement on its behalf.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S844-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S844-S845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE Y2K COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I said, I have two items to \ncommemorate. That is the first one, an item of some nostalgia looking \nforward. The second one actually is tomorrow, but I will take advantage \nof being here now to talk about something that comes to an end \ntomorrow.\n  The Presiding Officer was intimately involved, as he served as a \nmember of the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \nProblem, a committee that officially goes out of existence tomorrow. \nThere were many who said, when the committee was formed: There is \nnothing so permanent as a temporary government program. You will find \nan excuse somehow, some way, to keep this committee alive for years.\n  It is with some pride I point out that we are not doing that. The \ncommittee was organized to deal with the year 2000 technology problem. \nThe committee dealt with the problem. The committee was scheduled to go \nout of existence on February 29, when presumably the problem would be \nbehind us. The problem is behind us, and the committee will disband as \nof tomorrow.\n  I pay tribute to the vice chairman of the committee, Christopher \nDodd, the Senator from Connecticut. As chairman of the committee, I \ncould not ask for a better partner. I could not ask for a more \ncooperative or dedicated partner in working on this particular problem. \nWe acknowledge the other members of the committee, starting with the \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair, Senator Kyl from Arizona; Senator \nMoynihan from New York; Senator Smith from Oregon; Senator Edwards from \nNorth Carolina, who was preceded on the committee by Senator Bingaman \nfrom New Mexico; Senator Lugar from Indiana, who was preceded on the \ncommittee by the junior Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins; and then, of \ncourse, the two ex officio members of the committee who attended \ncommittee hearings, paid attention to the committee activities, and \ncontributed significantly to it, that is, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens and \nSenator Byrd.\n\n  There are many people who say: Well, you really didn't have a \nproblem, did you? You formed this committee, and then, look, nothing \nhappened with respect to Y2K.\n  It reminds me a little of the story attributed to Bob Hope, who said: \nYou know, I really don't appreciate the way the Army treats me when I \ngo out on these USO tours over the holidays. At Christmas, I go all \naround the world to put on shows for the GIs. They tell me I am going \ninto dangerous parts of the world, so they use me as a pin cushion; \nthey fill me full of shots before I go. It is a complete waste of time \nbecause I have never gotten sick once in any of these places.\n  I think that can be said to a certain extent with respect to the Y2K \nproblem. Many people are saying: Gee, you wasted all our time and \nmoney. Look, nothing happened.\n  The record is fairly clear that had we, as a Nation, not focused on \nthis issue and dealt with it, we would have had very significant \nproblems.\n  When the committee was formed, I set one goal, among others, which I \nbelieve we very much met and I feel very proud about having achieved. \nAs we looked out over the Nation and, indeed, the world with respect to \nthe Y2K problem, the one thing that was clear was that no one knew the \nextent of the problem. No one knew how it was going to play out, and \nthere was no place one could go to get that information. So I \nchallenged the staff as well as the members of the committee.\n  I said: If we do nothing else in this committee, we will become the \nrepository of accurate information about Y2K. All over the world, \npeople will know that if they want to find the best source of where \nthings are with respect to Y2K, they will want to come to the Senate \nSpecial Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem.\n  I believe we met that challenge. I believe by the last few months of \nY2K, it was recognized virtually around the world that the Senate \nreports on Y2K were the most authoritative, the most complete, and \nultimately the most dependable.\n  A lot of people don't realize we were saying in those last few \nmonths: There will not be a Y2K problem in the United States. I used to \nsay that in speeches, and I would have people challenge me: How can you \nsay that? Sometimes they would quote my own earlier speeches back to me \nbecause early on I was raising the alarm and predicting significant \nproblems. I was predicting those problems on the basis of the \ninformation then available. But as the committee fulfilled its function \nand became the repository of accurate information, committee spokesmen \nand women would stand and say again and again: We are probably not \ngoing to have any serious problems in the United States.\n  Then people said to us: Well, why did you miss it overseas? There \nweren't serious problems overseas?\n  I have two observations on that. First, we did not have the same \ndegree of accurate information about situations overseas that we had in \nthe United States. We were unable to reach the same level in dealing \nwith information that came from outside the country as we did from \ninformation within the country. Second, we had more problems overseas \nthan the press has reported. There were many people who were simply \nembarrassed about their Y2K problem and didn't talk about it. Indeed, \nwe had some examples before the committee of problems that did exist \nand were later denied simply because of the embarrassment people would \nfeel if they admitted they had had difficulties.\n  The ultimate question is: Was it worth it? Did we, in fact, make a \ncontribution worth the amount of money we spent to staff this \ncommittee? I say without any hesitation, yes, it was very much worth \nit. We are seeing benefits over and above the contribution the \ncommittee made to alleviating the problem.\n  John Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense, has publicly stated: If it \nwere not for the process we went through to deal with Y2K in the \nDefense Department, we would have had serious Y2K problems and we would \nnot have the information we now have.\n  In responding to the pressure from Y2K, the Defense Department, for \nthe first time in its history, now has an inventory of all of their \ncomputer systems together with a ranking as to which of those systems \nare mission critical and which are not. One might think in a straight \nmanagement assignment the Defense Department would have that \ninformation anyway. They did not have it before we caused them, in an \neffort to respond to the inquiries from the committee, to go through \nthe process of gathering it.\n  Alan Greenspan has been quoted as saying that in American industry at \nlarge, the effect of the Y2K remediation activity has caused American \nbusiness men and women to understand\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\ntheir vulnerability and dependability on computers in a way they never \nunderstood before and that the investment of bringing everything up to \nthe highest possible level is an investment that will pay significant \nfinancial dividends for the economy in the years ahead.\n  So as I look back on those activities and those accomplishments, I \nexpress satisfaction for the work of the committee, a degree of \nsatisfaction for whatever contribution I may have been able to make as \nits chairman but ultimately enormous gratitude to the members of the \ncommittee and to the members of the staff.\n  When Senator Dodd and I were appointed, respectively, as vice \nchairman and chairman of this group, we made the determination we would \nnot have a partisan staff. While it was partisan in the formal sense \nthat there was a minority director and so on, it was housed in the same \nfacility; the members of the staff were majority or minority and worked \ntogether on a daily basis. We had a number of detailees from a variety \nof agencies who came to us and brought a level of professional \nexpertise we could never have achieved in any other way. We maintained \nthroughout the entire exercise a determination to get the job done that \nwas not interfered with by any attempt at staff bickering or posturing \nfor any partisan purposes.\n  I pay tribute to Senator Dodd for his willingness to join me and, \nindeed, for his leadership in pushing me in that direction, and to the \npeople whom he appointed as minority members of the staff. I also pay \ntribute to the administration and John Koskinen, who held the position \non behalf of the President. There, also, there was no partisanship and \nno posturing for any partisan advantage.\n  For the sake of the record, I want to read into the Record the names \nof the staffers who helped us with this accomplishment. They are: \nRobert Cresanti, staff director. Before being staff director, he worked \nwith me on the Banking Committee to raise the initial alarm with \nrespect to this possibility. T.M. Wilke Green, appointed by Senator \nDodd as minority staff director; John B. Stephenson, who came from the \nGAO, the deputy staff director. Then we had Thomas Bello, professional \nstaff; Tania Calhoun, committee counsel; James P. Dailey, professional \nstaff; Paul Hunter, professional staff--these people were absolutely \nmagnificent in the degree of expertise and professionalism they brought \nto us--Unice Lieberman, minority press secretary; Sara Jane MacKay, \nlegislative correspondent; Don Meyer, press secretary; J. Paul \nNicholas, professional staff; Frank Reilly, professional staff; Noelle \nBusk Ringel, our archivist. The clerk was Amber Sechrist, who came out \nof my office in a very professional and solid way. We also had Ronald \nSpear, professional staff, and Deborah Steward, GPO representative.\n  To all of these men and women, I pay tribute and extend my warmest \nthanks and gratitude for the work they have done. Tomorrow, off the \npresses will come ``Y2K Aftermath--Crisis Averted, Final Committee \nReport.'' With the issuance of this report, the committee no longer \nexists. But as Secretary Hamre, Chairman Greenspan, and others have \nsaid, the benefits of the committee will live on over and above \nwhatever benefits we had for averting the crisis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, later today I will join Senators Ionuye, \nWarner and Levin in hosting a reception to bid farewell to Joe and Dede \nRalston, as General Ralston concludes his second tour as Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs.\n  Happily, this event does not signify General Ralston's retirement, \nbut his advancement to the position of Supreme Allied Commander Europe, \nin charge of all NATO forces, and all U.S. Forces stationed in Europe.\n  Joe Ralston has pursued a career of firsts, and breakthrough \nleadership success. His assignment as the first Air Force officer to \ncommand NATO is typical, and indicative, of his tremendous talents, and \nforce of personality.\n  Remarkably, Joe Ralston has achieved success in several distinct \nmilitary disciplines over his career, spanning more than 34 years.\n  Joe Ralton's military career is founded in his experience as a combat \nand command pilot during the Vietnam war. During two combat tours, in \nF-105 fighters and F-105 wild weasel jets, Joe honed his warfighting \nskills.\n  In the 1980's and early 1990's General Ralston played a key role in \nthe technological revolution in air warfare. While many of these \nprograms are still very sensitive, the direct impact of General \nRalston's service in technology development and acquisition played a \nprominent role in our victories in Desert Storm and Kosovo.\n  Moving into more senior leadership positions, General Ralston \ncontributed to reorganization of the Air Force during his tenure as \ncommander of the 11th Air Force, Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff of \nPlans and Operations and Commander of the Air Combat Command.\n  Most recently, General Ralston served with great distinction as Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  Over these past four years, General Ralston has left and indelible \nmark on our nation's military, now, and for many years ahead.\n  An architect of the 1997 Quadrennial Defense Review, General Ralston \nhelped shape the force structure and training doctrine now followed by \nour Nation's Armed Forces.\n  The modernization plan presented in the QDR has moved us forward on \nrecaptilizing our air and naval forces, and achieving Secretary Cohen's \ngoal of $60 billion for procurement for FY 2001.\n  These accomplishments proceeded during a period of overseas military \nactivity across the globe unmatched since the end of the Second World \nWar.\n  My colleagues here recognize that I have not always supported this \nadministration's policies in the deployment of U.S. Forces overseas.\n  Regardless of how and why those deployments commenced, the \nperformance and success of the U.S. military in these assignments \nreflects the leadership that General Ralston and all the Joint Chiefs \nhave provided.\n  Looking ahead, to the continued opportunity for service General \nRalston has accepted in moving to the Supreme Allied Commander job, \nthis will be his toughest challenge.\n  General Ralston proceeds to Brussels following another great American \nCommander, General Wes Clark.\n  Having visited General Clark many times at his headquarters, and in \nthe Balkans, there is no question that he provided the glue that held \nthe alliance together in Bosnia and Kosovo.\n  General Clark did so facing limitations unlike those encountered by \nany previous alliance commander. He merits our accolades.\n  General Ralston succeeds General Clark in an era where our allies \nmust decide the nature of their military forces in the future, and the \nrole of Europe, compared to NATO, in future security matters.\n  To me, there is no officer in the U.S. military today better \nprepared, by experience or temperament, to accept this challenge.\n  While that is a strong claim, I make this comment to the Senate based \non my personal experience in watching General Ralston command.\n  Catherine and I have known Joe and Dede Ralston since 1992, when they \narrived in Alaska to take on the responsibility of commanding all U.S. \nmilitary forces in my State.\n  Joe immediately established himself as not just a military commander, \nbut a real Alaskan.\n  In fact, as Joe and Dede saw the close of this assignment as Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs approaching, they made plans to establish \na home in Alaska--coming home as neighbors.\n  While disappointed that we cannot look forward to their imminent \nreturn to Alaska, I join all Alaskans in congratulating General Ralston \non the successful conclusion of his tenure as\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and wishing him well as he proceeds \nto this next position of military and diplomatic responsibility.\n  I am confident that I can also speak for my colleagues here in the \nSenate in that wish, and commitment to work with General Ralston to \nmeet the needs of our own military forces in Europe, and foster \ncontinued close ties with NATO.\n  Let me also take one moment to welcome General Ralston's successor as \nVice Chairman, General Dick Myers.\n  Senator Inouye and I enjoyed a close relationship with General Myers \nduring his tenure as commander of the Pacific Air Forces, which \nincluded units in our States of Alaska and Hawaii.\n  Most recently, General Myers served as Commander in Chief of the U.S. \nSpace Command. I know he will bring the same skills and judgment to \nthis position that he demonstrated in these earlier assignments.\n  All Senators are invited to the reception at 5 p.m. this afternoon in \nS-128, in honor of the conclusion of General Ralston's tenure as Vice \nChairman.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to take just a few \nminutes to express why so many of us are sad to see Joe and Dede leave \nWashington, but proud of their service, and the new challenges they \nwill assume on behalf of our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Iowa for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, presently we are experiencing the \ncountry's highest petroleum prices this decade. And there is every \nindication the price is going to go higher and higher. I think we need \nto start looking at why and not look at where to place blame. I think \nwe have to find a common sense solution to the situation because it's \nnot going to get any better in the short term even if OPEC decides to \npump more oil and ship more oil to the United States. The fact of the \nmatter is that regardless whether OPEC complies with our wishes there \nare still two reasons we are bound to face a similar dilemma again in \nthe future.\n  The No. 1 reason is that the United States and other energy-consuming \nnations are going to continue to consume a greater amount of gasoline \nand petroleum products over the next several decades. The demand is \ngoing to increase.\n  The second reason is that as long as OPEC remains a powerful cartel \nwilling to violate the principles of a free marketplace and continue \nits stranglehold on the production of oil, it will be able to radically \neffect our economy and financial stability.\n  As I look at how this administration is responding to the high price \nof oil, all I can see is that Secretary of Energy Richardson has been \ndispatched to the various oil-producing nations. The administration in \na sense is having the Secretary get down on his knees and beg for OPEC \nnations to produce more oil. Even if he is successful--some indications \nare that he might be to the tune of 1 million or 1\\1/2\\ million \nbarrels--it is going to be another 60 days before that oil makes any \nimpact on the price of gasoline at the pump in my State of Iowa or \nanyplace in the United States. Regardless of whether he is successful \nor not, this is a pretty poor energy policy.\n  Every time the price of oil gets so high that administration sends \nthe Secretary of Energy around to beg for more oil to be produced, we \nought to be looking at what we can do to be energy independent. This \nsort of extreme energy policy that President Clinton has seemingly \nimplemented is gouging the consumers of America.\n  One example of something the President could do right now would be to \ndevelop greater reliance upon alternative energy and renewable sources. \nThe President should be relying upon the ethanol and other renewable \nfuels instead of the ability of his Energy Secretary to be persuasive.\n  I am not only speaking for the economy of my State when I make this \npoint about ethanol. I am talking about all renewable fuels. Ethanol is \none of those renewable fuels. The reason I continue to hound the \nadministration about ethanol is that right now the Environmental \nProtection Agency has an opportunity, if the President would bring it \nto their attention--and I called upon him in a letter last year to do \nthis--to eliminate MTBE from gasoline nationwide and replace it with \nethanol.\n  MTBE, a nonrenewable source of oxygenated fuel which is a competitor \nto ethanol, is already documented as poisoning water and has been \noutlawed in the State of California. The EPA should make the decision \nthat MTBE ought to be outlawed in all 50 States, as the Governor of \nCalifornia has decided to do in the State of California. This action \nwould encourage the production of ethanol and fill the void which MTBE \nhas left in California.\n  The amount of ethanol that could be marketed in California is equal \nto the use of ethanol in all 50 States right now. The President, in \nmaking that decision, would be able to not only continue to use \noxygenated fuel to clean up the air, he could also help agriculture, \ncreate new jobs, and make us less dependent upon foreign sources of \noil, which strengthens our economy and national security. Obviously, \nsince one-third of our trade deficit comes from the importation of oil, \nhe would also reduce our trade deficit by relying on renewable fuels. \nBut the most important aspect is that to the extent which we rely on \ndomestically produced renewable sources of energy, we would not be \nforced to plead with OPEC every time they meet and decide they are \ngoing to gouge the American consumer.\n\n  Just the fact that the members of OPEC, many being Arab nations, \nagreed to reduce production and dramatically increase our cost bothers \nme tremendously. Is this how they show their respect for the Americans \nwho shed their blood in the Persian Gulf war so that the region would \nnot be dominated by Saddam Hussein? This surely is true of Kuwait, the \nthird leading exporter of oil in the world. Kuwait ought to show a \nlittle sense of gratitude to the American military and American \ntaxpayers for saving them from that sort of dominance. But this only \ngoes to show me we are actually dealing with a domestic problem. We \nseemingly cannot force OPEC to act reasonable, because if these nations \nwant to continue their monopolistic practice, unless we are willing to \ntake retaliatory action, we are going to be beholding to them. \nConsequently, this extreme policy of having no domestic policy on \nenergy is devastating the consumers of America. We need to have that \nreliance upon alternative fuels.\n  Another glaring problem with the Administration's energy policy is \ntheir policy has reduced the domestic production of energy, oil, \nnatural gas, et cetera, by limiting the areas in the United States \nwhere exploration can take place.\n  If they had anticipated $30 oil, I don't think they would have \nfollowed that policy. They had other thoughts in mind when they adopted \nthat policy and restricted the exploration of oil. Consequently, they \nhave put the United States in a position where we have not had much \ndrilling going on in the continental U.S. or offshore. Now we are \npaying the price.\n  In addition, there is a lot of regulatory red tape involved with the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. One of the pipeline companies put \nin an application to build a pipeline to the Northeast. The Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission put so many conditions upon the building \nof that pipeline, it became too costly and the pipeline company decided \nnot to build.\n  If one wonders why the price is $2 a gallon for heating oil in New \nEngland--when a year ago it was only about 60 cents--it is because of a \nregulatory policy that makes it almost impossible for people who are \nwilling to invest to derive economic benefit from their investment.\n  We ought to look at some of the regulations of this administration \nthat tend to discourage exploration, that prohibit exploration, or that \nhave made it very difficult to deliver the product from the refineries \nto the consumers.\n  OPEC's attempt to drive up the price of oil, at great cost to the US \nconsumer, is causing economic instability which also serves to injure \nour national security. The United States has long been the locomotive \npreserving\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\npeace around the world and when we are in jeopardy, peace is in \njeopardy.\n  The concept of world peace promoted by the US has led to an era of \ntrying to free up trade internationally through the World Trade \nOrganization. There are countries in OPEC who want to belong to the \nWorld Trade Organization. By simultaneously being a member of the \npetroleum exporting countries, and being a part of that organization, \ntheir whole approach to determining price is antithetical to the free \ntrade principles of the World Trade Organization. I don't think we \nought to be supportive of OPEC nations joining the World Trade \nOrganization if they don't want to follow the principles of free trade \nestablished within the WTO, which are contrary to OPEC's recent \nmonopolistic action.\n  There is also $415 million of the taxpayers' money that the \nadministration hopes to provide to some of the OPEC nations in the form \nof foreign aid. While we have traditionally done this for three or four \ndecades, should we continue to give taxpayers' money, paid for by \nworking men and women in this country, to the very same countries that \nhave imposed egregious oil prices upon those same men and women? And at \nthe same time encourage those consumers and working people of America, \nevery day when they go to work, to pay more taxes into the Federal \nTreasury even though the price of gasoline continues to increase?\n  There is a third lever we can use against some of these countries. \nMr. President, 20 percent of all the money for International Monetary \nFund loans comes from the American taxpayer. We should encourage the \nInternational Monetary Fund to review the anticompetitive energy policy \nexhibited by foreign states as a factor when considering approval for \nloans. At the very least our 20% contribution should be conditioned on \nthis criteria. We should not stand by while the same countries who \ngouge American taxpayers benefit from our 20 percent contribution.\n  I hope we use all the leverage we can against OPEC, but the only real \nsolution is ultimately less reliance upon imported sources of oil and \nmore on domestic production and/or renewable fuels.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I advise my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that I have had some discussions this morning with Senator \nDaschle and I think we are making some progress on getting an agreement \nas to how we can proceed on the education savings account legislation. \nIn our discussions this morning, we talked about the possibility of \ngoing forward with an agreement that education amendments and education \ntax-related amendments would be in order, plus one amendment by Senator \nWellstone. I thought that was an excellent way to proceed.\n  I am about to enter that as a unanimous consent request. I understand \nthere still may be need to have some further discussions, but I hope we \ncan get this worked out. If we do, it will mean we can vitiate the \ncloture vote that is scheduled for tomorrow, now at 2:30.\n  So I renew my request of last Thursday and ask consent that all \namendments be relevant to the subject matter of education or related to \neducation taxes, with the exception of the Wellstone amendment \nregarding a report on a TANF program, and that time with respect to \nthat amendment be limited to 2 hours equally divided and it be subject \nto relevant second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nprogress has been made over the weekend. I, of course, would prefer to \nhave the bill brought up and have no restrictions on amendments that \ncould be offered. It does not appear we are going to be able to do \nthat. Therefore, I hope during the next few hours, certainly before the \nscheduled cloture vote tomorrow, we can work something out and proceed \non a unanimous consent basis. I hope it does not come to a point where \nwe have to have the cloture vote.\n\n  That being the position of the minority, I object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then I hope we can come to an agreement on \nthe bill. This is important education legislation that does have \nbipartisan support. I believe we are close to getting an agreement. I \nappreciate what Senator Reid has been doing to try to bring about an \nagreement, including the amendment by Senator Wellstone that has \nbasically already been agreed to.\n  However, if an agreement cannot be reached on the subject matter on \nwhich Members may offer amendments, then Senators are reminded there \nwill be a cloture vote to occur tomorrow.\n  With that in mind, I now ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote \nbe scheduled for 3:30 instead of 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, if it is \nnecessary to have that vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. With these final negotiations going on, then, I ask the \nbill be open for debate only until 4 p.m. and that at 4 p.m. I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I realize we have at least one more Senator \non the floor who wishes to speak, but I want to take a moment to speak \non this legislation. This is legislation about which I feel very \nstrongly. I believe the American people support it.\n  It is a bill we debated a couple of years ago. It did pass the House \nand Senate, but it was vetoed by the President. At that time, I had \nsome discussions with the White House that indicated they understood \nthis had a lot of appeal and, while it is opposed by some people--\nspecifically, I guess, teachers' unions--that it has overwhelming \nappeal. And it does.\n  Let me explain to those who may be listening basically what this \nlegislation will do. It is not just about tax relief, although tax \nrelief is very important for parents who want to help their children. \nIt also is very much about education, quality education. Under this \nlegislation, parents would be able to save up to $2,000 a year per \nchild for their educational needs, K-12. That is the gist of it. I \ncannot understand some of the comments I have heard about how this is \nbad educational policy, that it was bad education policy 2 years ago, \nand it is still bad educational policy. Excuse me. What is bad about \nthis? To allow people to save for their own children's educational \nneeds?\n  We are not talking about a massive amount of money. We are talking \nabout a bill, also, that has offsets to pay for it. But you are talking \nabout up to $2,000 a year, with the interest of course receiving \nspecial tax consideration, where that money can be used for children's \neducational needs at the fourth grade, if they need some remedial \nreading attention, or at the eighth grade, if they need a computer, or \nmaybe it is even just clothes, I guess. Whatever the educational needs \nof your children would be--and I am not sure it would be applicable to \nclothes but supplies, tutors--I can think of a lot of things that could \nbe done for our children at a critical age.\n\n  We talk now about the need to have early intervention, that a lot of \nchildren by the time they start the first grade or kindergarten, they \nare already 2 years behind the curve. So we are looking now at what can \nwe do for early intervention to help our children be ready to begin \nschool.\n  We are also continuing to look at statistics that are not very \nencouraging when it comes to reading and arithmetic and basic education \nat the\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nelementary and secondary level: Fourth grade, eighth grade, tenth \ngrade. What really is amazing to me is we do allow for tax \nconsiderations for parents to save for their children's educational \nneeds in college. So it is OK for college, but it is not all right for \nelementary and secondary. Yet for higher education in America, there \nare scholarship programs, there are loan programs, there are grant \nprograms, and there are supplemental grant programs. For any student in \nAmerica who wants to get a college education, whether it is a community \ncollege or whether it is a special training program or higher \neducation, there is financial assistance available but not for \nelementary and secondary. I do not understand that. A lot of the needs \nare at that level.\n  So we are saying yes to higher education but no to K-12. If we do not \nhelp our children, our own children, along the way when they have extra \nneeds, then they are not going to be ready for college or, when they \ngraduate from high school, they are not going to be ready to be \ntrained.\n  I meet with corporate executives, people from the high-tech \nindustries, and they say: We are really worried; the children now \ncoming out of high school are not even ready to learn. They cannot be \ntrained to work in Silicon Valley because they do not have the basics.\n  I am not saying this one bill will totally solve that, but I am \nsaying it is one more option, it is one more part of improving \neducation in America. So I think it is good educational policy. I think \nit is good for our parents. I think it also provides tax relief.\n  Some people will say that a lot of workers cannot save for their own \nchildren. Maybe that is true, although I think it would be a real \nincentive for people, even at a low income level, to be able to put \naside just a little bit. It does not have to be $2,000; maybe it is \nonly a couple of hundred. But it would be their money which they could \nuse to help their children. Should not we provide that incentive?\n  By the way, what about middle-income parents? There are a lot of \nprograms that will help low-income children. Of course, children of \nparents who have plenty of income, they do not need our assistance. But \nwhat about the family where the father works in a shipyard and makes \n$37,000 a year? Should he not be able to do a little something for his \nown children?\n  I urge my colleagues, as I know Members on both sides of the aisle \nalready recognize this is important legislation, take a look at it. \nTell me you can go back and tell your constituents you are against \nparents of children K-12 being able to save a little to help their \nchildren at that level. I do not believe you can do that.\n  This is not a costly bill. This is a bill that has offsets. This is a \nbill that is a plus all the way down the line. I believe before we are \ndone, this legislation is going to pass and it is going to pass \noverwhelmingly when we get to the final vote, as it should.\n  I commend Senator Coverdell and the bipartisan group that has worked \non this legislation, brought it to the floor once before and back here \nnow. But I felt compelled to say something because I had seen this \nquote saying this is bad educational policy. For the life of me, I \ncannot explain why that would be true. This is good policy across the \nboard.\n  I urge my colleague to keep up the good work. I will continue to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and with the leadership \nto come up with a process that is fair, where education amendments can \nbe offered, where education tax amendments can be offered, now where \nthe Wellstone amendment can be offered. If we can work out a couple of \nother agreements, certainly I will be prepared to try to do that \nbecause I think this is important and the legislation is good.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the New York Times reported last Wednesday \nthat education stands out as the single most important issue \nnationally, and voters support action at the national level to improve \nthe Nation's schools. I agree with the leader. It is important we talk \nabout education. My own feeling, and I have mentioned this previously, \nis we should talk about all aspects of education. There are a lot of \nthings that need to be done.\n  Overwhelmingly, the American people support a national role in \neducation. I hope as we proceed down this legislative road dealing with \neducation that we are allowed to go beyond what the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Coverdell, has suggested. We need to go beyond this. That \nis why we are working so hard to get an agreement to go beyond this.\n  We have to make sure we talk about why kids are dropping out of \nschool at the rate they are, why school construction is not taking \nplace where it is needed, why we are not able to reduce class size. As \nthis debate goes forward, let's make sure it covers all education, not \njust a little bit of education which we all agree needs to be looked \nat, but let's broaden our scope.\n  In light of the fact the Senator from Arizona has something \nscheduled, I will cut my remarks short.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I appreciate \nhis willingness to allow me to move forward.\n  Also, what Senator Lott told us is extremely important. His point is \nthis is an act that is not going to be opposed by very many Senators \nonce we can get it to the floor for a vote. It is the procedural \nmaneuvering that is going on right now by some who want to gain an \nadvantage in this debate to propose some of their own extracurricular \nideas that have nothing to do with the bill that is holding us up from \nconsidering the bill.\n  I hope, along with the majority leader, we can get quickly to the \nconsideration of this important legislation because, as he correctly \nnoted, once we begin debate on this bill and have an opportunity to \nvote on it, it is going to receive overwhelming support from Members on \nboth sides of the aisle in the Senate.\n  I want to speak for a moment on an amendment which I intend to offer, \nbut before I do that, I commend the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell, for his work on S. 1134. He has made a valiant effort, over \na long period of time, to bring reform to our educational system.\n  He particularly wants to give all parents more choice in deciding \nwhere to send their children and to give them more of their own money \nwith which to do so, or perhaps I should say to allow them to keep more \nof their own money in order to have those choices.\n  The number of Americans and, as I said, Senators of both parties who \nagree with Senator Coverdell is growing every day.\n  His education IRA legislation, which was vetoed in 1998, is now a \nvital component of S. 1134. As noted by the majority leader, it will \nallow parents, grandparents, labor unions, churches, synagogues, \nemployers, or others to contribute to tax-free savings accounts to \nprovide for a child's education from kindergarten through high school.\n\n  According to a 1998 report from Congress' Joint Committee on \nTaxation, 14 million families--a majority of them low and middle \nincome--are currently denied these benefits because of the Clinton veto \nof this bill in 1998. These are the families who will benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  As one cosponsor of the vetoed bill, Democratic Senator Torricelli, \nlamented in an op-ed in the New York Times:\n\n       With one stroke of a pen. . .an effort to begin a vast \n     reform of American education has ended.\n\n  The Coverdell education IRA would extend a provision which I \nsupported in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which allowed parents to \nsave $500 per year tax free for their children's college education.\n  However, all levels of education, not just college, need the \nincentives to improve that market-oriented reforms such as parental \nschool choice supply.\n  The real crisis in education, as former Education Secretary Bill \nBennett has observed, ``is at the primary and secondary levels.''\n  As the majority leader said a moment ago, all of the help we provide \nfor college students goes for nought if our students are not prepared \nby the time they get to the college level. So we need to be focusing \nnow on the primary and secondary levels.\n  This resurrected Coverdell-Torricelli education IRA will allow \nfamilies to\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nsave up to $2,000 a year in a special education savings account for \neach of their children.\n  The contributions will be in after-tax dollars, but the interest \ngenerated will be tax free, as long as any deductions from the account \nare used to pay for school expenses.\n  The President may resist it, but we have to develop a unified student \nassistance funding system that guarantees choice to struggling parents \nof all income levels with children in all grade levels, from \nkindergarten through college.\n  Again, as Senator Torricelli said,\n\n       For real reform to take place, both Democrats and \n     Republicans, liberals and conservatives, must look beyond \n     their narrow agendas and partisan political interests and \n     seek out new proposals. Our schoolchildren deserve nothing \n     less.\n\n  I could not say it better.\n  With that background, let me discuss the amendment which I will be \noffering to S. 1134. As the whole theory of this is to put resources \nwhere they will help the most, I have prepared an amendment which in a \nvery narrow but important way will do precisely that. We call our \namendment the Apples for Three Million Teachers Tax Credit Relief Act \nof 2000, first introduced on January 24 of this year, with Senator \nBunning and Senator Fred Thompson as cosponsors.\n  In the House, Representative Matt Salmon introduced companion \nlegislation, H.R. 1710, which currently has 38 cosponsors, including \nthe majority leader, Dick Armey.\n  What will this amendment do? It will provide an annual tax credit of \nup to $100 for public and private teachers' unreimbursed classroom \nexpenditures that are qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.\n  What does that mean? We know that teachers routinely every year pay \nfor a lot of their supplies for their classrooms to help instruct their \nchildren, things they know will be useful in their instruction but \nwhich are not provided by their local school districts. There is \ncurrently a tax deduction allowed--which I will talk more about in the \nfuture--but it does not work as well for these particular taxpayers.\n  Our amendment provides a $100 tax credit right off the top for these \nschool supplies which these teachers are taking to their classrooms.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said ``an educated citizenry is essential for \nthe preservation of democracy.''\n  As the son and brother of teachers devoted to their students, I know \nfirsthand of the public spiritedness and commitment of these \nprofessionals to their students.\n  It falls to our teachers to inculcate the academic values and \nanalytic skills that make good citizenship possible, of which Thomas \nJefferson spoke.\n  In talking with teachers, both public and private, I have come to \nlearn that a lot of them use their own money to cover the cost of \nclassroom materials that are not supplied by their schools. Some have \nused money from the family budget to purchase these needed classroom \nsupplies, and they would do it again. It seems to me we should not \nexpect them to pay for these things out of their own pockets, or at \nleast to give some Federal financial assistance when they do, \nparticularly those who are on a teacher's rather modest income.\n  To put this in perspective, in 1996, according to a study by the \nNational Education Association, the average K-12 teacher spent $408 \nannually on those classroom materials which they thought they needed \nfor their classroom instruction but which were not supplied by the \nschools. They spend $408 on average per year. That includes everything \nfrom books, workbooks, erasers, pens, pencils, paper, and other \nequipment.\n  Under current law, a tax deduction is allowed for such expenses but \nonly if the teacher itemizes and only if expenses exceed 2 percent of \nthe teacher's adjusted gross income.\n  I commend Senator Susan Collins for her successful amendment to the \nTaxpayer Relief Act which eliminates this 2-percent threshold. I look \nforward to working with her to give our teachers needed relief from \ntheir out-of-pocket cost for classroom expenditures.\n  A deduction reduces taxable income. A credit will give teachers \nrelief dollar for dollar spent, in the case of my amendment, up to the \n$100 annual limit.\n\n  This isn't the solution, but it is a small first step which I think \nwould be very much appreciated by our hard-working and sacrificing \nteachers.\n  There is no absolute linkage between these personal contributions to \nschool supplies and the quality of the teaching. However, there likely \nis some correlation, given the degree of commitment evidenced by these \nteachers who are spending their own money on their students.\n  We will be helping the best teachers. I believe this will promote \nhigh-quality instruction.\n  A similar provision enacted by the Arizona legislature in 1997 has \nbeen very well received by our teachers. Incidentally, it was recently \nupheld in terms of its constitutionality by the Arizona Supreme Court.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill and in \nsupporting the amendment I will be offering. I think it is important \nthat our teachers at least be partially reimbursed for some of the \nfinancial sacrifices they made to educate our Nation's children. If we \nare serious about getting dollars to the classrooms that need it, this \nis really an excellent way to do it.\n  Again, I commend my colleague, Senator Coverdell, for all his efforts \nin this regard and look forward to working with him in the future as we \nget this legislation up for debate and, importantly, for a vote in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nArizona. Those were very good remarks. But they were also generous as \nin regard to our effort. I deeply appreciate it, along with his work.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, that Senator Reid \ncurtailed his remarks in order to assist Senator Kyl. He would like to \nfinish those remarks. I do not think he intends for them to be very \nlong. Then the Senator from Iowa would be next in the queue, if that \nwould be all right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my appreciation to my friend from Georgia \nfor his courtesy.\n  First of all, in brief response to my friend from Arizona when he \nmentioned--I made a note here--political maneuvering by the minority to \nkeep this bill from moving forward, the fact is we are not maneuvering \nanything. We are willing to go forward on this legislation and have it \ntreated the same as all legislation has been treated for more than two \ncenturies in the Senate--move forward on the legislation and allow \namendments. But recognizing that the majority is not going to allow us \nto do that, we are trying to work out some kind of compromise so there \nwill be the ability to offer some amendments. I am hopeful we can do \nthat. Certainly I hope so.\n  I talk about the need for us to discuss education. We need to discuss \neducation but not just a piece of education here and a piece of \neducation there. We need to talk about education in general.\n  Overwhelmingly, as I mentioned earlier, the American people support a \nnational role on education. The New York Times reported last Wednesday \nit is the most important issue facing the American people. When we talk \nabout a national role, we are not talking about interference with \ndecisions by local communities when it comes to schools. We are talking \nabout giving them the resources--that is, school districts--to reduce \nclass size, to strengthen the connection with parents, teachers, and \nstudents. We are talking about giving our children the best teachers in \nthe world and programs to help schools attract and keep those teachers. \nWe are talking about giving communities the resources to build new \nschools and to repair those crumbling schools that are all around us.\n  I believe in public education. I was educated in public schools. My \nfather never graduated from the eighth grade. My mother never graduated \nfrom high school. But as a result of the public school system we have \nin America, I was able to achieve the American dream of getting a good \neducation.\n  We should give all of our young people the tools to achieve their \ndreams. We can help them do this by modernizing our schools, raising \nour expectations and standards, and reducing class size. That is the \nright thing to do.\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\n  When we talk about political maneuvering, we are not maneuvering \nanything political. We simply want to go forward and treat the Senate \nas the Senate and not the House of Representatives. We should have been \nallowing amendments on this legislation last week. We would have been \ndrawing this debate to a close today. But we are not doing that. \nInstead of that--because of the political maneuvering going on with the \nmajority, not the minority--we are unable to move forward. I hope we \ncan set aside partisan differences and move forward on this \nlegislation. If we do so, the people who will benefit the most are the \nAmerican people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about some provisions in \nthis bill I have long backed to improve education. But before I point \nmy remarks directly to those few provisions of the bill, I would like \nto put this whole thing into context, if I could.\n  No. 1, the American people are very concerned about education in the \nUnited States. If there is any one thing they want the Congress, the \nState legislatures, and the local schools and municipalities to \naddress, it is the problem of education. I am convinced they want the \ndecisionmaking to be done at the local level, but they would like to \nhave both moral leadership and some resources to come from Washington.\n  I happen to be one who believes those resources that come from \nWashington, to the extent they are given to States and local \ncommunities with few strings attached--less redtape and less \npaperwork--the better off we are.\n  But I think, in the context of even more money, we want to think in \nterms of, if the money were the sole solution to the problems of \neducation, then that would be an easy solution: Just appropriate more \nmoney. I think in terms of the $5,500 per student per year spent in my \nState of Iowa and the fact that our graduates end up either first, \nsecond, or third on the ACT scores in our competition with Minnesota \nand Wisconsin. For 7 or 8 years in a row, our graduates have ended up \nfirst in the SATs. That is the result. We ought to be concerned about \nresults and not about process when we look at spending the taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Compare, on the one hand, that $5,500 per year spent by the State of \nIowa--still, my State legislators would say: There is a lot of concern \nabout the need to do more to improve the product of our educational \nsystem in our State--with the approximately $11,000 that is spent in \nthe District of Columbia--almost twice the amount spent in my State--\nand look at the massive dropout rate from the high schools in the \nDistrict of Columbia. You can only conclude that there has to be a lot \ndone in the District of Columbia other than just spending more money \nbecause if you looked at just more money being the solution to the \neducational problems, then I would quickly conclude that the District \nof Columbia ought to be doing much better than my State of Iowa.\n  People are very concerned about education. So in each one of our \nState capitals, and in the Congress of the United States, there is a \ngreat deal of time being spent on education, as there ought to be. We \nbelieve every child is entitled to a good education, entitled to that \ngood education in a crime-free environment and with the best of \nteachers.\n  We also have to remember a basic principle: Education is all about \nchildren. The product of our schools is what matters. Does the process \nhave the children in mind, or are there sometimes special interests \nbeyond just the children's welfare to which we give too much attention?\n  We have seen studies indicating that whatever we do in the schools, \nspending money or a policy other than spending money, one of the best \nthings we can do to enhance the environment of learning is to get \nparents involved in the education of their children, checking the \nhomework, talking about it at the dinner table, in every respect \nencouraging that child in that family to learn, and also being \nsupportive of the educational environment the child comes from, whether \nit be the public school or the private school, or some other learning \nenvironment of which that child might be a part. We have to make sure \nwe have the educational result that no child will fall through the \ncracks and, for those who do, that there is a process that the results \nin getting that child the best possible education so they can succeed \nin life as well.\n  This bill is all about encouraging families to save money for the \neducation of their kids from kindergarten through graduate school, \nplanning for the future, not relying upon somebody else. With present \ntax dollars, less than 50 percent of the education dollar is spent in \nthe classroom. That means we have to look at the allocation of \nresources within education and decide is it better to spend that on \nadministration or is it better to spend it on teachers in the \nclassroom, the ones who have the hands-on contact with the minute-by-\nminute education of everybody in that classroom. We have to have \naccountability for education dollars. I am not sure we have that \naccountability today, when we are spending less in the classroom than \nwe ought to be spending and more on other aspects of education than we \nought to be spending.\n  This bill is concerned with our children. When you are concerned \nabout our children, you are concerned about the future. When you are \nconcerned about the future of American children, you are concerned \nabout America's future and our place in the world, our ability to lead \nthe world, and our ability, individually and the country as a whole, to \nbe economically competitive in the global environment in which we are \nnow competing.\n  Too many people look to Washington for the answer. They might say: \nWell, if you're saying people shouldn't look to Washington for an \nanswer, they ought to look to their parents, they ought to look to \ntheir local or private school, why this legislation?\n  Well, this legislation is all about empowering families, empowering \nparents. It is not concerned with process. It is concerned with giving \nparents choice. Basically, all the money that comes into the Federal \nTreasury is taxpayers' money. It comes from that individual working man \nor woman in America who pays taxes. This is about giving them some \ncontrol over their own resources. It is about giving them choice. It is \nabout not having help come from Washington with a lot of redtape \nconnected with it to create more paperwork for the teachers than maybe \nthe dollars they receive are worth.\n  This definitely is not about making education policy in Washington, \nDC--pouring one mold in Washington and making all policy out of that \nmold. If we were to do that, we would be saying the problems of New \nYork City can be solved in exactly the same way as they can be solved \nin Waterloo, IA. One of two things is going to happen. Either we are \ngoing to fail in one place and succeed in another or, simultaneous with \nthat, if we get the taxpayers' money's worth in New York, we won't get \ntheir money's worth in Waterloo. So consequently, it is about \nsaying that our country is so geographically vast and our population so \nheterogeneous that you shouldn't pour one mold in Washington and expect \nto accomplish the same amount of good wherever you are in the United \nStates with those same taxpayer dollars.\n\n  This is a way of saying to the American people: We give you an \nencouragement to save. We give you a tax incentive to save for the \neducation of your children. What meets the educational policy needs of \nyour family, the needs of your child, in the final analysis it is made \nby the family for which these resources should be used, empowering the \nfamily, involving the family to a greater extent in the education of \ntheir children, and also giving them the resources to meet those needs. \nIt is not one size fits all. If we have 110 million different taxpayers \nin America, then this gives the possibility of 110 million different \nanswers to the problems of education in America.\n  With that background, I will speak about the two or three provisions \nof this legislation that I have been involved in, some of which were in \nthe tax bill that had been vetoed in the past. In particular, I mention \nthe tax deduction for student loan interest beyond its current 60-month \npayment restriction.\n  Everybody who is paying attention to this legislation knows that the \nimportant part of this bill is expanding the education savings account \nfrom $500 per year to $2,000 per year. In conjunction with this, we are \ntrying to do\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\nsome things that have other tax benefits to help education, some for \nkindergarten through 12 and some for higher education. What I am \nspeaking about regarding my involvement is eliminating the 60-month \npayment restriction for which I fought 6 years and finally got adopted \nin 1997, the provisions of our Tax Code that reinstitute the \ndeductibility of interest on student loans.\n  To fit that into the overall revenue-neutrality provisions of the \nbudget law, we had to cap it at 60 months. This legislation would \nremove that 60-month cap. As the cost of higher education continues to \nrise, the levels of student debt are spiraling upward. Students and \ntheir families are finding that financing a higher education is \nburdensome. Some students, due to financial concerns, are unable to \nreceive the education they need.\n  We have a duty to assist them in their need and, in so doing, send a \nclear message that the Congress understands their hardships and values \ntheir efforts in improving themselves through college. Also, it gives \nme an opportunity to establish a principle involved in this legislation \nbeyond just the economic points of view we are trying to make about \ngetting an education and the economic value of that--that is, to send a \nclear signal to the young people of America that borrowing money to \nenhance their intellect is just as important, as far as the Tax Code of \nthis country is concerned, as borrowing money for capital investment in \nsome business. And it seems to me that parity is legitimate. \nEliminating the 60-month payment restriction will eliminate costly \nreporting requirements that are currently required for both lenders and \nborrowers. That is an additional benefit to taking that 60-month limit \noff.\n\n  Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we succeeded in reinstating \nthe tax deduction of interest on student loans, which had been \neliminated 11 years previously. This brought much needed relief to \nstudents and their families. I spoke about the budget constraints we \nhad in 1997, which today we would not have and we don't have. So we put \nthat 60-month payment restriction in place for revenue neutrality. Our \ncurrent budget situation makes it possible to reevaluate this \nlimitation. As the price of going to college has continued to spiral \nupward, student debt has risen to very high levels.\n  The current restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. It \nhurts those who, due to limited means, have borrowed most heavily. It \nalso weighs heavily on those who have dedicated themselves to a career \nin public service, despite oftentimes lower pay that is connected with \nthat--as an example, teachers. By eliminating the 60-month payment \nrestriction, we will be assisting these most deserving borrowers, while \nrewarding civic involvement as well.\n  Also in this bill are provisions for assistance in school \nconstruction. Last week, a Member on the other side of the aisle asked \nwhy we are not talking about school construction and repairs. My simple \nanswer is: Read the bill. If they did, they would find that it contains \nsome very helpful school construction and rehabilitation incentives. \nSchool districts across the country today are struggling to fix some of \nthe wornout rungs in a fundamentally American institution, the public \nschools--the ladder by which people go up the economic scale. In fact, \nschool districts nationwide spent $18.7 billion on school construction \nin the last year for which we have figures, 1996. Building and \nrepairing U.S. elementary and secondary schools requires massive \ncapital to keep up with growing enrollments, aging buildings, and \nmodernization needs.\n  My State's reputation for educational excellence has gained national \nprominence, as I have already referred to, throughout the 20th century. \nEven in my State, we have local school districts that have tremendous \nneeds, and this bill will help them to accomplish a good building \nenvironment for the next century.\n  As America prepares to enter this new century--and we have--we must \nwork to strengthen our schools and ensure our classrooms are wired to \ndeliver a 21st century quality education. That includes fixing basic \nstructural damage and, even more so, installing modern communications \nand computer equipment. But whether it is repairing leaky roofs or \nremoving hazardous asbestos or fixing the structure, everything needs a \nhigh-tech facelift at this particular time.\n  Expanding greater access to affordable capital, which this bill does, \nwill relieve pressure on the local tax base and help more school \ndistricts build and repair their schools. Initiatives in this bill do \nthat, and I have sponsored some of those initiatives. They build on \nsomething that already works. They build upon the principle to \nestablish tax-exempt bonds. In fact, the single most important source \nof funding for investment in public school construction and \nrehabilitation is the tax-exempt bond market. Iowa school districts \nwere issued over $625 million in tax-exempt bonds in the last year we \nhave figures for, which is 1998.\n\n  Whether rural or suburban or urban schools, these school districts \nfrom coast to coast are facing substantial school construction costs. \nThe greater the flexibility the better. One size fits all won't work, \nwhether it is in capital investment in schools or investment in \npersonal education. That is why my plan is designed to give local \nschool districts greater leeway to secure critical funding.\n  This legislation would allow school districts to partner with private \ninvestors, allowing school districts to tap deep pockets in the private \nsector and leverage private dollars to improve public schools. Second, \nit would expand the volume of school construction costs that a small \nschool district could issue annually. This will allow smaller rural and \nsuburban schools a better opportunity to manage the high cost of \nreplacing or repairing aging facilities.\n  In conclusion, I think all of these steps, along with a lot more in \nthis bill, are important first steps. If and when we are able to pass a \nmore comprehensive tax relief measure, I hope to build upon these \ninitiatives and provide even more school construction assistance to our \nlocal communities.\n  Unlike a lot of proposals from this administration for school \nconstruction that require local school districts to get permission from \nFederal Government bureaucracies, the incentives in our bill empower \nlocal people, people on the local school board, and they preserve local \ncontrol. Without a doubt, that is what the people of this country want. \nThey do not want the dictation of educational policy from Washington, \nDC. They do not want, as a local school board, to come hat-in-hand to \nsome Washington bureaucrat to get permission to get a little bit of \nhelp for fixing a crack in the wall or wiring for some high-tech \nimprovement. They want to be able to decide the needs for their \ncommunity. Why should they be the ones to do that? Because they are the \nonly ones who know about it. There is no way, no matter how intelligent \na Washington bureaucrat might be, that they would know the needs of all \nthe local school districts of our country.\n  This is a very good bill that will enhance education in America. This \nbill will provide, through tax incentives, about $8 billion in \neducation assistance to the American people, with local control of that \nmoney. It deserves our strong support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the subject, of course, is education and I \nwanted to come to the floor for a few moments to visit about this \nissue. I am a product of a small public school in Regent, ND. I \ngraduated in a high school class of 9. I always kid that I was in the \ntop 5 of my class; I won't tell exactly where in that 5, though. I went \nto college and to graduate school and, through a strange set of \ncircumstances, I made my way to the Congress and finally to the Senate.\n  I am proud to stand on the floor of the Senate and discuss education. \nI don't pretend that I know more than anybody else in the Senate on the \nsubject. I don't pretend to have all of the answers. But I do hope that \nwhen we debate education--and most parents in this country want us to \ndebate how to improve public schools--I hope we will be able to debate \nall of the good ideas that exist in this Chamber, not only some or a \nfew.\n  It is my hope that, shortly, we will have an agreement by which we \nwill be able to consider all of the good ideas that exist in this \nChamber to improve and strengthen education in this country.\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\n  Thomas Jefferson used to say that anyone who believes a country can \nbe both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and \nnever can be. He understood the value of education, as I am sure most \nof my colleagues do. I understand the value of a quality education. I \nwant every young child in this country to be able to go through a \nclassroom door that we are proud of, into a classroom that will allow \nyoung children to be the best they can be. Regrettably, that doesn't \nhappen all across our country. We have some wonderful schools and some \nexcellent teachers, but we have some challenges as well.\n  Let me start with this premise: Those who suggest the public \neducation system in this country has collapsed and is unworkable are \nwrong--just wrong. We have many fine public schools in America. We have \nsome outstanding teachers in our country. We need to have more. There \nare some significant areas of concern in some schools. Some inner-city \nschools and BIA schools on Indian reservations, for example, have \nphysical facilities that should be cause for great concern.\n  Mr. President, decade after decade, we hear the debate that the \nschool system in this country is collapsing, and that somehow public \nschools are not making the grade. In fact, however, the evidence shows \nthat we have many fine public schools in this country.\n  The public school system has allowed the United States of America to \nprogress and do things that virtually no other country has done. Why? \nBecause we have an educated population.\n  Some while ago, a periodical described the progress in our country. \nThey said we have spliced genes, we have split the atom, we have cloned \nsheep, we invented plastic, the silicon chip, radar, television, and \ncomputers. We built airplanes; we learned to fly them. We built rockets \nand flew to the Moon. We cured polio. We cured smallpox. And this \ncountry is hardly out of breath.\n  Did that come from a country that didn't educate its people? No. All \nof those advancements are a result of our investments in education in \nAmerica--an investment in a system of public education in which we \ndecided as a nation that every young child should be allowed to become \nthe best he or she could be. We do not say to children somewhere along \nthe line: All right, here is what you are going to do and become. \nInstead, we've said every child has the opportunity to be the best they \ncan be in this system of ours.\n  Is it an accident that we stand at this precipice in history with the \nstrongest economy in the world? Is it an accident that we invented \ntelevision, that we invented the computer, and that we are the center \nof the high-tech industry? It is, in my judgment, a direct result of \nthe educational system.\n  I am a little tired sometimes of hearing people denigrate the system \nof public education in our country. There is a lot to be said for \npublic education.\n  I'm reminded of the old saying that bad news travels halfway around \nthe world before good news gets its shoes on. Never is that more \nevident than in the debate on education among politicians. They can't \nbump each other fast enough to get to a place to make a speech about \nhow bad our schools are.\n  Yes, some of our schools are not up to par. Some of our schools are \nin terrible need of repair. Some of our schools need reform. Yes; that \nis true. But I go into a lot of schools, and I see some remarkable \nplaces of learning.\n  I have a couple of children in school. I deeply admire their \nteachers. They do more homework than I did when I was in school. They \nare studying subjects at a higher level than I did when I was in their \ngrade in school.\n  When we debate this subject of education, let's debate it based on \nthe facts. I intend to bring a book to the floor by a researcher who \ncompares the test scores of children in school now to children in \nschools a decade ago and to children in other countries, and who \nevaluates what, in fact, is happening to our system of public \neducation. Is it, in fact, collapsing? Are test scores among the same \ngroup of students actually increasing?\n  Said another way, perhaps only the top 25 percent of the kids in high \nschool took a college entrance exam not too many years ago. Now \nsomewhere around 60 percent do. Has the average score dropped? Sure. \nThat is because you have the top 60 percent rather than the top 25 \npercent taking the exam. Compare the top 25 percent of today to the top \n25 percent a decade ago. Have the scores decreased? No. They have not \nat all.\n  There is a lot to be commended in our system of public education. I \ndon't want to hear people talk about how awful it is because it is not \nawful. In my judgment, it has created a country that is the best in the \nworld.\n  But let me talk about the challenges because they exist. That is part \nof what we want to address.\n  As I said, I come from a town of 300, and a high school that had 40 \nkids combined in all four grades. So I know something about small \nschools. I visited an inner-city school--something with which I was \ntotally unfamiliar. When I went in the front door of that school, there \nwere two metal detectors and armed security guards sitting at the front \ndoor. There was a shooting at this school some weeks after I had been \nthere. One kid bumped another at a water fountain, and the other kid \npulled a gun and shot him three or four times. This is a school with \nmetal detectors and armed guards.\n  Does that school have a serious challenge? You bet your life it does.\n  In my State of North Dakota, there are two schools I have described \nbefore. If people have heard this already, I am sorry, but it is \nimportant. Among the issues we will discuss, now that we have an \nagreement, is not only the proposal brought to the floor by Senator \nCoverdell and others to provide a tax cut for education savings \naccounts, but also ones to provide some help to improve and renovate \nschools and to reduce classroom size.\n  Let me talk about the Cannon Ball School. I am probably the only one \nin the Senate who has been to the Cannon Ball School, which is about 40 \nmiles south of Mandan, ND, on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux \nIndian Reservation. It is not a BIA school; it is a public school with \nmostly Indian students. And since it is on Indian land it has almost no \ntax base to support it.\n  The school has roughly 160 kids, most of them young Native American \nchildren. Much of the building is 90 years old; some of it is newer. \nMost of the classrooms do not have the capability to be wired for the \nInternet, so we do not have high-tech education. It has 160 kids, 2 \nbathrooms, and 1 water fountain. When I went there, they were using the \nold boiler room as a sort of make-do classroom, except a couple times a \nweek they had to evacuate that temporary classroom because of a backed-\nup sewer system.\n  In the classrooms, the desks are an inch apart, with kids crowded \ninto the little classrooms. How would Members feel if their daughter or \nson were walking into that classroom? Would they feel their children \nhad an opportunity for a good education?\n  A little girl named Rosie Two Bears, who was a third grader at the \ntime, said to me: Mr. Senator, are you going to build me a new school?\n  No, I am not able to build you a new school, not by myself. But I \nhope the actions of the Senate will give Rosie the opportunity to have \na new school. I hope every young Rosie who is walking into a classroom \nin this country has parents who believe they are sending a child into a \nclassroom of which they are proud, not one that is crowded with 30 or \n40 children, but a classroom in which a teacher can pay attention to \nthose children and give the children a good education, a classroom \nconnected to the future with new technology, a classroom in a building \nthat is safe, a classroom where that child can learn to be the best she \nor he can become.\n  That is not the case, regrettably, in Cannon Ball, ND, and those poor \nfolks who run the school cannot do a thing about it because they don't \nhave a tax base with which to issue a bond to renovate that school or \nbuild a new one. We ought to do something to help schools like this \none, by providing funding for new teachers to reduce class size and to \nbuild new classrooms to reduce overcrowding.\n  Some will say that this is a bureaucrat's approach to solving the \nproblems at Cannon Ball Elementary School. If we say let's provide help \nto a school such as that, so that child can go to a good school, we are \ntold that we want bureaucrats to run our public education system. That \nis not the case at all--not a bit.\n  I am not embarrassed as a country for having goals and aspirations \nfor our\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nchildren. Some want to brag that we as a country, the United States of \nAmerica, have no national goals in education; good for us. Don't count \nme among those who pat themselves on the back for having no national \ngoals or no national aspirations for what we want to get out of our \npublic school system.\n  Has anybody been to the Ojibwa School? Probably not. The Ojibwa \nSchool has trailers sitting out on a hillside on the Turtle Mountain \nIndian Reservation. It is a BIA-funded school. We have a responsibility \nto these schools to do better. This school has been deemed unsafe by \neverybody. God forbid that someday there should be a fire that sweeps \nacross those temporary classrooms with their wooden fire escapes, \ntaking the lives of children. Everybody says: Why doesn't somebody \nstand up and take notice of that? They did. Study after study after \nstudy has found this school to be unsafe. Those children have to go out \nin the freezing cold weather in North Dakota between these mobile, \ntemporary classrooms. Does anyone in the Senate volunteer to have their \nchildren attend that school? I don't think so.\n\n  Where are the resources to give those kids a decent school building? \nMaybe from some bureaucrat? Is it by the local school district? By the \ntribal council? How about the State legislature? No, no, no, in every \ncase. How about from us? Could we in the Congress do something for the \nyoung school children in the Ojibwa School?\n  We have a list of those schools for which the federal government has \nresponsibility. This is a federal trust responsibility that we have for \nIndian schools, and we are not meeting it. Why? Because we don't have \nthe will to put up the money to build a decent school for those \nchildren.\n  Everyone in the room knows what makes a good education: A good \nteacher who knows how to teach, a child who wants to learn, parents who \ncare about that child's education, and a safe and effective learning \nenvironment. We know what works.\n  We will, because of this unanimous consent agreement that was just \nreached, be able to address not just the question proposed by the \nSenator from Georgia regarding providing tax-favored education saving \naccounts for K-12 education.\n  In conclusion, I fully support and feel very strongly about the need \nto address the issue of reducing class size. We know a teacher does \nmuch better for students when she or he is teaching a class of 15 \nchildren rather than 35 children. We know that. That is not rocket \nscience. We also know that a child who goes into a classroom that is in \ndecent repair, in a good school building of which we can be proud, has \na better opportunity to learn. We know that. To fail to address those \ntwo major issues is to fail on the subject of education. We will have \nan opportunity to debate that. I intend to debate those issues.\n  An additional point. I believe every school in this country ought to \nprovide a report card to parents about how it is doing. I am a parent. \nMy children are in school. I get report cards. I am able to open the \nmail and get a report card that gives me a grade for how my children \nare performing in mathematics, in English literature, and so on. That \nis very helpful for a parent. Parents can talk to their children all \nday long when they get home from school: What did you do in school \ntoday? What did you learn? And you get one-word answers, as we know. So \na report card is a very important tool to let parents know how their \nchildren are doing in school.\n  But what about a report card on the school itself? Why don't parents, \nas taxpayers, have an opportunity to get a report card that says: This \nis how your school is doing versus other schools in the State; this is \nhow your school is doing versus other schools in the school district, \nthe State, and the Nation; so parents and taxpayers can compare their \nschool to other schools? A school report card would give a parent \ninformation, not only about their child, but also information about \ntheir child's school, which is very important to their children's \neducation.\n  So I intend to offer an amendment that would provide that report \ncard. It is not intrusive, in my judgment. It would empower parents, \ngive parents information about what they are getting for their tax \ndollars, what kind of school they are producing for their children to \nattend.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Georgia, as I have on past occasions, \nthat he is a serious legislator. He brings ideas to the floor, some of \nwhich I disagree with strongly. Occasionally I have supported his \nideas. But we are on the right subject. Education is the right subject. \nIt is our future. It is our children. The unanimous consent agreement \nnow gives us the opportunity in the next couple of days to address all \nthe ideas for improving education. Instead of getting the worst of what \neach has to offer, maybe we can get the best of what both have to offer \nin this Chamber. That would be a refreshing change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I renew the leader's request of a few \nminutes ago, which is that all amendments be relevant to the subject \nmatter of education and/or related to education taxes with the \nexception of a Wellstone amendment regarding a TANF program, the time \nwith respect to that amendment be limited to 2 hours equally divided, \nsubject to a relevant second-degree amendment, and the amendment filed \nat the desk by Senator Bob Graham, which is amendment No. 2843.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I am very happy that we have been able to arrive at a point \nwhere within the next few minutes we will be able to start debating \neducation issues.\n  I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Georgia and to the \nmajority leader for this agreement. I think it is something with which \nwe can work. I look forward to a good debate in the next few days on \neducation and education-related matters.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, having just reached an agreement, I now \nask unanimous consent that the scheduled cloture vote for Tuesday be \nvitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I hope Members will be prepared to \noffer their amendments with votes to occur beginning on Tuesday. It is \nthe leader's hope the Senate can conclude this bill by Wednesday \nevening. In the meantime, I look forward to vigorous debate and thank \nall Members for their cooperation.\n  I mentioned to the Senator from Nevada a little earlier that as we \nmove forward with this bill, if we can get some parameters around the \ndebate and equally divided limits on the amendments, I think that would \nbe useful for everybody. But we will proceed at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia that we are \nready to start offering amendments this afternoon. We hope to be able \nto do that, and with notification to the leader, we hope there can be \nsome votes tomorrow morning, or at least when we finish our \nconferences. We expect to have at least one amendment offered today. \nThat would take a little while in the morning but is something we think \nwe can get our teeth into and work quickly.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding the first \namendment is by Senator Dodd of Connecticut. If Senator Reid could \noffer it in his behalf, we could begin that debate--we can confer about \nthis--at 9:30 in the morning. That is what I think is the schedule.\n  Mr. REID. That seems appropriate.\n  Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the Senator from North \nDakota. He has been a leader in education, both in the House and the \nSenate. I always look forward to what he has to say during debate on \neducation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator for his remarks. There are a \ncouple of comments I want to make but I know Senator Frist, from \nTennessee, is pressed so I am going to yield the floor so he can begin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, it is a pleasure to be opening this \nsecond session of the 106th Congress with a bill that is, I believe, so \nimportant in our\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nstep-by-step approach to improving education, which is something I \nthink both sides of the aisle feel strongly about. From the statements \nwe have heard today and at the end of last week, and we will hear again \nand again, nothing is more important to America's future than \naddressing the education needs of our children. That is so for all the \nobvious reasons. There is nothing more important than education as we \nlook at the preparation for quality of life, for looking at our \nNation's overall economic prosperity domestically, but also as we look \nat issues such as global competitiveness.\n  As we heard this afternoon, every child in America does deserve the \nright to a drug-free classroom, to a violence-free classroom, with a \nhighly qualified teacher at the head of that class. As a father of \nthree young boys, 16, 14, and 12, I think a lot about education. I \nthink a lot about how students can be best prepared for a future that \nis increasingly sophisticated in technology, information technology, \nand a global economy where competitiveness is not only with other \npeople in the community but other people across the State, across the \ncountry, and across the world.\n  It comes back to that basic principle of local involvement, how we \ncan step away from thinking education needs to be controlled by either \nus in the Senate or Washington, DC, or bureaucrats; and recognize it is \nthat local control, those local schools that can best identify the \nneeds of a local community with the involvement of parents who care the \nmost about the education of their own children, and the involvement of \nprincipals in a local community. That is why last year my colleagues \nand I introduced legislation which we called Ed-Flex, which basically \nreturns that power back to local communities, recognizing how limited \nwe are, being right in Washington, DC, even assuming we can micromanage \nwhat goes on in Alamo, TN, or Soddy or Daisy, TN. It is those \nprincipals, those teachers, those parents, those superintendents, those \ndistricts that can best identify what the needs are of that community.\n  Ed-Flex allowed schools to use Federal money. That particular bill \ndid not include new Federal money. Although I might add, we in the \nSenate, under Republican leadership--and I am very proud of this--did \nincrease Federal spending last year by $500 million above what the \nPresident of the United States wanted or requested. The Republican \nleadership in the Senate sent a strong message: Yes, if we have local \ncontrol, improved flexibility, and strong accountability, we will \ncontinue to invest, and invest heavily, in education across this \ncountry.\n  Ed-Flex took the same amount of money we had, but basically stripped \naway all the Washington redtape, freeing the shackles of these \nexcessive, burdensome regulations that were added here in Washington, \nDC, but really handcuffing our teachers whose goal, whose profession is \nto educate people in that classroom, children in that classroom.\n\n  Ed-Flex was a first step. Issues such as school safety are, again, \nvery important issues that have to be addressed if that right really \ndoes include being in a classroom that is violence free and drug free. \nIt is time we extend this concept of empowerment of families, of \nparents, of using resources locally so they can be directed where the \nneeds are. That is what this legislation does.\n  I am pleased because this is a continuation of a process. Again, this \nparticular bill doesn't answer all the education challenges we have, \nbut it continues that process by giving significant relief to American \nfamilies, to parents as they pursue the educational opportunities which \nwe all--both sides of the aisle--know are so important.\n  I had the opportunity of presiding over the previous hour, and again \nyou hear this particular bill does not do enough to improve all K-12 \neducation, or all education. Yes, this particular bill is not intended \nto solve all of the problems or all of the challenges of education. But \nit does very specifically address a number of them.\n  At the same time this discussion on the floor continues, we are \ndebating in committee what is called ESEA, although a lot of people are \njust getting familiar with what those letters mean. ESEA is the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. We are reauthorizing that large \nact, which addresses many of the other issues in education. This \nparticular bill will likely be debated actively in committee within the \nnext several weeks and then brought to the floor to follow the current \nbill about which we are talking.\n  It is this combination of the bill we are talking about on the \nfloor--and I will come to a few more of the details in this bill--and \nthe more comprehensive legislation of ESEA that I believe put together, \nbuilding on Ed-Flex last year, building on the additional $500 million \ninvestment this body put in above the President, that moves us towards \nthe goal on the right track with the right principles of local control, \nstrong accountability, and increased flexibility that ultimately will \nimprove our American education system. That is true especially where we \nneed the improvement the most, and that is kindergarten through the \n12th grade.\n  The ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, addresses \nissues on the spending side of the ledger. The bill we are addressing \ntoday addresses the tax-related issues associated with education as \nwell as the savings side of education. We had hearings in the Senate a \ncouple of weeks ago. My colleague from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, \nheld hearings on the rising cost of college, how that can be addressed \ntoday.\n  One of the things that came out of those hearings is that we should \ndo all we can to empower parents and students to save enough for a \ncollege education.\n  What do we have today? Under current law, a family can contribute \n$500 per year into an education IRA. I do not want to diminish that \nbecause it is very important. It again came from this particular body, \nof which I am very proud. But I think we can extend it. We have an \nopportunity to extend that limit in one part of this bill.\n  Last week in Tennessee, I had an opportunity to visit three different \nK-12 public schools. The teachers and parents who had come said: \nSenator Frist, we don't want you to be telling us how many computers we \ncan have, what kind of computers, and where to hook them up. We want \nyou to help us to be free to spend the resources we have. And can't you \nhelp us save a little bit for our children's education in the future? \nIsn't there something you can do in terms of legislation?\n  IRAs are tremendous savings vehicles. The regular IRAs we have today \nsimply do not help the conscientious people of Tennessee save enough \nmoney for their children's education because when you take money out of \nthese traditional IRAs, you pay a significant penalty for early \nwithdrawal. Therefore, the only savings vehicle we have today is the \neducation IRA. But as I mentioned, the limit on maximum contributions \nis $500 a year, and that comes down to about $40 a month. I do not know \nabout my colleagues, but that is about what my cable bill is each \nmonth.\n  In addition to raising that contribution limit for education IRAs, \nthis bill will also allow the American family for the first time to use \nsome of those education savings for expenses that are associated with \nK-12 education. Currently, with an education IRA as presently designed, \none cannot use that money for K-12 expenses. I have heard a number of \nmy colleagues claim that allowing families to use some of their own \nmoney for elementary and secondary education is a backdoor attempt for \na voucher debate. I hate to hear that almost fearmongering of: Let's \nnot talk about the issues at hand because what you are really talking \nabout is vouchers, when they are totally disassociated.\n  It comes down to whose money is this? It is the family's money; it is \ntheir money to begin with. This whole debate on vouchers can be held on \nsome other day.\n  I want to make it clear this savings proposal we are debating is no \nmore a voucher proposal than a tax cut is a voucher proposal.\n  As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee's Task Force on Education, \nI had the opportunity to listen to people who were bringing before that \ntask force creative solutions to the problems which plague our Nation's \nschools today. Although, again, we need to address that in a \ncomprehensive manner, which we are doing, I believe expanding the \neducation savings account is a positive, constructive first step, not a \nfinal solution.\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n  It does move us in the important direction of empowering parents, \nchildren, and that parent-child team. Again, the concept is very \ndifferent than a Washington, DC, one size fits all strategy or more \nmandates out of Washington. What we are doing is locally empowering \nthat parent-child team. Who best can identify the local needs of that \nchild? It might also be an individual with a disability. For the first \ntime, we allow these K-12 funds to be used for the purchase of \ntechnology to make learning easier. Or we are empowering for the first \ntime that parent and that child, through a savings account, to use \nthose resources for afterschool tutoring for that child who cannot \nquite keep up or does not quite understand what the teacher is trying \nto say.\n  On the issue of expansion of the definition of qualified education \nexpenses, again, it has been talked about, but I want to make the point \nthat you can do these things for higher education, but it is K-12 for \nwhich you cannot use these funds. Therefore, this expansion of \ndefinitions is critically important. It can be used for fees, it can be \nused for academic tutoring as I mentioned, for books, or for supplies. \nIt can be used for the cost of computers or technology, for those \nindividuals with disabilities. It might be a tool that allows one \neither to hear a little bit better or to express one's self if one is \nunable to talk. Home schooling expenses, again, can qualify. We all \nknow it is parents who know best and who care the most about their \nchildren's future.\n\n  The President signed in 1997 the Taxpayer Relief Act which authorized \nnew education IRAs for those higher education expenses. I have been \nvery supportive of that, and this body has been very supportive of \nthat. What we want to do now is take those moneys and apply it to K-12.\n  Higher education in this country is the envy of the world. There is \nno question about it. We have the greatest higher education system of \nall 140 or 150 countries anywhere in the world. But what about \nkindergarten through 12? Are we the best? No. Are we in the top four or \nfive? I can tell you what TIMSS, the Third International Math and \nScience Study, shows.\n  Looking at math and science and the 12th grade where one would think \nwe would be the very best with the prosperity and the freedoms we have \nand our emphasis on education and the best higher education, surely in \nthe 12th grade we are the best. In math and science, which we know \npretty well are the backbone of technology and job creation of the \nfuture, we are not first in the world. We are not 5th in the world. We \nare not 8th in the world. We are not 12th in the world. We are not 15th \nin the world. We are not 18th in the world. But we are 19th and 20th in \nthe world when it comes to the 12th grade. We are failing in K-12.\n  There are a number of issues we can talk about, and I know there are \nother Members on the floor who want to speak, but I do want to mention \nthe employer-sponsored aspect of this bill. We will talk a lot about \nthe education savings account as we go forward, but in addition, this \nbill extends the tax exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance and restores the exclusion for employer-provided educational \nassistance at the graduate level.\n  The Senator from Iowa was just in the Chamber and emphasized a very \nimportant point that can be overlooked but should not because it is a \nvery important part of the bill, in that the bill eliminates the limit \non the number of months a taxpayer may deduct the interest costs that \nhe or she must pay on his or her student loan.\n  As a reminder, currently a taxpayer can only deduct the interest on \nhis or her loan for 5 years, regardless of how long he or she must pay \ninterest on that loan. The provision allows taxpayers to deduct the \ninterest that must be paid on a student loan for the lifetime of that \nloan.\n  In closing, I want to mention that the bill itself does provide help \nfor all of those schools, as well as those school districts in need of \nschool construction, school modernization. Thus, I am pleased the \nmajority leader has brought this bill before the Senate for early \nconsideration. I applaud his decision to do so. It builds upon what we \ndid in the last session. It sets us on the right track focusing on K-12 \neducation, and there is no more important issue as we look to the \nfuture than education.\n  If we can complete action on this particular bill and then complete \naction on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will have \naddressed both the spending side of the equation, as well as the tax \nside of the equation, both of which are important to improving and \nstrengthening education in this country. We can do all of that before \nEaster.\n\n  I compliment the Senator from Georgia, who has worked on this \nparticular issue during the whole period I have been in the Senate. His \nleadership is impressive. He is a mentor to many of us on education. I \nappreciate his hard work. I urge my colleagues to support this very \nimportant bill in order to expand education opportunities for families \nand students, yes, in Tennessee but all across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his remarks and \ngenerous comments on our efforts. I enjoy very much working with him. I \nam very complimentary of his work in education on the Budget Committee \nand on the Educational Flexibility Act which was a historic \naccomplishment by the Congress. I thank the Senator so much for being \nhere today.\n  I yield the floor. I note the Senator from Texas is seeking \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me \nto speak. I am very pleased to support the bill. Of course, I \nacknowledge the leadership of Senator Coverdell and Senator Roth. They \nhave been the leaders in trying to give more choices to more parents in \nour country to do what is best for their children.\n  In Washington, sometimes we get a one-size-fits-all mentality, but \neveryone knows that every child in this country is different and every \nchild has different needs. What we should be doing in Washington is \ngiving parents the ability to choose what is best for their particular \nchild. That is what S. 1134 does.\n  The Affordable Education Act of 1999 is exactly what this country \nneeds to empower parents to do the best for their children. Our goal is \nto give every child the opportunity to succeed in this country. No \nchild can succeed without a good education.\n  This bill is simple and it is compelling. We have in the law now an \neducation IRA. It allows post-tax contributions to be invested and then \nused tax free for college tuition and other costs. This is a great \nidea.\n  Once again, Senator Coverdell and Senator Roth led us to pass this \nbill. It creates an added incentive for Americans to save, particularly \nat a time when Americans have a negative savings rate. It encourages \nmore Americans to think about and plan for and pay for college for \ntheir children. More college-educated Americans mean more higher-income \nAmericans; it means more tax revenues to offset the lost revenues. If \never there was a win-win tax policy, this is it.\n  So why would anyone oppose expanding this tremendously successful \nprogram for K through 12 education expenses? We have a high school \ndropout rate that is unacceptably high for the greatest country on \nEarth. We have children who are unable to afford basic supplies, much \nless computers. We have children literally trapped in failed schools.\n  I support this bill because I support the ability of parents to \nchoose what is best for their children. This bill ensures the maximum \npossible flexibility for parents. If they wish to save for college and \nuse the proceeds to pay for college tuition on a tax-free basis, they \ncan do that. If they want to use the proceeds to purchase band uniforms \nfor their child, they can do that--or books or computers or anything \nthat would relate to the education or development of their children.\n  And yes, parents can use the accounts for private or parochial school \ntuition--which forms the core of the opposition to this bill by the \nPresident and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  I am not going to apologize for supporting a bill that allows working \nfamilies to save their own hard-earned\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\nmoney to send their children to the school that will give them the best \nchoice and the best start in life. It takes not one penny from the \npublic schools in this country.\n  I do not apologize for supporting that because I know working-class \nTexans who have told me they want the choice to send their child to a \nschool that they think is the best.\n  Choice is what this bill is all about. Choice is at the heart of a \nprovision that I offered to this bill last year, which was passed on \nthe Senate floor before being vetoed by President Clinton. That \namendment would, for the first time, make Federal funds available for \npublic single-sex schools and classrooms as long as comparable \neducational opportunities were made available for students of both \nsexes.\n\n  The Senate overwhelmingly approved this amendment on two previous \noccasions. I am confident it will again because I am going to bring it \nup on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nscheduled to be taken up later this year in the Senate.\n  I might say, Senator Collins, who is sitting in the Chair today, is a \nvery strong supporter of this amendment. I appreciate her leadership on \nthis issue. She has talked to parents in Maine who have wanted to be \nable to send their children to a single-sex classroom because they know \nthat child would be able to do better in that environment, but they \nhave been discouraged by the Department of Education.\n  So because of that experience, because Senator Collins listened to \nher constituents in Maine, we are now going to team up and let every \nchild in America have the choice that the parent in Maine wants for her \nchild.\n  I offered that provision to help remove the cloud of doubt that was \nhanging over the education community about what the Federal Government \nwould do if parents decided this is what they wanted, and they went to \nthe school board and asked for the authorization of a same-gender \nschool or classroom.\n  The amendment is simple. It adds the establishment and operation of \nsame-gender schools and classrooms to the list of allowable uses for \nfunds under title VI, the Federal innovation education block grant \nprogram. This amendment is necessary because for too long the \nDepartment of Education has discouraged States and public schools from \npursuing voluntary single-sex programs, despite the clear benefits that \nsuch programs have for some students and despite the fact that they \nwould only be offered where parents asked for it and support it.\n  Ask almost any student or graduate of a same-gender school, most of \nwhom are from private or parochial schools, and they will almost all \ntell you--enthusiastically--that they were enriched and strengthened by \ntheir experience.\n  Surveys and studies of students show that at certain levels of \neducation, for some students, both boys and girls enrolled in same-\ngender programs tend to be more confident, more focused on their \nstudies, and ultimately more successful in school, as well as later in \ntheir careers. Both sexes report feeling a camaraderie and a sense of \npeer and teacher support that they do not encounter to the same degree \nin coeducational classrooms. Teachers, too, report fewer control and \ndiscipline problems--something almost any teacher will tell you can \nconsume a good part of classtime. Inevitably, these positive student \nattitudes translate into academic results.\n  Study after study has demonstrated that girls and boys in same-gender \nschools, on average, are academically more successful and ambitious \nthan their coeducational counterparts. These results and benefits of \nsame-gender education for hundreds of thousands of American students \nand their families can be an option in public schools as well as \nparochial and private.\n  Susan Estrich, a professor of law at the University of California, \nstated in a recently syndicated article regarding the amendment:\n\n       Without boys in the classroom, researchers have found, \n     girls speak up more, take more science and math, and end up \n     getting more Ph.D.s, and serve on more corporate boards. \n     While the benefits of single-sex education for boys have been \n     less well-documented, there is at least anecdotal evidence \n     that boys' schools in the inner cities, where discipline is \n     stressed and positive male role models emphasized, may result \n     in lower dropout rates and higher test scores.\n  I believe this is an idea that should be an option for every parent. \nIt is not a mandate. It is not even a recommendation. It is just an \noption. Why not let the parents have the full range of choices in \npublic school? That is what the innovation provision of title VI is \nsupposed to do.\n  We also hear a lot on the Senate floor about the need to hire more \nteachers and to reduce class size. Many on the other side of the aisle \nthink the answer to the growing teacher shortage is to simply have the \nFederal Government hire more teachers, pay for a fraction of their \nsalaries, and force local school districts to pick up the rest. I think \nthere is a better approach and one that will not only ensure that more \nteachers are hired but that better teachers are also hired, teachers \nwith real-world experience and knowledge that can be translated into \nthe classroom.\n  Called Careers to Classrooms, my proposal would build on a \ntremendously successful Department of Defense program that takes \nexperienced, qualified military service men and women and helps them \ntransition into the classroom as teachers. The program seeks out and \nhelps place members of the military, with at least 10 years of service \nand skills, in high-need areas such as math, science, computers, and \nlanguage skills. It also helps many of them with stipends while they \nget their certification, which usually comes through a streamlined \ncertification process.\n  Careers to Classrooms takes this successful model and applies it to \ncivilian professionals interested in sharing their knowledge with \npublic school students. Under this program, individuals with \ndemonstrable skills in high-need areas, such as computers or foreign \nlanguages, would be helped to find a school that has a need for \nteachers in their field. It would provide assistance to the school to \nhire the individual while they obtain their certification--again, under \na streamlined process.\n  This is another example of a win-win for a career person who would \nlike to go into a different career, would like to go into teaching, \nhappens to be able to speak French or Russian or Italian or Chinese, \nand would like to offer that to a school that can't offer it to \nstudents because they don't have a qualified teacher. This approach is \nfar less costly than simply paying the salaries of new teachers \nregardless of their expertise or background.\n  While there is no question our teachers need to be paid, and paid \nwell, this is an area that has been left to the discretion of our \nStates and local school districts throughout the history of this \nNation. Our Nation's parents and their children do not need more \nFederal control, more bureaucracy, and more redtape.\n  I had a teacher come to one of my townhall meetings in a small town \nin north Texas. The teacher was about to go out of her mind. She \nbrought me the number of forms she has to fill out. It was this tall--\nthis tall--with pages she has to fill out just to be a teacher in this \nvery small school district in north Texas.\n  That is not what our teachers need. What we need is to empower our \nparents with greater choices to find the education path that is best \nfor each individual child in this country. We need to give teachers the \nability to teach rather than have more Federal mandates. We need to \nmake options available, and we need to do it in an innovative and \nflexible manner.\n  Heaping more money on a failed system has been exhaustive to our \nteachers, to our principals, to our superintendents, to our parents, \nand to our children. The policies of the past have failed. The \nAffordable Education Act and the two additional proposals I have \noutlined are policies of the future, policies that will enable every \nchild in this country to fulfill his or her potential.\n  That is our goal. How we get there is the debate we are having today. \nI want to do it with flexibility, with options and empowerment of \nparents. That is what Senator Coverdell and Senator Roth are giving us \nthe opportunity to pass. I urge my colleagues to support this very good \npiece of legislation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \nher\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\ngenerous remarks and also the thoroughness with which she has described \nthis legislation and her amendment.\n  If the Chair is willing, I am glad to assume the Chair so the Senator \nfrom Maine might participate in this debate, if that is appropriate.\n  (Senator COVERDELL assumed the Chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Presiding Officer for his generosity in \nassuming the Chair so I may debate this extremely important issue. The \nSenator from Georgia has been such a strong leader in the Senate on \neducation issues. I have been very pleased to work with him on a number \nof education issues. I know how committed he is to improving education \nfor all American children. I am delighted to join in this debate today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, improving education for all American \nchildren is our No. 1 priority in the Senate. It is No. 1 on our \nRepublican plan.\n  Education is more important than ever before in our history. While \neducation has always been the engine of social and economic progress, \ntoday it assumes more importance than ever before. Education is \ncritical to allow people to fully participate in our increasingly \ntechnological society. Education is critical to narrowing the gap \nbetween the rich and the poor in this country, which is largely an \neducational gap. In fact, an individual with a college degree can \nexpect to earn, on average, $17,000 more a year than an individual who \nonly has a high school degree. Increasingly, education is important not \nonly to our quality of life, not only to technological and medical \nbreakthroughs, but to narrowing the gaps in our society and ensuring \nthat everyone is able to have the quality of life he or she wishes to \nhave.\n  By working with our parents, our teachers, our communities, and our \nStates, our goal is to strengthen our schools so that every American \nchild has the opportunity for a good education, so that no child, in \nthe words of Texas Governor George Bush, is left behind. That is our \ngoal.\n  A good education is a ladder of opportunity. It turns dreams into \nreality, it is responsible for improvements in our quality of life, and \nit enables a child to achieve his or her full potential. That is why I \nam a strong supporter of the Affordable Education Act, the legislation \nwe are debating today.\n  The Presiding Officer knows I am a very strong supporter of public \neducation. I would not support a bill I thought in any way weakened \npublic education. The last time this bill was debated on the Senate \nfloor--and again today--I heard suggestions that somehow this bill was \na backdoor attempt at vouchers. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In fact, this legislation will allow American families to save \nfor their children's future education--to save for college, for \nexample. It will allow them to use the money they put aside to \nsupplement public education in K through 12, to hire a tutor, for \nexample, to pay for a school trip, to help to afford extra help by way \nof buying a computer. This will help parents help their own children \nwith their own money that they are putting aside in an educational \nsavings account.\n  I am particularly interested in this legislation because I think it \nwill help parents afford higher education, which often seems to be an \nobstacle that many families question they can afford.\n  Creating the educational IRA, as this Congress did, was an important \nfirst step in encouraging families to save for higher education. But we \nneed to go further, and the Affordable Education Act contains \nsignificantly improved benefits for families using educational IRAs to \nsave for postsecondary education.\n  In the State of Maine, we have a terrific record of encouraging our \nstudents to complete high school. We have one of the best records in \nthe country. But, unfortunately, we don't do as well encouraging \nstudents to go beyond high school. In that area, we lag behind other \nStates. Yet we know how important higher education is. It is more \nimportant than ever before. As I talk with students and their families, \nschool administrators, and teachers, I find that too many Maine \nfamilies believe education beyond high school is simply beyond their \nmeans. This legislation will help them save for the cost of higher \neducation. It will increase the annual amount a family can contribute \nto an educational IRA from $500 to $2,000.\n  Now, let's look at what that means and the difference that can make. \nThat means if a family were saving the maximum amount of $2,000 each \nyear for 18 years, starting at the child's birth, at a return of about \n8 percent per year, they would have about $75,000 to pay for a college \neducation. Now, that contrasts sharply with the $19,000 they would have \nunder current law. That is important because $75,000 is an awful lot \ncloser to the average cost of attending a private college for 4 years \nthan $19,000 would be.\n  The Affordable Education Act also makes some important changes and \nimprovements in prepaid tuition plans. That is another way we can help \nAmerican families better afford higher education. Some of the \nprovisions in this bill were originally proposed in legislation I \nintroduced called the Savings For Scholars legislation.\n  For example, families will be allowed to roll over accounts without \nincurring tax liability from one prepaid plan to another. So if they \nmove from one State to another with a different variation, they don't \nlose the benefits of that plan.\n  The legislation includes first cousins among the family members to \nwhom a plan can be transferred should it not be needed or used by the \nchild who was the original beneficiary. It will provide greater \nincentives for grandparents to establish prepaid tuition or to \nparticipate in prepaid tuition plans.\n  Another provision of this legislation, which I think is very \nimportant, is that it will eliminate the 60-month limit on the \ndeduction of student loan interest. The second bill I introduced as a \nnew Senator in 1997 allowed students to deduct the interest on their \nstudent loans. I am very pleased that a version of my legislation--and \nthere were many others supporting that approach as well--was \nincorporated into the 1997 Tax Relief Act. But we found that there was \na 60-month limit put on how long someone could deduct the interest on a \nstudent loan. This legislation eliminates that 60-month limit. That is \ngoing to be very important to students who attend graduate or \nprofessional school or who otherwise have incurred a large debt burden.\n  The impetus for the legislation I introduced back in 1997 came from \nmy experience while working at a small college in Maine. Most of the \nstudents of this college--Husson College in Bangor, ME--were first-\ngeneration college students, the first members of their family to \nattend college. Eighty-five percent of them received some sort of \nstudent loan in order to be able to afford college. What I found is \nthat many of them were graduating with a mountain of debt. They were \nworried about how they were going to be able to pay off those student \nloans. Allowing them to deduct that interest every month when they \nwrite that check, knowing they will be able to deduct that interest, is \nan enormous help to them. By eliminating that 60-month limit, we will \nhelp even more students and help make higher education that much more \naffordable.\n  Another important provision of the Affordable Education Act is the \nprovision dealing with the National Health Corps scholarships \nexclusion. Because Maine is underserved in many of our rural areas for \nhealth care providers, this provision is particularly important to our \nState. What it would do is allow health care providers who had received \nthese National Health Corps scholarships to exclude the cost of that \nscholarship from their gross income.\n  I have touched on just some of the very important provisions of this \nlegislation. We know that investing in education and making it easier \nfor families to afford education, whether it is helping at the K \nthrough 12 level or making higher education more affordable, is a good \ninvestment, that it is the surest and best way for us to build our \ncountry's assets for the future. We need to help more American families \nafford higher education. We need to strengthen our educational system. \nThat is what this legislation will accomplish.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in supporting this legislation, \nwhich will\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nmake a real difference to so many American families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, thank you very much. I am extremely \npleased to be able to come to the floor this afternoon to join my \ncolleague in support of S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act.\n  A few moments ago, I was in our TV studio cutting a tape, as many of \nus oftentimes do, to send back to our constituents or to speak out on a \ngiven issue in which a group has asked us to become involved. I was \ncutting a tape on a project that is a nationwide project called Safe \nPlace. You have probably seen that triangular, yellow sign that shows a \nchild inside that is on the glass or door of a small business, a fire \nstation, or a city hall. It says ``Safe Place,'' and designates that \nparticular location as ready to receive a child in crisis, a child who \nhas had a crisis within its home or with its peers in the community and \nfeels at risk and therefore seeks a safe sanctuary, a haven.\n  I have also asked our colleagues to support the third week of March \nfor the second year in a row as National Safe Place Week.\n  The reason I say that in the context of the Affordable Education Act \nis that we Americans recognize the value of our young people. We \nrecognize they are without question our most important asset and that \nwe have a fundamental responsibility to them as a culture and as a \nsociety.\n  When I speak about Safe Place, that is one of the first things we \nthink of as a parent and as a community. Are our children safe within \nour homes, safe within our suburbs, or safe within our communities? The \nnext thing we begin to think about after their safety is their well-\nbeing beyond safety. I think we all recognize that beyond safety comes \neducation as a major part of a child's well-being; therefore, early on \nas a country we began to establish a general educational system so that \nall of our young people could be more educated and more prepared than \nthe generation before them.\n  Education has become a profound part of all levels of our government. \nWhile we recognize education is still the primary responsibility of \nState and local units of government, we have also said the family unit \nhas as its major responsibility not only the haven of safety and \nsecurity but the responsibility of assuring its young people an \neducation and that we in government would help facilitate that, we \nwould help make that happen. But most important is to empower the \nparent and the family in a way that allows them to bring on that \nfundamental and basic responsibility of providing for their children \nand their education.\n  S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act, looks at some primary \nconcerns, and it recognizes our Tax Code penalizes the family for \nsaving money to defray a child's educational expenses.\n  Is it fair to penalize them for wanting a better future for their \nchildren as a part of what I think is the fundamental responsibility of \na human culture? Of course it is not. By expanding the educational IRA, \nwe are doing something substantive to address a parent's concern about \nhis or her child's education.\n  Opponents of this bill claim we are not helping education as a whole \nbut only giving a subsidy to private schools. Shame on them. Shame on \nthem for trying to narrow the debate when the fundamental debate is to \nbroaden the issue and to expand the ability of families to provide for \ntheir children's education.\n  It is simply not the case that we offer a subsidy to the private \nschool. The money parents can save with these accounts can be used \ntoward books, supplies, and other ``qualified educational expenses'' at \na public or a private school.\n  Why should we stand in the way of a parent's responsibility, that I \nthink I have appropriately explained, in fulfilling the needs of their \nchild in his or her educational desires?\n  This bill also benefits public education by changing the formula for \nlocal government bonds so more money would go to benefit public school \nconstruction. What is wrong with that? We have already heard about a \ndeficit in the safety of some of our old educational structures or the \nneed to expand and improve or to build new educational structures.\n  It is true, though, that this bill would benefit parents who do not \nsend their children to public schools, as the money from these savings \naccounts can be used to help defray expenses incurred at a private \nschool or for home schooling. Yes, let me repeat that: Home schooling. \nWhat is wrong with allowing and empowering the parent to work for the \neducation of their children?\n  This again comes down to the issue of fairness. Instead of being \nselective and saying all children have to march down this single \nFederal national public tightrope because that is the only way they can \nget an education, we are saying that is simply not true.\n  Thousands and thousands of American families today are demonstrating \njust that. They want the flexibility of choice to send their child \nwhere they think that child will receive the best education. Why \nshouldn't we have the intelligence--maybe there is another word that \nfits better--to allow that parent to do as he or she wishes and to \nimprove their ability to do so with this kind of law, for these parents \nto decide if their children would learn better wherever they chose to \nplace them? We in Washington should not penalize them for making every \neffort to ensure their child receives a quality education.\n  This bill allows parents, many of whom are of lower or middle class, \nto use up to $2,000 tax free to help their child learn the way the \nparent wants them to learn--not a Washington bureaucrat, not a labor \nunion leader, but the parent. That is where the fundamental and primary \nresponsibility lies.\n  In the end, it comes down to this essential question: Should we be \ntaxing the money parents use to further their child's education or \nshould we give them an opportunity by allowing them to put away a tax-\nfree dollar in that benefit? I, for one, do not believe we should tax \nin this area. This is the same as levying a punitive tax on education.\n  We all know the old axiom: When you tax something, you get less of \nit. It is just very fundamental and very simple to understand. This \nlegislation goes a long way toward offering parents that opportunity to \nadvance their child's education.\n  I know of no other issue today that is more important than the \ngeneral issue of education. When I am home in my State of Idaho, \nholding town meetings or visiting with the citizens of my State, \neducation is the issue. There is no question they express great \nconcern, either about the safety of their schools, the quality of the \neducation being provided, or the expense of a college education today. \nAll Americans hope for a better life for their children than the one \nthey led. They are absolutely sure that better life will come through \nfulfilling an American dream that offers an optimum educational \nexperience. That is why this legislation, S. 1134, is so important.\n  The sanctuary of security is our first parental instinct; our second \nis to try to provide the very best opportunities for our children. \nThose opportunities will only come and a parent will only be able to \nprovide for the very best if they have the greatest of flexibility to \nassure that child has the better educational experience. That is what \nthis legislation is about.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for the leadership he has taken in \nworking to empower America's families to put away in a nontaxed \nenvironment just a little bit to ensure the opportunity of their \nchildren to secure the education of their choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his support of the \nlegislation, his remarks, and the generous kindness he has extended to \nme.\n  Madam President, I think it might be of use to those listening to \ntake just another moment to frame the totality of the legislation, a \nlittle bit about who are the sponsors of the legislation, and then to \nrespond to some of the critiques we have heard from the other side of \nthe aisle. I first want to make clear, this is a bipartisan legislative \neffort. The chief cosponsor of this legislation is Senator Torricelli \nof New Jersey.\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\n  When this legislation was before the Senate last, it received 59 \nfavorable votes, Republican and Democrat.\n  The first point is this is a bipartisan bill. It has received \nsignificant passionate and dedicated support from both sides of the \naisle. There is no one who has fought harder for the legislation, as I \nsaid, than Senator Torricelli from New Jersey. He has been rather \ncourageous about it, candidly.\n  The second point I wish to make is to frame the nature of the overall \nbill. The component that gets talked about the most is the education \nsavings account, which we know will benefit about half the elementary \nschool population in the United States. Fourteen million families, we \nestimate, will open an education savings account for their children. \nThey will be the parents of about 20 million kids. That is just under \nhalf the entire population going to kindergarten through high school. \nOver the next 10 years, we are saying to these 14 million families, if \nyou put the money in your savings account, we will not tax the interest \nbuildup. That is not a large sum of money. It is, over 5 years, about \n$1.3 billion. Over 10 years, it is about $2.4 billion that we would not \nhave taxed out of these savings accounts. We would have left it in the \nsavings accounts.\n  I have said this many times. It is amazing to me how a small \nincentive makes Americans do big things. By saying to these families we \nwill not tax the interest in your account, we estimate they will save, \nover 10 years, $12 billion. I asked a Senator the other day in the \ndebate on how many Federal programs can we get a 10-to-1 return? Not \nmany.\n  We are forfeiting $2.5 billion in taxes and, in return, we are \ngetting $12 billion voluntarily put forward to help schools all across \nthe land. That would be one of the largest influxes of new resources \nbehind education in the last 10 or 15 years. We have not had to \nappropriate anything to do it; no Governor did, no local community did. \nBy simply saying we are not going to tax that interest, people step up \nto the bar.\n  As has been mentioned in the debate by several Senators, that is a \nvery powerful component of the legislation. But it will also help 1 \nmillion employees advance their education because we are allowing the \nemployer a tax incentive, up to $5,200 a year, that can be spent on an \nemployee's continuing education and it would not be taxed. We are \nhelping students who are in prepaid State tuition plans all across the \ncountry because we are not going to tax those proceeds. How many? About \na million students. A million employees. This is beginning to add up to \nreal numbers in America--14 million families.\n  On school construction, we are using the proposal of Senator Graham \nof Florida, on the other side of the aisle, to help local communities \nwith the problems of school construction.\n  The Senator who is now acting as our Chair talked about the health \ncare benefits that are in the legislation and the fact we are allowing, \nthrough the life of a loan, the deductibility of the interest for \nhundreds of thousands of students who have large debt when they get out \nof college.\n\n  The point I am making is it is a very broad policy, and it is \nsupported strongly by Members of both parties.\n  In the debate last week, several people who have objected to the \nlegislation did so on the grounds that it would allow a family \nattending a parochial school or a private school or a home school to \nuse the proceeds of their own account to help pay for that. That is \nextremely puzzling to me.\n  Ninety percent of America's students are in public schools. Only 10 \npercent or less are in private or parochial schools. The major \nbeneficiary of the savings accounts will be families in public schools. \nSeventy percent of the people who open these accounts will be helping \ntheir children who are in public schools. Thirty percent will be \nhelping their children who are in a private, parochial, or home school.\n  The division of the money being saved is higher for those in a \nparochial or private school because they know they have an extra burden \nto bear and they will tend to save a little more. So the distribution \nof the $12 billion will be about equal--$6 billion to public school \nstudents and $6 billion to private and parochial school students.\n  The comment was made on the other side this past week that somehow \nthe parents or families in parochial or private schools are wealthy and \nthey do not deserve any incentive or public attention. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  There is a study out from New York that the demographics of the \nstudent body of a parochial or private school are virtually identical \nto the demographics of the student body in the public system. In \nparochial schools, about 60 percent of the families make less than \n$40,000 a year. In private schools, 60 percent make, according to the \nCensus Bureau, less than $50,000 a year.\n  With regard to private and parochial schools, we have parents who, \nfor whatever reason, have decided they have to make a special effort to \ndeal with the education of their children because, remember, all of \nthese families are paying State taxes and local taxes for their school \nsystem. If they have decided to go to another school, they are still \npaying for the public school system. They have to reach down and pay \nanother bill to get in this other system.\n  They are not wealthy. I think it was offensive to hear these families \ndescribed as people driving around in a long limousine dropping Johnny \noff at the school. We will discuss this more during the course of the \ndebate, but the Chair recognizes that when scholarships have been \noffered in Washington, DC, or in other parts of the country, the \nprincipal applicants are African Americans who are struggling to \neducate their children. These are not rich families. They should not be \ncharacterized as such.\n  Senator Collins and I had a long discussion--not a debate--about \nwhether this is a voucher or not. As was concluded by the Senator from \nMaine, it is not a voucher. It will help people who have already made a \ndecision. It will help people in public schools, but statistically \ninsignificant is the number of people who might, because they have a \nsavings account, change schools. I am sure it will happen, but it would \nbe insignificant. And when it does happen, who is to say it should not?\n  In my State, there is a huge debate raging in the general assembly \nabout school accountability. Legislation that is likely to pass, which \nhas been offered by a Democratic Governor, says schools are either \nmaking it or not, and if they are not, those children have a right to \nescape that school.\n\n  If that becomes a law in my home State, then I want this kind of \ntool. It is just a tool to help families deal with that situation. The \nfirst thing that comes up is, if the school is not preparing our \nstudents and it is closed, who deals with the transportation? There \nwill be all kinds of commensurate costs that occur for the students who \nhave to go somewhere else. This kind of tool will help them deal with \nthat.\n  This debate is raging across the country. A little earlier, the \nSenator from North Dakota was complimentary of the public school system \nand I believe justifiably so. But the fact of life is, as the Senator \nfrom Tennessee alluded to, 40 percent of the students coming out of K-\n12 all across America cannot effectively read. We do have some \nproblems.\n  This legislation will help a student, whether they are in a public \nsetting or a private setting. Tutors and computers have been mentioned. \nThe poor in our country are shortchanged. The President has alluded to \nit, and the Vice President alluded to the digital divide, they call it. \nThis helps close the divide because it makes funds available to the \nfamily to begin to make high-tech equipment available to their kids, as \nwell as to those in better systems.\n  I close with a reminder that there is a piece of this legislation for \nwhich the reach is almost impossible for any of our estimators to \nfigure. This IRA account is different than others because it allows \nsponsors. In other words, a child can have an account opened for her or \nhim by a grandmother, a sister, a neighbor, an employer, a benevolent \nassociation, a labor organization. There is no limit to it when this \nbecomes law--and it will--and people begin to understand: I can help \nthis child over here; I can help the children of my employees; we can \nhelp the children of the people who belong to this union or church.\n  I used an example in the last debate a couple of years ago about the \nloss of\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\na couple of police officers in Atlanta. I thought at the time--because \neverybody wants to help--if we had been able to open this account for \nthe children of those officers, when they reached high school or junior \nhigh or college, the community easily could have provided a benefit of \nenormous consequences to the families of the fallen officers. I believe \nwe will see that kind of imagination begin to take root.\n  The value of those contributions are not in any of these numbers. No \none knows how many friends and neighbors and organizations and \nemployers will begin to seize on this. I know it will be a lot because \nthis kind of thing is in the American gut. It is a tool that Americans \ninstinctively will use.\n\n  I was about a third of the way through this debate last time when I \nremembered my father and I had opened a savings account for my two sets \nof twin nieces and nephews. At the time we opened it, we did not have \ntwo nickels to rub together. But we would put about $25 a month in it. \nIf this had been the law, we would have had two to three times the \namount of resources available when those children began to use it for \nschool. As it was, it was not a lot of money. I think it probably got \nup to $5,000 to $8,000. But you know what. It made a difference. We did \nnot have much money, but we found a way to put a few dollars away. A \nlot of other Americans will, too.\n  With this legislation, no one gets hurt. Everybody gets helped: \nPublic, private, parochial, home, whatever. No one is being gouged. No \none is paying a price at the expense of somebody else. As I mentioned a \nmoment ago, in America it is intuitive in our nature to step forward.\n  The last thing I will say is, the dollars in these savings accounts \nhave a--who knows?--3-to-1 value, 10-to-1 value. I do not know what it \nis, but these dollars are worth more than public dollars, a lot more, \nbecause they are laser-beam managed.\n  First of all, mom and dad are going to get a statement from whichever \nsavings and loan it is to remind them every month how much money is in \nthat account, which will also remind them of their responsibility for \neducating those children. It is just an automatic reminder.\n  The second thing that makes it so valuable is that no one knows the \nunique need of the child better than the parent or the sponsor of these \naccounts.\n  So this money goes right to the target, whether it is a special \neducation need, a medical need, a tutor, a home computer, whatever. \nPublic dollars are hard to direct that way. They build the buildings; \nthey hire the staff; they hire the teachers, and much good is done from \nit, but it is hard to put them right on the dime. It reminds you of one \nof these missiles we saw in Kosovo--going right down the chimney. That \nis exactly where these dollars will go.\n  As has been said, we already have a savings account for higher \neducation. That is good. This makes that account four times larger. In \nother words, higher education will benefit from this as well because \nmany families will save for K through 12, and then they will not have \nto use that money. It will be there for college. But as the Chair \nnoted, $75,000 versus $19,000 is a big difference.\n  Because there is so much trouble in K through 12, there are families \nwho will have to use it and need it at an earlier time. If that is the \ncase, they should have the ability to do that. It seems illogical to me \nto try to push away the options and requirements and needs of families, \nof children who are in kindergarten through high school.\n  That is where America's problem is right now. We will fix it. I am an \noptimist about this. I am not a pessimist. We will fix it. But \nremember, every day we wait on this we leave someone else behind. In my \nview, in this land of freedom, any child who is denied the fundamental \nskills of an education means there is one more among us who is not \ntruly free and cannot enjoy the benefits of citizenship in the \nUnited States. There is no higher work for us than to keep that from \nhappening every time we can.\n\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the \nAffordable Education Act on behalf of myself, the Presiding Officer--\nSenator Coverdell--and my good friend from Arizona, Senator Kyl.\n  We worked together to craft this amendment to help our public school \nteachers when they either pursue professional development at their own \nexpense or when they purchase supplies for their classrooms.\n  Our legislation has two major provisions. First, it will allow \nteachers to deduct their professional development expenses without \nsubjecting the deduction to the existing 2-percent floor that is in our \nTax Code. Second, it will grant teachers a tax credit of up to $100 for \nbooks, supplies, and other equipment they purchase for their students. \nThat is very common. As Senator Kyl noted earlier today, a study by the \nNational Education Association indicates the average schoolteacher \nteaching K through the 12th grade spends more than $400 annually on \nsupplies for the classroom.\n  Our amendment would reward teachers for undertaking these activities \nthat are designed to make them better teachers or to provide better \nsupplies for their students. It is an example of a way that we can say \nthank you to teachers who do much for our children.\n  Provisions similar to both of these components of our amendment were \nincluded in last year's tax bill. In this amendment, the definition of \n``acceptable professional development activities'' has been changed to \nreflect the definition included in the Teacher Empowerment Act that \nSenator Gregg of New Hampshire and I introduced last year, and which we \nexpect to be included in the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, which the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions is about to mark up. This definition sets high \nstandards for the quality of professional development activities \ncovered by our amendment, ensuring that such programs will help \nteachers truly excel in the classroom.\n\n  While our amendment provides financial relief for our dedicated \nteachers, its real beneficiaries are our Nation's students. Other than \ninvolved parents, which we all know to be the most important component, \na well-qualified and dedicated teacher is the single most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \nrepeatedly demonstrated the close relationship between qualified \nteachers and successful students. Moreover, teachers themselves \nunderstand how important professional development is to maintaining and \nexpanding their levels of competence. When I meet with teachers from \nMaine, they always tell me of their need for more professional \ndevelopment and the scarcity of financial support for this very worthy \npursuit. The willingness of Maine's teachers to reach deep into their \nown pockets to fund their own professional development impresses me \ndeeply.\n  For example, an English teacher in Bangor, who serves on my \nEducational Policy Advisory Committee, told me of spending her own \nmoney to attend a curriculum conference. She then came back and shared \nthat information with all of the English teachers in her department. \nShe is not alone. She is typical of teachers who are willing to pay for \ntheir own professional development as well as to purchase supplies and \nmaterials to enhance their teaching.\n  Let me explain how our amendment would work in terms of real dollars \nwhen it comes to professional development. In 1997, the average yearly \nsalary for a teacher was about $38,000. Under current law, a teacher \nearning this amount could not deduct the first $770 in professional \ndevelopment expenses he or she paid for out of pocket. So imagine, you \nare a teacher who is making about $38,000 a year and you are spending \nmore than $700 in order to take a course to improve your teaching to \nhelp you be a better teacher. Yet because you don't reach that 2-\npercent floor that is in the existing Tax Code, you don't get a tax \nbreak for that first $770. You have to spend more than that before you \ncan get the deduction. Our amendment would change that. It would see to \nit that teachers receive tax relief for all such expenses. Under our \namendment, that $770 would be a deduction on the teacher's income tax \nform.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education they need to improve their schools and to serve \ntheir students better. I greatly admire those teachers who reach into \ntheir own pockets to buy supplies, paints, books, all sorts of \nmaterials that are lacking in their classroom. We should reward those \nteachers. Let us change the Tax Code to recognize and reward their \nsacrifice and to encourage more teachers to take the courses they need \nor to help supplement the supplies in their classroom.\n  I hope these changes in our Tax Code will encourage more teachers to \nundertake the formal course work in the subject matter they teach, or \nto complete graduate degrees in either a subject matter or in \neducation, or to attend conferences to give them more ideas for \ninnovative approaches to presenting the course work they teach in \nperhaps a more challenging manner.\n  This amendment will reimburse teachers for just a small part of what \nthey invest in our children's future. This money will be money well \nspent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most \nimportant assets for our country's future; that is, a well-educated \npopulation. We need to ensure that our public schools have the very \nbest teachers possible in order to bring out the very best in our \nstudents. Adopting this amendment is the first step toward that goal. \nIt will help us in a small way recognize the many sacrifices our \nteachers make each and every day.\n  I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to work with the \nSenator from Georgia and the Senator from Arizona on this amendment. \nThey have\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nboth been great leaders in education and in coming up with innovative \nways to use our Tax Code to encourage better teaching. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us in support of this modest but important effort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to speak briefly on a matter we \nwill probably have the opportunity to discuss in greater detail at a \nlater time. That has to do with the nomination of Bradley Smith to be a \nCommissioner on the Federal Election Commission.\n  The President has made this nomination with the greatest reluctance. \nHe delayed it for many months while fending off hard lobbying on behalf \nof Mr. Smith by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  In the end, the President forwarded this nomination to us, \nacknowledging the Republican leadership's strongly held view that, \nunder standard practice for FEC appointments, each party is entitled to \nhave the President nominate its choice for a Commission seat allocated \nby law to that party.\n  I understand the President's decision. He did what he believes that \nhe, as President, was required to do, notwithstanding his concerns \nabout the suitability of Mr. Smith.\n  Now we, as Senators, must do what we are required to do by the \nConstitution--to consider this nomination on the merits.\n  I have examined the candidacy of Mr. Smith carefully, guided by only \none question--indeed the only question that should guide us: Is he \nqualified, as Commissioner of the FEC, to enforce the laws we have \npassed to control federal campaign fundraising and spending?\n  In my view, Mr. Smith's complete disdain for federal election law \nrenders him unqualified for the role of an FEC Commissioner, whose \nprincipal job is to administer the Federal Election Campaign Act as \nenacted by Congress and upheld by the courts.\n  Madan President, the American people must be able to trust that we, \nas legislators, mean what we say when we write the laws of the land. \nThey should not fear that we are passing laws professing the noblest \nmotives, while actively working against those laws by whatever means we \ncan find.\n  Nowhere is there a more critical need for this consistency of purpose \nthan in our consideration, enactment and oversight of laws governing \ncampaign finance.\n  We are, after all, candidates, and also party leaders, directly \naffected, in our own campaigns and political activities, by the \noperation of the Federal Election Campaign Act. Few laws that we pass \nas elected officials more acutely raise the spector of conflict of \ninterest--that we might structure rules and encourage enforcement \npolicies designed more to serve our own interests than the public \ninterest.\n  Why would the public not be suspicious, observing our failure \nsession-after-session to enact comprehensive campaign finance reform?\n  Now our Republican colleagues would like the Senate to confirm Mr. \nSmith. He comes to them highly recommended by those who would oppose \nmeaningful controls on campaign finance. And he has earned the respect \nof those in the forefront of the fight against reform.\n  Why? Because he believes that ``the most sensible reform . . . is \nrepeal of the Federal Election Campaign Act.'' Because he believes that \nmost of the problems we have faced in controlling political money have \nbeen ``exacerbated or created by the Federal Election Campaign Act.'' \nBecause he believes that the federal election law is ``profoundly \nundemocratic and profoundly at odds with the First Amendment.'' And \nbecause--and I quote again--``people should be allowed to spend \nwhatever they want.''\n\n  This is the man our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nlike us to seat on the Federal Election Commission, charged with the \nenforcement of the very laws he believes are undemocratic and should be \nrepealed.\n  This is not just asking the fox to guard the chicken coop. It is \ninviting the fox inside and locking the door behind him.\n  What would be better calculated to promote and spread public cynicism \nabout our commitment to campaign finance reform--indeed, cynicism about \nour commitment to responsible enforcement of the law already on the \nbooks--than confirmation of this nominee?\n  In considering this nomination, we are bound by the law we passed \nthat speaks specifically to the qualifications required of an FEC \nCommissioner. That law states that Commissioners should be ``chosen on \nthe basis of their experience, integrity, impartiality and good \njudgment.''\n  Certainly a fair, and in my view fatal, objection could be raised to \nthe Smith nomination on the grounds that he lacks the prerequisite \nquality of ``impartiality.'' He would be asked, as a Commissioner, to \napply the law evenhandedly, in accord with our intent, without regard \nto his own opinions about the wisdom of the legislative choice we have \nmade. Yet Mr. Smith has made his academic and journalistic reputation \nout of questioning that choice.\n  How will he reconcile that conflict, between his strongly held views \nand ours, in the often difficult cases the FEC must decide? When the \nCommission must enforce our contribution and spending limits, what \ndegree of impartiality can be expected of a Commissioner who believes, \nin his words, that ``people should be allowed to spend whatever they \nwant on politics''?\n  I am concerned, too, about the requirement of judgment. For Mr. Smith \nhas insisted for years that the Federal campaign finance laws are an \noffense against the First Amendment of the Constitution, undemocratic \nand in need of repeal. The Supreme Court has held in clear terms to the \ncontrary.\n  Perhaps Mr. Smith imagined that the Court's jurisprudence had \nchanged. If so, he is seriously mistaken, as made plain by the Court's \ndecision only weeks ago in the Shrink Missouri PAC decision effectively \nto affirm Buckley v. Valeo.\n  A commissioner who neither understands nor acknowledges the \nconstitutional law of the land is poorly equipped to balance real First \nAmendment guarantees against real Congressional authority to limit \ncampaign spending in the public interest. This is particularly true \nwhere he questions our laws, not merely on constitutional grounds, but \non the sweeping claim that they are undemocratic.\n  Mr. Smith is an energetic advocate for his views. We can respect his \nwish to express those views, and some indeed may agree with them. But \nthis nomination places at issue whether he is the proper choice to act \nnot as warrior in his own cause, but as agent of the public, as a \nfaithful, impartial administrator of the law.\n  I must conclude that he is not the right choice, not even close, and \nso I will oppose that nomination, and I will vote against confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S862-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S862-S865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADVANCE NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. Thurmond. Mr. President, pursuant to Section 304(b) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(b)), an \nadvance notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted by the Office of \nCompliance, U.S. Congress. The notice relates to regulations under the \nVeterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, which affords to covered \nemployees of the legislative branch the rights and protections of \nselected provisions of veterans' preference law.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice to be printed in the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\nRecord; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the notice be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998: Extension of Rights \nand Protections Relating to Veterans' Preference Under Title 5, United \n States Code, to Covered Employees of the Legislative Branch--Advance \n                     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     (``Board'') invites comments from employing offices, covered \n     employees, and other interested persons on matters arising \n     from the issuance of regulations under section 4(c)(4) of the \n     Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (``VEO''), \n     Pub.L. 105-339, 112 Stat. 3186, codified at 2 USC Sec. 1316a.\n       The provisions of section 4(c) will become effective on the \n     effective date of the Board regulations authorized under \n     section 4(c)(4). VEO Sec. 4(c)(6). Section 4(c)(4) of the VEO \n     directs the Board to issue regulations to implement section \n     4. Section 304 of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995 (``CAA''), Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, prescribes the \n     procedure applicable to the issuance of substantive \n     regulations by the Board. Upon initial review, the Board has \n     concerns that a plain reading of VEO may yield regulations \n     that are the same as the regulations of the executive branch \n     yet provide veterans' preference rights and protections to no \n     currently ``covered employee'' of the legislative branch. If \n     that is the case, questions arise over the nature and scope \n     of the Board's authority to modify the regulations in order \n     to achieve a more effective implementation of veterans' \n     preference rights and protections to ``covered employees.''\n       The Board issues this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPR'') to solicit comments from interested individuals \n     and groups in order to encourage and obtain participation and \n     information in the development of regulations.\n       Dates: Interested parties may submit comments within 30 \n     days after the date of publication of this Advance Notice in \n     the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, DC 20540-1999.

In addition, and most \n     relevant to this ANPR, VEO affords to ``covered employees'' \n     of the legislative branch (as defined by section 101 of the \n     CAA (2 USC Sec. 1301)) the rights and protections of selected \n     provisions of veterans' preference law. VEO Sec. 4(c)(2). The \n     selected statutory sections made applicable to such \n     legislative branch employees by VEO may be summarized as \n     follows.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A definitional section prescribes the categories of \n     military veterans who are entitled to preference \n     (``preference eligible''). 5 USC Sec. 2108. Generally, a \n     veteran must be disabled or have served on active duty in the \n     Armed Forces during certain specified time periods or in \n     specified military campaigns to be entitled to preference. In \n     addition, certain family members (mainly spouses, widow[er]s, \n     and mothers) of preference eligible veterans are entitled to \n     the same rights and protections.\n       In the appointment process, a preference eligible \n     individual who is tested or otherwise numerically evaluated \n     for a position in the competitive service is entitled to have \n     either 5 or 10 points added to his/her score, depending on \n     his or her military service, or disabling condition. 5 USC \n     Sec. 3309. Where experience is a qualifying element for the \n     job, a preference eligible individual is entitled to credit \n     for having relevant experience in the military or in various \n     civic activities. 5 USC Sec. 3311. Where physical \n     requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element, \n     preference eligible individuals (including those who are \n     disabled) may obtain a waiver of such requirements in certain \n     circumstances. 5 USC Sec. 3312. For certain positions in the \n     competitive service (guards, elevator operators, \n     messengers, custodians), only preference eligible \n     individuals can be considered for hiring, unless no one \n     else is available. 5 USC Sec. 3310.\n       Finally, in prescribing retention rights during RIFs, the \n     sections in subchapter I of chapter 35 of Title 5, USC, with \n     a slightly modified definition of ``preference eligible,'' \n     require that employing agencies give ``due effect'' to the \n     following factors: (a) employment tenure (i.e., type of \n     appointment); (b) veterans' preference; (c) length of \n     service; and, (d) performance ratings. 5 USC Sec. Sec. 3501, \n     3502. Such considerations also apply where RIFs occur in \n     connection with a transfer of agency functions from one \n     agency to another. 5 USC Sec. 3503. In addition, where \n     physical requirements (age, height, weight) are a qualifying \n     element for retention, preference eligible individuals \n     (including those who are disabled) may obtain a waiver of \n     such requirements in certain circumstances. 5 USC Sec. 3504.\n       Section 4(c)(4)(A) of the VEO authorizes the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance established under the \n     CAA to issue regulations to implement section 4(c) of the VEO \n     pursuant to the rulemaking procedures of section 304 of the \n     CAA, 2 USC Sec. 1384. Pursuant to that authority, the Board \n     invites comments before promulgating proposed rules under \n     section 4 of the VEO.\n       Section 4(c)(4)(B) of the VEO specifies that these \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     (applicable with respect to the executive branch) promulgated \n     to implement . . . [the referenced statutory provisions] . . \n     . except to the extent that the Board may determine, for good \n     cause shown and stated together with the regulation, that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Section 4(c)(4)(C) further states that the \n     ``regulations issued under subparagraph (A) shall be \n     consistent with section 225 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act of 1995 (2 USC Sec. 1361).''\n\n\n                         Interpretative Issues\n\n       The Board has identified and reviewed the regulations \n     issued by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to \n     implement the relevant provisions of the veterans' preference \n     laws. These regulations are integrated into the body of \n     personnel regulations in Title 5 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations (CFR) issued by OPM under its authority to \n     oversee and regulate civilian employment in the executive \n     branch. See 5 USC Sec. Sec. 1103, 1104, 1301, 1302. The \n     Board's review has raised a number of interpretative issues \n     concerning the identity of legislative branch employees \n     affected by the statute and regulations; potential legal and \n     factual bases, if any, for modification of the regulations; \n     and the scope of the Board's statutory authority to \n     promulgate certain of the regulations in place in the \n     executive branch. Before discussing those issues, the Board \n     summarizes below the pertinent executive branch regulations \n     which implement the statutory sections of veterans' \n     preference law made applicable to covered legislative branch \n     employees by VEO.\n       5 CFR Part 211 implements the definitional section, 5 USC \n     Sec. 2108, declaring the requirements that a military veteran \n     or his family member must meet to be considered ``preference \n     eligible.''\n       5 CFR Sec. 332.401 and Sec. 337.101 implement 5 USC \n     Sec. 3309 which, in the appointment process, requires that a \n     preference eligible individual who is tested or otherwise \n     numerically evaluated for a position in the competitive \n     service is entitled to have either 5 or 10 points added to \n     his/her score.\n       5 CFR Sec. 337.101 also implements 5 USC Sec. 3311, which \n     provides that, where experience is a qualifying element for \n     the job, a preference eligible individual is entitled to \n     credit for having relevant experience in the military or in \n     various civic activities.\n       Subpart D of Part 330, 5 CFR, implements 5 USC Sec. 3310, \n     which restricts to preference eligible individuals the \n     positions of guards, elevator operators, messengers, and \n     custodians in the competitive service.\n       5 CFR Sec. 339.204 and Sec. 339.306 implement 5 USC \n     Sec. 3312, which provides that, where physical requirements \n     (age, height, weight) are a qualifying element for an \n     examination or appointment in the competitive service, \n     preference eligible individuals (including those who are \n     disabled) may obtain a waiver of such requirements in certain \n     circumstances.\n       Finally, Part 351 of 5 CFR implements those provisions of \n     subchapter I of chapter 35 of 5 USC, which prescribe \n     retention rights during RIFs, including those instances where \n     an agency function is transferred to another agency.\n       First. The statutory rights and protections that are \n     applicable under VEO envision that veterans' preference is to \n     be accorded in appointments to the ``competitive service.'' \n     This presents an interpretative issue for the Board in \n     proposing regulations that ``are the same'' as those in the \n     executive branch because there is a substantial question \n     whether any covered employee, as defined by VEO Sec. 4(c)(1), \n     encumbers a position in the ``competitive service.'' The \n     ``competitive service,'' as the term is used in the relevant \n     statutes, is not a generic term descriptive of any personnel \n     system in which applicants vie for appointment. Rather, the \n     competitive service is an integral, specifically defined \n     component of the federal civil service system, in which, for \n     over a century, appointment to employment (mainly in the \n     executive\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\n     branch) has been determined through competitive examinations.\n       In the competitive service, Congress has prescribed that \n     the ``selection and advancement shall be determined solely on \n     the basis of relative ability, knowledge, and skills, after \n     fair and open competition.'' 5 USC Sec. 2301(b)(1). Toward \n     this end, Congress gave the President the authority to \n     prescribe rules ``which shall provide, as nearly as \n     conditions of good administration warrant, for . . . open, \n     competitive examinations for testing applicants for \n     appointment in the competitive service . . . .'' 5 USC \n     Sec. 3304(a)(1) (emphasis supplied). In addition, OPM has \n     been granted authority, ``subject to rules prescribed by the \n     President under this title for the administration of the \n     competitive service, [to] prescribe rules for, control, \n     supervise, and preserve the records of, examinations for the \n     competitive service.'' 5 USC Sec. 1302(a).\n       In this setting, the ``competitive service'' has a specific \n     meaning. Congress has enacted a three-fold definition: First, \n     the competitive service consists of ``all civil service \n     positions in the executive branch,'' with exceptions for (a) \n     positions specifically excepted from the competitive service \n     by statute (known as the excepted service \\4\\); (b) positions \n     requiring Senate confirmation, and (c) positions in the \n     Senior Executive Service.\\5\\ 5 USC Sec. 2102(a)(1) (A)-(C) \n     (emphasis added). Second, the competitive service includes \n     ``civil positions not in the executive branch which are \n     specifically included in the competitive service by \n     statute.'' 5 USC Sec. 2102(a)(2). Third, the competitive \n     service encompasses those ``positions in the government of \n     the District of Columbia which are specifically included \n     in the competitive service by statute.'' 5 USC \n     Sec. 2102(a)(3).\n       Arguably, the Board should take these statutory definitions \n     into account in promulgating regulations. Under VEO, the \n     regulations issued by the Board must be consistent with \n     section 225 of the CAA (2 USC Sec. 1361), which in part \n     requires as a rule of construction that, except where \n     inconsistent with definitions and exemptions provided in the \n     CAA, the definitions and exemptions in the laws made \n     applicable by the CAA shall also apply. Applying this rule of \n     construction to the foregoing definitions arguably yields the \n     following conclusions. The first definition may not be \n     relevant because legislative branch employees are not part of \n     the executive branch. Similarly, the third definition may not \n     be relevant because it pertains to employees of the \n     government of the District of Columbia. In contrast, the \n     second definition is arguably relevant because it includes \n     ``civil positions not in the executive branch,'' within which \n     category falls the legislative branch (and the judicial \n     branch). However, upon an initial review of those legislative \n     offices in which ``covered employees'' as defined by VEO can \n     be employed,6 it may be that no ``covered \n     employee'' in the legislative branch satisfies the \n     qualification in the second definition that the job position \n     be ``specifically included in the competitive service by \n     statute.'' Accordingly, insofar as the statute authorizes the \n     Board to propose substantive regulations that are the same as \n     the regulations of the executive branch, the Board could end \n     up proposing regulations that apply to no one.\n       On the other hand, VEO mirrors the rulemaking provisions of \n     the CAA in directing the Board upon good cause shown to \n     modify executive branch regulations if it would be more \n     ``effective for the implementation of rights and \n     protections'' made applicable to covered \n     employees.7 Under this approach, the statute may \n     authorize proposing modifications of the executive branch \n     regulations to take account of the void in competitive \n     service positions for covered employees. In other words, if \n     the regulations are essentially ineffective because in \n     practice they afford rights and protections to no one, should \n     the Board authorize modifications that make them effective by \n     applying the rights and protections of veterans' preference \n     laws to some arguably analogous employees? If so, as a \n     factual and legal matter, what modifications to the \n     regulations does the statute authorize?\n       Second. While the applicable statutory appointment \n     provisions (5 USC Sec. Sec. 3309-3312) are directed with \n     particularity to the competitive service, the applicable \n     statutory retention provisions (5 USC chapter 35, subchapter \n     I) with one exception are not. Section 3501(b) states that \n     subchapter I ``applies to each employee in or under an \n     Executive agency,'' without singling out the competitive \n     service for specific coverage. Only Sec. 3504, which provides \n     for waiver of physical requirements (including age, height, \n     weight) for job retention purposes, is directed specifically \n     to competitive service positions. Nonetheless, OPM has \n     written major portions of the implementing regulations (found \n     principally in 5 CFR Part 351) in terms of the competitive \n     service and the excepted service. See, e.g., 5 CFR \n     Sec. 351.501 (order of retention for competitive service), \n     Sec. 351.502 (order of retention for excepted service). Were \n     the Board simply to propose regulations that are the same as \n     the executive branch's without modifications, there may not \n     be any covered employees in the legislative branch who are in \n     the competitive service or the excepted service, as defined \n     by statute and regulation. Therefore, once again the issue of \n     whether the statute authorizes a modification of these \n     regulations arises.\n       Third. A survey of the regulations indicates that some of \n     the rules promulgated by OPM8 derive not from the \n     statutory sections concerning veteran's preference that have \n     been made applicable to the legislative branch through VEO \n     but from OPM's overarching statutory authority to regulate \n     and supervise civilian employment policies and practices in \n     the executive branch pursuant to 5 USC Sec. Sec. 1302-04. \n     This latter supervisory authority arguably has not been \n     bestowed upon the Board with respect to personnel management \n     in the legislative branch. Therefore, a question is presented \n     whether the Board's authority over veterans' preference is \n     coextensive with OPM's authority to regulate personnel \n     management in the executive branch. The Board must identify \n     what parts of the veterans' preference regulations are an \n     exercise of OPM's supervisory authority that arguably has not \n     been bestowed upon the Board with respect to personnel \n     management in the legislative branch, or determine that the \n     statute authorizes the Board to exercise authority co-\n     extensive with OPM's authority to promulgate regulations \n     governing the statutory sections made applicable through VEO.\n       Fourth. There is some indication that the Senate Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs was aware of the problem of applying the \n     rights and protections of veterans' preference, including the \n     regulations, to the legislative branch. The Senate Committee \n     Report that accompanied the VEO bill included the following \n     comment: ``The Committee notes that the requirement that \n     veterans' preference principles be extended to the \n     legislative and judicial branches does not mandate the \n     creation of civil service-type evaluation or scoring systems \n     by these hiring entities. It does require, however, that they \n     create systems that are consistent with the underlying \n     principles of veterans' preference laws.'' 9 But \n     in enacting the legislation Congress took no further steps to \n     codify this precatory statement nor did it (or the Committee) \n     provide any explanation of the intent of this highly general \n     comment.10 Therefore, the question is presented \n     whether the statute requires the creation of ``systems that \n     are consistent with the underlying principles of veterans' \n     preference laws''? If so, how is this to be effectuated? If \n     not, what effect if any does this Committee comment have?\n       Fifth. By virtue of the selectivity with which Congress \n     made veterans' preference laws applicable, there are \n     regulations relating to veterans' preferences in Title 5 CFR \n     that are not being considered because they are linked to \n     statutory provisions not made applicable by VEO. Examples \n     include regulations in Part 302 pertaining to the excepted \n     service,11 which were promulgated to implement 5 \n     USC Sec. 3320; those regulations in Part 332 that implement 5 \n     USC Sec. 3314 and Sec. 3315, which afford rights to \n     preference eligible individuals who either have resigned or \n     have been separated or furloughed without delinquency or \n     misconduct; and those regulations in Subpart D of Part 315 \n     that implement 5 USC Sec. 3316, which addresses the \n     reinstatement rights of preference eligible individuals. The \n     task of promulgating regulations that are the ``same'' as \n     those of the executive branch will entail in part identifying \n     and excluding those whose statutory underpinning has not been \n     made applicable by VEO to the legislative branch.\n\n\n                          request for comment\n\n       In order to promulgate regulations that properly fulfill \n     the directions and intent of these statutory provisions, \n     especially in light of the foregoing analysis, the Board \n     needs comprehensive information and comment on a variety of \n     topics. The Board has determined that, before publishing \n     proposed regulations for notice and comment, it will provide \n     all interested parties and persons with this opportunity to \n     submit comments, with supporting data, authorities and \n     argument, as to the content of and bases for any proposed \n     regulations. The Board wishes to emphasize, as it did in the \n     development of the regulations issued to implement sections \n     202, 203, 204, 205, and 220 of the CAA, that commentors who \n     propose a modification of the regulations promulgated by OPM \n     for the executive branch, based upon an assertion of ``good \n     cause,'' should provide specific and detailed information and \n     the rationale necessary to meet the statutory requirements \n     for good cause to depart from the executive branch's \n     regulations. It is not enough for commentors simply to \n     propose a revision to the executive branch's regulations or \n     to request guidance on an issue; rather, if commentors desire \n     a change in the executive branch's regulations, they must \n     explain the legal and factual basis for the suggested change. \n     The Board must have these explanations and information if it \n     is to be able to evaluate proposed regulations and make \n     proposed regulatory changes. Failure to provide such \n     information and authorities will greatly impede, if not \n     prevent, adoption of proposals suggested by commentors.\n       So that it may make more fully informed decisions regarding \n     the promulgation and issuance of regulations, in addition to \n     inviting and encouraging comments on all relevant matters, \n     the Board specifically requests comments on the following \n     issues:\n       (1) What positions, if any, of the legislative branch \n     encumbered by ``covered employees'' (as defined by \n     Sec. 4(c)(1) of VEO) fall within the meaning of the \n     ``competitive service'' as the latter term is used in 5 USC \n     Sec. Sec. 3309-3312?\n       (2) In the absence of any such ``competitive service'' \n     positions in the legislative branch, what, if any, positions \n     held by ``covered employees'' are subject to a merit-based \n     system of appointment (which may include examinations, \n     testing, evaluation, scoring and such\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\n     other elements that are common to the ``competitive service'' \n     of the executive branch)?\n       (3) Does VEO authorize the Board to extend the rights and \n     protections of veterans' preference for purposes of \n     appointment to those positions identified in (2) above \n     notwithstanding they are not technically ``competitive \n     service'' positions?\n       (4) In order to provide for effective implementation of \n     veterans' preference rights, could the Board, under the \n     ``good cause'' provision of Sec. 4(c)(4)(B) of VEO, modify \n     the most relevant substantive regulations of the executive \n     branch pertaining to veterans' preference in the appointment \n     of ``covered employees'' so as to make them applicable to the \n     legislative branch without reference to the ``competitive \n     service''?\n       (5) How would the rights and protections of subchapter I of \n     chapter 35, Title 5 USC (pertaining to retention during \n     RIFs), be applied to ``covered employees'' (as defined by \n     Sec. 4(c)(1) of VEO)?\n       (6) Does VEO authorize the Board to extend the rights and \n     protections of veterans' preference for purposes of retention \n     during reductions in force to ``covered employees'' holding \n     positions that are not technically within the ``competitive \n     service'' or the ``excepted service''?\n       (7) In order to provide for effective implementation of \n     veterans' preference rights, could the Board, under the \n     ``good cause'' provision of Sec. 4(c)(4)(B) of VEO, modify \n     the most relevant substantive regulations of the executive \n     branch pertaining to veterans' preference in the retention of \n     ``covered employees'' during reductions in force so as to \n     make them applicable to the legislative branch without \n     reference to the ``competitive service'' or the ``excepted \n     service''?\n       (8) In view of the fact that VEO does not explicitly grant \n     the Board the authority exercised by OPM under 5 USC \n     Sec. 1103, Sec. 1104, Sec. 1301 and Sec. 1302 to execute, \n     administer, and enforce the federal civil service system, \n     does the Board have the authority to propose regulations that \n     would vest the Board with responsibilities similar to OPM's \n     over employment practices involving covered employees in the \n     legislative branch?\n       (9) Is the Board empowered by the statute to give effect to \n     the comment in the legislative history that employing offices \n     of the legislative branch should ``create systems that are \n     consistent with the underlying principles of veterans' \n     preference laws,'' as discussed by the Senate Report \n     accompanying the bill enacted as VEO (Sen. Rept. 105-340, \n     105th Cong., 2d Sess., at 17 (Sept. 21, 1998)? If so, how \n     should such effect be given?\n       (10) Under VEO, what steps, if any, must employing offices \n     of the legislative branch take to ``create systems that are \n     consistent with the underlying principles of veterans' \n     preference laws,'' as discussed by the Senate Report \n     accompanying the bill enacted as VEO (Sen. Rept. 105-340 \n     (105th Cong., 2d Sess. Sept. 21, 1998), at 17)?\n       (11) With respect to positions restricted to preference \n     eligible individuals under 5 USC Sec. 3310, namely guards, \n     elevator operators, messengers, and custodians, the Board \n     seeks information and comment on the following issues and \n     questions:\n       (a) The identity, in the legislative branch, of guard, \n     elevator operator, messenger, and custodian positions within \n     the meaning of these terms under 5 USC Sec. 3310.\n       (b) The identity of covered employing offices responsible \n     for personnel decisions affecting employees who fill \n     positions of guard, elevator operator, messenger, and \n     custodian within the meaning of 5 USC Sec. 3310 and the \n     implementing regulations.\n       (c) Would police officers and other employees of the United \n     State Capitol Police be considered ``guards'' under the \n     application of the rights and protections of this section to \n     covered employees under VEO?\n       (d) Whether the current methods of hiring include an \n     entrance examination within the meaning of 5 CFR Sec. 330.401 \n     and, if not, whether the affected employing offices believe \n     that the statute mandates the creation of such an examination \n     and/or allows such an examination to be required of the \n     employing offices?\n       (e) What changes, if any, in the regulations are required \n     to effectuate the rights and protections of 5 USC Sec. 3310 \n     as applied by VEO?\n       (12) Which executive branch regulations, if any, should not \n     be adopted because they are promulgated to implement \n     inapplicable statutory provisions of veterans' preference law \n     or are otherwise inapplicable to the legislative branch?\n       (13) What modification, if any, of the executive branch \n     regulations would make them more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections made applicable \n     under VEO as provided by VEO Sec. 4(c)(4)(B)?\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 16th day of February, \n     2000.\n\n                                                Glen D.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for payment of claims by health care providers against \ninsolvent Medicare+Choice Organizations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       bankruptcy of premier HMO\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of the \nSenate a serious problem facing many thousands of Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Arizona. On November 16, 1999, Premier Health Care of \nArizona went into receivership. The health care of more than 20,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries who were enrolled in Premier has been affected \nby this solvency.\n  Since Premier Medicare HMO was placed in receivership, I have been \nadvised that some non-contract providers--providers outside of the HMO \nnetwork--have asserted that Medicare beneficiaries are personally \nliable for unpaid claims and have referred the outstanding claims to \ncollection agencies.\n  These unpaid claims--some of which may date back more than six months \nand amount to significant sums of money--have made it difficult for \nmany contract and non-contract providers to continue to provide care to \nMedicare beneficiaries. Because Premier operated in a largely rural \narea where few alternative providers were accessible, this has created \na dire health-care delivery situation for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that addresses the \nArizona situation, as well as future\n\n[[Page S868]]\n\nMedicare+Choice insolvencies, wherever they may occur. This legislation \nmandates that, after a Medicare+Choice goes into receivership, the \nreceiver--in this case, the state insurance commissioner--may apply to \nthe Secretary of HHS for payment of all valid, unpaid provider claims \nfor items or services furnished to Medicare enrollees before the date \nthe receiver was appointed.\n  Contract providers will be paid at their contract rate, while non-\ncontract providers will be paid for the ``reasonable cost'' of the \ncovered item or service. Amounts needed to make these payments will be \npaid out of the Part A or Part B trust fund, as is appropriate based on \nwhich fund would have paid the claim on a fee-for-services basis.\n  To recover these amounts paid to providers, the bill establishes that \nHCFA will become a creditor of the receivership estate and assumes the \npriority position of the respective providers it has paid.\n  The bill also mandates that Medicare+Choice enrollees may not be held \nliable to contract or non-contract providers for any claims that are \nunpaid by the Medicare+Choice organization.\n  While the regulation of state-licensed Medicare+Choice organizations \nis primarily a state responsibility, the Medicare law makes clear that \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and the administrator of \nHCFA have an ongoing ``responsibility to ensure that it (HCFA) \ncontracts only with fiscally-sound Medicare+Choice organizations.''\n  To this end, Section 1857(d) gives the Secretary the right to audit \nand inspect any books and records that pertain either to the ability of \nthe Medicare HMO to bear the risk of potential financial loss, or to \nthe quality and timeliness of services provided for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. See 42 CFR 422.502, 516 and 552.\n  My bill strengthens current law and regulation by requiring that, \nonce HCFA determines that a Medicare+Choice organization may not be \nable to bear the risk of financial losses, the Secretary must promptly \nnotify the appropriate state officials and provide those officials with \nthe information on which that determination is based.\n  The bill also strengthens current law by requiring that, when \nMedicare+Choice organizations fail to provide prompt payments to \nproviders, the Secretary must pay providers directly. Under my bill, if \nthe Medicare+Choice plan fails to provide prompt payment of 10 percent \nof claims submitted for services and supplies furnished to enrollees \nwithin 60 days of the date on which the claim was submitted, the \nSecretary must pay contract and non-contract providers directly--there \nis no discretion as there is in current law.\n  To avoid a repeat of this problem with other carriers in the future, \nthe bill requires that Medicare+Choice organizations post a surety bond \nof no less than $500,000, as well as meet any additional requirements \nrelated to bonding or escrow accounts that the Secretary deems \nnecessary. The bond requirement may be waived if a comparable surety \nbond is required under state law.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will enable the government to fulfill \nits promise to those seniors who have chosen to receive their Medicare \ncoverage through a Medicare+Choice organization. It will prevent \nseniors from being billed for covered services and providers from \nlosing large sums in unpaid bills.\n  If providers aren't paid, many may be unwilling--or unable--to \ncontinue providing care. If quality care is not available through \nexperienced providers, or if seniors are the subject of legal action \nfor the bills of insolvent Medicare+Choice organizations, beneficiaries \nwill lose confidence in the Medicare+Choice programs, and ultimately, \nin Medicare fee-for-service as well. We simply can't let that happen.\n  The Congress must ensure that providers are paid and Medicare \nbeneficiaries are protected. This is a commitment we have made to \nseniors--it is a commitment we must fulfill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2111. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey for \nfair market value 1.06 acres of land in the San Bernardino National \nForest, California to KATY 101.3 FM, a California corporation; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                        LAND CONVEYANCE TO KATY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to assist Katy Gill, the owner of KATY radio, a station \nbroadcasting out of a one acre parcel of the San Bernardino Forest and \nacting as an important public service announcement source for the \nresidents of Idylwood, California.\n  KATY radio has been caught up in some unfortunate circumstances \ninvolving an antennae site that the station had at one time, been \nleasing from GTE. When GTE decided to move out of the area, KATY was no \nlonger able to legally operate. This bill will allow KATY to purchase \nat fair market value the title to 1.06 acres of land in San Bernardino \nNational Forest so that the station could continue broadcasting.\n  This legislation is supported by the Forest Service and KATY radio \nstation listeners throughout Idylwood, California. I know of no \nopposition to such legislation. Representatives Mary Bono, Jerry Lewis \nand Don Young have introduced similar legislation in the House. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the House and the relevant \nSenate committee members to ensure that we address this issue before \nthe end of the 106th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Kerry, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2112. A bill to provide housing assistance to domestic violence \nvictims; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing Act\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Landrieu, Senator Murray, and Senator Kerry \nto introduce ``The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's \nHousing Act of 2000.'' This legislation provides funding for shelter \nassistance to women and children fleeing domestic violence, stalking, \nand sexual assault. Due to the fact that domestic violence victims \noften have no safe place to go and financial obstacles make it \ndifficult to rebuild lives, this funding is needed to help support a \ncontinuum between emergency shelter and independent living.\n  In my home state of New Jersey, one act of domestic violence occurs \napproximately every six minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Nationally, \nit is estimated that a woman is beaten every fifteen seconds. Yet, many \nindividuals and families fleeing domestic violence are forced to return \nto their abusers because of inadequate shelter or lack of money. Half \nof all homeless women and children are fleeing domestic violence. Even \nif they leave their abusers to go to a shelter, they often return home \nbecause the isolation from familiar surroundings, friends, and \nneighborhood resources makes them feel even more vulnerable. Shelters \nand transitional facilities are often located far from a victim's \nneighborhood. And, if emergency shelter is available, a supply of \naffordable housing and services are needed to keep women from having to \nreturn to a violent home.\n  The issue of homelessness for battered women goes beyond the ability \nto find a space in a domestic violence shelter. Because women escaping \nabusers often leave suddenly, they often have no money saved for a \nsecurity deposit and first month's rent. This is especially problematic \nin New Jersey as rents are so expensive. New Jersey is the second most \nexpensive state in the nation to rent a two-bedroom apartment and 45 \npercent of all New Jersey renters cannot afford the State's average \nrent for a two-bedroom apartment. And, many battered women may have to \nleave their jobs because of workplace stalking by their abusers. Women \nwho leave violent situations often incur additional expenses as they \nmust purchase clothing, cookware, and furniture. The lack of financial \nsecurity hinders their ability to secure safe, decent, and affordable \nhousing for themselves and their families.\n  This is why Senator's Jeffords, Landrieu, Murray, Kerry and I are \nintroducing ``The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing \nAct of 2000.'' Under current law, domestic violence shelters must apply \nfor federal homeless assistance along with\n\n[[Page S869]]\n\nother organizations assisting the general homeless population. This \nlegislation creates a specific grant targeted towards shelters \nproviding assistance to individuals and families fleeing domestic \nviolence, stalking, and sexual assault only. Funding is authorized \nthrough the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act for five years \nbeginning at $50 million for fiscal year 2001. Non-profit, community-\nbased housing organizations receive the funds through a competitive \ngrant process administered by the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Groups would use the grant to provide emergency and \ntransitional housing or direct financial assistance for rent, security \ndeposit, and first month's rent. In addition, the legislation also \nrequires organizations to provide a 25% match in funds for services \nsuch as child care, employment assistance, and healthcare. This \nassistance helps provide a stable home base so that those fleeing \ndomestic violence learn new job skills, work full-time jobs, or search \nfor adequate child care.\n\n  The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing Act of 2000 \nis supported by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and \nthe NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Senators Jeffords, Landrieu, \nMurray, Kerry and I look forward to working with them and all others \ninterested in helping us address the continuing national epidemic of \ndomestic violence. I urge my colleagues to join us in our efforts to \nprevent victims of domestic violence from having to choose between \nviolence and homelessness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic Violence and Sexual \n     Assault Victims' Housing Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Housing can prevent domestic violence and mitigate its \n     effects. The connection between domestic violence and housing \n     is overwhelming. Of all homeless women and children, 50 \n     percent are fleeing domestic violence.\n       (2) Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified domestic \n     violence as a primary cause of homelessness.\n       (3) Women's poverty levels aggravate the problems of \n     homelessness and domestic violence. Two out of three poor \n     adults are women. Female-headed households are six times \n     poorer than male-headed households. In 1996, of the 7,700,000 \n     poor families in the country, 4,100,000 of them were single \n     female-headed households. In addition, 5,100,000 poor women \n     who are not in families are poor.\n       (4) Almost 50 percent of the women who receive Temporary \n     Assistance to Needy Families funds cite domestic violence as \n     a factor in the need for assistance.\n       (5) Many women who flee violence are forced to return to \n     their abusers because of inadequate shelter or lack of money. \n     Even if they leave their abusers to go to a shelter, they \n     often return home because the isolation from familiar \n     surroundings, friends, and neighborhood resources makes them \n     feel even more vulnerable. Shelters and transitional housing \n     facilities are often located far from a domestic violence \n     victim's neighborhood. While this placement may be deliberate \n     to protect domestic violence victims from their abusers, it \n     can also be intimidating and alienating for a woman to leave \n     her home, community, cultural support system, and all that \n     she knows for shelter way across town. Thus, women of color \n     and immigrant women are less likely to become shelter \n     residents.\n       (6) Women who do leave their abusers lack adequate \n     emergency shelter options. The overall number of emergency \n     shelter beds for homeless people is estimated to have \n     decreased by an average of 3 percent in 1997 while requests \n     for shelter increased on the average by 3 percent. Emergency \n     shelters struggle to meet the increased need for services \n     with about 32 percent of the requests for shelter by homeless \n     families going unmet. In fact 88 percent of cities reported \n     having to turn away homeless families from emergency shelters \n     due to inadequate resources for services.\n       (7) Battered women and their children comprise an \n     increasing proportion of the emergency shelter population. \n     Many emergency shelters have strict time limits that require \n     women to find alternative housing immediately forcing them to \n     separate from their children.\n       (8) A stable, sustainable home base is crucial for women \n     who have left situations of domestic violence and are \n     learning new job skills, participating in educational \n     programs, working full-time jobs, or searching for adequate \n     child care in order to gain self-sufficiency. Transitional \n     housing resources and services provide a continuum between \n     emergency shelter provision and independent living.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       For purposes of section 4, the authorization of \n     appropriations under section 429(a) of the Stewart B. \n     McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11389(a)) shall \n     be increased by $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 and by such \n     sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2002 through 2005.\n\n     SEC. 4.

McKinney Homeless Assistance \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 11381-11389). Funds made available by the \n     Secretary through reallotment under the preceding sentence \n     shall remain available for expenditure until the end of the \n     fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such funds \n     become available for reallotment.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Res. 263\n\n       Whereas the United States currently imports roughly 55 \n     percent of its crude oil;\n       Whereas ensuring access to and stable prices for imported \n     crude oil for the United States and major allies and trading \n     partners of the United States is a continuing critical \n     objective of United States foreign and economic policy for \n     the foreseeable future;\n       Whereas the 11 countries that make up the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries (``OPEC'') produce 40 percent \n     of the world's crude oil and control 77 percent of proven \n     reserves, including much of the spare production capacity;\n       Whereas beginning in March 1998, OPEC instituted 3 tiers of \n     production cuts, which reduced production by 4,300,000 \n     barrels per day and have resulted in dramatic increases in \n     crude oil prices;\n       Whereas in August 1999, crude oil prices had reached $21 \n     per barrel and continued rising, exceeding $25 per barrel by \n     the end of 1999 and $27 per barrel during the first week of \n     February 2000;\n       Whereas crude oil prices in the United States rose $14 per \n     barrel during 1999, the equivalent of 33 cents per gallon;\n       Whereas the increase has translated into higher prices for \n     gasoline and other refined petroleum products; in the case of \n     gasoline, the increases in crude oil prices have resulted in \n     a penny-for-penny passthrough of increases at the pump;\n       Whereas increases in the price of crude oil result in \n     increases in prices paid by United States consumers for \n     refined petroleum\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\n     products, including home heating oil, gasoline, and diesel \n     fuel;\n       Whereas increases in the costs of refined petroleum \n     products have a negative effect on many Americans, including \n     the elderly and individuals of low income (whose home heating \n     oil costs have doubled in the last year), families who must \n     pay higher prices at the gas station, farmers (already hurt \n     by low commodity prices, trying to factor increased costs \n     into their budgets in preparation for the growing season), \n     truckers (who face an almost 10-year high in diesel fuel \n     prices), and manufacturers and retailers (who must factor in \n     increased production and transportation costs into the final \n     price of their goods): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should immediately communicate to the \n     members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (``OPEC'') cartel and non-OPEC countries that participate in \n     the cartel of crude oil producing countries that--\n       (A) the United States seeks to maintain strong relations \n     with crude oil producers around the world while promoting \n     international efforts to remove barriers to energy trade and \n     investment and increased access for United States energy \n     firms around the world;\n       (B) the United States believes that restricting supply in a \n     market that is in demand of additional crude oil does serious \n     damage to the efforts that OPEC members have made to \n     demonstrate that they represent a reliable source of crude \n     oil supply;\n       (C) the United States believes that stable crude oil prices \n     and supplies are essential for strong economic growth \n     throughout the world; and\n       (D) the United States seeks an immediate lifting of the \n     OPEC crude oil production quotas;\n       (2) the President should review administrative policies \n     that may put an undue burden on domestic crude oil producers, \n     and should consider lifting unnecessary regulations that \n     interfere with the ability of United States energy industries \n     to supply a greater percentage of the energy needs of the \n     United States; and\n       (3) the Senate, when it considers the fiscal year 2001 \n     Federal budget, should appropriate sufficient funds for the \n     development of alternative energy resources, including \n     measures to increase the use of biofuels and other renewable \n     resources, to reduce the dependence of the United States on \n     foreign energy sources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S872-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S872-S883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 2823\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table)\n  Mr. HATCH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1134) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-free expenditures from education individual retirement accounts for \nelementary and secondary school expenses, to increase the maximum \nannual amount amount of contributions to such accounts;

EXPANSION OF INCENTIVES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Record numbers of students are enrolled in our Nation's \n     elementary and secondary schools and that record is expected \n     to be broken every year through 2007. The record numbers are \n     straining many school facilities. Addressing that growth will \n     require an increasing commitment of resources to build and \n     modernize schools, and to hire and train new teachers. In \n     addition, the increasing use of technology in the workplace \n     is creating new demands to incorporate computers and other \n     high-technology equipment into the classroom and into \n     curricula.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office (in this section referred \n     to as the ``GAO'') has performed a comprehensive survey of \n     the Nation's public elementary and secondary school \n     facilities and has found severe levels of disrepair in all \n     areas of the United States. The GAO report concluded that \n     more than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of \n     extensive repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend \n     schools with life safety code violations, and 12,000,000 \n     children attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in test scores when students were moved \n     from a poor facility to a new facility.\n       (5) Furthermore, a recent study by the Environmental \n     Working Group concluded that portable trailers, utilized by \n     many school districts to accommodate school over-crowding, \n     can ``expose children to toxic chemicals at levels that pose \n     an unacceptable risk of cancer or other serious illnesses.'' \n     Because ventilation in portable trailers is poor, the \n     pollution through the build-up of toxins can be significant. \n     This is particularly hazardous to those children who have \n     asthma. The prevalence of asthma in children increased by 160 \n     percent between 1980 and 1994. The report also stated, \n     ``Schools are facing two epidemics: an epidemic of \n     deteriorating facilities and an epidemic of asthma among \n     children.''\n       (6) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems.\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\n       (7) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 2,400 schools.\n       (8) The General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (9) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (in this \n     section referred to as the ``BIA'') for Native American \n     children are also in dire need of repair and renovation. The \n     General Accounting Office has reported that the cost of total \n     inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities is $754,000,000. \n     The December 1997 report by the Comptroller General of the \n     United States states that, ``Compared with other schools \n     nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer physical \n     condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental factors, \n     more often lack key facilities requirements for education \n     reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.''\n       (10) Across the Nation, schools will need to recruit and \n     hire an additional 2,000,000 teachers during the period from \n     1998 through 2008. More than 200,000 teachers will be needed \n     annually, yet current teacher development programs produce \n     only 100,000 to 150,000 teachers per year. This level of \n     recruitment is simply the level needed to maintain existing \n     student-teacher ratios.\n       (11) The rapid growth in the student population, in \n     addition to the imminent shortage of qualified teachers and \n     recent efforts by Congress to help States reduce class size, \n     present urgent infrastructure needs across the Nation.\n       (12) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (13) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (14) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Public School Modernization.--Chapter 1 is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subchapter:\n\n         ``Subchapter X--Public School Modernization Provisions\n\n``Part I. Credit to holders of qualified public school modernization \n              bonds.\n``Part II. Qualified school construction bonds.\n``Part III.

PUBLIC SCHOOL REPAIR AND RENOVATION.\n\n       Title XII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 8501 et seq.) is amended to read as follows:\n\n            ``TITLE XII--PUBLIC SCHOOL REPAIR AND RENOVATION\n\n     ``SEC. 12001. FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) The General Accounting Office estimated in 1995 that \n     it would cost $112,000,000,000 to bring our Nation's school \n     facilities into good overall condition.\n       ``(2) The General Accounting Office also found in 1995 that \n     60 percent of the Nation's schools, serving 28,000,000 \n     students, reported that 1 or more building features, such as \n     roofs and plumbing, needed to be extensively repaired, \n     overhauled, or replaced.\n       ``(3) The National Center for Education Statistics reported \n     that the average age for a school building in 1998 was 42 \n     years and that local educational agencies with relatively \n     high rates of poverty tend to have relatively old buildings.\n       ``(4) School condition is positively correlated with \n     student achievement, according to a number of research \n     studies.\n       ``(5) The results of a recent survey indicate that the \n     condition of schools with large proportions of students \n     living on Indian lands is particularly poor.\n       ``(6) While school repair and renovation are primarily a \n     State and local concern, some States and communities are not, \n     on their own, able to meet the burden of providing adequate \n     school facilities for all students, and the poorest \n     communities have had the greatest difficulty meeting this \n     need.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by--\n       (1) continuing and enhancing the Troops to Teachers model \n     for recruiting and supporting the placement of such teachers; \n     and\n       (2) recruiting, preparing, placing, and supporting career-\n     changing professionals who have knowledge and experience that \n     will help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Subject to subsection (b), the Secretary is \n     authorized to use funds appropriated under subsection (c) for \n     each fiscal year to award grants, contracts, or cooperative \n     agreements to institutions of higher education and public and \n     private nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out \n     programs authorized by this Act.\n       (b) Troops to Teachers.--\n       (1) In general.--Before making awards under subsection (a) \n     for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall first--\n       (A) consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary \n     of Transportation regarding the appropriate amount of funding \n     needed to continue and enhance the Troops to Teachers \n     program; and\n       (B) upon agreement, transfer that amount to the Defense \n     Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) to \n     carry out the Troops to Teachers program.\n       (2) Continuation of program.--The Secretary may enter into \n     a written agreement with the Departments of Defense and \n     Transportation, or take such other steps as the Secretary \n     determines are appropriate to ensure effective continuation \n     of the Troops to Teachers program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this Act, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $18,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2005.\n\n     SEC. 5. APPLICATION.\n\n       Each applicant that desires an award under section 4(a) \n     shall submit an application to the Secretary containing such \n     information as the Secretary requires, including--\n       (1) a description of the target group of career-changing \n     professionals upon which the applicant will focus in carrying \n     out its program under this Act, including a description of \n     the characteristics of that target group that shows how the \n     knowledge and experience of its members are relevant to \n     meeting the purpose of this Act;\n       (2) a description of how the applicant will identify and \n     recruit program participants;\n       (3) a description of the training that program participants \n     will receive and how that training will relate to their \n     certification as teachers;\n       (4) a description of how the applicant will ensure that \n     program participants are placed and teach in high-poverty \n     local educational agencies;\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\n       (5) a description of the teacher induction services (which \n     may be provided through existing induction programs) the \n     program participants will receive throughout at least their \n     first year of teaching;\n       (6) a description of how the applicant will collaborate, as \n     needed, with other institutions, agencies, or organizations \n     to recruit, train, place, and support program participants \n     under this Act, including evidence of the commitment of those \n     institutions, agencies, or organizations to the applicant's \n     program;\n       (7) a description of how the applicant will evaluate the \n     progress and effectiveness of its program, including--\n       (A) the program's goals and objectives;\n       (B) the performance indicators the applicant will use to \n     measure the program's progress; and\n       (C) the outcome measures that will be used to determine the \n     program's effectiveness; and\n       (8) an assurance that the applicant will provide to the \n     Secretary such information as the Secretary determines \n     necessary to determine the overall effectiveness of programs \n     under this Act.\n\n     SEC. 6.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Transition to Teaching \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) School districts will need to hire more than 2,000,000 \n     teachers in the next decade. The need for teachers in the \n     areas of mathematics, science, foreign languages, special \n     education, and bilingual education, and for those able to \n     teach in high-poverty school districts will be particularly \n     high. To meet this need, talented Americans of all ages \n     should be recruited to become successful, qualified teachers.\n       (2) Nearly 28 percent of teachers of academic subjects have \n     neither an undergraduate major nor minor in their main \n     assignment fields. This problem is more acute in high-poverty \n     schools, where the out-of-field percentage is 39 percent.\n       (3) The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) \n     ranked United States high school seniors last among 16 \n     countries in physics and next to last in mathematics. It is \n     also evident, mainly from the TIMSS data, that based on \n     academic scores, a stronger emphasis needs to be placed on \n     the academic preparation of our children in mathematics and \n     science.\n       (4) One-fourth of high-poverty schools find it very \n     difficult to fill bilingual teaching positions, and nearly \n     half of public school teachers have students in their \n     classrooms for whom English is a second language.\n       (5) Many career-changing professionals with strong content-\n     area skills are interested in a teaching career, but need \n     assistance in getting the appropriate pedagogical training \n     and classroom experience.\n       (6) The Troops to Teachers model has been highly successful \n     in linking high-quality teachers to teach in high-poverty \n     districts.\n\n     SEC. ____3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to address the need of high-\n     poverty school districts for highly qualified teachers in \n     particular subject areas, such as mathematics, science, \n     foreign languages, bilingual education, and special \n     education, needed by those school districts, by recruiting, \n     preparing, placing, and supporting career-changing \n     professionals who have knowledge and experience that will \n     help them become such teachers.\n\n     SEC. ____4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The Secretary is authorized to use funds \n     appropriated under subsection (b) for each fiscal year to \n     award grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements to \n     institutions of higher education and public and private \n     nonprofit agencies or organizations to carry out programs \n     authorized by this title.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this title, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated $18,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2006.\n\n     SEC. ____5.

Mr. President, every February nationwide we \ncelebrate African American History Month. We do so because in 1926, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a recognition as \na way of preserving the history of the Negro and recognizing the \nenormous contributions of a people of great strength, dignity, faith \nand conviction--a people who rendered their achievements for the \nbetterment and advancement of a Nation once lacking in humanity towards \nthem. Throughout the Nation, we celebrate the many important \ncontributions African Americans have made in all facets of American \nlife.\n  Lerone Bennett, editor, writer and lecturer recently reflected on the \nlife and times of Dr. Woodson. In an article he wrote earlier this \nmonth for Johnson's Publications, Bennett tells us that one of the most \ninspiring and instructive stories in African American history is the \nstory of Woodson's struggle and rise from the coal mines of West \nVirginia to the summit of academic achievement:\n\n       At 17, the young man who was called by history to reveal \n     Black history was an untutored coal miner. At 19, after \n     teaching himself the fundamentals of English and arithmetic, \n     he entered high school and mastered the four-year curriculum \n     in less than two years. At 22, after two-thirds of a year at \n     Berea College [in Kentucky], he returned to the coal mines \n     and studied Latin and Greek between trips to the mine shafts. \n     He then went on to the University of Chicago, where he \n     received bachelor's and master's degrees, and Harvard \n     University, where he became the second Black to receive a \n     doctorate in history. The rest is history--Black history.\n\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, in keeping with the spirit and the vision of Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson, I would like to pay tribute to two courageous women, \nclaimed by my home state of Michigan, who played significant roles in \naddressing American injustice and inequality. These are two women of \ndifferent times who would change the course of history.\n  Mr. President, Sojourner Truth, who helped lead our country out of \nthe dark days of slavery, and Rosa Parks, whose dignified leadership \nsparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the start of the Civil Rights \nmovement are indelibly echoed in the chronicle of not only the history \nof this Nation, but are viewed with distinction and admiration \nthroughout the world.\n  Sojourner Truth, though unable to read or write, was considered one \nof the most eloquent and noted spokespersons of her day on the \ninhumanity and immorality of slavery. She was a leader in the \nabolitionist movement, and a ground breaking speaker on behalf of \nequality for women. Michigan recently honored her with the dedication \nof the Sojourner Truth Memorial Monument, which was unveiled in Battle \nCreek, Michigan on September 25, 1999. I commend Dr. Velma Laws-Clay \nwho headed the Monument Steering Committee and Sculptor Tina Allen for \nmaking their dream, a true monument to Sojourner Truth, a reality.\n  Mr. President, Sojourner Truth had an extraordinary life. She was \nborn Isabella Baumfree in 1797, served as a slave under several \ndifferent masters, and was eventually freed in 1828 when New York state \noutlawed slavery. She continued to live in New York and became strongly \ninvolved in religion. In 1843, Baumfree, in response to a command from \nGod, changed her name to Sojourner Truth and dedicated her life to \ntraveling and lecturing. She began her migration West in 1850, where \nshe shared the stage with other abolitionist leaders such as Frederick \nDouglass.\n  In 1851, Sojourner Truth delivered her famous ``Ain't I a Woman?'' \nspeech at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio. In the speech, Truth \nattacked both racism and sexism. Truth made her case for equality in \nplain-spoken English when she said,\n\n       Then that little man in black there, he says women can't \n     have as much rights as men, cause Christ wasn't a woman? \n     Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come \n     from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.\n\n  By the mid-1850s, Truth had settled in Battle Creek, Michigan. She \ncontinued to travel and speak out for equality. During the Civil War, \nTruth traveled throughout Michigan, gathering food and clothing for \nNegro volunteer regiments. Truth's travels during the war eventually \nled her to a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln in 1864, at which \nshe presented her ideas on assisting freed slaves. Truth remained in \nWashington, D.C. for several years, helping slaves who had fled from \nthe South and appearing at women's suffrage gatherings. Due to bad \nhealth, Sojourner Truth returned to Battle Creek in 1875, and remained \nthere until her death in 1883. Sojourner Truth spoke from her heart \nabout the most troubling issues of her time. A testament to Truth's \nconvictions is that her words continue to speak to us today.\n  Mr. President, on May 4, 1999 legislation was enacted which \nauthorized the President of the United States to award the \nCongressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks. The Congressional Gold Medal \nwas presented to Rosa Parks on June 15, 1999 during an elaborate \nceremony in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. I was pleased to cosponsor this \nfitting tribute to Rosa Parks--the gentle warrior who decided that she \nwould no longer tolerate the humiliation and demoralization of racial \nsegregation on a bus. Her personal bravery and self-sacrifice are \nremembered with reverence and respect by us all.\n  Forty four years ago in Montgomery, Alabama the modern civil rights \nmovement began when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat and move to \nthe back of the bus. The strength and spirit of this courageous woman \ncaptured the consciousness of not only the American people but the \nentire world.\n  My home state of Michigan proudly claims Rosa Parks as one of our \nown. Rosa Parks and her husband made the journey to Michigan in 1957. \nUnceasing threats on their lives and persistent harassment by phone \nprompted the move to Detroit where Rosa Parks's brother resided.\n  Rosa Parks' arrest for violating the city's segregation laws was the \ncatalyst for the Montgomery bus boycott. Her stand on that December day \nin 1955 was not an isolated incident but part of a lifetime of struggle \nfor equality and justice. For instance, twelve years earlier, in 1943, \nRosa Parks had been arrested for violating another one of the city's \nbus related segregation laws, which required African Americans to pay \ntheir fares at the front of the bus then get off of the bus and re-\nboard from the rear of the bus. The driver of that bus was the same \ndriver with whom Rosa Parks would have her confrontation 12 years \nlater.\n  The rest is history--the boycott which Rosa Parks began was the \nbeginning of an American revolution that elevated the status of African \nAmericans nationwide and introduced to the world a young leader who \nwould one day have a national holiday declared in his honor, the \nReverend Martin Luther King Jr.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way toward achieving justice and \nequality for all. But we still have work to do. In the names of Rosa \nParks, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Carter G. Woodson, Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., and many others, let us rededicate ourselves to continuing the \nstruggle on Civil Rights and to human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S893-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S893-S894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR CHARLES J. JOHNSON\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Command \nSergeant Major Charles J. Johnson of the U.S. Army Communication-\nElectronics Command who is retiring from the United States Army after \n30 years of active duty.

He is known for his dedication and integrity. He has tackled \nthe tough issues that our Army has faced the passed few years while \nconsistently focused on the proper care and concern for our soldiers \nand families. Through his hard work and efforts and the most \nsignificant contributions he has made our United States Army enters \nthis new millennium as a strong, well-trained, proud fighting force. \nThis wonderful American deserves a tremendous praise and thanks from a \nnation for which he has given so much and loves.\n  Sergeant Major Johnson was born on August 8, 1949. He was raised in \nCanton, Georgia, and entered the Army in April 1970 at Fort Knox, \nKentucky, where he was trained in Basic Soldiering and Basic Combat \nSkills. Upon the completion of Basic Training he received advanced \nindividual training as a Communications Center Specialist at Fort \nGordon, Georgia. Throughout his career, Sergeant Major Johnson \ncontinued his military education completing numerous military schools \nbut most notable: Defense Race Relations Institute, Advance \nNoncommissioned Course, Organizational Effectiveness Staff Officers \nCourse, First Sergeant Course and the United States Army Sergeants \nMajor Academy. Sergeant Major Johnson was also awarded a Bachelor of \nScience Degree from the University of Maryland.\n  Sergeant Major Johnson's initial assignment was with the Defense \nCommunications Agency Southwest Asia Mainland Region (Vietnam). He was \nassigned to the Defense Communication Agency in Washington, DC, \nfollowing duty in Vietnam. Sergeant Major Johnson has served over 24 \nyears overseas to include six tours in Germany, one tour in Korea, and \nanother combat tour in Southwest Asia.\n  Sergeant Major Johnson has served with distinction in every \nleadership position from Team Chief to Command Sergeant Major.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize and congratulate Mr. and Mrs. David Herbst, on receiving the \nNational Young Farmer Award from the American Farm Bureau Federation. \nFrom their farm near Chaffee, Missouri, David and Leslie Herbst have \nset an example to our nation's agricultural industry about productive \nfarming, land management, and environmental conservation.\n  The National Young Farmer Award is the highest award given for \noutstanding achievements, and it is given only to one farmer each year. \nDavid and Leslie Herbst were selected from a field of nominees \nsubmitted by state Farm Bureaus across the nation. It is an honor for \nMissouri to have such prominent examples of excellence in farming.\n  This prestigious award, presented to David and Leslie, is accompanied \nby some impressive prizes, including a 2000 Dodge Ram 4x4 truck and an \nArctic Cat all terrain vehicle. They also won registration to \nconferences that will give them an opportunity to share their successes \nand perspectives on farming with other young farmers and ranchers.\n  David and Leslie are continuing the tradition of family farming in \nsoutheast Missouri. They are the fourth generation of Herbsts to farm \nin the region, and they have been particularly successful with a unique \napproach to environmental protection that will preserve their land and \nkeep it fertile for future generations.\n  When I look to Missouri, I do not see a state defined only by its \ngeography--spanning from the Missouri River to the Mississippi River. \nNor do I simply define Missouri by its economic diversity--a state \nleading in farming and industry. I see the definition of Missouri as a \nplace where Missourians, like the Herbsts, can work together to give \nthe next generation more opportunity than we have today. It is a state \nof ascending opportunity.\n  Because of David and Leslie's careful stewardship of their land, \nprudent planning, and perseverance through the market crises of recent \nyears, they will be able to advise the next generation of Missourians \nto continue the traditions of family farming and agri-business. The \nHerbsts can truly say ``the best is yet to come.''\n  It is my honor to wish David and Leslie continued success in \nagriculture. They have set an inspiring example for farmers across the \nnation, and indeed in Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S894-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S894-S895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JIM GOODMON--VISIONARY\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, back in the mid-1960s, I was \nenjoying life as one of the guys active in the management of a very \nsuccessful television station in my hometown of Raleigh. The company, \nCapitol Broadcasting Company, had been founded by a remarkable \ngentleman, Mr. A.J. Fletcher, born in the mountains of Western North \nCarolina, son of a circuit-riding Baptist preacher whose ministry \nincluded hundreds of mountain families who attended the many churches \nunder the watchcare of the Reverend Mr. Fletcher.\n  Those were hard scrabble times and by today's standards, just about \neverybody whom Reverend Fletcher's ministry served was poor.\n  A.J. Fletcher had nonetheless begun a lifetime love affair with the \nmusic of opera. So he headed east, to Raleigh and Wake County; \nvirtually penniless he nonetheless studied law at night and in the \nprocess developed an instinctive knowledge of business and investment. \nIn the years that followed, neither A.J. Fletcher nor anyone else in \nhis family ever lived another hard-scrabble day.\n  Mr. President, I developed a high respect and genuine friendship for \nand with Mr. Fletcher. What I have recited up to this point is intended \nto be a lead-in to a magazine article about one of Mr. Fletcher's \nremarkable grandsons, James Fletcher Goodmon who today is president and \nCEO of Capitol Broadcasting Company.\n  I will get to the article in a moment, Mr. President, but I am \nobliged to mention my earliest impressions of Jim Goodmon when he was \nin high school in Raleigh and worked every possible minute of every day \n(and night) that he could manage at the television station (WRAL-TV) \nwhich was to become the flagship station-to-be of an expanded Capitol \nBroadcasting Company.\n  I saw young Jim Goodmon frequently back in those days (and nights) as \nhe concentrated on learning everything possible about the mysteries of \nkeeping a television station on the air. Many times he was covered with \ngrease, many times he was bound to have been tired, but Jim Goodmon was \nthen, as he is today, a hard-charger. Grandpa Fletcher was proud of \nJim--and so was I. I sensed back then that Jim Goodmon would one day be \na leader in television--as he certainly has turned out to be.\n  A few words about Jim Goodmon's family. After attending Duke \nUniversity, Jim Goodmon found a bride--a lovely one and a hard-charger \nherself--across the mountains in Tennessee. Barbara Lyons was a \nregistered nurse then. Now, years later, Barbara Lyons Goodmon \ngenuinely cares about people. She and Jim have three children and one \ngrandchild. They complement each other; both stay busy but never so \nbusy that they cannot help each other in their myriad of projects.\n  What I have stated is scarcely more than a snapshot of a remarkable \nfamily. Mr. A.J. Fletcher is long gone from the scene but I have a \nhunch that he is looking down from a Cloud Nine somewhere, nodding his \napproval of the way Jim and Barbara are doing things.\n  Let me hurriedly add that Jim Goodmon is president and owner of the \nDurham Bulls baseball team which plays its home games in its dandy new \nstadium about 20 miles away in Durham--and then I will proceed to \ncalling attention to a profile about Jim Goodmon published in the \nlatest issue of the magazine, Region Focus.\n  The article, by Betty Joyce Nash, is entitled ``James F. Goodmon, an \nindustry visionary and community cheerleader defines the future.'' Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Profile/James F. Goodmon--An Industry Visionary and Community \n                     Cheerleader Defines the Future\n\n       Jim Goodmon was fighting fatigue and a cold. He had just \n     flown back to Raleigh, N.C., from Colorado where he helped \n     pitch the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill Triangle area as the \n     site of the 2007 Pan American Games. Goodmon played a key \n     role in luring the 1999 Special Olympics to the Triangle, so \n     why not the Pan Am games?\n       It wasn't meant to be. San Antonio was chosen instead of \n     the Triangle. But that's irrelevant, Goodmon says, his spirit \n     hardly dampened by the loss, the jet lag, or sniffles. North \n     Carolina, he says, showed initiative in planning and \n     promoting the future.\n       ``What's important is that we were working on something in \n     2007 and not for next week,'' says Goodmon, president and \n     chief executive officer of Capitol Broadcasting Co. Inc. in \n     Raleigh. Goodmon's grandfather, A.J. Fletcher, started the \n     company in 1939 to serve the community. Still a family-owned \n     enterprise, Capitol is a rarity in the rapidly consolidating \n     broadcast industry.\n       So far, Goodmon has invested nearly $4 million to make \n     Capitol's WRAL the nation's first television station to \n     transmit television signals digitally. These high-definition \n     transmissions provide flawless pictures and ``surround'' \n     sound. WRAL-HD, the ``HD'' stands for high-definition, went \n     on the air in 1996. Goodmon is still charged by the potential \n     he sees in this medium. ``Not a day goes by that I'm not \n     amazed that we can send pictures through the air,'' he says.\n       Capitol's other holdings include minor league baseball \n     teams in Durham, N.C., and Myrtle Beach, S.C., a satellite \n     communications firm, and office developments in downturn \n     Durham.\n       But Goodmon's future includes a big role as community \n     cheerleader. A sports fan, Goodmon tirelessly cheers for the \n     Triangle. He is also president of his family's 50-year-old \n     philanthropic foundation--the A.J. Fletcher Foundation--and \n     is a chief promoter of Gov. Jim Hunt's Smart Start program \n     for preschool-aged children.\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n       ``If you want to make a difference in the future, what's \n     better than investing in kids?'' he asks.\n       Despite his prominent role in the community, Goodmon likes \n     to work behind the scenes, says longtime friend Smedes York. \n     A former Raleigh mayor who has known Goodmon since high \n     school, York was also a member of the committee that tried to \n     lure the Special Olympics and Pan Am Games to the Triangle. \n     Goodmon is serious about this commitment to making things \n     happen, York says, and backs up his promises with resources.\n       ``He'll pick up two or three key things and put his time \n     and resources into those,'' York says. ``He's not just \n     talking. He's putting up major money and people in his \n     organization he'll assign to work on these tasks.''\n       Goodmon may have a preference for the background, but he is \n     a natural leader. For instance, he persuaded the owner of the \n     new Hurricanes hockey team to use the name ``Carolina'' \n     Hurricanes, not ``Raleigh'' Hurricanes.\n       While others might wring hands, Goodmon acts, says \n     colleague Ben Waters. Waters should know. He is Capitol's \n     vice president of administration and often is responsible for \n     getting Goodmon's projects off the ground. One night in 1985, \n     Waters recalls, Goodmon called him and asked if he had seen a \n     news show about Ethiopia's starving children. Goodmon gave \n     him a task.\n       ``He said, `Find out how we can help them. We can't sit \n     back and not do anything,' '' Waters remembers. Although \n     Capitol was too late to aid Ethiopia, a program to funnel aid \n     through a religious organization to another famine hot \n     spot is ongoing.\n       The son of Fletcher's only daughter, Goodmon's legacy as a \n     leader began at a young age. He was 12 years old when he took \n     his first job as a gravedigger at a cemetery owned by his \n     family. He earned 35 cents an hour. At age 13, he began his \n     career in broadcasting by working odd jobs at WRAL. By age \n     15, he ran a camera as a member of the television production \n     crew. U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of Goodmon's \n     supervisors back then, remembers him well.\n       ``I can see him now,'' Helms recalls of the young Goodmon. \n     ``I did a lot of evening work to catch up with my \n     correspondence and I'd see him every evening in that \n     engineering department. He could show some of our full-time \n     engineers how to do it.''\n       The love of technology carried Goodmon to Duke University \n     where he studied engineering. But he left without a degree in \n     1965 to join the U.S. Navy. The technology bug stayed with \n     him.\n       A serviceman stationed in Memphis, Tenn., Goodmon also \n     worked at a local television station. And it was in this city \n     that he met his wife, Barbara, on a blind date. They played \n     card games.\n       ``Jim always said the reason he kept coming back to visit \n     was that we had a color TV,'' Barbara Goodmon laughs. He \n     often visited after he got off work at the television \n     station. But when it was time to go, she had to help him \n     start his car, an Austin Healy.\n       ``The only way he could start it was to get underneath \n     it,'' she says. ``I would get under the hood and hold \n     something while he started it.''\n       The couple is still a formidable team when it comes to \n     starting projects. As a member of the board of the Salvation \n     Army, the matriarch has rallied family members to serve in \n     soup kitchens and to participate in a variety of community \n     projects. Although the couple's work is now less hands-on, it \n     is more extensive. Their work with Healing Place is a prime \n     example. The facility plans to offer shelter and \n     rehabilitation services when it opens in November.\n       Healing Place was boosted by the A.J. Fletcher Foundation, \n     which provided start-up office space and supplies. Capitol \n     paid an employee to act as the facility's director. And the \n     community ponied up $4.5 million for the project.\n       Sowing the seeds of self-sufficiency is a hallmark of the \n     foundation, which now spends about $3.5 million a year to \n     help fund worthy North Carolina projects and fledgling \n     organizations. ``That's part of my future thing--getting \n     things started,'' says Goodmon.\n       His energy appears limitless.\n       ``He is up and down on the computer during the night with \n     ideas,'' his wife says. ``The people who work for him say, \n     `We know how much he's been doing according to how many e-\n     mails he has sent.' ''\n       That relentless pace took its toll on Goodmon and led to a \n     heart attack five years ago. He says the experience clarified \n     his vision and forced him to work more efficiently and \n     delegate better. Although always family-centered, he has a \n     renewed commitment to spending time with family members, \n     particularly his grandson, who is a toddler. He also watches \n     Durham Bulls baseball games and attends movies with his \n     family.\n       Still, Goodmon's vision is in high definition as he plugs \n     his energy into projects that will make a difference 10 years \n     into the future. ``Things don't just happen right; things \n     don't just come out right by themselves,'' Goodmon says. \n     ``You have to work on it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/28/senate-section/article/S895-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S895-S898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION ACT \n                           AMENDMENTS OF 1999\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.
