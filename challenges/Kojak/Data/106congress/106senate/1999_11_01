Mr. President, this is the ninth time I have come to the \nfloor of the Senate to talk about the issue of Medicare coverage for \nprescription drugs. As the Senate can see, I am urging seniors to send \nin copies of their prescription drug bills, as this poster instructs, \nto your Senator, U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510.\n  I am doing this because it is critically important that Congress move \non this issue and address it in a bipartisan way. With the counsel and \ninput of Senator Snowe of Maine, there is one bipartisan bill now \nbefore the Senate to cover the issue of prescription drugs for the \nNation's elderly.\n  I am sure other Members of the Senate are getting the kind of mail I \nam. What I will do this morning, as I have done on eight previous \noccasions, is talk specifically about some of the bills I am getting \nfrom senior citizens in Oregon in an effort to pull together a \nbipartisan coalition for action in this session.\n  We have heard, again and again, experts on the health care issue say \nthe prescription drug question is too complicated for the Senate to act \non at this time. That is a view I do not share. It is not shared by \nSenator Snowe. In fact, 54 Members of the Senate have already voted for \nthe funding plan the two of us have developed. We have already laid the \nfoundation for the Senate to move on this issue in a bipartisan way.\n  I will talk for a few minutes this afternoon about our legislation \nand about some copies of bills I have received from senior citizens. I \nhave a whole sheaf of them to go through.\n  What our bill is all about is trying to give senior citizens who are \non Medicare the same kind of bargaining power in the marketplace that a \nhealth maintenance organization has. The sad part about this issue is \nthat the senior citizens get shellacked on their prescription bills \ntwice. Medicare doesn't cover prescription drugs. When the program \nbegan in 1965, it didn't cover prescriptions. Maybe back then there was \na\n\n[[Page S13586]]\n\nfeeling they weren't that important. If anybody thought that then, they \ncertainly would not believe that now, because we have more than 20 \npercent of the Nation's senior citizens spending over $1,000 a year out \nof pocket for their prescription medicine. They can't afford these \nprescriptions. The doctors tell them to take three prescriptions. They \nstart off taking two, and then they take one, and eventually they can't \nafford their medicine, and they get sicker and they need perhaps \ninstitutional care, which is far more expensive. What is so sad is that \nthe seniors, of course, with Medicare not covering prescriptions, have \nto pay out of pocket. On top of that, they have to subsidize the big \nbuyers, the health maintenance organizations, the health plans, and \nother big buyers that are in a position to get a discount on their \nprescription medicine.\n  So Senator Snowe and I, in support of the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \nbill, are urging seniors to send copies of their prescription drug \nbills to the Senate, to your Senators, in Washington, DC, in the hopes \nthat we can deal with this in this session of the Senate.\n  I have been concerned about this issue since back in the days when I \nwas codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I ran the legal aid office \nfor senior citizens then, and prescriptions were awfully important even \nthen. But the fact is they are much more important to the Nation's \nolder people today than they were then because, today, so many of these \nprescriptions can, in effect, help to keep seniors well and healthy and \nphysically fit. So many of the drugs today can help to lower blood \npressure, or deal with cholesterol problems, or a wide variety of \nconditions, and can keep our seniors healthy. The savings associated \nwith these kinds of drugs are absolutely staggering.\n  I reported last week, when we talked about the question of \nprescriptions for seniors on the floor of the Senate, about one \nanticoagulant drug seniors often take today. It costs a little over \n$1,000 a year for a senior citizen to take that anticoagulant drug. By \ntaking that drug, very often it is possible to prevent a debilitating \nstroke that can cost a senior more than $100,000, in terms of expenses. \nJust think of that. An anticoagulant drug helps our seniors stay \nhealthy for about $1,000 a year. As a result of spending $1,000 a year \non this particular medicine, we can keep that person from having a \ndebilitating stroke, which could cost more than $100,000 a year.\n  So, very often, I am asked by colleagues and others in the Congress \nwhether our Nation can afford to cover prescription drugs for the \nelderly. My answer is that our Nation cannot afford not to cover \nprescription drugs, when you look at the kind of savings that would be \nassociated with this coverage.\n  Now, in the Snowe-Wyden bill, we seek to do a number of things beyond \ngiving senior citizens the same kind of bargaining power that a health \nmaintenance organization does. We focus on the principles of the \nprivate marketplace, trying to create choices and options and a wide \nvariety of alternatives for the Nation's seniors, and we do it through \na concept the President of the Senate and all of us understand very \nwell, and that is, we use the model of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. We don't go out and set up a whole new bureaucracy. We \ndon't set up a lot of price controls and get the Government intervening \nin the marketplace.\n  I have great reservations about that kind of approach because, if you \ngo with price controls, say, on Medicare, the only thing that will \nhappen is you will shift all the costs onto the backs of other \nvulnerable people. I don't think there is a Member of the Senate who \nwould like to see us take action with respect to prescription drugs for \nthe Nation's senior citizens, and then have a lot of costs shifted \nonto, say, a 27-year-old woman who is divorced and has two kids and is \nworking hard and playing by the rules and suddenly is seeing the \nprescription drug costs for her children go up very dramatically. So we \nought to unleash the forces of the marketplace. That is what is in the \nbipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill.\n\n  What I am going to do for a few moments is talk about some of the \nbills and documents that I have been sent by seniors since we came to \nthe floor and began to urge them, as this poster says, to send in \ncopies of their prescription drug bills to us in the Senate.\n  The first case I want to talk about this morning involves a senior \ncitizen who is 73 years old and lives in my home State, in Hillsboro. \nShe has a monthly income of $1,000, and she is spending 25 percent of \nit on her prescription drugs. She doesn't have any of these bills \ncovered by her health insurance--not any of them. She has to take a \nwide variety of drugs, such as Relafen and Prilosec--a whole host of \nprescription drugs--primarily due to hypertension and a variety of \nproblems. Her Prilosec alone is one she has to take on a regular basis; \nyet, as a result of the expenses associated with her prescription \nmedicine, this senior citizen at home in Hillsboro, OR, is not able to \ntake all of the medication she needs. She reports that when she does \ntake her Prilosec as her doctor tells her, she has had to give up other \nkinds of necessities. She is eating cheaper foods and is particularly \nconcerned that if something isn't done about prescription drugs in the \nSenate, she is going to have a whole host of other problems. She is not \nable to afford other essentials, such as being able to take care of \nexpenses for her house.\n  This is a real case, not some government report from some think tank \nin Washington, DC, hypothesizing about what the senior citizens need. \nThis is a real, live case from my home State, in Hillsboro, OR. She \nheard I am urging senior citizens, as this poster says, to send in \ncopies of their prescription drug bills to their Senators.\n  She sent me her case. Very clearly, these are heartrending cases--to \nthink people with a $1,000-a-month income trying to get by on that \nalone is hard enough. Having to spend 25 percent of her income on \nprescription drugs, having to be part of a drug regime where she can't \neven take all that her doctor is telling her to take--this is what is \ngoing on in the United States of America. A country as rich and \npowerful and as good as ours has not yet figured out a way to help \npeople such as this. It is a tragedy that we cannot come together on a \nbipartisan basis, the way the Snowe-Wyden bill envisages. There are \nother approaches that certainly would be appealing as well. But we need \nto get this done. What everybody says is that this Congress is so \npolarized, they can't deal with big issues.\n  Well, I believe the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden bill, which has gotten 54 \nvotes in terms of a funding plan and is based on models that every \nMember of the Senate knows about, is a very appealing kind of concept. \nBut if our colleagues have different approaches--and certainly in this \nbody we have strong views, and there are a variety of different ideas \non this--have them come forward.\n  But let's not duck this issue. Let us not duck it and say, oh, this \nis a matter for the 2000 campaign, and we don't need to deal with it \ntoday. We need to deal with it now.\n  I am going to go through a couple of other cases.\n  Here is another one from a couple in Cornelius, OR, a home in my \nState. They have a monthly income of about $1,000. They are spending \nbetween $200 and $400 every month on their prescription drugs. They \nhave to take drugs for arthritis, for cholesterol problems, and \nantibiotics on a fixed income.\n  Clearly, this kind of case where month after month they are seeing \nbetween 20 percent and 40 percent of their monthly income going for \nprescription drugs ought to make it clear to Members of this body that \nwe have to move and move on a bipartisan basis.\n  There isn't anything that is important in Washington, DC, that isn't \nbipartisan. I don't know of a single issue that can be addressed in a \nsignificant way without Democrats and Republicans coming together. The \nSnowe-Wyden bipartisan approach is one way. There may be others. But \nthe important thing is we ought to move and we ought to move in this \nsession of Congress.\n  A third case I would like to go through involves an elderly woman in \nForest Grove, OR. Recently, in effect, in the last few weeks, she spent \n$294 on her prescription medicine. She has had to take a variety of \ndifferent medicines. That is one example of what we are getting now \nfrom the seniors across this country. This particular senior is in \nForest Grove, OR, taking a whole host of medications.\n\n[[Page S13587]]\n\n  A lot of our seniors average 15 prescriptions a year. The third case \nI have gone through this morning with seniors spending $294 in just a \nfew weeks on her prescription medicines in Forest Grove is pretty \nrepresentative of what we are hearing.\n  I hope that as a result of my coming to the floor over these last \ndays before we wrap up for the year that we can see Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate coming together to try to deal with this \nquestion.\n  I want to bring up one last case. It is a particularly poignant one. \nIt is from an older person who is now taking 15 prescription drugs. She \nis on a fixed income with nothing but her Social Security. She is \nspending $600 a month--$600 a month--on her prescription medicine. None \nof it is covered by her health insurance. She writes to tell me that \nshe is spending almost her entire monthly income on prescription drugs.\n  Think of that. A senior citizen, again, at home in Oregon spending \nalmost her entire monthly income on prescription drugs. We asked: What \nhappens when you can't afford the prescription drugs you need? She said \nborrow. That is what she tries to do. A senior citizen with only Social \nSecurity spending virtually all of her monthly income on prescription \ndrugs is now having to borrow from friends and family.\n  I have a list of these prescriptions. Again, the list goes on and on.\n  This is an example of the kind of bills that senior citizens are now \nsending in as a result of our efforts to try to get bipartisan action \non this issue.\n  I hope as a result of my remarks other seniors will, as this poster \nsays, send in copies of their prescription drug bills. I hope they will \nbe interested in the bipartisan Snowe-Wyden prescription drug bill. \nBut, frankly, I would like to make sure they are in contact with all of \nus in the Senate because this is not an issue that should be allowed to \nbe put off until after the 2000 election.\n  We are given an election certificate. Mr. President, I know you feel \nvery strongly about important issues such as campaign finance reform \nwhere it is important to come together. We are giving election \ncertificates to deal with these issues. I have not been given an \nelection certificate to put this off until after another election. We \nare all sent here to deal with these important issues such as campaign \nfinance reform and prescription drugs because these are important to \nthe American people.\n\n  I am very proud to have been able to work with Senator Olympia Snowe \non this issue.\n  I think when you are dealing with important questions such as \nprescription drugs and campaign finance reform it has to be bipartisan. \nMy plan is to keep coming to the floor of the Senate day, after day, \nafter day, bringing up these examples of what I am hearing from the \nNation's senior citizens and hope that we can come together. Senator \nSnowe and I got 54 votes on the floor of the Senate for the funding \napproach we are taking. More than $10 billion goes from the Medicare \nprogram each year to cover tobacco-related illnesses. We know we have \nto act. We have to act responsibly to address these concerns of \nseniors.\n  There is a marketplace-oriented approach to this problem. We don't \nneed a lot of price controls. We don't need a ``one-size-fits-all'' run \nfrom a Washington, DC, program. The Snowe-Wyden bill will give seniors \nthe same kind of bargaining power that a health maintenance \norganization has to negotiate prices, not through a government regime \nbut through the power of marketplace forces.\n  I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate until we \nget action on this issue. I will keep reading from these letters. I \nhope seniors will continue, as this poster says, to send in copies of \ntheir prescription drug bills. I know that seniors at home have made it \nclear they are going to keep sending them to me, and I am very hopeful \nthat we can get action on this issue in this session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I will take a few minutes and talk about \nsome of the things we are doing. Obviously, we are heading toward the \nend of this session. There is speculation as to when we will conclude \nour work. Of course, before that is done, clearly the most important \nthing before us is the appropriations process, funding the Government, \nand we will do that.\n  I had the opportunity this weekend to spend some time in my home \nState. I can always pick up things about which people feel strongly. \nThey want to see the budget signed. There are differences of view as to \nwhat that budget should contain--legitimately, of course.\n  Most of the people in my State--and I certainly believe they are well \ninformed because I agree with them--think we ought to hold down the \nsize of the budget because that is how we really put some limits on \nGovernment. That does not mean we do not fund the things that are \nessential. Certainly we will not always have unanimity on what people \nperceive as being essential, and that is what it is all about.\n  People do want the budget signed. They do not want the Government to \nshut down, nor does anyone here, and I hope not the President. He has \nindicated he does not. We have about five bills to complete and get \nsigned. I am optimistic about it. We will conclude our work without a \nshutdown. We will conclude our work without spending Social Security \ndollars, which was the commitment we made.\n  Out of the surplus this year--a surplus, frankly, for the second time \nin 25 years--we will only spend that money when it comes in the \noperational budget and not the budget of Social Security. More \nimportant, not only will we not spend Social Security money, but we \nalso have a plan to strengthen Social Security for the future. To save \nSocial Security is not enough. We must do that, of course.\n\n  The other thing I have heard--and I already mentioned it--is hold \ndown the size of Government; we do not want the Federal Government to \ncontinue to grow and to be the dominating factor in people's lives. \nIndeed, there are essential elements of the Federal Government, but the \nstrength lies in the communities, States, and counties of this country. \nThe more decisionmaking that takes place there, it seems to me the \nstronger we will be and the closer we will be to the governed making \nthe decisions, and the better off we will be.\n  We will do well. We will have to make some adjustments. One of them \nmay well be an across-the-board cut of 1 percent. I happen to favor \nthat idea. We are talking about a discretionary budget of about $595 \nbillion. That is out of a total of about $1.7 trillion, the rest being \nmandatory. We are talking about actually below 1 percent, a .97-percent \nacross-the-board cut, which is about $3.5 billion. That will bring us \ndown to $592 billion. I cannot imagine that agencies with a budget of \n$15 billion or $260 billion are unable to find 1 percent that can be \nreduced. Generally, through things that are not terribly\n\n[[Page S13588]]\n\nimportant or some even considered to be wasteful spending, they can \nfind 1 percent. In any event, I am very confident that can be done.\n  Some say it will require the military to lay off. The fact is, after \n1 percent, it would still be a substantial increase over last year and \nover the President's request for the military budget. We are closing in \non getting that job done. Certainly it is the compelling task before \nus.\n  It reminds me of one of the things I believe we ought to consider, \nand that is a biennial budget, so we can do this business of budgeting \nand allocating resources every other year, which has the advantage of \ngiving agencies and the Federal Government a better opportunity of \nknowing what they will be doing for a longer period of time. But more \nimportant, it provides an opportunity for 1 year to do budgeting and \nappropriations and 1 year for oversight which, in my view, is equally \nimportant. It is important for the Congress to have oversight of the \nexpenditures and to ensure these expenditures are implementing policies \nthat have been passed by the Congress.\n  Most States do biennial budgeting and find it very useful, very \nsatisfactory, and successful. I suspect there will be resistance, of \ncourse, from those involved in the appropriations process because it \nwill eliminate 1 year in which they have perhaps extraordinary \nauthority in the direction we will take. Nevertheless, I hope this idea \nis favored by the chairman of the Budget Committee and by the leader of \nthe Senate majority. That is something we ought to consider.\n  As we talk to people at home, we ought to talk a little bit about the \naccomplishments of this Congress. I believe it has been extraordinary. \nIt is a little difficult to keep up with it through the media's \ndescription of what we do; they don't like to talk about anything \nunless it is sensational; and also opportunities to communicate are \nvery difficult. One of them is the budget.\n  We have a surplus--the first time in 42 years. Two years in a row, we \nhave had a surplus. Part of that, obviously, is we have more revenue \ncoming in and a strong economy. But equally as important--perhaps more \nimportant--is the balanced budget amendments that were passed 3 years \nago that have kept down spending. At the end of the seventies and \nthrough the eighties, into the nineties, growth each year was in the \nneighborhood of 10 to 12 percent. In this year, it is just over 2 \npercent. Is it where we want to be? No. For many of us, it is not. \nNevertheless, it is progress. We even have had, of course, a non-Social \nSecurity surplus.\n\n  Instead of spending at 10 percent, which we did in the early \neighties, we are spending at 2.8-percent growth. That is pretty good.\n  Spending as a percent of gross national product has fallen during the \nnineties. Unfortunately, largely because of the President's tax bill in \n1995, the percentage of taxes with respect to the gross national \nproduct has increased, the highest since World War II. Of course, we \ntried to do something about that. We passed a bill that would have been \na reduction in taxes, but, unfortunately, the President vetoed it.\n  I mentioned Social Security and that we have to do more than simply \ntalk about it. We can do that. Two years ago, President Clinton urged \nus to save Social Security first. Unfortunately, he has done very \nlittle since then, but there have been a number of things done here. \nRepublicans have worked hard in seeking passage of a Social Security \nlockbox. Unfortunately, it has been filibustered on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  One of the most fundamental changes I hope will be considered next \nyear and passed is the notion of having private accounts where people \nwho are closer to the retirement benefit age will continue as they are. \nBut people 25, 35, and 40 years old will have the opportunity to take \nthe dollars they have contributed to Social Security and put them in a \npersonal account, directly invested in equities, directed by the owner \nthrough an investment program, that will have several benefits. One, it \nwould belong to the taxpayer. If, unfortunately, you were not able to \nutilize it before you passed away, it would be part of your estate. The \nsecond is, the return on the investment would be more substantially \ninvested in equities than it would be invested as it is now in \nGovernment securities. That is the real direction we need to take.\n\n  Tax relief, of course, will be back again. It continues to be an \nissue. When you have taxpayers who are paying more into the Federal \nGovernment than is necessary to sustain the essential elements of the \nGovernment, then the money ought to be returned. It has been said--and \nit is probably true--that if dollars remain in Washington, they have a \nway of getting spent. So we ought to give some relief to taxpayers.\n  I was out last summer, in August, talking about the tax relief bill, \nand people sort of rolled their eyes about it because they had heard \nthat before. But when you talked about the elements of it, they became \nvery interested and supportive of it.\n  Estate taxes: For example, we have a lot of agriculture in Wyoming. \nMany agriculturists have almost all of their life's earnings in \nproperty, not in yearly income but in the estate they build up in that \nfarm or ranch. Currently, they could lose nearly half of that through \nestate taxes. We would like to do away with those over a period of \ntime.\n  Capital gains: More and more people are investing money in the market \nand seeking to take care of themselves for their old age security or to \nsupplement their Social Security. We need to encourage that. One way to \ndo that is to reduce the tax on capital gains.\n  The marriage penalty: Almost everyone would agree to the fact that a \nmarriage penalty is very unfair, where two young people who are single \nat a certain wage level pay a certain amount of tax, but if they get \nmarried, they pay a higher amount of tax. That is not fair. We sought \nto change that. Unfortunately, as I said, that was vetoed. \nNevertheless, I consider it to be an accomplishment for the Republican \nSenate because it sets the groundwork to move forward in another year.\n  Education: This budget we are talking about contains more for \neducation than the President requested. He is arguing about that. The \nbig argument is not the amount of money. The argument is because the \nPresident wants to dictate, to stipulate where the money goes--in this \ncase for 100,000 teachers. We think it makes much more sense to be more \nflexible. If you have the money, send it to the States, send it to the \nschool districts, and let those folks decide where it is most efficient \nto invest the money.\n  I have a strong belief that the needs in Greybull, WY, are quite \ndifferent than they are in Pittsburgh. We ought to be able to adjust \nfor that. I believe what we have done, in the case of education with \nEd-Flex, is given local people more flexibility. So there is additional \nmoney in this budget for education. We had money in our tax bill to \nencourage education, as well. I am pretty pleased about that.\n  National security: We have added $17 billion for the defense of this \ncountry. Probably, if you had to select the item and the issue that the \nNational Government is most responsible for--the Federal Government--it \nis defense. No one else, of course, can participate as fully in the \ndefense of our country as the Federal Government.\n  Unfortunately, we have had more troop deployments over the last \ncouple years than we have had in 50 years. But the administration has \nrequested funds that would cause military readiness to go down. We have \nbeen in Haiti, in Bosnia, in Kosovo, and a number of other places, \nwhich has been very expensive. We have found ourselves in the \nsituation, with voluntary Armed Forces, where it is difficult to \nrecruit people to come into the military. Probably the more difficult \nthing is to retain those people in the military who have been trained \nto be pilots or mechanics, or whatever, who can find, of course, much \nbetter jobs somewhere else.\n  Health care: Clearly, health care is a vital interest to all of us. \nAgain, folks in Wyoming are interested in that, in particular, because \nthe changes that have been made over the last couple of years have \naffected rural areas probably to more of an extreme than nonrural \nareas. We are moving, of course, into an era where very small hospitals \nfind it most difficult. We have some towns in our State with hospitals \nthat have an average occupancy of one or two acute-care beds. That is\n\n[[Page S13589]]\n\nvery difficult. And there are shifts taking place. We have changed the \ndefinition of ``hospital'' so that HCFA, the funding agency, can fund \nhospitals that have less than full services, even emergency rooms, to \nmove those patients off to somewhere else.\n  We passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. I hope one of the things that \nwill happen before we leave is some change in the balanced budget \namendment on Medicare. That will probably be an additional $15 billion \nover 10 years, to take away what we think were the overcuts that have \nbeen made by the agency that pays it out. So we will be moving forward \non that.\n  Financial modernization: I think for the first time since the 1930s \nthe whole financial picture has changed somewhat. That bill is prepared \nto come to the floor. We closed the deal last week. We have been trying \nfor 10 years--and finally got that done--to change the regulations that \nwere put in place during the Depression times to fit what is necessary \nnow.\n  So we have accomplished a great deal in the budget: Social Security, \neducation, defense, tax relief, health care, and now a banking bill--\nall things that are good for America--but yet without letting the \nFederal Government grow out of control.\n  It is legitimate to have different views, and we ought to have an \nexchange of views. There are different views everywhere. One of the \nbasic differences here has to do, frankly, with the size and \ninvolvement of the Federal Government; it has to do with spending. The \nliberals, of course, want to have more taxes, more spending, put the \nFederal Government into more things, override the States because they \nthink that is a better way to do it. It is a legitimate point of view. \nI do not agree with it.\n  We ought to try to limit those things that can best and must be done \nby the Federal Government. Do we raise money to do it? Of course. But \nafter that we ought to let that be done closer to the people.\n  Those are the real issues. Sometimes they do not show up. We get to \ntalking about details, but the basic philosophy is there and it is \nlegitimate and we need to work at it.\n  I hope we can move forward. I think we have completed a good amount \nof work this year. We have some more to do. We have probably less than \n2 weeks to do it. So I hope we move forward.\n  I now yield whatever time he might consume to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from \nWyoming taking the time to show some of the differences and some of the \naccomplishments of this session of the Senate. While I was watching him \ndo that, it occurred to me that something else constantly needs to be \nbrought up before the American people because a lot of times people \nlook at Democrats and Republicans and do not realize that we do stand \nfor different things.\n  In the case of the Republican Party, I have had the honor, since I \nhave been in the Senate, of serving on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I originally discovered when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives--and it was a shocker--why there is such a difference \nin the approach to national security between the Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  To put it very bluntly, the Republicans have always believed that the \nprimary responsibility of Government was to give America a more secure \ncountry and to promote our national security. Yet time and time again, \nit is quite obvious that there is a difference between Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  To document this or to quantify it, there is a group called the \nCenter for Security Policy. I think this is kind of interesting because \npeople need to know what we are doing here. All too often people will \nread the mail of their Senators and assume that is everything that is \ngoing on here, when, in fact, there are some things that may not be \naccurately expressed in that mail. For example, if a constituent is \nconcerned with how his particular Member is voting on tax issues, the \nNational Tax Limitation Committee and National Taxpayers Union rank us \nso they can tell who is for more taxes and who is for less taxes. If a \nconstituent is concerned about what is happening in terms of family \nvalues, they have a number of organizations that will tell how Members \nvoted on issues such as abortion. If they are concerned about how much \nregulation is disturbing people who are trying to run small businesses, \nthe NFIB, National Federation of Independent Business, actually does a \nrating.\n\n  As far as national security is concerned, the Center for Security \nPolicy is an organization that takes all these votes we cast having to \ndo with a strong national defense, having to do with test ban treaties, \na national missile defense system, defense spending, and they rank us \nto see who the good guys and the bad guys are in their eyes; that is, \nwho is promoting a stronger national defense and is more concerned \nabout national security or who legitimately believes there is a threat.\n  The average Democrat is ranked, in accordance with the Center for \nSecurity Policy, at 12 percent; the average Republican is 94 percent. \nThat tells us something. It tells us there is a basic difference in the \npolicy of the Democrat versus the Republican Party.\n  This is significant because we just completed debate on the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty and we heard a lot of dialog on both \nsides. To the last one on the Republican side who voted in opposition \nto this treaty, it was a recognition that there is a real threat out \nthere. By unilaterally disarming, which is essentially what we would \nhave done under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, we would have \nallowed those nations to go ahead and test their nuclear arsenal, even \nthough there is no way of verifying whether or not they were testing, \nof course.\n  Good old America, we do what we say we are going to do. If we say we \nwill not do it, then we don't do it. I remember several times \nSecretaries of Defense would actually testify: We know we are not going \nto do it, but there is no way of knowing whether the other side is \ndoing it. I had no doubt in my mind that both China and Russia would \ncontinue to test their nuclear weapons, even if they had ultimately \nratified. By the way, they kept using the argument that we are going to \nhave to ratify this because if we don't do it, Russia won't do it. I \nremember that same argument in the START II treaty. Russia still hasn't \ndone it. We need to look at these things. Unfortunately, it does become \na partisan issue.\n  In talking about our national defense, I come from the background of \nchairing the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. There is a huge issue taking place right now. I will make a \ncouple of references to it because I have introduced a Senate \nconcurrent resolution, with several Members who are cosponsoring it, \nwhich calls upon the President and the Secretary of Defense to reopen \nthe Vieques training bombing range off the island of Puerto Rico.\n  This is what the range looks like. This is the island of Puerto Rico. \nIt is about 22 miles from here to there. This part represents a live \nbombing range. It only constitutes 2.7 percent of the entire island.\n  This bombing range has been hot range active for 58 years. During the \ntime period it has been active, there has only been one death on the \nground as a result of the use of the range. That was last April 19. As \na result, everyone in Puerto Rico who is running for office, whether it \nis for delegate or for the Governor of Puerto Rico, is using as his or \nher platform: We are going to do the most we can to shut down this \nrange.\n\n  This is the range over here. It has been used for 58 years. There is \nlive ordnance all over the range. There are protesters there right now, \nillegally trespassing, who are picking up and throwing around these \nlive pieces of ordnance.\n  I have written twice to Janet Reno and told her she should go down \nthere\n\n[[Page S13590]]\n\nand enforce the trespassing laws, if for no other reason than just to \nkeep someone from getting killed. She has refused to do that. \nUnfortunately, it has been politicized.\n  We had a committee meeting where we had the Governor of Puerto Rico \nand others testify. They take the position that if you want to keep \nthis training range active so we can properly train our American \nsoldiers, which include Puerto Rican soldiers, somehow you don't like \nPuerto Ricans. I think it is very important to realize that that little \ntraining range offers three components of training that cannot be \nduplicated anywhere else in the Western Hemisphere.\n  First of all, it is high-altitude bombing. Why is that necessary? It \nis necessary because, as in the case of Kosovo, when we sent our pilots \nin there with cruise missiles, it was necessary that they be above the \nrange of the surface-to-air missiles. They were very successful in \nKosovo in doing that. There is no place else we can get that training \nbecause of airspace restrictions.\n  I went, the weekend before this last weekend, to the U.S.S. \nEisenhower, which is scheduled to go to the gulf, where they very \nlikely could see some kind of combat. The Navy pilots were actually \nfrom that aircraft carrier conducting their training exercises in two \ndifferent places in the United States.\n  Here is the problem. I say this as a professional pilot of 40 years. \nTo do that, they have to go through normal commercial airspace. In \nother words, they take off in an F-14 or F-18 from the U.S.S. \nEisenhower. They go to drop their load of either real or not real \nordnance. To do this, they have to fly through civilian airspace as if \nthey were a general aviation pilot or a commercial pilot flying a \ncommercial airline. In doing this, it is a totally different set of \nrules. Then when they come up to the range, where they can drop their \nordnance, they have to all of a sudden be tactical. It is totally \ndisruptive, and they can't do it at an altitude high enough to give \nthem the actual training. What it will mean is, if these guys are \ndeployed in the Persian Gulf on February 18, many of them will go over \nthere and will be called upon to do things they have never done before.\n  At the same time, you have your marine expeditionary units, that \nwould not have had this training--actually landing and going on \namphibious operations on the shores of Vieques, where they have been \ndoing it for 58 years without incident. We wouldn't have the Navy being \nable to fire their guns. In fact, one of the officers said that they \nwould be sending sailors out there to fire when they have never fired \nlive on the ground before.\n  It is a very serious problem. I bring this up not just to gain \nsupport for the resolution but to respond to something that is going on \nright now.\n  We had a committee hearing with Governor Rossello. He came in. I will \nread some of the local press there.\n\n       Gov. Rossello on Friday called Republican Senator James \n     Inhofe a ``backward and reactionary'' member of the ultra \n     right wing of the Republican Party, while several island \n     legislators called him an ``Ugly American'' following \n     comments the Oklahoma Senator made about Puerto Rico this \n     week.\n       [Senator Inhofe] upholds the same tradition of other people \n     who have made similar statements, which is an anti-Hispanic, \n     anti-minority. . . .\n\n  It goes on. I think this is a further demonstration that they must \nnot have a case, if they are going to have to resort to these kinds of \ninsults.\n  I say, in my own defense, that it wasn't long ago--it was 1996--I, \nalong with the Democrat over on the House side, was the recipient of \nthe Award for Freedom and Democracy from the International Foundation \nfor Election Systems. The statement that was made when I was being \nintroduced was: Senator James Inhofe has done more to promote freedom \nand democracy in Central America; he has done more to promote trade \nwith Mexico and more to provide humanitarian assistance to the \nCaribbean than anybody else and is hereby awarded the Freedom and \nDemocracy Award by the International Foundation of Election Systems.\n  That was due to a couple of things I have done. One time, not too \nmany years ago, when a devastating hurricane wiped out the lower \nCaribbean, I led a group of 10 airplanes through two hurricanes to take \ndown humanitarian goods, doctors, two nurses, and food for the victims \non those islands. In the case of promoting trade with Mexico, in 1981 I \npromoted the first trade where we actually flew to San Luis Potosi, \nMexico, and made, not a cultural exchange but an industrial exchange, \nwhere we computerized things they can do down there and things we were \ndoing in my home city of Tulsa, OK. And they now have established trade \nwith that country, and relationships and contracts are still alive \ntoday.\n\n  I had occasion to be involved in Central America during the problems \nthat were taking place down in Nicaragua and some of the other Central \nAmerican countries. So I say that in my own defense. I appeal to people \nto start looking at the real problems that exist in Puerto Rico right \nnow, in terms of that range. I wish there was someplace else we could \ntrain other than this island of Vieques. When they say it is an \ninconvenience and it is noisy and it is just 10 miles--this is the \nrange. This is where the population is. It is 9.7 miles between here \nand here.\n  I want to show you, by contrast, if you hold up the other chart, the \ntwo red areas are the live ranges that are where? In Oklahoma, Fort \nSill, which is an artillery training range, a hot range. When I fly \nover the area, the controller tells me whether their range is hot or \nnot. So there it is, these two ranges. Here is the population of \nLawton, OK. So you can see the hot range goes within 1 mile of a \npopulation of 100,000 people, as opposed to Vieques, where the range is \n9.7 miles from 9,000 people.\n  Hold up the other chart, if you will. To give a comparison between \nthe two, at Vieques, they use 9-inch guns. We use 6.1-inch in Fort \nSill. The days of training average 164 live days a year in Vieques, and \nat Fort Sill we average 320 days per year. The range at Fort Sill is \nopen and is hot and used twice as many days per year as it is in \nVieques.\n  Thirdly, the distance from the population is 9.7 miles in Vieques, \nand it is only 1 mile at Fort Sill. The population, instead of 9,000, \nis 100,000 people. They talk about the danger that imposes. There have \nbeen three fatalities. One fatality in Vieques was an F-18 that went \ndown and both pilots were killed. They have had 1 ground fatality \nthere, and we have had 26 (34 including air fatalities) at Fort Sill \nover a period of time.\n  So when people accuse us of having two standards, one for those \nranges in the United States and one for the range that happens to be in \na territory, I think those people have to stop and realize: aren't they \nasking for something that is more than what we find to be perfectly \nacceptable in Kansas or in Oklahoma? So I hope people will keep in mind \nthat several of our officers have made the statement that if we send \nand deploy, on February 18, as is currently scheduled, those sailors \nand airmen and marines, they will have to go by way of the \nMediterranean to the Persian Gulf. The chances are better than 2-to-1 \nthat they will see combat in the Persian Gulf because that is what \nhistory shows us right now. We would be sending them there without the \nbenefit of any training at all.\n  There is another resolution that was introduced by Senator Warner, \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, last week. He was admonishing \nthe President not to deploy the U.S.S. Eisenhower if they don't have \nthat training range opened up so they can get the training. I am going \nto support that resolution as well as mine. The problem I see with it \nis that we have already deployed the U.S.S. Roosevelt. They are already \nreturning. The U.S.S. Kennedy is out there right now, and only half of \nits personnel have had proper training. We would be asking them to make \na second 6-month deployment. That would have a terribly negative effect \non an already-eroding problem that we have with retention in the \nmilitary.\n  So I have two points I wish to make. One is that we need to do all we \ncan to protect our young people whom we are asking to go into combat by \ngiving them the proper training, and also to point out that there is a \ndifference between the Democratic and the Republican Party when it \ncomes to our support of national defense.\n  I will repeat one more time the statistic I used from the center for \nsecurity policy. The average Democrat rates 12 percent; the average \nRepublican rates 94 percent. I don't think the American people would \nexpect that the\n\n[[Page S13591]]\n\ndefense of our country and national security should be a partisan \nissue, but it is.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to read an editorial from \ntoday's Columbus Dispatch. I want to read it in its entirety because I \nbelieve it strongly makes a point that needs to be made.\n  The editorial is entitled: ``Cooked books--That big federal budget \nsurplus? It isn't.''\n  The editorial reads as follows:\n\n       The president and members of Congress should all be kept \n     after school to write this on the blackboard 123 billion \n     times:\n       There is no federal budget surplus.\n       The $123 billion surplus that the president and Congress \n     are crowing about last week really is a $1 billion deficit, \n     hidden by $124 billion in excess Social Security tax revenue \n     that shouldn't even be counted in the general budget because \n     it is meant to be set aside in a trust fund to cover \n     retirement-benefit payments later.\n       Put that Social Security money aside as intended and the \n     truth about the federal surplus becomes evident:\n       The government spent $1 billion more than it took in last \n     year.\n       Certainly, a $1 billion deficit is a vast improvement over \n     years past, when the government was running in the red to the \n     tune of $200 billion or more annually and creating a national \n     debt approaching $6 trillion.\n       But it is still a deficit.\n       And it is patently dishonest for the president and Congress \n     to pretend that all that red ink is black.\n       Even the $124 billion in excess Social Security revenues is \n     really not a surplus for the retirement program.\n       Yes, Social Security took in more last year than it paid \n     out, but that surplus is a drop in the bucket of the \n     program's $8 trillion unfunded liability.\n       That's the amount of money the program ultimately is \n     obligated to pay out to current retirees and workers above \n     and beyond what those participants have paid or will pay into \n     the system.\n       The $124 billion cushion that Social Security has right now \n     puts a mere 1.6 percent dent in that massive obligation.\n       Congress and the president each pay lip service to the idea \n     of balancing the federal budget and preserving the Social \n     Security surpluses for Social Security, but a genuine \n     commitment to these goals would begin with honest \n     bookkeeping.\n       Until then, it is back to the blackboard:\n       There is no federal budget surplus.\n       There is no federal budget surplus.\n       There is no federal budget surplus.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, the picture I have displayed on the \nfloor of the Senate is of an 11-year-old child named Jeanna North. \nJeanna North was tragically murdered by a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle \nBell was a previously convicted child molester, a violent criminal \nliving in the neighborhood. This young girl, out on roller blades one \nafternoon on a quiet Fargo street, was abducted and murdered.\n  Kyle Bell was convicted of that murder. On October 13, Kyle Bell was \nbeing transported to prison and he escaped in New Mexico from a bus \nthat was transporting him and nearly 30 other prisoners across the \ncountry. Kyle Bell, this convicted child murderer, escaped from a \ncompany called Transcorps. Transcorps is a private company. There are a \nnumber of private companies that states contract with to haul killers \nand criminals around the country. When you haul toxic waste around \nAmerica, you have to meet certain requirements. When you haul circus \nanimals around this country, you have to meet certain minimum \nrequirements. But if you are a business holding yourself out to \ntransport prisoners all around this country from State to State, there \nare no minimum requirements and no standards. Get yourself a minivan, \nhire your brother-in-law and two cousins and say you are in business \nand you want to haul a convicted child killer around the country.\n  The escape of this convicted child killer occurred in a circumstance \nwhere the bus transporting him, which carried over 30 people, pulled up \nto a service station to get gas. One of the guards apparently was \nfueling the vehicle, the other apparently might have been getting a \nhamburger at the Food Mart, and the third was asleep on the bus, and in \nthe meanwhile this killer goes out through a hatch in the roof of the \nbus. Then the guards get back on the bus and for 9 hours that bus drove \nacross the country, and they never knew this convicted killer had \nescaped.\n  He escaped in civilian clothes, incidentally--a convicted killer \nbeing transported across this country in civilian clothes. One would \nlogically ask the question: If you are doing that, if you are \ntransporting a convicted killer across State lines, why would you not \nhave an orange prison uniform that says ``I Am A Prisoner''? Because \nthere are no regulations, no standards. You can haul prisoners, \nincluding violent prisoners, across this country coast to coast and you \ndo not have any standards to meet. I think that is wrong. If you are a \ncompany, a private company contracting to haul violent prisoners across \nthis country, it seems to me you ought to meet minimum regulations, \nminimum standards.\n  In order to enhance public safety, I am going to propose later this \nweek a piece of legislation that will require the Justice Department to \nestablish standards that private companies effecting that transport \nmust meet. When there is an interstate transport of criminals across \nthis country, especially high-risk criminals, certain minimum \nconditions must be met.\n  Minimum standards on background checks for employees--is that \nreasonable? You bet. Minimum standards for the type of training an \nemployee would have, who is transporting a violent criminal across \nState lines; restrictions on the number of hours that employees are on \nduty during a 24-hour period; minimum standards on the number of guards \nthat must be present for supervising violent criminals; standards \nrequiring that high-risk violent prisoners wear brightly colored \nclothing, clearly identifying them as prisoners; minimum standards on \nthe type of restraint that is used when transporting these prisoners; \nand a requirement that private prison transport companies notify law \nenforcement officials of scheduled stops in their jurisdiction when \nthey are hauling a cargo of violent prisoners.\n  These are standards that ought to be implemented. The murder of this \nyoung girl in Fargo, ND, by Kyle Bell is a tragedy. But it is a tragedy \nthat is compounded by the escape of this murderer who now, this \nafternoon, is on the loose. God forbid he should harm or kill someone \nelse while he has escaped from custody. But this escape should\n\n[[Page S13592]]\n\npersuade us, as almost all law enforcement officials have told me, that \nthere is a need for some reasonable standards or requirements. Even the \nprivate companies themselves have said, yes, there is a need for some \nbasic standards.\n\n  I intend to introduce legislation that would allow the Justice \nDepartment to establish these standards and perhaps we will not again \nsee an escape of a violent killer of this type. The U.S. Marshals \nService also transports offenders or criminals across this country, and \nthey have never lost a violent criminal during that transport. When \nprivate companies are contracting with States and cities to haul \nviolent criminals, the American public ought to expect that if they \npull up to a gas station someplace they are not pulling up next to a \nminivan that contains three or four convicted murderers who are being \nhandled improperly, by ill-trained guards, sitting in civilian \nclothing, and potentially able to escape.\n  The American public should not have to accept that risk. We will not \naccept risks in the transport of toxic waste. We will not accept the \ntransport, without standards, of cattle; or for that matter of circus \nanimals. Neither should we accept the transport of convicted killers \nacross this country without some basic minimum standard that would \nguarantee public safety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Senator Daschle and I have been working, \nreally last week and early this week, to reach an agreement on the best \nway to have further consideration of the trade bill and also the \nbankruptcy bill. I want to say right up front that there has been a \ngood faith effort on both sides. I certainly feel that way toward the \nDemocratic leader. We are very close to reaching an agreement. I think \nit is basically a question of showing each other the actual amendments \nthat would be involved. But I understand the Senator from South \nCarolina will not allow us to enter into any agreement with regard to \nthe trade bill at this time. Having said that, we will continue to work \nto reach an agreement on the bankruptcy bill as well as trying to find \na way to consider the pending trade bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13592-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13592-S13597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Resumed\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, with that, I now call for the regular \norder with respect to the trade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment \n     policy for sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Lott (for Roth/Moynihan) amendment No. 2325, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Lott amendment No. 2332 (to amendment No. 2325), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Lott amendment No. 2333 (to amendment No. 2332), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Lott motion to commit with instructions (to amendment No. \n     2333), of a perfecting nature.\n       Lott amendment No. 2334 (to the instructions of the motion \n     to commit), of a perfecting nature.\n       Lott (for Ashcroft) amendment No. 2340 (to amendment No. \n     2334), to establish a chief agricultural negotiator in the \n     Office of the United States Trade Representative.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2340 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I now withdraw amendment No. 2340.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, it is now my hope the Senate can consider \ntrade related amendments to the underlying African trade/CBI bill. We \nhave been encouraging Members throughout this process to be prepared to \noffer their amendments. I have stated previously it has always been our \nwillingness to have Senators offer these trade amendments. I believe it \nis time to move forward on this important legislation and complete this \nbill as early as possible this week.\n  So I ask consent it be in order for me to send to the desk a series \nof cleared amendments that I think are about equally divided on both \nsides. This will be the so-called managers' amendments to H.R. 434. I \nwould say, we would offer these en bloc. There may be other amendments \nthat may need to be offered that are not on this list.\n  I ask this so-called managers' amendment be considered en bloc, \nagreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, when I yield the floor, the bill will be \nopen for amendment. An amendment can be offered at this point. In my \ndiscussion with Senator Daschle, I have indicated if we can get \nagreement on how to proceed on the trade bill and the bankruptcy bill, \non which I think he and I can agree, I will be perfectly willing to \ntake down the tree, too. I want the Record to reflect that. I have \nopened this slot so an amendment is in order. Senator Daschle may want \nto comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first, while I fully recognize the \nability of the Senator from South Carolina to object to this amendment, \nit is certainly his right. I am disappointed. The majority leader has \nmade, in my view, a major step forward in trying to resolve the \nimpasse. I commend him and appreciate the direction he has now \nindicated he is prepared to go in an attempt to bring this matter to a \nclose.\n  The amendment, as the majority leader indicated, is one that includes \namendments on both sides. We expressed last week our concern for two \nthings: First, the array of relevant amendments that may not be \ngermane. The majority leader's amendment includes all relevant \namendments that, in many cases, if not all of them, are not germane. So \nunless we get an agreement to add these relevant amendments, we are \nprecluded from doing so.\n  There are some relevant amendments that still need to be offered that \nare not included in this package. By taking the tree down, those \nrelevant amendments about which we have been very concerned are still \npending and would not be offered if there were objections to offering \nthem or if we were not able to bring them to closure.\n  The second problem we had, of course, was with nonrelevant, \nnongermane amendments. In our discussions and negotiations, we have \nbeen able to accommodate that concern by working out an agreement on \nbankruptcy that I find to be very satisfactory that will allow us to \ntake up nonrelevant, nongermane amendments.\n  I intend to support cloture tomorrow, if that is the only way we can \nmove this forward. I hope our colleagues will do so. It is no longer \nnow a matter of protecting colleagues' rights. We are denied that \nright, not by the majority leader or by the parliamentary situation, \nbut by individual Senators who are within their rights, of course, to \nobject to proceeding on this bill.\n  I want to get this legislation finished. I want to do all I can to \nprotect Senators and their rights to offer amendments. Obviously, we \nwill have to find other ways with which to do that. One way or the \nother, we are going to continue to work to see if we can resolve these \ndifficulties. I appreciate very much the majority leader's effort to \nget us to this point.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, in conclusion, I yield the floor and \nobserve the bill is open for amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I remember the distinguished minority \nleader's plea about protecting the rights of colleagues. Now instead of \nprotecting the rights, we are given our rights on the installment plan. \nIf you get in line for your installment, fine business.\n  Like the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, he has an amendment \nthat the majority leader was just presenting to grant permanent and \nnormal trade relations status to Albania. Isn't that grand? We have \ngone from CBI, to the sub-Sahara, and now we are back to Albania. Next \nthing you know, we will have a Kosovo amendment protecting Members' \nrights to present amendments. You can get in the back room and work \nthis out.\n  Here is another one. The Dodd-Ashcroft-Bond amendment that would \nallow a company with operations in Connecticut and Missouri to obtain \nthe\n\n[[Page S13593]]\n\nrefund on duties paid on imports of nuclear fuel assemblies. Isn't that \nwonderful? They can bring up that amendment. That is germane. I am sure \nit is because down in the Caribbean Basin, they have a lot of nuclear \ndown there, particularly in the sub-Sahara. I have traveled there and I \nhave gone to see all the nuclear plants in Nigeria and Ghana and the \nRepublic of Congo, Brazzaville, the French Congo, and the rest. It is \nwonderful to see all those nuclear powerplants. That is another germane \namendment.\n  Then the distinguished Senator from Montana has a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that it is the Senate's view that Japan should open its \ntelecommunications sector. Now we have gone from CBI, to sub-Sahara, \nand we are all the way around to Japan now. With this deal, you can \nmove things around. It is bargain basement time-- this sort of \nparliamentary Filene's that opened up on the weekend. I did not know \nyou could get all of these things over the weekend.\n  The Roth amendment, the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee would ensure existing reports regarding trade-related matters \nare submitted to the Finance and Ways and Means Committees in addition \nto the committees already designated. We have the Government Operations \nCommittee with jurisdiction in this bill.\n  Clarification regarding rules of origin for silk products, an \namendment requested by the President. Tell him to run for the Senate \nlike his wife.\n  An amendment requested by the President to clarify the rules of \norigin regarding silk products. This clarification is part of a \nsettlement reached in a dispute between the United States and the \nEuropean Union--not sub-Sahara, not CBI, not a Senator, but sooey pig, \neverybody come, just get whatever you want.\n  I am ready to deal because I have worked into a position where I can \ndeal now. That is the way trade is treated in the Senate. It is a very \nsad thing for the main and simple reason we have an extremely important \nmatter not only for textiles but with respect to the general mindset of \nthe National Government.\n  I have heard time and again on the floor of the Senate how the e-\ncommerce and the telecommunications industry, the information society, \nthe semiconductors, software, Microsoft, and all the rest are an engine \nthat is really barreling this economy forward of the United States. I \nwas very interested in reading over the weekend about the impact. I \nrefer in particular to the October 30 edition of the London Economist:\n\n       A study published in June by the Department of Commerce \n     estimates that the digital economy--\n\n  That is what they are talking about--\n\n     the hardware and software of the computer and telecoms \n     industries--amounts to 8% of America's GDP this year. If that \n     sounds rather disappointing, then a second finding--that it \n     has accounted for 35% of total real GDP growth since 1994, \n     which should keep e-fanatics happy.\n       Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed \n     McKelvey of Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of \n     ``technology'' is too wide. They argue that since such things \n     as basic telecom services, television, radio and consumer \n     electronics have been around for ages and they should be \n     excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and \n     communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP. \n     . . .\n       But what, might you ask, about the Internet? Goldman \n     Sachs's estimate includes Internet service providers, such as \n     America Online, and the technology and software used by \n     online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It does not, however, \n     include transactions over the Internet. Should it? E-\n     business is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an \n     Internet consultancy, estimates that this will increase to \n     more than $1.5 trillion in America by 2003. Internet bulls \n     calculate that this would be equivalent to about 13% of \n     GDP. Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such \n     goods and services, whose production owes nothing to the \n     Internet. The value added of Internet sales--i.e., its \n     contribution to GDP--would be much less, probably little \n     more than 1% of GDP.\n\n  But with the contributions, it has a 100-percent impact on this \nparticular body when we would see it with about 1-percent impact \nactually on the economy. But politically it has gotten where you pick \nit up in the weekend news magazines. Time magazine--talking about the \nmove of Fruit of the Loom, with its 17,000 jobs from Kentucky, its \n7,000 jobs from Louisiana, going down to the Cayman Islands, with its \nexecutives contributing over $500,000 to the Presidential race of Gov. \nGeorge W. Bush, and others, and of course of, the Democrats. They know \nhow to give to both sides.\n  But with those contributions, it is not 1 percent of the effect, it \nis 100 percent, and we come around and start changing the rules. When \nthe computer industry came to town--that was American Online, Gateway, \nand all the rest of them--our friend Bill Gates, talked all of us. We \nsat around the table and then rushed out with Y2K legislation. It can't \neven happen until a couple months from now or more, but we changed all \nthe State tort laws. Why? Because of the contributions.\n  I think they have an article with respect to just exactly that in the \nsame magazine. Here in the magazine they have taken judicial notice, as \nwe used to say in the law:\n\n       The rise of America's high-tech industry is not just a \n     windfall for presidential hopefuls. It could also be a \n     godsend for the liberal political tradition.\n\n  But the high-tech industry have come to town now, and they have \ndoubled their effort on all scores.\n\n       The Technology Network (TechNet), a political action group \n     founded two years ago in Silicon Valley, has just set up a \n     second office in Austin, and plans to open more chapters in \n     the future--an attempt to influence policy at both state and \n     local level. Companies in Washington, DC--home of America \n     Online, America's biggest Internet service provider, and a \n     city where the computer industry has just taken over from \n     government as the biggest local employer--have also started \n     their own lobbying group, CapNet.\n\n  Oh, boy it goes on and on and says, wait a minute, it has the largest \ncontribution group in all of Washington all of a sudden. Five years ago \nthey were not even around.\n  That is what it says on page 23 of this October 30 edition of the \nLondon Economist.\n  You ought to read these magazines. Somehow, maybe that is what \ncolleagues can do on the weekends. Because if you read Time magazine, \nif you read the London Economist, if you read the Washington Post, you \ncan find out what influence it can have up here.\n  The devastating impact, of course, is somehow, really, we ought to \nget rid of the textile industry and we ought to get rid of all these \nsmokestack industries and everything else. That is what they said to \nthem in Great Britain years ago: that we will go from a nation of brawn \nto a nation of brains; instead of providing products, we will provide \nservices; instead of creating wealth, we will handle it. Of course, \nthey have gone to second rate. They have the lowest GDP growth and have \ncreated two levels of society.\n  I came over only because of the unanimous consent request. But I have \nthe articles with respect to the U.S. News & World Report, and Mort \nZuckerman 2 weeks ago, that I had inserted into the Record about how we \nare going to two levels of society. Now we see the magazines and the \ntitle:\n\n       The new economy e-exaggeration. The digital economy is much \n     smaller than you think.\n\n  It is really a bummer for the main and simple reason it does not \ncreate jobs, it does not help with the exports. It is not helping with \nthe growth at all. It is small income growth, and imbalanced mix of \njobs, and a poor export prospect. In fact, Eamonn Fingleton, the \ndistinguished author of ``Blindside,'' now has put out his book ``In \nPraise of Hard Industries,'' and compares exactly the hard industries \nand their contributions to the economic security and power of a nation \ncompared with the e-commerce or the information society, what he calls \nthe deindustrialization group.\n\n       The postindustrial jobs, that is what it is, the \n     postindustrial jobs of people of considerably higher than \n     average intelligence. It does create jobs for the top 2 or 3 \n     percent. You have to be a whiz kid to be one of the 22,000 \n     who work for Bill Gates out there at Microsoft in Redmond, \n     WA. I have had the privilege of visiting there and meeting \n     with those folks.\n\n  Right to the point, according to Time magazine, with their stock \noptions, you have 22,000 millionaires. They are well paid. But heavens \nabove, that is not middle America. That is not jobs for everybody. What \nwe are talking about is--of course, the computerization, has assisted--\nbut more than anything else, with robotics we have become a very \nproductive society for not the best IQ laborers in our society but\n\n[[Page S13594]]\n\nfor normal folks such as you and me who can get the job.\n  According to Fingleton and Michael Rothchild, 20 percent of the \nAmerican workforce will be marginalized by the move to an information-\nbased economy. That amounts to a shocking 25 million people. We are not \njust talking about textiles for the CBI and sub-Sahara. We are talking \nabout the basic, formative industry in America really supporting our \nsociety. And with 25 million, they can give you all of these particular \nstatistics about unemployment and otherwise, but I can tell you now, \nthose are retail jobs and part-time jobs for people who have lost their \njobs in textiles--some 31,200 in South Carolina since NAFTA--that they \nhave had to seek out as best they can. That is a loss of some 25 \nmillion jobs. It is a slow-income growth. For example, the ultimate \nauthority on the income growth or the new economy is the Organization \nof European Community Statistics and Figures, the Paris-based \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\n       For those who believe in the superiority of the U.S. \n     postindustrial strategy, the 1998 edition of the yearbook \n     makes distinctly chastening reading. It shows, with a per \n     capita income--about $27,821 a year--the United States trails \n     no fewer than eight other nations.\n\n  Last week when I was talking about the United States going out of \nbusiness, look at this: We trail Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, \nAustria, Switzerland. You can go right on down the list. They are into \nthe manufacturing and the middle class of America. Manufacturing over \nin those other economies have outpaced the United States in interim \ngrowth with 134 percent compared to our 106 percent over the same \nperiod. The wages of America's post-industrial workers are generally \nmuch higher than the American average. Naisbitt jumps to the completely \nfallacious conclusion that a general shift by the United States into \npost-industrialism or the information society will result in a general \nboost in wages. The fallacy here is that Naisbitt assumes that post-\nindustrial wages are higher by dint of the superior economic virtues. \nIn reality, the high wages paid, such as in the software industry, \nmerely reflect the fact that some businesses generally recruit \nexceptionally intelligent and capable workers. But it is a very small \ngroup of people earning this income.\n\n  The leader in income growth, of course, for the entire period from \n1980 to 1998 is South Korea, because it has gone, not for high tech, \nbut for hard goods. Of course, they tried to say this information \nsociety or post-industrial America is really going to create those \njobs, but in truth, it does not. Without those jobs, they have slow \nincome growth and poor export prospects.\n  We have all been talking about the matter of agriculture, which is a \nmagnificent contribution to our exports. We used to export a lot of \nhard goods because we manufactured and produced hard goods. Last week, \nI put into the Record that we have really gone out of business with \nrespect to shoes and textiles and machine tools and steel. We are \nimporting steel. Can you imagine--the United States of America is a net \nsteel importer. That is why we have had a hard time getting a ruling. \nWe have had to take the case all the way from the International Trade \nAdministration to the commission and back over to the White House \ntrying our dead level best to save the No. 1 industry important to our \nnational security. But we don't have anything now to export.\n  When you look to software, you have the language difficulties, the \ncultural difficulties with respect to that software. You have the \nproposition of piracy, and they can steal and reproduce immediately \nthis software overseas. This is the most important thing to emphasize \nbecause they have people smart enough about software outside of the \nUnited States. They assume all of these skills are just here, which is \nabsolutely fallacious. That is why they are trying to change the \nimmigration laws.\n  The software people are coming up here because they want to take all \nthe smart people the world around and bring them into this country.\n  Let's talk about Japan, which is supposed to be going broke. That has \nparticularly nettled me, and I am glad to get the exact figures, \nbecause they have calculated a controlled kind of capitalism through \ntheir Ministry of Finance and their Ministry of International Trade and \nIndustry. They allocate the financing of a particular industry and then \nthey control the local market.\n  We act as if we have led the way for 50 years on liberal trade and \nhave broken down the barriers, as one of the distinguished proponents \nsaid only last Friday. That is why I brought that thick book. Just on \ntextiles alone, barriers persist around the world, specifically in the \nsub-Sahara and the CBI, specifically no reciprocity in this particular \ntreaty--that is the thing we are trying to emphasize. Those things \ncontinue. Japan now is supposed to have gone broke. Let's see how they \ncompare.\n  The living standards and everything have really improved. In fact, \nwith the so-called almost depression that was described in the Wall \nStreet Journal, there was a less than 4 percent unemployment rate, less \nthan 4 percent in the first 8 years of the 1990s up to early 1999. The \nhighest it had been at any stage was 4.4 percent. Japan's total exports \nduring that period rose by a cumulative 53 percent in the first 8 \nyears. That represents real growth of more than 18 percent.\n  So Japan is still coming on as an economic superpower at this \nminute--the little island of 125 million versus the great United States \nwith its 260 million. Japan outproduces the United States of America. \nIf it continues at this particular rate, by the end of next year, 2000, \nit will have a bigger gross domestic product; it will have a larger \neconomy, the largest in the world.\n\n  John Schmitt and Lawrence Mishel pointed out that the per capita \ngross domestic product actually grew faster in Japan than in the \nbooming United States for the first 8 years of 1990. The distinguished \nSenator from New York and the distinguished chairman of our Finance \nCommittee started off the debate on Friday that way: What a wonderful \neconomic boom we have had. We have to sober up. We have to look at the \nreal facts.\n  Actually, our competition is growing much stronger and much faster \nthan we are. Japan's performance has been even better than the \ncomparisons suggest. For a start, the figures measured gross domestic \nproduct, whereas the most appropriate yardstick for comparison is gross \nnational product. The distinction, of course, is that the GNP is a more \ncomprehensive measure. Unlike gross domestic product, it takes in \naccount the debits and credits relating to cross-border investments.\n  The United States has become an increasingly large net importer of \ncapital in recent years. Its GNP is actually now considerably less than \nits GDP. By contrast, Japan has long been a major net exporter of \ncapital and its GNP is considerably larger than its GDP. These are the \nkinds of things that have to be taken into consideration. The yen has \nbeen gaining a net 24 percent between 1989 and 1998 on the dollar.\n  I saw that in the Financial Times last week. I put that article in. \nIf we continue with this deficit in the balance of trade, there is \nbound to be a devaluation. In this regard, if other things are equal, \nthe strength of a nation's currency is the ultimate determinant of the \nsize of its economy, the ultimate symbol of its economic health. In the \n1960s, President John F. Kennedy felt so strongly about this that he \nranked dollar devaluation alongside nuclear war as the two things he \nfeared most.\n  Let us get right to a particularly interesting section here: the \nclearest evidence of the lengths to which Japanese leaders are prepared \nto go to understate their economy. They know how to talk rather than \nrun around beating their breasts like American politicians saying how \ngreat we are, the only remaining superpower. We are going to blow them \noff the map and, of course, if they don't move with the Air Force, we \nare not going to invade, or anything else of that kind. It is almost \nembarrassing, this braggart attitude of United States politicians.\n\n       Perhaps the clearest evidence of the lengths to which \n     Japanese leaders are prepared to go to understate their \n     economy's true strengths is in the way they talk about the \n     Japanese Government's budget. All through the 1990s, they \n     have suggested that the government has been running huge \n     deficits--deficits ostensibly intended to stimulate \n     consumption, particularly consumption\n\n[[Page S13595]]\n\n     of imported goods. So successful have they been in this \n     regard that America's most respected media organizations--\n     organizations of the caliber of the New York Times, the \n     Washington Post, and the Wall Street Journal--have fallen for \n     the story. Thus, year after year, Americans have been treated \n     to a deluge of reports that Japan was supposedly running huge \n     government deficits. In reality, as authoritative figures \n     from OECD demonstrate, Japan was running huge government \n     surpluses. In 1995, for instance, the year when the Wall \n     Street Journal reported that Japan was running a budgetary \n     deficit of 2 percent, the OECD found that the government \n     achieved a budgetary surplus of 3.5 percent. In fact, \n     according to OECD's figures, which were published each year \n     in the widely circulated yearbook OECD In Figures, not only \n     was Japan's surplus one of the strongest of any OECD nation, \n     but Japan was the only major nation that had a budget surplus \n     at all that year. By comparison, the United Kingdom, for \n     instance, ran a deficit of 5.0 percent and America's deficit \n     was 2.2 percent.\n\n  Well, this Senator knows better than anyone how they didn't really \ncontinue to call deficits surpluses. I put that in the Record, and I \nwill put it in the Record again time after time. The Department of \nTreasury's figures showed that they had $127 billion deficit last \nfiscal year. Now, true it is, they had some carry-over amount, which \nconcluded to be about $16 billion. So, at best, it would be $111 \nbillion to $112 billion deficit--not a surplus. That is the debt of \ntreasury at year end, September 30, 1999, for fiscal year 1999--a \ndeficit, not a surplus. But these newspapers pick this up, and we have \nalmost got a cheering section carrying us into bankruptcy. Continuing \nto read, it says:\n\n       So how strong is the Japanese economy really?\n\n  Eamonn Fingleton said, in this book Hard Industries:\n\n       From his vantage point in Tokyo, he has seen little since \n     then to undermine his confidence in his analysis. Certainly, \n     he has been vindicated in his central point, which was that \n     Japan's current account surpluses would continue to soar in \n     the latter half of the 1990s, thus, giving the lie to much \n     talk in the American press in the mid-1990s that Japan's \n     export industries would be disastrously hollowed out by South \n     Korea and other low-wage East Asian nations.\n       . . . the truth is that, at last count, Japan was producing \n     $708 billion in new savings a year--or nearly 60 percent more \n     than America's total of $443 billion.\n\n  They are saving twice as much.\n\n       . . . Japan's net external assets jumped from $294 billion \n     to $891 billion in the first seven years of the 1990s. By \n     contrast, America's net external liabilities ballooned from \n     $71 billion to $831 billion.\n\n  Madam President, the reason we continue to give these figures with \nrespect to this particular bill is that we are in deeper trouble than \nmost Senators realize. They are all talking about whether they are \nhuman, or whether they have on an overcoat, or a jacket, or whatever \nnonsense it is about running the campaign, and who all is for \neducation. Everybody is for education and wants smaller classrooms, or \nbetter math and science programs. We finally got, again--in the U.S. \nNews and World Report, from David Gergen, he got back to my particular \npremise, that what we ought to do is double the teachers' pay. You get \nwhat you pay for. Average pay is $37,000. The average pay in my State \nis down to $31,000. I see the young graduates coming across the stage \nand they say: Senator, I would like to have gone into teaching, but I \ncould not save enough money to send my children to college. Yet, we are \nbumping into each other, saying how we are all for education. We can be \nall for it or all against it. The most you are going to spend is 7 \ncents out of every dollar. It is a local matter. We are Senators and we \nhave to get on to the things the local and State governments do not \ntake care of, and that is trade. That is the economic strength and \nviability and security of the United States, the sustenance of the \nmiddle class. That is why I am talking about these particular figures.\n\n  In the first seven years of the 1990s, America's current account \ndeficits totaled $726 billion, up 79 percent. Thus, despite a massive \ndevaluation of the dollar that supposedly brought a dramatic turnaround \nin American competitiveness that would soon dispose of the deficits for \ngoods.\n  Madam President, for the first 8 years of the 1990s, Japan's current \naccount surpluses totaled $750 billion. That was more than 2\\1/2\\ times \nthe total of $279 billion recorded in the first 8 years of the 1980s. \nSo all during the `90s, we have been reading and telling each other \nthese fairy tales. One, that the information age is upon us and the \ninformation society, and post-industrialism has taken over. The \ncomputer software and so forth is the engine of the economy that is \nbarreling us forward into global competition. False. It is taking us \ndown into very precarious straits. We are relying upon it, and we are \ngoing to eliminate the middle class and the workforce of America. \nOtherwise, we have been told time and time again about how Japan has \nbeen going down and we have been going up. We have had 8 years of the \nboom, with the lowest inflation, the lowest unemployment; but we have \nbeen giving away the store.\n  Mr. President, I wasn't prepared to get into this general item this \nafternoon, but it is salutary that we were able to touch on it so we \ncan talk sense to the American people, because what we have with the \nCBI, the sub-Sahara bill, is an extension of NAFTA to the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative; and so the sub-Sahara. If you are in with or close to \nthe leadership, you can take care of Japan, Albania, and operations in \nConnecticut and Missouri to refund some money on nuclear fuel \nassemblies. You even can get a distilled spirits tax fixed.\n  You watch it.\n  I am going to present an amendment to put side agreements that we had \non NAFTA on this particular bill, and you can bet your boots they will \nstand down there and say it is not germane, having had the audacity to \ncome in with nuclear, Japan, Albania, distilled spirits, and what have \nyou, but not take a formative, relevant, serious concern that we have \non this particular bill.\n  I didn't like NAFTA. But, be that as it may, it had side agreements \non both the environment and labor. I have a side agreement to present \non the environment. I want them to allow us to vote on that side \nagreement for the CBI and the sub-Sahara. I want them to let us vote--\nat least a vote. Don't get here with a technicality after you have \nsneaked in all your Japanese, Albanian, Missouri, and nuclear \namendments here this afternoon when nobody is in town and then come \ntomorrow when the Senate is in full session and say, oh, no, that is \nnot germane; we have rules of rules. They will get to be rules of rules \ntomorrow. One is reciprocity. We have tariffs that are being really \nmerged out and disassembled out because under the Multifiber \nArrangement we had a 10-year blend-out of it and a termination. So now \nwe are entering the last 5 years.\n  But there are still some tariffs that ought to be reconciled with the \nCBI and the tariffs in the sub-Sahara, so we can get some modicum of \nreciprocity when they talk about the trade adjustment assistance. That \ntakes gall to do that. They say it is unconscionable to oppose this \nbill. I will say it takes gall to talk about trade adjustment \nassistance, which is nothing more than welfare payments putting people \nout of work.\n  So they say: Hurry up, we have to get this bill done because we have \n200,000 of those put out of work who have lost their jobs as a result \nof these silly trade agreements--these one-way streets that the Senate \nhas ratified and agreed upon. You wouldn't have to have trade \nadjustment assistance if you just let them trade, if you just let them \nwork, and not put them out of business.\n  But the great merit, according to the senior Senator from New York, \non this particular measure is, back in Kennedy's days, 37 years ago, we \npassed trade adjustment assistance. I don't want that to infer that \nJohn F. Kennedy was against textiles. Thirty-eight years ago, President \nJohn F. Kennedy put in his seven-point textile program and one-price \ncotton looking out for the cotton farmer.\n  So the Senator from Massachusetts, then President, was very aware of \nthe economic viability of these United States of America. He knew what \nwas keeping the country strong and what was necessary to keep the \ncountry strong. So he put that in. He wasn't bragging about having to \nput in trade adjustment assistance. He was just trying to reconcile the \nsuccessful United States at the time with the other trading nations, \ngiving them a chance under the Marshall Plan to rebuild their \neconomies.\n  At that particular time, they said to me, as Governor: Governor, what \ndo\n\n[[Page S13596]]\n\nyou expect these Third World emerging nations to make? Let them make \nthe textiles and the shoes, and we will continue, and we will make the \ncomputers and the airplanes. My problem now, in November 1999, is those \ncountries are making 86 percent of the shoes worn on the floor of the \nSenate. I can see them now. These countries also are making two-thirds \nof the clothing that I see, looking at in this Chamber, imported into \nthe United States.\n  Look at the contracts made by USAir and all of the other airlines \nconcerning Airbus. They are making the planes and dumping them here in \nthe United States. They are making the computers and dumping them in \nthe United States. The Japanese have taken over the computer industry, \nin spite of Sematech, in spite of Microsoft, in spite of Intel.\n  We have to be not pessimists nor optimists but realists.\n  Here on the floor of the Senate is a good moment to really bring \neverything into focus because the leadership said we are now going to \nvote cloture tomorrow and the minority leader is not going to ask them \nto vote against it. That is exactly how NAFTA was passed.\n  I will never forget the New York Times article. I wish I had it. But \nI will try to get it and put it in the Record tomorrow. But in NAFTA, \nthe President then just bought off the sufficient votes to pass NAFTA. \nI will never forget. He gave a cultural exchange to my friend, Jake \nPickle of Texas. He gave two C-17s to another Texas fellow. He gave \nanother particular freebie, and they went down with the 26 giveaways to \npick up the 26 votes.\n  Here on this solemn afternoon, we have the same deal going. They are \nbuying off the votes. They are getting it on nuclear fuel assemblies. \nWe are getting it on the Japanese telecommunications. We are getting it \non Ways and Means and Finance Committee rules. We are getting it on \nsilk products of the United States and the European Union. We are \ngetting it on Albania. We just go right down--on Kyrgyzstan. What in \nthe world? Kyrgyzstan. I don't know about that. Now we are in Asia \nMinor. I am almost at Bible school. Asia Minor. This procedure has \ngotten to be a disgrace. They buy enough votes and they win. They have \n11 of them listed here on the so-called managers' amendment. So they \nput them all in there and take care of those 11 votes so they will know \nthat they will get cloture.\n  It is wonderful to serve in this body.\n  But it is better to be heard because it is important that we be \nheard. I can tell you here and now, when the ATMI wakes up, the \nAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute, and they put in the sub-\nSahara along with the CBI, I want to see them at that party. They are \ngoing to hold a victory party because they supported this particular \nbill. That is going to happen. That is exactly what is going to occur. \nYou can see the fix is on. They are going to roll over this particular \nSenator and get rid of what little textile industry we have left.\n  There will be a few of the real competitors; the Roger Millikens will \nlast. They put money in, and they know how to run an industry and they \nwill survive. But generally speaking, they can't survive. The reason \nthey can't survive is on account of us. We Democrats, we Republicans, \nwe Senators and Congressmen have many requirements called the American \nhigh standard of light. That standard calls for Social Security, \nMedicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, safe working \nplace, safe machinery, clean air, clean water, all of these things, \nlabor rights, and otherwise. And it is one of these things in the \nglobal competition that is not required. On the other hand, they have \nthe comparative advantage of their governmental policies.\n  I wish Ricardo were here because he didn't think finance could be \ntransferred so easily, that the bankers would all stay close to their \nhome folks and depositors. Now you can transfer it on satellite by \ncomputer, in a flash, and you can get capital anywhere. You can send on \na computer chip the technology and save 20 percent of your labor costs \nby moving to low-wage offshore countries. So a company in the United \nStates with $500 million in sales can save 20 percent, or $100 million, \nby keeping its main office and its sales force here in the United \nStates, send its manufacturing to a Third World, low-wage country, and \nmake $100 million, or they can continue to work their own people and go \nbroke because of competition.\n  That is why on last week I inserted part of an important book in the \nRecord. I will get that book again and show you that all of them are \nleaving here in the United States--Dan River, the corn mills, \nBurlington, all of them are going down. It is not the sewing operations \nalone, it is fabric plants, and, of course, the Japanese, the Koreans, \nand, most of all, the Chinese, the People's Republic of China.\n  They are whining on the other side of the aisle about most favored \nnation for China. Look at a most-favored-nation Chinese vote and anyone \nwill see a vote for this bill.\n  China, we have sub-Sahara; put up the front companies and put up the \nproduction of the People's Republic of China through the sub-Sahara.\n  The arrangement that those folks relied on some 5 years ago; they \nbetter batten down the hatches because I don't know how they will get \nthe money out of the machinery and survive with this particular \nmeasure. It is drastic. It is unconscionable. They say we are \nunconscionable; I say they are unconscionable.\n  We can see how the majorities are fixed. We have not had any real \ndebate on the floor of the Senate on trade as a matter of national \npolicy or otherwise. They say the President wants this; the minority \nleader says it is his duty to give the President what he wants. The \nother side of the aisle has been wanting to do away with all kinds of \ntrade agreements and market forces, and Adam Smith has long since gone \nin this global competition. It ought to depend on market forces. They \ndepend on protection. Of course, so does the other side of the aisle \nwhen it comes to intellectual property, movies, books, copyrighting, \nwhen it comes to protecting the talents of the individual producers, \nthe authors, writers, singers, and performers. Fine, let's have \nprotection for them. But for those who work by the sweat of their brow, \nthat is protectionism and a terrible thing. We are isolationist and we \nare unconscionable.\n  Maybe they will have another consent agreement similar to this one, \nand I will have another opportunity to talk. I appreciate the \nindulgence of my colleagues this afternoon.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am proud to stand on the floor of the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. I've been proud every time over the \npast twenty years that I have had this privilege. I can think of no \ngreater honor than to discuss with my Senate colleagues issues of vital \nimportance to our nation.\n  So I am deeply distressed that I have not yet had an opportunity to \ndiscuss important trade issues. Last week, the majority leader chose to \ncut off consideration of amendments to the Africa bill, the only trade \nbill which will reach the floor of this honorable body. That bill \nincluded amendments which had bipartisan support. Because of this \nbizarre process, we can't even act on Senator Harkin's amendment to \ncombat child labor, which has widespread support.\n  I had filed two amendments to the bill, both of them trade-related. \nBoth of them issues which are extremely important to Americans. I am \nvery disappointed that we were locked out of discussing them. However, \nwith the new filing of cloture, I hope that we may have the chance to \ntalk about these important matters.\n  One of the amendments allowed for tariff cuts on environmental goods \nas part of a global agreement in the WTO. The measure has the support \nof both business and environmental groups. This is a rare instance \nwhere both sides of the trade-environment debate agree on something. \nIt's a shame that the Senate cannot move forward on something so \nsensible.\n  The second amendment concerned agricultural subsidies. American \nfarmers are the most productive in the world. But they're being frozen \nout of foreign markets by European and Japanese subsidies. I filed an \namendment that would fight back by funding our Export Enhancement \nProgram.\n  This amendment required the Secretary of Agriculture to target at \nleast two billion dollars in Export Enhancement Program funds into the \nEU's\n\n[[Page S13597]]\n\nmost sensitive markets if they fail to eliminate their export subsidies \nby 2003. It's time to start fighting fire with fire. This ``GATT \ntrigger'' should provide leverage in the next round of the WTO in \nreducing grossly distorted barriers to agricultural trade.\n  I voted against cloture last week because I objected to the way the \nmajority leader handled the bill. I was denied the ability to do what \nthe people of Montana sent me here to do. But I support the bill \nitself. I support each of its elements--the Caribbean Basin Initiative, \nthe Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and the renewal of both Trade \nAdjustment Assistance and the Generalized System of Preferences.\n  I have long supported efforts to extend additional tariffs \npreferences to the Caribbean Basin. But with conditions. The benefits \nshould be conditioned on the beneficiary countries' trade policies, \ntheir participation and cooperation in the Free Trade Area of the \nAmericas (``FTAA'') initiative, and other factors. This trade bill is \nsubstantially similar to the version I supported in the 105th Congress \nwith some reservation.\n  I see a flaw in the bill, however, and would like to work to repair \nit. The bill suggests criteria the President can use when deciding \nwhether to grant CBI benefits. It is a long list of about a dozen \nitems. Criteria like Intellectual Property Rights. Investment \nprotections. Counter-narcotics. Each one is important. The bill should \nmake these criteria mandatory.\n  In particular, I believe that the President should be required to \ncertify that CBI beneficiaries respect worker rights, both as a matter \nof law and in practice. We can't maintain domestic support for open \ntrade here at home unless our programs take core labor standards into \naccount.\n  We want to help our Caribbean neighbors compete effectively in the \nU.S. market. But we don't want them to compete with U.S. firms by \ndenying their own citizens fundamental worker rights.\n  It only seems reasonable that as we help the economic development of \nthese nations, we also help them enforce the laws already on their \nbooks. The majority of these countries already have the power and only \nneed the will to ensure that their citizens see the benefits of \nenhanced trade--decent wages, decent hours and a decent life.\n  Overall, I believe that CBI parity is the right thing to do--if it \ndoes what it is intended to do. That is lift the people of the \nhurricane devastated countries out of poverty and ensure them a better \nway of life.\n  I also believe that the U.S. must lead by example. Sensitively to \nlabor and environment must play a role in our trade decisions and \nactions around the world.\n  It's tragic that partisan politics keeps the United States Senate \nfrom taking these actions.\n  I have the same concerns about labor in terms of the African Growth \nand Opportunity portion of the bill. But I supported the Chairman's \nmark, which included a provision requiring U.S. fabric for apparel \nproducts produced in eligible sub-Saharan African countries.\n  Developing markets is in the best interest of us all. And the trade \nbill would help Africa move in that direction. But this bill is about \nmore than trade. It is about hope.\n  It is about bringing the struggling nations of Sub-Saharan Africa \ninto our democratic system. It is about establishing stability and a \nframework wherein the citizens of these nations can enjoy the fruits of \nprosperity. It is about building a bridge between the United States and \nAfrica that will be a model for all nations.\n  The third part of the bill renews the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram. This program is vital to help our workers adjust to the new \nforces of globalization.\n  I have seen the effects of this program in Montana. We have been well \nserved by the efforts of Gary Kuhar, Director of the Northwest TAA \nCenter in Seattle, Washington.\n  Impact on Montana--Montana currently has six firms affected by TAA \nfunding, including:\n  Montana Moose--Christmas ornament operation,\n  Ranchland--a cattle operation,\n  Mountain Woods--furniture designer,\n  Western States--pellet operation,\n  Sun Mountain Sports--manufacturer of golf bags and other ripstops,\n  Burt and Burt--wind chimes, and\n  Kahlund Enterprises--picture frames producer.\n  In fact, the renewal of Trade Adjustment Assistance translates to 330 \nMontana employees impacted and approximately $44 million in gross \nannual sales preserved.\n  This legislation is long overdue. While we delay, certified firms \nanxiously await funding. This is fundamentally unfair--especially for \nfirms fighting import competition that is beyond their control.\n  They cannot afford to wait while TAA is caught up in the annual \nbattle for funding as the ``perennial bargaining chip'' for other trade \nproposals. That's just ineffective government. It's time to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Finally, let me say a word about GSP renewal. This is the fourth part \nof the trade bill. This is also a question of effective government. \nOver the years, the program has lapsed periodically when renewal \nlegislation was delayed. The latest lapse occurred on June 30. Four \nmonths later, we still haven't acted on its renewal.\n  Who gets hurt? Not just foreign companies. A lot of American firms \nget hurt. That includes both American importers and exporters. A lot of \nthe American firms produce abroad and then export to the United States. \nMuch of this is internal company trade. That's the reality of today's \nglobal economy.\n  When GSP lapses, these companies are suddenly required to deposit \nimport duties into an account. Customs holds the money until renewal \nlegislation is signed. Eventually the companies get their money back. \nBut they don't know how long renewal legislation will take. So they \ndon't how much they'll have to set aside, or how long the money will it \nbe in escrow.\n  How can we expect businesses to operate efficiently under such \nconditions? These cycles of GSP lapsing and then being renewed \nrepresent government at its worst. We have a responsibility to provide \nbusiness and consumers with a consistent, predictable set of rules. We \nneed to fix this GSP lapse as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, a lot of effort, a lot of thought, a lot of time has \ngone into this bill. Much time has also gone into formulating \namendments. It was a great disappointment to see this effort unravel \nover partisan politics. We may have a second chance this week. Let's \nnot squander the opportunity. We can and should work together to pass \nthis bill.\n  We were elected to his body to pass legislation not to bicker. Let's \ndo what the people sent us here to do.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask that we return to morning business \nfor a period of 30 minutes for remarks on the Labor-HHS conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13597-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13597-S13601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     D.C./LABOR-HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, the business before the Senate will soon \nbe the conference report on Labor Department and Health and Human \nServices and Education appropriations bill. We are now considering \nvarious trade measures. Since we will be taking up the D.C./Labor-HHS \nconference report tomorrow, I appreciate the Presiding Officer's \ngenerosity in allowing me to discuss this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I think it is fair to describe that one night within the last few \nweeks, through back-door negotiations, various members of the Senate \nand House of Representatives Appropriations Committees crafted the \nconference reports that we have before us today. The end result was \nthat a very large elephant, weighing $313.6 billion, The Labor/HHS \nconference report, being placed upon the back of a relatively small and \nnot particularly compliant ant weighing $429 million, the District of \nColumbia's Appropriations bill.\n  Out of that marriage of elephant and ant, we now have before the \nSenate the\n\n[[Page S13598]]\n\nconference report on the District of Columbia with the enormous \naddition of a $313 billion of Labor-HHS ``rider''.\n  Unfortunately, when these bizarre marriages occur, the public \ninterest is not necessarily served. This parliamentary tactic has \nstolen from Members of the Senate the right to offer motions \ninstructing the conferees on how we believe they should proceed in \nconference. We have also lost the right to challenge the existence of \nauthorizing legislation on an appropriations bill during the process of \nnegotiation between the two Houses. There will be no opportunity for \nCongress or the President to independently consider the Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations bill. While one is an \nelephant and one is an ant, they are both important and deserve \nseparate and distinct consideration.\n  There is not the opportunity to protest the inclusion of items which \nwere not included in either the Senate or the House bill, or were so \naltered as to be unrecognizable. This bill is purely the creation of \nthat late-night negotiation. This lack of democracy has allowed the \nwill of a small minority to triumph on a variety of provisions of great \nimportance. I will take the opportunity this afternoon to focus on only \ntwo of the issues that are a part of this marriage of elephant and ant: \nFirst, the proposal to terminate competitive bidding for Medicare's \npayment of health maintenance organizations' reimbursement; and, \nsecond, preventing the Congress from fully funding the Social Service \nBlock Grant Program.\n\n  Let me begin the discussion with the absconding of funds from two \ncongressionally authorized competitive pricing demonstrations. This \ntakes us back 2 years to 1997 during the consideration of the Balanced \nBudget Act. Both Houses of Congress voted to create demonstration \nprojects based upon community participation in an attempt to learn more \nabout how HMOs, which provided services to Medicare beneficiaries, \ncould be priced; that is, how the amount of that reimbursement from the \nFederal Government could be determined by competitive bidding.\n  In order to understand what this issue is about, I am afraid some \ndiscussion of how HMOs currently are priced when they provide services \nfor a Medicare beneficiary is required. In a simplified form, the way \nin which an HMO receives reimbursement when it provides funds to a \nMedicare beneficiary is a function of how much is paid within that \ncounty for fee-for-service payments. While there are some modifications \nto this overly broad statement, basically if, let us say, in a \nparticular county the average payment for a fee-for-service Medicare \npatient is $5,000, then the HMO is reimbursed at, more or less, 95 \npercent of that level, or $4,500. There is some blending of the \nnational fee-for-service rate and the local fee-for-service rate, but \nas of today, and in the past and in the immediate future, the \ndescription I have given is essentially an accurate representation.\n  What has been the result of this reliance on a percentage of fee-for-\nservice within a narrow, local area on the amount that HMOs are \nreimbursed? It has resulted the fact that in many areas of your State \nand mine, where fee-for-service charges are relatively low--that is \nparticularly true in rural areas--there are no HMOs. Why? Because HMOs \ncannot economically justify operating with the reimbursement levels \nthey would get based on 95 percent of those relatively low fees for \nservice.\n  On the other hand, in some areas which have very high fees for \nservice--for instance, an area that has a large tertiary hospital, \nparticularly one associated with a medical school where costs tend to \nbe very high because of the nature of the service they provide--that \ncommunity will have a high fee-for-service rate. Therefore, 95 percent \nof that high level will result in high reimbursement levels for HMOs. \nSo, you have not just one HMO, but typically many HMOs that want to \ncompete to get that fixed-formula-based percentage of fee-for-service \nreimbursement.\n  The purpose of the 1997 action of the Congress was to try a different \nmodel; to not rely on this central planning use of fee-for-service but \nrather go out and test the marketplace. What will the market in a rural \narea say is called for to engage managed care as an option for Medicare \nbeneficiaries? What is the appropriate level of HMO reimbursement in a \nlarge urban area with high fee-for-service costs? That was the purpose \nof this competitive bidding demonstration project.\n  The Balanced Budget Act, in conjunction with the Health Care \nFinancing Agency, set up a structure which included area advisory \ncommittees. These committees consisted of health plans, providers, and \nbeneficiary representatives. It was decided the two communities in \nwhich demonstrations would take place were Kansas City and Phoenix. The \nfunction of the area advisory committees was to recommend how to best \nimplement the competitive pricing demonstrations in these two \ncommunities.\n  Unfortunately, in the bill that will be before us tomorrow, the bill \nthat the conference has reported as the funding for Departments of \nLabor, HHS, and the District of Columbia, all funding for these two \ndemonstrations in Kansas City and Phoenix has been removed, removed by \nthose who do not want to find out if there is a means to use the \ncompetitiveness of the marketplace to arrive at what should be the \nappropriate reimbursement level for health maintenance organizations.\n\n  Experience has shown us in other areas of the Medicare system that \nthere is the potential for preserving high levels of quality and saving \nmoney by using the dynamism of the marketplace as determined by \ncompetitive bidding. Let me use an example from my own State. One of \nthe other provisions in that 1997 Balanced Budget Act was to set up \ncompetitive bidding on the Part B, or hospital component of Medicare, \nas it related to a variety of items, including durable medical \nequipment. The demonstration for durable medical equipment was settled \nto be in Lakeland, FL.\n  In its first year, this project has substantially reduced the amount \nMedicare pays for the five products that were included in the \ndemonstration, and in that one community has saved Medicare \napproximately $1 million.\n  What are the areas that are being competitively bid? Let me say that \nthese products, durable medical equipment, for most of America today \nare the subject of a price list. It would be as if you suddenly needed, \nlet's say, a wheelchair--you had broken your leg and you had to have a \nwheelchair for temporary use--and the way you would pay for that \nwheelchair, or decide what was the appropriate rental for the \nwheelchair, was to have Government give you a price list and say this \nis what thou shalt pay to purchase or lease that wheelchair. That is \nexactly what Medicare does today for a list of hundreds of durable \nmedical equipment items. So we are going to find out, was there a \ndifferent way to establish what those prices should be? Was there a \nmeans by which we could use the marketplace to set the price? That was \nthe purpose of the demonstration in Lakeland, FL.\n  What results? Competitive pricing has reduced the price of oxygen \nsupplies and equipment by 17.5 percent over what was on that price \nlist, for exactly the same oxygen supplies and equipment. Competitive \nbidding for hospital beds and ancillary hospital items has been reduced \nby 29.8 percent by competitive bidding as opposed to the price list. \nFor enteral nutrition, where a person is taking his or her nutrition \nthrough intravenous means rather than more normal oral means, the price \nof that has been reduced by 29.2 percent as a result of competition, \nrather than using the price list. Surgical dressings have been reduced \nby 12.9 percent, and urological supplies by 20 percent. All of these \nsavings were accomplished by the use of competitive bidding as opposed \nto relying on almost a Soviet system of a prescribed price list.\n  It is estimated, if this Lakeland demonstration were to be applied on \na nationwide basis and applied to a broader range of items that are \njust as susceptible to competitive bidding as the five which were \nselected for the demonstration in Lakeland, we could save the Medicare \nprograms over $100 million a year. The Medicare program is a big \nprogram, but even for that big program, even for the Federal \nGovernment, saving $100 million a year is an important achievement.\n  It is interesting that, while we are about to take a vote on whether \nwe\n\n[[Page S13599]]\n\nshould terminate even a demonstration on competitive bidding to \nestablish the appropriate price for HMO reimbursement, we are applying \ncompetitive bidding in other areas. We are using the competitive \nmarketplace, rather than centralized planning, to determine what is a \nfair price.\n  For example: In 1998, Congress reformed the means by which national \nparks reimbursed their concessionaires. To put it more accurately, the \nconcessionaires paid for the privilege of operating within one of our \nnational parks. Previously, prior to 1998, concessionaires had a \npreferential right of renewal allowing them to match any other offers, \nthus eliminating competition.\n  You can imagine if, Madam President, there were a firm which had a \nconcession in a national park in your beautiful State of Maine and they \nknew that in order to keep that concession, all they had to do was \nmatch any other competitor who would deign to try to take the \nconcession. That would not encourage very many people to go to the \neffort of offering a competitive bid because they knew all the \nincumbent concessionaire had to do was just match their best price and \nthey would continue to have the concession.\n  In 1998, we changed the system. We said we would go to an open, \ncompetitive bidding process and let those who could offer the highest \nquality and the best return to the park system be the concessionaires.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of visiting Bandelier National \nMonument in New Mexico. It exemplified the concession's contract law's \npositive effect on the national parks system. The new concessionaire \nimproved the quality of products and provided such things as \nhandicapped access to facilities that had not been available \npreviously.\n  We can anticipate that the rates of return to the Government at \nBandelier and other national parks will increase because we have a good \nexample at Yosemite National Park. At Yosemite, the application of \ncompetitive bidding resulted in almost a 15-percent increase in the \nrate of return to the Government of the lease of their various \nconcession facilities.\n  I commend Senator Craig Thomas, our colleague, who was the leader in \nassuring this movement towards a fair price and quality goods and \nservices for the users of our national parks. Unfortunately, the \nzeroing out of funds for competitive bidding demonstrations in Phoenix \nand Kansas City, as this conference report on the Labor-HHS/District of \nColumbia appropriations will do--it ensures that we will never know if \nwe can achieve similar savings in the Medicare+Choice Program; that is, \nwe can never know there will be a better, fairer way of reimbursing \nhealth maintenance organizations, which provide services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries than what we are getting today through this percentage of \nfee-for-service formula.\n  Here is a riddle for the Senate to answer: Why would the \nappropriators eliminate funding for a program that saves money without \nharming quality, that gives us the opportunity to learn if there is a \nfree-enterprise approach to reimbursing HMOs as opposed to a socialist \napproach?\n  Madam President, it does not take a Sherlock Holmes to solve this \nmystery.\n  Chapter 1 of our mystery: It is July, 1999. The United States spends \na full week debating managed care reform. The end result of this debate \nis vapid, weak legislation that impacts less than one-third of all \nAmericans whose health care is covered by HMOs. It has weak standards \non issues such as emergency room, access to specialists, a woman's \nright to use an OB/GYN as a primary physician, the right to continue to \nuse a doctor if an HMO changes its plan. The legislation the Senate \npassed earlier this summer also had very limited enforcement and no \nright to sue.\n  It is interesting that the House of Representatives has written a \ndifferent chapter with a much stronger and more effective bill of \npatients' rights when they are members of a health maintenance \norganization.\n  We have a second chapter in our book. The Senate is about to \neliminate two demonstration projects that will allow us learn whether \nthe marketplace might be an appropriate determinant of how Medicare \nHMOs should be reimbursed. Chapter 2 continues with the Senate Finance \nCommittee designing a bill to give funds back to providers who have \nmade the case they have been negatively, excessively impacted by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. It is the same Balanced Budget Act that \nweaves its way through this whole volume.\n\n  What does the Senate Finance Committee decide to do? Nearly one-third \nof the money that will be provided back to physicians, hospitals, home \nhealth care agencies, skilled nursing facilities --a whole variety of \nmedical providers--nearly one-third of the total money goes to the \nhealth maintenance organizations that provide services under the \nMedicare+Choice Program.\n  The irony is that only about 15 percent of the beneficiaries of \nMedicare receive their health care through a health maintenance \norganization. The remaining 85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries get \ntheir Medicare through the traditional fee-for-service system; that is, \nthey make an unrestrained choice as to what doctor they want to see and \nthen receive the services of that physician, and they, along with \nMedicare, then reimburse that physician.\n  The 85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who use fee for service get \nonly two-thirds of the additional payback money. Clearly, there is \nsomething fishy about the way these critical funds, intended to allow \nfor the providers of health care to Medicare beneficiaries avoid \ndraconian cuts in their service levels, were divided. Clearly, there is \nsomething amiss when one-third of the money in the Balanced Budget Act \n``add back'' measure goes to one-sixth of the Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Adding to this peculiar situation is the Congressional Budget \nOffice's estimate that up until the end of this decade, the number of \nMedicare beneficiaries receiving their reimbursement through an HMO \nwill still be less than the one-third of the total Medicare population. \nYet, one-third of the money in the Balanced Budget Act ``add back'' \nbill is allocated to Medicare HMOs.\n  Chapter 3: A Republican Member of the House of Representatives \nintroduces a bill to give doctors the right to collectively bargain \nwith HMOs. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee brings this bill up \nbefore his committee for consideration. What happens? Let me read from \nthe Daily Monitor of Wednesday, October 27. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record immediately after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Under the headline ``GOP Leaders Order Hyde To Kill Bill \nOn Doctor Bargaining'':\n\n       Managed care lobby pushed to halt measure allowing doctors \n     to negotiate with health plans.\n       After an intense lobbying campaign by managed care plans, \n     House GOP leaders have killed for this year--at least--a bill \n     that would allow doctors to bargain collectively with health \n     plans.\n       The bill (H.R. 1304), sponsored by Tom Campbell, R-Calif., \n     had been scheduled for a markup in the House Judiciary \n     Committee Tuesday. But Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., on \n     Monday asked committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., to \n     yank it.\n       ``It won't be dealt with this year,'' Hyde said. ``The \n     leadership decided that they were involved with other health \n     care issues and this was the. . .one that broke the camel's \n     back. It's extra weight on a complicated issue. They felt it \n     was another area of focus they don't need right now.''\n       On Oct. 7, after months of heated negotiations and debate, \n     the House passed a broad patients' rights measure (H.R. 2723, \n     later H.R. 2990) after voting down a much narrower package \n     backed by Hastert. The issue has long been a thorn in the \n     side of the GOP leadership, which favors allowing the \n     marketplace--rather than government--to regulate managed \n     care.\n       The Campbell bill would for the first time allow \n     independent doctors who contract with health plans to bargain \n     collectively on everything from fees to who determines the \n     treatment a patient receives. Health insurance groups \n     strongly oppose the bill, arguing that doctors would be able \n     to fix prices and drive up health insurance premiums. \n     Doctors, led by the American Medical Association, backed the \n     measure. They say health plans are beginning to monopolize \n     the patient market, and that doctors often have no choice but \n     to sign restrictive contracts in order to stay in business.\n       Hyde said that, along with Hastert, rank-and-file members \n     who had been contacted by the health insurance industry asked \n     him to pull the bill.\n\n[[Page S13600]]\n\n       The chairman said he still wants to pursue the issue in the \n     future but could not say if he would ever mark up the \n     Campbell bill. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I'm interested in \n     doing something with the difficult relationship between \n     doctors, HMOs and insurers. I don't think the problem will go \n     away, nor will our responsibility [to address it].''\n\n  We have had the HMO industry delude, almost to total lack of \neffectiveness, the Patients' Bill of Rights in the Senate. We have had \nthe industry increase its reimbursement at twice the rate that fee-for-\nservice medicine is having its reimbursement increased as a part of the \nBalanced Budget Act ``add-backs'' legislation that we will soon be \nconsidering. We have had the House kill a bill to allow doctors to \ncollectively bargain when they negotiate with HMOs. And now, after the \nHMOs have said what they want is to have the marketplace, not \nGovernment, run their business, they seem to have said they do not want \nto participate in the competitive bidding process to determine their \nlevels of reimbursement. It appears that they would rather rely on the \nsocialist-based theory of percentage of fee-for-service cost.\n  The managed care industry has successfully used its influence to move \nforward one of its key policy objectives: To strengthen Medicare \nmanaged care at the expense of Medicare fee for service. You might \nthink that my statement is extreme, but I assure you it is accurate.\n  The policy objective is very clear. Using the words of the former \nSpeaker of the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich, which he used to describe \nhis view of Medicare reform, I quote from an Associated Press article \nof July 30, 1996, in a speech given to the Health Insurance Association \nof America. This is what the Speaker said:\n\n       We don't get rid of it [Medicare] in round one because we \n     don't think that's politically smart, and we don't think \n     that's the right way to go through a transition. But we \n     believe it [traditional Medicare] is going to wither on the \n     vine.\n\n  ``Wither on the vine.''\n  If you had to have a series of events that all had as their common \nobjective diverting energy, resources, and attention away from the \nprogram where 85 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries receive their \nhealth care services towards the program where 15 percent receive their \nhealth care services--and nobody is estimating that within the next 10 \nyears any more than 30 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries will \nreceive their health care through HMOs--you couldn't have had a better \nstrategy than the chapters that we have either written or are in the \nprocess of writing in the Congress in 1999.\n  On behalf of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries in America today, \nand the millions more who will rely on the program tomorrow, I pledge \nto make certain that when Congress embarks upon true Medicare reform it \nwill be focused on what is best for all beneficiaries, both fee-for-\nservice and Medicare+ Choice participants alike.\n  We must reverse the course of this Congress. This Congress has \nshielded HMOs from patient protections, balanced negotiations with \nphysicians, and competition in pricing. This Congress has rewarded HMOs \nwith one-third of the additional money for one-sixth of the Medicare \nbeneficiaries. And this Congress has refused to enhance the fee-for-\nservice programs for 85 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries.\n  This Congress can begin to reverse this record by sustaining the \nPresident's veto of the outrage which describes itself as the Labor-\nHHS/District of Columbia appropriations bill. I am confident that the \nPresident will reject this legislation. We will have our next \nopportunity when we sustain his veto.\n  Madam President, having talked about just one of the outrages in this \nbill, let me turn to a second. That is the funding of the social \nservices block grant.\n  On September 30, by a 57-39 vote, the Senate placed its strong \nbipartisan support behind the continued funding of the Social Services \nBlock Grant Program at its authorized level of $2.38 billion.\n  The Social Services Block Grant allocates funds to States, enabling \nthem to provide services to vulnerable, low-income children and \nelderly, disabled people. The Social Services Block Grant is a \nmandatory program established under Title XX of the Social Security \nAct.\n  The purpose of Title XX is to intervene with vulnerable populations \nbefore they reach the point of disability or other condition that might \nmake them eligible for a Social Security entitlement program.\n  In 1996, the Senate Finance Committee joined the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, and then the full Chambers, in promising that this program \nof social services block grants would be funded at the authorized level \nof $2.38 billion for the fiscal year 2000. In fact, we made a \ncommitment to the States that the social services block grant would be \nguaranteed at the $2.38 billion annual level until welfare reform was \nfully completed in the year 2002.\n  When this commitment was recommended to be breached by the Senate \nversion of the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, on September 30, the \nSenate stood up, and by that vote of 57-39 voted to restore full \nfunding to comply with our commitment to our constituents and to the \nStates.\n  Once again, the appropriators have nullified our vote. They have \nvoided our promise to the States. In the conference report that will be \nbefore us, the Labor-HHS/District of Columbia appropriations bill, the \nSocial Services Block Grant Program will be recommended for funding at \n$1.7 billion--over a half billion dollars below what is our authorized \nlevel, what is our commitment to the States. This figure is below what \nwas approved by the Senate. This figure is also below the $1.9 billion \nthat the House Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee approved for this program.\n  The raiding of the Title XX program should serve as an example of \nwhat can happen when a program is block granted. Our experience with \nthe social services block grant should serve as a red flag as we \nstructure other social services funding.\n  Those, for instance, who might succumb to the siren call of block \ngrants for education should take note. A Federal program which serves a \nlargely politically voiceless group of Americans, as Hubert Humphrey \ndescribed, those who live in the dawn of life, our children, those who \nlive in the twilight of life, our elderly, and those who live in the \nshadows of life, the disabled, these are the Americans who will be at \nrisk, just as they are at risk today with the slashing of funding of \nthe social services block grant. They will be at risk if we move \ntowards the same pattern of funding for important national programs \nsuch as education. Because they will not have the HMOs' lobbyists, they \nwill not have the PACs to represent their interests, to ensure they get \ntheir share when the Federal largess is divided, they are likely to get \nthe scraps that are left over.\n  I urge the President of the United States to veto this legislative \nelephant which is squashing the ant. I urge that he veto the \nlegislation that would fund the Departments of Labor and HHS, and the \nDistrict of Columbia because we, the Congress, can do better. We need \nto be given the opportunity and the challenge to do so.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the CQ Daily Monitor, Oct. 27, 1999]\n\n        GOP Leaders Order Hyde To Kill Bill on Doctor Bargaining\n\n                          (By Karen Foerstel)\n\n       After an intense lobbying campaign by managed care plans, \n     House GOP leaders have killed for the year--at least--a bill \n     that would allow doctors to bargain collectively with health \n     plans.\n       The bill (HR 1304), sponsored by Tom Campbell, R-Calif., \n     had been scheduled for a markup in the House Judiciary \n     Committee Tuesday.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who touched the \nlives of each person he came into contact with throughout his teaching \nand coaching career. Coach Ralph Tasker was a respected person, and a \nperfect gentleman. He always looked for the good in people and had that \nrare ability to bring out the best in others.\n  Born and raised in Moundsville, West Virginia, Coach Tasker took up \nbasketball when he was five years old. This was his common bond with \nmost of his friends. In Moundsville, nearly everyone worked in coal \nmines except for Tasker's parents, who owned and operated a grocery \nstore. He played basketball in high school, earning all-state honors in \nhis junior and senior campaigns. From there he played four years at \nAlderson-Broaddus College, and this is where he met his wife, Margaret \nElizabeth Marple. The two were married and devoted to each other for \nnearly fifty years until Margaret passed away in 1991.\n  Tasker began his coaching career straight out of college at Sulphur \nSprings High School in Sulphur Springs, Ohio, in 1941. He spent less \nthan a year at Sulphur Springs, but even then made an impact on his \nstudents and players. Tasker went beyond the role of coach and teacher, \nas he was always a friend to his students and players. From his first \nyear in coaching, his students considered Coach Tasker a father figure. \nThose who knew Coach Tasker describe him as dedicated, sincere, and \nloyal to his players and community.\n  After leaving Sulphur Springs, Coach Tasker served our country for \nthree years in the U.S. Air Corps. He then accepted another coaching \nposition in New Mexico at Lovington High School. After three years and \none state championship with Lovington, Coach Tasker moved twenty miles \nsouth to Hobbs High School, where he would remain for the rest of his \ncoaching career. Forty-nine years, eleven state championships, two \nperfect seasons, and two National High School Coach of the Year awards \nlater, Coach Tasker decided to retire. In fifty-three years of \ncoaching, Tasker had a remarkable collection of achievements. He \nfinished with 1,122 wins and 291 losses, which ranks him as the third \nplace coach in total number of wins in high school boys' basketball \nhistory. Among many honors, he was elected to four different halls of \nfame, won twelve state championships, and in 1991 was named the \nNational Athletic Coach of the Year in the prestigious Walt Disney \nNational Teacher Awards Program.\n  Coach Tasker was slow to take credit, but quick to praise. He often \nsaid, ``When you've got players like I've got, they make a great coach \nout of you.'' He was uncomfortable in the limelight, and even chose to \nput his awards away in drawers, preferring to display artwork by his \ngrandchildren. Coach Tasker always sought to uplift his children, \ngrandchildren, students, and players.\n  Mr. President, Coach Ralph Tasker passed away on Monday, July 19, \n1999, after a brief bout with cancer. I trust the Senate will join me \nin honoring one of the greatest men in the sports history of New Mexico \nand this country. He will be missed by everyone. I believe my friend \nSenator Domenici put it best when he said, ``The passing of Ralph \nTasker marks the loss of an institution in Hobbs and in New Mexico.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13601-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE GARRETSON, SD, CHAPTER OF THE FUTURE FARMERS OF \n                                AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have spoken many times to my colleagues \nin this body about the importance of agriculture in America. It is \ncertainly one of the most valuable industries in my home state of South \nDakota and is clearly essential to the economy and well-being of the \nentire United States.\n  Undoubtedly, farming has always been a difficult job. But, consistent \nwith the industrious spirit of America, there have always been \ndedicated young men and women who have been willing to face the \nchallenge of growing the food for this country. And even during tough \ntimes, there have been young Americans who are willing to answer the \ncall to one of the most noble vocations in our country--they want to be \nfarmers.\n  Last week, the Future Farmers of America hosted their seventy-second \nannual national convention in Lexington, Kentucky. Nearly 50,000 future \nfarmers and their guests, including a number of young South Dakotans, \ngathered to exchange ideas, develop leadership skills and to have a \nfrank discussion about the future of family farming.\n  Mr. President, I'm proud to report that, of the hundreds of local FFA \nchapters from across the country, and of the thousands of participants \nnationwide, the Future Farmers of America chapter from Garretson, South \nDakota was named National FFA Chapter of the Year. Chapter members \nBrian Cooper, Gary Kringen, Mitch Coburn, Amanda Dorman, and their \nadviser Ed Mueller have spent countless hours working on projects \nranging from promoting economic development in rural communities to \nproviding lessons in farm safety to elementary students. Their hard \nwork and dedication to the future of agriculture is a heartening sign \nthat there will be a future generation of farmers to work the land and \nraise the food for this great country.\n  I want to offer my most sincere congratulations to the members of the \nGarretson chapter of the Future Farmers of America on receiving this \ngreat honor. These young people have earned the admiration and respect \nof their community and the entire state of South Dakota. Brian, Gary, \nMitch, and Amanda remind us that outstanding young people are willing \nto commit themselves to farming--one of the most challenging, \nrewarding, and important careers they could choose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13601-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13601-S13602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CHANGES TO THE BUDGETARY AGGREGATES AND APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE \n                               ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The CBO staff contacts are Hester \n     Grippando (for revenues), who can be reached at 226-2720, \n     John R. Righter (for payment to territories of rum excise \n     tax), who can be reached at 226-2860, and Jeane De Sa (For \n     streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine), who can be reached at 226-\n     9010.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n      CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, OCTOBER 29, 1999\n\n               S. 1792: Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999\n\n  (As reported by the Senate Committee on Finance on October 26, 1999)\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       S. 1792 would amend existing tax laws and extend numerous \n     tax provisions that have expired recently or are about to \n     expire. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates that \n     enacting S. 1792 would decrease on-budget governmental \n     receipts by $320 million over the 2000-2004 period, but would \n     increase such receipts by $461 million over the 2000-2009 \n     period. By extending through calendar year 2000 the exclusion \n     of employer-provided educational assistance, JCT estimates \n     that the bill also would decrease off-budget revenues by a \n     total of $118 million in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. In \n     addition, CBO estimates that the bill would increase direct \n     spending by $124 million over the 2000-2004 period and by \n     $159 million over the 2000-2009 period. Although the bill \n     would affect both governmental receipts and direct spending, \n     section 301 of the bill specifies that any change in the \n     surplus or deficit resulting from enactment shall not be \n     counted for purposes of enforcing the pay-as-you-go \n     procedures established by the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act.\n       JCT estimates that S. 1792 contains one new \n     intergovernmental mandate, the cost of which would not exceed \n     the threshold for intergovernmental mandates ($50 million in \n     1996, adjusted annually for inflation) established in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). JCT estimates that S. \n     1792 contains 16 new private-sector mandates, and that the \n     costs of those mandates would exceed the threshold \n     established in UMRA ($100 million in 1996, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) in each of fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n\n\n                    description of major provisions\n\n       S. 1792 would amend the Internal Revenue Code to:\n       Extend to tax years 1999 and 2000 a provision to allow \n     individuals to use nonrefundable personal tax credits to \n     offset their regular tax liability in full (as opposed to \n     limiting such credits to the difference between their regular \n     tax liability and their alternative minimum tax liability);\n       Extend the research and experimentation tax credit through \n     December 31, 2000;\n       Extend the exemption from Subpart F for active financing \n     income through tax year 2000;\n       Extend to tax year 2000 the suspension of income limitation \n     on percentage depletion from marginal oil and gas wells;\n       Extend the work opportunity and welfare-to-work tax credits \n     through December 31, 2000;\n       Temporarily increase the amount of the excise tax on rum \n     paid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from $10.50 \n     per proof gallon to $13.50 per proof gallon;\n       Add the streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine to the list of \n     taxable vaccines;\n       Increase the amount of the estimated tax that individuals \n     must pay based on the amount of their prior year's tax to \n     110.5 percent for tax years beginning in 2000 and to 112 \n     percent for tax years beginning in 2004;\n       Modify the rules that allow taxpayers to credit the payment \n     of foreign taxes against the payment of U.S. taxes owed on \n     income derived from foreign sources; and\n       Prohibit taxpayers who use an accrual method of accounting \n     from also using the installment method of accounting when \n     reporting dispositions of property for income tax purposes.\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1792 is shown in the \n     following table. Estimated spending would fall within budget \n     functions 800 (general government) and 550 (health).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2000     2001     2002    2003    2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated On-Budget Revenues..     200    -3,738     730     686   1,802\nEstimated Off-Budget Revenues      -77       -41       0       0       0\n \\1\\..........................\n                               -----------------------------------------\n    Total Changes in Revenues.     123    -3,779     730     686   1,802\n \n                     CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING \\2\\\n \nEstimated Budget Authority....      85        20       6       6       7\nEstimated Outlays.............      85        20       6       6      7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Represents a loss of taxes to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors\n  Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds from extending through\n  calendar year 2000 the exclusion of employer-provided educational\n  assistance.\n\\2\\ Implementing the bill would also increase spending subject to\n  appropriation, but CBO estimates that such costs would not be\n  significant.\n \nSources: Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       Revenues: All revenue estimates were provided to CBO by \n     JCT.\n       Direct Spending: Payment to Territories of Rum Excise Tax. \n     Under current law, a tax of $13.50 per proof gallon is \n     assessed on distilled spirits produced in or brought into the \n     Untied States. The treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin \n     Islands receive $10.50 of the tax assessed on rum \n     manufactured in either territory. In addition, the \n     territories receive payments, at a similar rate, on all rum \n     imported into the United States from any foreign country. \n     Those payments to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are \n     recorded as outlays in the budget.\n       Under the bill, the governments of Puerto Rico and the \n     Virgin Islands would receive the full $13.50 per proof gallon \n     for assessments made between July 1, 1999, and December 31, \n     2000. Based on recent tax and payment data, CBO estimates \n     that increasing the territories' share of the excise tax \n     would increase direct spending by $85 million in fiscal year \n     2000 (including $18 million in retroactive payments for \n     fiscal year 1999) and $16 million in fiscal year 2001.\n       Streptococcus Pneumoniae Vaccine. S. 1792 would add \n     conjugate vaccines against streptococcus pneumoniae to the \n     list of taxable vaccines and thus would allow for federal \n     payments to individuals for injuries related to those \n     vaccines from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust \n     Fund. CBO estimates that this provision would increase \n     outlays for compensation to individuals by $4 million over \n     the 2000-2004 period. This provision also would increase \n     federal Medicaid outlays by $21 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period because Medicaid would be required to pay the excise \n     tax on purchases of vaccines against streptococcus \n     pneumoniae. The federal government purchases about one-half \n     of all vaccines through its Vaccines for Children Program.\n       In addition, this provision would increase the cost of \n     vaccines purchased under section 317 of the Public Health \n     Service Act. Section 317 would authorize grants to states for \n     the purchase of vaccines under federal contracts with vaccine \n     manufacturers. We estimate that any increase in spending \n     under this section would not be significant and would be \n     subject to the availability of appropriated funds.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act sets \n     up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays and \n     governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-go \n     procedures are shown in the following table. For the purposes \n     of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the effects in \n     the budget year and the succeeding four years are counted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                             By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                                               ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    2000         2001         2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007         2008         2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in receipts...........................................          200       -3,738          730          686        1,802       -1,000          468          427          445          441\n\n[[Page S13603]]\n\n \nChanges in outlays............................................           85           20            6            6            7            7            7            7            7            7\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Section 301 specifies that any change in the surplus or \n     deficit resulting from enactment of S. 1792 shall not be \n     counted for purposes of enforcing the pay-as-you-go \n     procedures.\n\n\n        estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments\n\n       JCT has determined that the provision that would add \n     streptococcus pneumoniae to the list of taxable vaccines is \n     an intergovernmental mandate.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to stand \nup for a small business in my home state--the Rutland Fire Clay Company \nof Rutland, VT.\n  For the past week, a coalition of 240 special interest organizations \nhave run a series of the same paid advertisements in such Washington-\nbased publications as Roll Call and National Journal's Congress Daily \nAM . The targets of these interest groups in this expensive ad campaign \nare, of course, the members of this body and of the House of \nRepresentatives. The advertisement uses the recent bankruptcy \nreorganization filing of the Rutland Fire Clay Company to promote the \nFairness in Asbestos Compensation Act, S. 758 and H.R. 1283.\n  Mr. President, here is a copy of this ad. The headline is: ``How \nasbestos litigation ruined a family business.'' Then in the body of the \nadvertisement is this pullout headline: ``Rutland Fire Clay Files For \nChap. 11.'' Throughout the ad is the history of this 116-year-old \nVermont firm as reported in the Rutland Herald on October 19, 1999.\n  Finally, the ad concludes with this statement: ``we believe that the \ninterests of the hundreds of large and small businesses affected by \nthis national travesty, their employees, pensioners, communities who \ndepend on them, and their millions of shareholders warrant your support \nof the Act as well.'' I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nadvertisement be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am offended by this slick advertisement. \nIt is clear that the executives on Madison Avenue who crafted this ad \nwant lawmakers--you, me, and all of our colleagues--to believe that the \nemployees of the Rutland Fire Clay Company support the Fairness in \nAsbestos Compensation Act and that this bill would have helped the \nVermont firm avoid reorganization in bankruptcy. Nothing is further \nfrom the truth.\n  Thomas Martin, who is the President of the Rutland Fire Clay Company, \nand who is named in the advertisement, has written to me to set the \nrecord straight. Mr. Martin writes: ``I reviewed the bill and my \nopinion is it would not help Rutland Fire Clay Company reduce this \n[asbestos litigation] burden, nor would it help other small businesses \nwith thousands of claims. . . . Under S. 758 costs would be apportioned \nto Rutland Fire Clay Company equally, and thus higher, than under the \ncurrent system.''\n  Mr. Martin continues: ``The advertisement's heading gave the \nimpression that our family business would be `ruined' and that our 22 \nemployees would be out of work. The truth is that we have worked out a \nconsensual bankruptcy plan which recognizes the value of Rutland Fire \nClay Company and its employees. No jobs will be lost and we will \ncontinue to serve the fireplace and home repair markets as we have for \n116 years.''\n  Finally, Mr. Martin notes: ``our firm in no way assisted in \npreparation of the CAR advertisement nor did we have any knowledge of \nit until your office sent me a copy.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Thomas Martin's letter \nto me be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have met with Tom Martin of the Rutland Fire Clay \nCompany and corresponded with him about asbestos litigation. Mr. Martin \nshould be commended for reaching a settlement with his insurers and the \ntrial bar concerning his firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big \nbusinesses that are trying to avoid any accountability for their \nasbestos responsibilities through national legislation, Mr. Martin and \nthe Rutland Fire Clay Company are trying to do the right thing within \nthe legal system.\n  Mr. Martin plans to lead the Rutland Fire Clay Company from \nbankruptcy next year as a stronger firm with a solid financial \nfoundation for the 21st Century. I applaud Tom Martin and the employees \nof the Rutland Fire Clay Company for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I am willing to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and with interested parties to craft fair legislation to \nhelp victims and businesses, large and small, affected by asbestos. But \nexploiting the bankruptcy filing of a small firm in Vermont and using \nmisleading advertisements to promote a flawed bill are not the right \nways to advance our consideration of this issue, and they are certainly \nnot an admirable way to attempt to sway opinion in or outside of this \nbody.\n  I believe the 240 special interest organizations that sponsored this \nadvertisement owe an apology to Tom Martin and the other Vermonters who \nwork for the Rutland Fire Clay Company, and I will remind them of that \nobligation until they offer that apology.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Oct. 19, 1999]\n\n                  Rutland Fire Clay Files for Chap. 11\n\n\n  how asbestos litigation ruined a family business: 22 employees and \n                            50,000 lawsuits\n\n       Asbestos lawyers would have you believe that only billion \n     dollar companies are affected by the asbestos nightmare. But \n     in reality, more than 300 small businesses, as well as large \n     ones, find themselves today enmeshed in the asbestos \n     litigation mess. This spiraling litigation--filed largely by \n     non-sick claimants who may have been exposed to asbestos, as \n     have a majority of all Americans, but have no physical \n     symptoms or impairment--continues to drive firms to \n     bankruptcy or its brink.\n       Just last week, Rutland Fire Clay, a small family-owned \n     Vermont manufacturer of furnace and wood stove repair \n     cements, was\n\n[[Page S13604]]\n\n     forced into bankruptcy as a result of what it termed ``the \n     crushing burden of asbestos related lawsuits.''\n       You should know these facts about the Rutland Fire Clay \n     case:\n       Rutland Fire Clay, with its 22 employees, is a small, 116 \n     year-old family business, in Rutland, Vermont.\n       The business was started in 1883 by Rufus Perkins and his \n     two sons and has manufactured, for more than 100 years, a \n     cement material for use in the repair of furnaces and \n     residential wood stoves sold through hardware stores. The \n     product originally contained a very small amount of \n     encapsulated asbestos, although Rutland discontinued the use \n     of asbestos in its products almost 30 years ago.\n       Since 1984, there have been 50,000 asbestos cases filed \n     against the company, and 37,000 remain pending today--most of \n     these cases involving non-sick claimants.\n       The company has estimated its liability for current and \n     future asbestos claims at $67 million, with assets of only $3 \n     million.\n       Thomas Martin, the firm's president, said in a Rutland \n     press interview last week, that if it weren't for asbestos \n     claims, the 116 year-old company would never have wound up in \n     bankruptcy. He described business as ``excellent,'' with the \n     company expecting a record sales year.\n       The Rutland Fire Clay case is a stark example of what \n     happens in the asbestos litigation world today. Asbestos \n     lawyers continue to draw from an almost limitless pool of \n     potential defendants by targeting, with the touch of a word \n     processing button, small and large companies--many with only \n     a tangential association to asbestos. These ``asbestos'' \n     defendants include local building products distributors, home \n     remodeling centers, ``mom and pop'' hardware stores, and \n     other unsuspecting companies who manufactured, or only \n     distributed, products that may have contained nominal amounts \n     of asbestos in a component part of end products, such as \n     forklifts, cranes, gaskets, grinding wheels, lawnmower \n     engines, etc.\n       While the principal focus of the bipartisan Fairness in \n     Asbestos Compensation Act is, as it should be, on the rights \n     of deserving asbestos victims, we believe that the interests \n     of the hundreds of large and small businesses affected by \n     this national travesty, their employees, pensioners, \n     communities who depend upon them, and their millions of \n     shareholders warrant your support of the Act as well.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             Exhibit No. 2\n\n\n                                    Rutland Fire Clay Company,\n\n                                    Rutland, VT, October 29, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for sending me the recent \n     advertisement produced by the Coalition for Asbestos \n     Resolution (CAR) that is using our recent bankruptcy filing \n     in its campaign in support of S. 758 and its companion, H.R. \n     1283.\n       We presently have over 37,000 lawsuits pending against us \n     and we have approximately $4 million of insurance and $2 \n     million in assets. For small firms such as ours with limited \n     remaining insurance and minimal assets, the burden of claims \n     is indeed crushing as quoted in the CAR advertisement. \n     However, I reviewed this bill and my opinion is it would not \n     help Rutland Fire Clay Company reduce this burden, nor would \n     it help any other small business with thousands of claims. As \n     an example under section 601 apportionment of costs for the \n     ARC are addressed. Potential disputes could easily arise \n     between defendants as to their respective share of costs. Our \n     company cannot afford the expense of litigation if \n     disagreement with the large defendants is the result. In \n     addition, our historical costs per claim processed for \n     defense and indemnity have been very low relative to that of \n     other defendant companies. Under S. 758 costs would be \n     apportioned to Rutland Fire Clay Company equally, and thus \n     higher, than under the current system.\n       The advertisement's headline gave the impression that our \n     family business would be ``ruined'' and that our 22 employees \n     would be out of work. The truth is that we have worked out a \n     consensual bankruptcy plan which recognizes the value of \n     Rutland Fire Clay Company and its employees. No jobs will be \n     lost and we will continue to serve the fireplace and home \n     repair markets as we have for 116 years.\n       Lastly, our firm in no way assisted in preparation of the \n     CAR advertisement nor did we have any knowledge of it until \n     our office sent me a copy.\n       Thank you,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas P.

A bill to provide that certain income derived from an \nagreement between the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa Indians and the State \nof Minnesota shall not be considered income for purposes of Federal \nassistance eligibility; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n   income exemption from federal assistance eligibility requirements\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing today \nlegislation of great importance to two tribes in Minnesota, the Bois \nForte Bank of Chippewa and the Grand Portage Band of Chippewa. This \nbill would exempt income derived from an agreement between the two \nbands and the State of Minnesota from being considered as income for \npurposes of Federal assistance eligibility when the funds from the \nagreement are distributed to tribal members.\n  Under current law, most payments to Indians derived from trust \nresources are exempt from consideration as income or resources for the \npurposes of determining federal benefits under various Federal or \nfederally assisted programs. Regulations promulgated by various Federal \nagencies reflect the statutory exemptions for income derived from \ninterests of individual Indians in trust or restricted lands and from \npayments distributed to tribal members as the result of Indian claims \nawards. This legislation is to accord similar treatment to payments \nmade to the approximately 2,700 members of the Bois Forte Band and the \n790 members of the Grand Portage Band.\n  In 1988 the two bands entered into an agreement with the state of \nMinnesota whereby the State agreed to make an annual payment to the \nbands in exchange for the bands' restriction of their members' hunting \nand fishing rights. These rights are guaranteed by the treaty of \nSeptember 30, 1854. From that payment, the Tribal Councils of the Bands \nmake small annual payments to their members. The Bois Forte Band pays \neach of its members $500 per year, for example. The shares of minors \nare paid into a trust fund that cannot and disbursed until the minor \nreaches the age of 18. The shares of adults are paid directly to them.\n  These payments are intended to compensate the band members for a \nFederal treaty right that they have elected to forgo in return for \nthese funds. As a result, this constitutes income which is derived from \na trust resource. The intent of the Federal law is that such funds--up \nto a certain level, are not treated as income for purposes of Federal \nbenefit eligibility. This is in recognition of the special status of \nIndian tribes within the United States, and the trust relationship that \nthe Federal Government maintains to this day. However, while these \npayments clearly fall within the intent Federal law to protect trust \nresources, the current statute does not encompass these payments.\n  The result is that for a small number of band members, approximately \n10 percent of the Bois Forte band and currently no members of the Grand \nPortage Band, this income is of no real benefit because it reduces or \neliminates their public assistance payment. These members are all \nextremely poor, elderly, or disabled. Mr. President, these are people \nwho can least afford to bear the brunt of this loophole in Federal law.\n  Additionally, Mr. President, these band members see a spike in their \nincome--an extremely small spike mind you--in 1 month out of the year. \nDoes it serve any public purpose to kick them off of Federal assistance \nin that 1 month, only to require them to reapply in the following \nmonth? Their circumstances are not changed by this payment. These funds \nwill not lift anyone out of poverty, they do not replace an income lost \nto disability or age.\n  This bill will ensure that members of the Bois Forte and Grand \nPortage Bands receive fair--though small--compensation for their \nforegone treaty rights. It is a question of simple equity and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1837.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Healthy \nSeniors Act of 1999. Prescription drugs are a hot topic these days. \nFrom the lawn of the White House to the TV screen in your house, \neveryone is talking about prescription drugs, and for good reason. \nAmericans have the greatest health care system in the world: The best \ndoctors, the best research, and the most effective prescription drugs. \nThat doesn't mean anything if thousands of seniors can't afford to use \nthem. We are creating a system where the well-off can buy the best \nhealth care and the poor can afford little more than an aspirin.\n  Recently, ``60 Minutes'' did a show on the high cost of prescription \ndrugs and the need to provide coverage to low-income beneficiaries. \nNational Public Radio has run a series of stories on the rising cost of \nprescription drugs and government plans to make them available to \nMedicare beneficiaries. Full-page advertisements and news stories are \nin our Nation's newspapers, from the Washington Post to the Billings \nGazette. We have all seen Flo and her bowling ball.\n  I have a story from the Montana Standard, Butte's local newspaper. \nThe headline reads: ``Montanans Testify for Medicare Drug Coverage.''\n\n       Greg Loushin's heart breaks every time he watches Montana's \n     elderly and uninsured scrounge for change to buy prescription \n     drugs. Oftentimes, the Butte pharmacist pulls money from his \n     own pocket.\n\n  Think of that, the local pharmacist pulls money from his own pocket \nwhen his own customers do not have adequate funds to pay for their \ndrugs.\n  From the story:\n\n       Pharmacist helping seniors buy drugs they need from his own \n     money.\n\n  People help one another out in Butte, MT. Greg's customers are lucky \nto have him for a pharmacist. But we know in our increasingly \ninterpersonal world, Greg's generosity is a rare exception. It isn't a \nlong-term solution to the problem of escalating costs of prescription \ndrugs; creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare is.\n  Why is it suddenly so important seniors be given a drug benefit under \nMedicare? Why all the attention? Why the stories? The answer is \ntwofold.\n  First, prescription drug costs have risen dramatically. Overall \nmedical inflation has been slowed in recent years, but the cost of \nprescription drugs has actually skyrocketed, rising much faster than \nthe average cost of medical care. In 1980, prescription drugs were only \n4 percent of total health costs. In the year 2000, they will account \nfor 16 percent of the total, a fourfold increase in 20 years. The \nincreased costs are attributable both to the prices charged for the \nnew, sophisticated drugs that are being developed by pharmaceutical \ncompanies, and to increase use of the drugs by our seniors.\n  Today as never before there is increased competition among drug \ncompanies to put out new drug therapies for the many ailments that face \nAmericans, young and old. I, for one, do not want to stunt the \ninnovation that has made America the leading architect of medical \ntechnology.\n  The second reason the drug benefit is so important is these research \nefforts are increasingly fruitful. Drugs can now treat illnesses where \nformally surgery was needed. Drug coverage means healthier individuals, \nleading to fewer hospitals and less time in the hospital.\n\n  New York has a plan called EPIC to help low-income seniors with \nmedications that saved an estimated $47 million in hospitalization \ncosts in the recent year, compared with the $41 million it cost to run \nthe program. David Cutler, a Harvard economist, reports elderly \ndisability rates have fallen 15 percent in the last decade largely \nbecause of increased use of prescription drugs.\n  Barbara Holter, a Montana Medicare beneficiary, last week wrote me:\n\n       Senator Baucus . . . innovative prescription drugs and \n     biological therapies played an important role in the \n     treatment of arthritis. While not a cure, these new \n     medications can help alleviate the pain, slow the progress of \n     disease, and prevent disability. Unfortunately, 35 percent of \n     Medicare beneficiaries do not have coverage. It is important \n     that Congress take action to expand access to drug coverage.\n\n  Gone are the days when surgery and mechanical devices alone work to \nsave lives and increase their quality. A heart ailment that may have \nrequired an extensive bypass a few years ago can now be treated with a \nclot-busting medication or a stent. To paraphrase the renowned \nphysician and health care policy expert, Dr. William Schwartz, medicine \nis changing ``from the mechanical to the molecular.''\n  Everyone seems to recognize this shift. Everyone, that is except our \ngovernment. We are 60 days from the year 2000, and we are still trying \nto run a health care program rooted in the year 1965.\n  Some say we ought to reform Medicare before providing a drug benefit. \nSenator Bill Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, has indicated his \ninterest in working in a bipartisan fashion to strengthen Medicare in \nthe coming year. I welcome his willingness to do so. Without action, \nMedicare will go broke in just 15 years, at the very time our social \ninsurance system becomes inundated with the baby boom generation, about \n15 years from now.\n  We must act to save Medicare. We ought not let perfection be the \nenemy of the good. I accept and agree that Medicare must be changed. It \nis also true the average senior fills 19 prescriptions every year on \naverage. Our seniors don't have the luxury of waiting until the \npolitics are right to get the drugs they need. This is particularly \ntrue in rural areas.\n  As this chart indicates, one-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no \nprescription drug coverage. One-third of seniors in our country have no \nprescription drug coverage. In rural areas, it is even worse. In rural \nAmerica, the number increases to nearly half. Seniors are being denied \nproducts that can save their lives because of geography. Half of \nAmerican seniors don't have prescription drug coverage.\n  Part of the problem is we don't have a lot of managed care in rural \nareas. In fact, we have very little. Managed care will often provide \ndrug coverage to seniors. In many parts of America, particularly rural \nAmerica, there is no managed care, much less prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors.\n  Recently, my staff spoke to Ardys Olin and her mother Thelma of \nBillings, MT. Both are beneficiaries of Gold Choice, Montana's only \nMedicare managed care plan. Ardys is disabled; Thelma is 87. For the \ntime being, they both get prescription drug coverage through Gold \nChoice, the only managed care program for Medicare in Montana. They are \nquite pleased with it.\n  Because payment rates are insufficient to sustain managed care in \nrural America, Gold Choice is soon going to leave Montana, leaving its \n2,600 beneficiaries without prescription drug coverage. Where are these \npeople going to go? What are they going to do when Gold Choice pulls \nout of Montana?\n  Most employers in rural America can't afford to offer prescription \ndrug coverage in their retirement plans. The profit margins are so low \nin rural America. Unfortunately, many people in rural areas have little \nor no retirement income beyond their Social Security checks. These \npeople are hurting. Many of the 2,600 Montanans losing prescription \ndrug coverage with the termination of Gold Choice--the only managed \nMedicare care program in our State--don't have enough money of their \nown to buy Medigap coverage. Medigap is the insurance plan offered by \nmany companies to fill the gap between what Medicare doesn't pay and \nwhat Medicare should pay. Maybe people do not have enough money to buy \nMedigap insurance. That is why many Americans don't have any \nprescription drug coverage at all. They simply have to hope they do not \nbecome ill and, if they do, that they will be able to afford the cost \nof the drugs their doctors prescribe.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing will begin, not totally--but begin \nto address this problem. We are not creating any new bureaucracies, no \nnew large Government programs. We are simply extending the reach of the \nMedicaid program to administer drug coverage to our most needy. That is \nit. This bill provides prescription drug coverage to the elderly whose \nincomes are 175 percent of the Federal poverty limit. In real terms, \nthat means seniors making up to about $13,500 a year will be provided \nsome prescription drug coverage; $16,800 in the case of couples.\n  This bill impacts seniors who are less able to pay for their \nprescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S13607]]\n\n Consider the following data graciously provided by, and under review \nat, Health Affairs, the Nation's leading health policy journal.\n  These numbers are from a study supported by the Commonwealth Fund, a \nnational philanthropic organization engaged in independent research on \nhealth and social policy issues, and is the product of the able \nscholarship of Dr. Jan Blustein, professor at the Wagner School of New \nYork University.\n  This chart shows the extent to which low-income seniors with \nhypertension have prescription drug coverage. Hypertension--that is, \nhigh blood pressure--is prevalent among the elderly, occurring in \nbetter than 50 percent of persons over age 65. As you can see, seniors \nwith hypertension, with incomes between 100 and 125 percent of poverty, \nonly have prescription drug coverage about 65 percent of the time. \nAgain, seniors whose income is between 100 percent and 125 percent of \npoverty have prescription drug coverage only about 65 percent of the \ntime. Those between 126 percent and 150 percent of poverty, the next \nline down, fare even worse, receiving drug coverage only about half the \ntime, 55 percent of the time.\n  Mr. President, 150 percent of poverty is not a lot of money, only \nabout $11,500 a year. There is clearly a need to help these people, and \nthe bill I am introducing today does just that.\n  Let me be clear in stating this legislation is not intended as a \npermanent solution to the prescription drug problem. It does not \nprovide stop-loss coverage for beneficiaries whose drug bills measure \nin the thousands of dollars. And because it uses Medicaid, the \nlegislation uses a delivery mechanism that can differ from State to \nState in the scope of benefits it provides. But it does provide a \nbenefit to those who need it the most. It is not perfect, but it is a \nstart. Most important, it is an idea that has broad-based support from \nthe public and in the Congress.\n  The Medicare Commission, although unable to reach a supermajority on \nits recommendation to fix the program--that is, Medicare--proposed \ncovering drugs for low-income seniors through Medicare. In a recent \npoll, 86 percent of Americans favored adding a new Medicare drug \nbenefit to cover part of the cost of the prescription drugs.\n  During the recent debate over tax cuts and the Federal budget, I, \nwith 33 of my colleagues, sent the President a letter urging him to set \naside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. I am pleased he \nannounced his intentions just last week to do that, to fund a \nprescription drug benefit. Although creating a prescription drug \nbenefit will be expensive, I think inaction is even more costly. In the \nwords of the former President, Calvin Coolidge, ``We cannot do \neverything at once but we can do something at once.''\n  Let's do that something now to help our most vulnerable seniors, help \nthem pay for the drugs that can save their lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1839. A bill to provide that land which is owned by the Lower \nSioux Indian Community in the State of Minnesota but which is not held \nin trust by the United States for the community may be leased or \ntransferred by the Community without further approval by the United \nStates; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          approval not required to validate land transactions\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation \ntoday which will allow the Lower Sioux Indian Community of Minnesota to \nsell non-trust land which falls outside their reservation borders. \nEnactment of this bill would give the Lower Sioux the same rights as \nany other landowner: to conduct real estate transactions without an act \nof Congress.\n  The Lower Sioux Community has acquired several parcels of land \noutside its reservation borders. None of these lands are held in trust \nby the United States. The Community pays state and local property taxes \non the land and is not exempted from local zoning ordinances. The \nCommunity is treated like any other non-Indian land owner with regard \nto these parcels under the law--except that federal law requires that \nCongress approve the sale of land owned in fee simple by Indian tribes. \nIn other words, should the Community wish to engage in almost any kind \nof land transaction involving these parcels, Congress must pass \nlegislation to allow it to happen.\n  The Community seeks to have this burden lifted from them. It argues \nthat the Community's development projects are unfairly restricted by \nthis requirement. Indeed, my colleagues know how long it can take for \nCongress to act on even the most parochial and non-controversial of \nlegislation. Last year, we were successful in passing legislation \nauthorizing the sale of a single parcel of land owned by the Lower \nSioux. It passed as part of a technical amendments bill, but the entire \nprocess took over six months. All of this for a plot of land no bigger \nthan thirteen acres.\n  Obviously, such hurdles can make dealing with the Lower Sioux \nCommunity complicated and time consuming. Congress could even choose \nnot to act upon a request. This puts the band at a competitive \ndisadvantage relative to other land owners. The Lower Sioux is not a \nwealthy community. It can ill afford the hassles of pursuing closure in \nWashington to deals in Minnesota.\n  This legislation is introduced at the request of the Lower Sioux \nCommunity. The legislation does not cover any other tribe besides the \nLower Sioux Community, and again, it applies only to land not held in \ntrust by the United States or that is not within the borders of the \nCommunity's reservation. This is a narrowly focused bill designed to \nmeet the unique needs and circumstances of the Lower Sioux Community.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will lower barriers to the Lower \nSioux's pursuit of economic opportunities to improve the lives of its \nmembers. With that in mind, I believe it is both appropriate and \nnecessary and I urge its adoption.\n  I ask that a copy of a tribal council resolution in support of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n           Lower Sioux Community Council Resolution No. 08-99\n\n       Whereas, The Lower Sioux Community Council is the governing \n     body of the Lower Sioux Indian Community in Minnesota, a \n     federally recognized Indian tribe; and\n       Whereas, The Lower Sioux Community has in the past \n     purchased land in its own name in fee simple for various \n     Community purposes, including the promotion of economic \n     development that would enable the Community and its members \n     to become self-sufficient; and\n       Whereas, The Community must make additional such purchases \n     in the future for economic development, housing, and other \n     purposes; and\n       Whereas, There is no certainty that the Community will be \n     able to transfer any of its fee land to the United States to \n     hold in trust for the Community; and\n       Whereas, Under current federal law, when the Community \n     purchases land in fee it must pay taxes on such land but it \n     is not allowed to transfer, lease, mortgage, or otherwise \n     convey interests in such land without a congressional statute \n     allowing it to do so; and\n       Whereas, The restrictions on the transfer, lease, and \n     mortgage of Community fee land unfairly burden the \n     Community's development projects, and place the Community in \n     a worse position than any other surrounding landowner.\n       Now Therefore be it Resolved that: The Lower Sioux \n     Community Council urges the Minnesota congressional \n     delegation specifically, and Congress generally, to support \n     legislation that will remove the restrictions on the \n     Community's ability to transfer, lease, mortgage, or \n     otherwise convey interests in land owned by it in fee. The \n     removal of these restrictions will allow the Community to use \n     its fee land in the same manner as any other landowner in \n     order to develop its economy and provide services to its \n     members.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13607-1",

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce my resolution \nwhich would recognize August 1st, 2000 as ``National Relatives as \nParents Day.''\n  Mr. President, last year the state of Michigan and its Governor, John \nEngler, declared August 1, 1999, as Relatives Raising Relative Children \nDay in order to recognize the enduring and valuable contributions of \nthose individuals willing to raise relative children as their own sons \nand daughters. I believe that we should follow the example set by my \nhome State and recognize all of our relatives raising relatives.\n  Mr. President, my resolution declaring August 1, 2000 as ``National \nRelatives as Parents Day'' provides the perfect opportunity to \nrecognize and honor the dedication and compassion of relatives who \nwillingly take on the often thankless responsibility of providing a \nrelative child in need of a family and home.\n  Mr. President, there is little doubt that children are our Nation's \nmost valuable resource. They are, quite literally, America's future. \nAnd, it is our most important responsibility as lawmakers and as \ncitizens to protect and care for our most vulnerable charges.\n  Mr. President, there is also little doubt that the family plays a \nvital and irreplaceable role in providing young children with the \nsecure and caring environment necessary to teach them the values \nintegral to leading a happy, healthy and productive life. Mr. \nPresident, it is within the family that children best receive the \nspecial care and attention necessary for their proper development.\n  Unfortunately, not all children grow up in a healthy home \nenvironment. Too many children will suffer from child abuse or neglect, \npoor nutrition and insufficient child care, all of which jeopardize the \nwell-being of a young child and his or her opportunity for a fulfilling \nand successful adulthood. Sadly, in the event that the family unit \nbreaks down, the child cannot remain in his or her existing home \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to note that there are many individuals \nwilling to open their hearts and homes to children whose families are \nin crisis. These special people play an indispensable role in helping \nchildren heal--providing children with a stable and secure environment \nin which they can grow and develop into successful adults.\n  Mr. President, approximately 520,000 children live with foster \nfamilies--about 150,800, or 29 percent, of whom are children living \nwith relatives who are willing to take in relative children, providing \nthem with guidance and a caring and positive home environment. It is in \nhonor of these individuals that I stand today, for without their \nselflessness, many of the close to 160,000 children would either remain \nin unhealthy and unsafe environments or be uprooted and placed in \ntemporary group homes. Relatives who take on the responsibility of \nparents deserve special recognition for their long-lasting \ncontributions to their children and to the larger community.\n  It is my hope that all of my colleagues will join with me in \nrecognition of all of this country's relatives, who as parents, have \nhad an incalculable positive impact in the lives of young children in \nneed of a family and home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13609-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 213--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, AND \n               REPRESENTATION OF EMPLOYEES IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

ENCOURAGING MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TRADE AND \n                   INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A mutually beneficial United States Sub-Saharan Africa \n     trade policy will grant new access to the United States \n     market for a broad range of goods produced in Africa, by \n     Africans, and include safeguards to ensure that the \n     corporations manufacturing these goods (or the product or \n     manufacture of the oil or mineral extraction industry) \n     respect the rights of their employees and the local \n     environment. Such trade opportunities will promote equitable \n     economic development and thus increase demand in African \n     countries for United States goods and service exports.\n       (2) Recognizing that the global system of textile and \n     apparel quotas under the MultiFiber Arrangement will be \n     phased out under the Uruguay Round Agreements over the next 5 \n     years with the total termination of the quota system in 2005, \n     the grant of additional access to the United States market in \n     these sectors is a short-lived benefit.\n       (b) Treatment of Quotas.--\n       (1) Kenya and mauritius.--Pursuant to the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing, the United States shall eliminate the \n     existing quotas on textile and apparel imports to the United \n     States from Kenya and Mauritius, respectively, not later than \n     30 days after each country demonstrates the following:\n       (A) The country is not ineligible for benefits under \n     section 502(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2462(b)(2)).\n       (B) The country does not engage in significant violations \n     of internationally recognized human rights and the Secretary \n     of State agrees with this determination.\n       (C)(i) The country is providing for effective enforcement \n     of internationally recognized worker rights throughout the \n     country (including in export processing zones) as determined \n     under paragraph (5), including the core labor standards \n     enumerated in the appropriate treaties of the International \n     Labor Organization, and including--\n       (I) the right of association;\n       (II) the right to organize and bargain collectively;\n       (III) a prohibition on the use of any form of coerced or \n     compulsory labor;\n       (IV) the international minimum age for the employment of \n     children (age 15);

Mr. President, as November has been designated \nNative American History Month, I am honored to congratulate a museum in \nmy own state for its efforts to recognize Native American artists and \nencourage the creation of new Native American fine art. The Eiteljorg \nMuseum of American Indians and Western Art recently launched an \nunprecedented 10-year program to strengthen the recognition and study \nof Native American artists who are making a valuable contribution to \nour nation's fine arts. The long-term goal of the program is to create \na national alliance of scholars, curators, artists, teachers, and \ncollectors who would further the notice and study given to Native \nAmerican fine artists.\n  Under the leadership of John Vanausdall, the museum's president and \nCEO, an international jury of scholars was appointed to select the \nfirst year's fellows and master artist from 106 qualified nominees. \nJurors included: Gerald R. McMaster (Plains Cree), curator of \ncontemporary Indian art at the Canadian Museum of Civilization; Bruce \nBernstein, assistant director for cultural resources at the National \nMuseum of the American Indian; and Kay WalkingStick (Cherokee), artist \nand professor of fine art at Cornell University.\n  On November 13, the first five recipients of the Eiteljorg Fellowship \nof Native American Fine Art will travel to the Eiteljorg Museum where \nthey will receive national acclaim. They will each be presented with a \nfellowship award of $20,000 and participate in the opening events for \nan exhibition of their art. I am pleased to announce the inaugural \nwinners: Lorenzo R. Clayton (Navajo), Truman Lowe (Ho Chunk), Marianne \nNicolson (Kwakwaka'wakw), Rick Rivet (Metis/Dene), and Jaune Quick-to-\nSee Smith (Flathead). In addition, George Morrison (Chippewa) was named \na master artist. I urge Americans to visit the exhibition which will be \non view at the Eiteljorg Museum, located in the beautiful White River \nState Park in Indianapolis from November 13, 1999 through January 23, \n2000.\n  I commend the Eiteljorg Museum for conceiving this long-overdue honor \nto Native American artists. This wonderful program is due to the \ngenerosity of the Indianapolis-based Lilly Foundation, Inc. which has \ndirected $490,000 to this worthy endeavor. Thanks to the efforts of the \nEiteljorg Museum and Lilly, the future is bright for Native American \nartists, as this program will award $100,000 to five artists every two \nyears. Our state is fortunate for their vision and I am honored to \nrecognize their efforts in promoting Native American Art and preserving \nthe culture of Native Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13614-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MARC HULL\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with much pride, and a \nlittle sadness, that I rise today to pay tribute to one of Vermont's \noutstanding leaders in education. Marc Hull, who recently resigned his \npost as Commissioner of Education in my home state, deserves both \npraise and gratitude for all he has accomplished for the children and \nyouth of Vermont.\n  At a time when education rightly tops the state and national agenda, \nwe have been fortunate to have his services. Marc has effectively \nadvanced the education agenda of Vermont through his dedication and \nperseverence in making sure that every child achieves his or her \nhighest potential, by setting high standards and giving children and \nteachers the means to reach them. To do so, he developed the Vermont \nFramework of Standards which is serving as the guide for improving the \nperformance of all Vermont schools, and most importantly the \nperformance of Vermont's students.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to salute Marc for his prior \nservice to Vermont as Director of Special Education. He has \nconsistently spoken for those who at one time had no voice and helped \nindividuals advocate for themselves and their children. For years he \nhas labored tirelessly to provide appropriate education programs for \nchildren with disabilities.\n  But despite these important positions and titles, I think of Marc as \nfirst and foremost a teacher. He has certainly taught me, and I think \nhe has probably touched and inspired everyone around him.\n  I am especially fond of the example that stemmed from his visit to \nWashington, D.C. this spring. Marc had led Vermont's efforts to \nimplement the federal Ed Flex law, and was invited by the President to \nattend the signing ceremony in the Rose Garden. At the ceremony, the \nPresident graciously gave Marc one of the pens he used to sign the \nlegislation. For most of us, the story would have stopped there, as the \npen gathered dust on our bookshelf or in a drawer. Not so for Marc. He \ntook the pen with him to classrooms throughout Vermont so that hundreds \nof students had the thrill of writing a word or two with the pen the \nPresident used to sign the Ed Flex legislation. As usual, their \ncomments were priceless, ranging from ``This must be worth millions!'' \nto ``Can I use it to write my name in my baseball cap?\"\n  Marc Hull has written his name into the fabric of our state. With \ncompassion for all whom he served, unique leadership skills and \nunsurpassed creativity, Marc has worked to make Vermont schools the \nbest they can be. I am pleased that while he has left his post as \nCommissioner, he will not leave the field of education. And wherever he \nworks, I know he will continue to have an impact on helping children to \nreach higher.\n  His integrity, humility and humanity make Marc Hull a wonderful \nadvisor, a good friend and an asset to the nation. He's not a bad \npolitician either, in the best sense of the word. Throughout my term as \nchairman of the Senate's education committee I have relied on his good \ncounsel. Though he will never get proper credit, his influence has been \nfelt far beyond the Green Mountains. I thank him, I wish him well, and \nI plan to continue learning from him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13614-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13614-S13615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ON THE RETIREMENT OF JAMES B. EDWARDS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today \nto recognize my friend Dr. Jim Edwards, who recently retired as \npresident of the Medical University of South Carolina after a \ndistinguished 17-year tenure. Thanks to his hard work and dedication, \nMUSC is now consistently ranked as one of the top 100 research \nuniversities in the country and has established itself as a leader in \nteaching and patient care.\n  Since Dr. Edwards took the helm at MUSC, the university has graduated \nmore than 10,000 health care professionals who are serving throughout \nthe state and nation. The university also experienced remarkable \nphysical growth under his leadership with the construction of several \nvaluable facilities including the Children's Hospital, the Hollings \nCancer Center, the Gazes Institute for Cardiac Research and the Strom \nThurmond Biomedical Research Center. The Charleston area is fortunate \nto have MUSC in its midst. The area's largest employer, MUSC has an \nimpressive economic impact of $1.3 billion annually.\n  Dr. Edwards' vision and drive that helped place MUSC in the medical \nforefront are talents he developed during the previous two decades as a \npublic servant. He became a politician for all the right reasons. He \nwas the archetypal man fed up with America's ills, but with the \nuncommon belief that it was his duty to correct them.\n  A successful oral surgeon, Jim served for two years in the South \nCarolina Senate before resigning to run for governor in 1974. Although \nthe underdog in the race, he emerged the victor, becoming the first \nRepublican governor of South Carolina since Reconstruction. As \ngovernor, he passed the Education Finance Act, which helped modernize \nour state's education system. He also established a reserve fund, \ncreated a motor vehicle management office, streamlined the state \nbudgeting process, developed welfare reform procedures, established the \nEnergy Research Institute and launched state government reorganization \nefforts.\n\n[[Page S13615]]\n\n  His nonpartisan approach to state government was commendable. ``I \nsincerely believe that during a campaign you ought to be partisan as \nyou can be,'' he told The State newspaper recently, ``and talk about \nthe differences of the two parties. There's plenty there to talk about. \n. . . But when elected, all this partisan stuff should stop. You ought \nto work together with whomever the people elected to work with you in \ngovernment.'' Democrats far outnumbered Republicans in the South \nCarolina legislature when Jim was governor, yet representatives from \nboth parties have compliments to bestow upon him to this day. He left \nthe Governor's Mansion with an approval rating of nearly 80 percent.\n  A year after Dr. Edwards returned to his dental practice, President \nReagan asked him to serve as the nation's energy secretary. True to his \ncommitment to public service, Jim answered the call, moving to \nWashington to tackle an important national issue. During his tenure, \nthe DOE decontrolled oil, stepped up the pace for filling the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, obtained federal aid for three synthetic fuel \nprojects and shepherded a nuclear waste measure through Congress. In \n1982, he moved back to South Carolina and assumed the presidency at \nMUSC.\n  Dr. Jim Edwards' retirement marks an end to the career of one of \nSouth Carolina's finest. His impact will be felt for many years to \ncome. My wife, Peatsy, joins me in wishing Jim and his wonderful wife, \nAnn, a happy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13615-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n Mr. HELMS.

In addition to the success Local \n599 has achieved for its members and their families, the men and women \nof the Local have been deeply involved in the life of the Flint \ncommunity by supporting countless civic and charitable activities.\n  UAW Local 599 has truly played an important role in the history of \nthe labor movement. I know my colleagues join me in extending sincere \ncongratulations to the past and present members of Local 599, as they \ncelebrate the 60th anniversary of its founding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13615-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF MAJOR TIM COY\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today, I would like to recognize an \nindividual that has been a tremendous asset to my office--Maj. Tim Coy. \nFor the past year, Major Coy has been an Air Force Legislative Fellow \nin my office. He has proven to be a professional officer, who handles \nany task he is given with enthusiasm and tenacity.\n  A year ago I requested a sharp military officer be assigned to my \nstaff because of my new position on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. Once we interviewed Tim, we knew that his extensive space \nand missile expertise would benefit my committee assignments, and his \nknowledge of Colorado would also be invaluable.\n  From Tim's first day in the office, he blended in with my talented \nstaff and went to work. He assisted in all areas of the office. He \nplayed a major role with our defense team on committee work, floor \nspeeches, and became a point person for missile defense issues. Just as \nimportant, he became more than a one year staffer, but a friend to us \nall.\n  In closing, Tim is an exceptionally capable and professional military \nofficer. He is the very first fellow I have hired, and one of the \nreasons I look forward to bringing in another fellow for next year. He \nhas a bright future in the Air Force and I know I will be hearing great \nthings about him in the future. Not only was I proud to have Maj. Tim \nCoy as a ``member'' of my staff, but he also did the Air Force \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13615-4", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13615-S13616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEO MARSHALL\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, under the daily 24-hour assault of \nour highly competitive news media, constantly in search of the latest \nevent and the most readily available personality, it would be easy to \nconfuse leadership with celebrity. However, there are in every \ncommunity, men and women whose names are rarely found in the headlines \nand whose faces rarely appear on the television screen, but who \nnevertheless contribute real leadership day in and day out.\n  In my state of Delaware, one of those invaluable if rarely recognized \nleaders is Wilmington City Clerk, and Democratic City Chairman, Leo \nMarshall. A Wilmington native and a lifelong Wilmington resident, Leo \nMarshall does not often make the morning headlines or the evening \nbroadcast news, but he is easily familiar to many Wilmingtonians \nbecause he never joined the migration to the suburbs that drained the \nenergies and economies of many of our older cities--he has lived and \nserved among them for four eventful decades.\n  Leo Marshall is, in many ways, the ``Mr. Wilmington'' of an older and \nincreasingly diverse city he has helped to guide through the social and \neconomic challenges that have marked our urban landscape from the \nconfrontations of the Sixties to, in Wilmington's case, the dawning \nrebirth of the Nineties. He would be the last to claim major credit for \nthe city's successes; he will tell you that the city has survived and \ngot to its feet again at the hands of a succession of progressive city \nadministrations--but knowledgeable Wilming-\ntonians will tell you Leo Marshall has built and maintained the strong \npolitical structure that has made progress possible in the relatively \nsmall city that is nevertheless Delaware's largest and most thoroughly \nurban community.\n  Like another Democrat prominently in the news today, Leo Marshall \nfirst came to public notice with a basketball in his hands, but as a \nproud product of Wilmington's still highly coherent Polish-American \ncommunity, he was not willing to stop there. He turned his attention to \ncity government, and the same intelligence and fiercely competitive \nspirit that had been so evident on the basketball court soon marked him \nas a leader in the rough-and-tumble of city politics.\n  He was and is a frankly partisan Democrat, and he has made Wilmington \na Democratic stronghold in most of our elections; but he has always \nreserved his most intense partisanship for his city itself. He never \nloses sight of the city's interests, and he will vigorously defend them \nagainst all comers, regardless of party. Those of us who encounter him \nas Democrats learn quickly, if we expect to enjoy the relationship, \nthat Leo Marshall will almost invariably be found among the most \nprogressive of Democrats when it comes to issues or candidates, local, \nstate or national--but only when he is assured that the city's \ninterests have been taken into constructive consideration. In those \ncases, he is capable of being a statesman who can help pull a party, a \ncity or a state together; but if\n\n[[Page S13616]]\n\nhe feels the city is being attacked or neglected, he takes off the \nfrock coat and rolls up his sleeves--and his opponents rarely enjoy the \ncontest that ensues.\n  If it sounds like I am characterizing Leo Marshall as an old-\nfashioned ``city boss,'' there is some truth to that notion; he came to \nparty leadership out of the tradition of bare-knuckle ward politics \nthat was the hallmark of most American cities of the day. But he has \nsurvived and successfully carried his leadership into a far different \nday because he has proved to be a boss with a difference--in a city \nsignificantly and persistently marked by rapid and challenging social \nand economic changes, he has been able to adapt his outlook, his \nleadership and his party to one major transition after another to the \nbenefit of both his party and his community.\n  Such adaptable behind-the-scenes party leadership invites a \nconsideration of the current state of our political parties. Much is \nsaid these days of how ``entrepreneurial politics'' has reduced our \nparties to mere shadows of their former selves, and those of us who \nmust regularly place our records and our hopes for the future before \nthe judgment of our constituents are well aware that that analysis \ncomes uncomfortably close to the truth. Replacing party conventions \nwith primary elections, struggling to meet the staggering costs of \ncampaigning and coping with a swollen press corps that dogs our tracks \nat all seasons has inevitably thrown onto the shoulders of individual \ncandidates much of the burden that historically was borne by the \npolitical parties.\n  But we should not let that fact blind us to the continuing \ncontribution our political parties make to our national life. They \nremain the institutions that embody the political values we place \nbefore the voters when we campaign for office. They still provide the \nstructure upon which our whole political system is based. They may not \nwield the overwhelming political influence they once possessed--and \nmost of us would agree that they should not--but they are not without \nidentity, they are not without purpose, and they are not without \ncontinuing value. They deserve our continuing attention, and leaders \nwho maintain them to serve our nation's political life--leaders like \nLeo Marshall who have adapted those parties to the realities of our \nday--deserve our thanks and our admiration.\n  Mr. President, the great American humorist Will Rogers was as wise as \nhe was amusing, and never more so than when he said, ``God will look \nyou over, not for medals, diplomas or degrees-- but for scars!'' \nWilmington's Leo Marshall need fear no such examination; he bears the \nhonorable scars of many a political battle, all of them acquired in the \nservice of his city and his party, but also on behalf of his state and \nnation. He does not often make the headlines, but he has made his mark \non the history of his community, and that is the truest legacy of \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13616-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMENDATION OF DR.

David is a distinguished Ohioan, who \nhas helped to enhance the economic vitality and environmental quality \nof my State and the Northeast-Midwest region.\n  Dr. Sweet has been dean of the Levin College of Urban Affairs at \nCleveland State University since 1978. He has expanded that institution \nand developed it into a well-respected research center that focuses on \npublic service. Before joining Cleveland State, David served in several \nhigh-ranking positions within Ohio's State government. He was a member \nof the Public Utilities Commission, director of the Department of \nEconomic and Community Development, chairman of the Ohio Energy \nEmergency Commission, and secretary of the Ohio Developmental Financing \nCommission.\n  David actually served four 3-year terms on the Northeast-Midwest \nInstitute's Board of Directors, and he was elected chairman from 1995 \nto 1998. He has provided stable leadership, offered a wealth of ideas, \nand advanced the Institute's credibility. The Northeast-Midwest \nInstitute provides policy research for the bipartisan Northeast-Midwest \nSenate Coalition and its Great Lakes Task Force, which I co-chair with \nSenator Carl Levin of Michigan.\n  Mr. President, I again want to commend David Sweet for his service on \nthe board of the Northeast-Midwest Institute. He has provided valued \ncounsel and helped increase that organization's reputation and \neffectiveness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13616-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL LINDA J. STIERLE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor Brigadier General Linda J. Stierle as she retires after twenty-\nnine years of active duty service in the United States Air Force. \nGeneral Stierle culminates her distinguished career as the Director of \nMedical Readiness and Nursing Services in the Office of the Air Force \nSurgeon General. She is the first Nurse Corps officer to be appointed \nas the Director of Medical Readiness for the Air Force Medical Service. \nUnder her direction, the medical readiness doctrine has been \nreengineered to be faster, lighter, and more responsive to the needs of \nthe fighting force. Thanks to her extraordinary leadership, the Air \nForce Medical Service is positioned to fully support the Air Force's \nnew Expeditionary Air Force structure in meeting current and future \ncontingencies.\n  General Stierle's distinguished career began in 1970 when she \nreceived a direct commission in the Air Force Nurse Corps as a second \nlieutenant. Highlights of her diverse and challenging career include \nserving as Director of the Department of Nursing at two of the Air \nForce's largest medical centers--David Grant USAF Medical Center, \nTravis Air Force Base, California, and Wilford Hall USAF Medical \nCenter, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. Prior to her current position, \nshe served as the Command Nurse, Office of the Command Surgeon, Air \nMobility Command, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, where she provided \nleadership and oversight of nursing services for 12 medical treatment \nfacilities and the worldwide Aeromedical Evacuation System.\n  Mr. President, more than fifty years ago, as I was recovering in a \nmilitary hospital, I began a unique relationship with military nurses. \nGeneral Stierle embodies what I know military nurses to be--strong, \nprofessional leaders who are committed to serve their fellow comrades \nin arms and their country. General Stierle's many meritorious awards \nand decorations demonstrate her contributions in a tangible way, but it \nis the legacy she leaves behind for the Air Force Nurse Corps for which \nwe are most appreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate General \nStierle on her outstanding career of exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/01/senate-section/article/S13616-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13616-S13617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AUTHORIZING OF SENATE REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD.
