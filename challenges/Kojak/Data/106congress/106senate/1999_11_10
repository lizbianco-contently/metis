Madam President, perhaps my colleagues have already noticed \nthat the Senate seems to be extraordinarily well organized and \neffective today and there is a reason for that. With apologies from the \nChaplain and the majority leader, I think we should note that a \nsignificant milestone in the 210-year course of the Senate's history is \ntaking place. Never before has a team composed entirely of women \nMembers and staff opened the day's proceedings. Today's remarkable \noccasion reminds Members how much the Senate's collective face has \nchanged and improved in recent years.\n  The Senate has benefited from the service of 27 female Senators since \nthe Honorable Rebecca Felton of Georgia first held that position on \nNovember 21, 1922, and particularly since 1932, when Hattie Caraway of \nArkansas became the first woman elected to the Senate. While Senator \nFelton served only 2 days, Ms. Caraway's service continued until 1945, \nand she became the first woman to chair a Senate Committee.\n  Another pioneering woman Senator was Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, \nand the Presiding Officer today, Senator Collins, also hails from that \nState of Maine. Mrs. Smith joined the Senate in 1949 and served until \n1973. During her distinguished career, she openly criticized the \ntactics of fellow Senator Joseph McCarthy in a 1950 speech entitled ``A \nDeclaration of Conscience,'' and became a Presidential candidate in \n1964--partially, I believe, because of that famous speech.\n  Following in these formidable steps was Nancy Landon Kassebaum, now \nthe wife of former Senator and majority leader, Howard Baker of \nTennessee. Her nearly 20-year career in the Senate became a model for \nmany women to come. My first few months as majority leader involved a \nlot of issues but one of them is the now famous Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \nwith regard to portable health issues. She was determined that before \nshe left the Senate she was going to leave an indelible mark, and she \ndid for many reasons but for that piece of legislation in particular.\n  In January 1993 as the Senators of the 103rd Congress took the oath \nof office, an unprecedented six women assumed their place on the floor. \nSince that time, the number of women Senators has grown to nine.\n  In recent years, the role of women officers has continued to grow, as \nwell. In 1985, Jo-Anne Coe became the first woman to serve as Secretary \nof the Senate. In 1991, Martha Pope became the first female Sergeant at \nArms. In 1995, Elizabeth Letchworth became the first Secretary of the \nmajority for the Republicans and presently still holds that position. \nCurrently, women serve as: Assistant Secretary (Sharon Zelaska), Deputy \nSergeant at Arms (Loretta Symms), Assistant Parliamentarian (Elizabeth \nMacDonough), Assistant Journal Clerk (Myra Baran), Assistant \nLegislative Clerk (Kathie Alvarez), Bill Clerk (Mary Anne Clarkson), \nAssistant Secretary for the Minority (Lula Davis), and Republican Floor \nAssistant (Laura Martin). They all do a fantastic job, and we \nappreciate their service so much. They have been involved in a lot of \nactivities in the last year, some of it they would just as soon have \nbeen able to miss, but they have done a great job every time they have \nbeen called upon.\n  Over the years, the Senate has changed as an ever-increasing number \nof women ran for and were elected to public office. Since the end of \nWorld War II, there has been a steady increase in the number of women \nserving this institution as legislative clerks and other appointed \nofficials. This is a historic day and a long time in coming--too long. \nI am proud it happened under my watch.\n  To the women in the Chamber today and all of those who serve \nelsewhere in the Senate, let me take a moment to say thank you and \nextend my personal best wishes to all of our leaders, women officers of \nthe Senate, and remind people just how much we appreciate their hard \nwork and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14438-5", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14438-S14439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the bankruptcy reform legislation with up to 4 hours of debate on \nthe Hatch amendment No. 2771 regarding drugs. I must say to my \ncolleagues, this bill is moving very slowly. The Democratic leader and \nI, Tom Daschle, have agreed we would let the amendments go forward and \nlet the Members have an opportunity to work their will, but we also \nwant to get this important legislation passed; our intent is to get it \ndone today. As with other bills, we are going to stick with this. If I \nhave to file cloture to bring it to conclusion, I will do that. I have \navoided doing that because I want to show good faith and trust that \nSenators will stick to the issue and find a way to complete the \nlegislation. We cannot leave it on the sidetrack indefinitely or have \nit tie up the Senate's time much longer because we have a number of \nbills we need to pass today, tonight, Friday, or whenever we are going \nto wrap up this session.\n  Following the use or yielding back of that debate time on amendment \nNo. 2771, the Senate will proceed to at least three stacked rollcall \nvotes beginning with the Hatch amendment, to be followed with votes on \nthe nominations of Carol Moseley-Braun and Linda Morgan. Those votes \nare expected to occur between 12 and 1 p.m. at the latest. I hope it \ncan actually occur earlier because we do have some conflicts of which \nwe are trying to be cognizant.\n  Senators who have amendments pending to the bill or amendments they \nexpect to offer are encouraged to work with the bill's managers so \nthose amendments can be disposed of in a timely manner. I hope a large \nnumber of them will be accepted or withdrawn. Senators can expect votes \nto occur\n\n[[Page S14439]]\n\nthroughout today's session and into the evening.\n  For the information of all Senators, progress has been made on the \nappropriations bills. It is hoped the Senate can vote on the remaining \nappropriations today or early next week. I realize that doesn't please \na lot of Senators, but while I think great progress has been made, and \nI did have occasion to talk to the President a few minutes ago, I think \nnow our biggest problem is just the physical ability to get the \npaperwork done and the House vote, and then have it come to the Senate \nand complete action.\n  However, the Senate has been known to act with lightning speed when \nit makes up its mind. I hope we can do that this time.\n  Thanks again to the women officers of the Senate for the work they do \nand for being here today. I hope we can keep Members in place the rest \nof the day and we can wrap this up by sundown.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14439-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of an \namendment offered by Senator Hatch and by Senator Abraham and by me. \nThis amendment contains the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine \nAntiproliferation Act of 1999. It is a comprehensive \nantimethamphetamine bill that I am grateful to have the opportunity of \nsaying is built upon what we called DEFEAT Meth legislation that I \nintroduced earlier this year. It reflects a tremendous amount of truly \nbipartisan work by the members of the Judiciary Committee cooperating \nto address a threat which was once thought to have been very localized \nbut is a threat now that is literally reaching from sea to sea.\n  The reason for the level of bipartisan effort, of course, in crafting \nthis bill is the recognition by all involved that it is needed to \ncombat one of the fastest growing threats to America, the explosive \nproblem of methamphetamine. When I say explosive, I do not just refer \nto the fact that those cooking or producing methamphetamines are using \ndangerous chemicals that often result in explosions and house fires. It \nhas exploded in terms of growth across our culture, and we need to \ncurtail it.\n\n[[Page S14440]]\n\n  Today we are blessed and privileged to live in a period of great \nnational prosperity, but with prosperity sometimes comes apathy or \ncomplacency. Unfortunately, this is the perfect breeding ground for \ndrug abuse. Worse still, apathy and complacency not only foster drug \nabuse, they hamper our society's ability to combat drug abuse and other \nsocial ills. We have not been combating drug abuse effectively enough \nas a culture, and for that reason we have been working on this measure \nto increase and elevate our effectiveness against this most dangerous \nof drugs.\n  As I have noted many times before, under this administration we have \nbeen backsliding in the war against drugs. Marijuana use by 8th graders \nhas increased 176 percent since 1992, and cocaine and heroin use among \n10th graders has more than doubled in the last 7 years. And now we need \nto add to these failings the burgeoning epidemic of methamphetamines.\n  Methamphetamines have had their roots on the west coast and for a \nlong time in other parts of the country, but the epidemic has now \nexploded in middle America. Meth in the 1990s is what cocaine was in \nthe 1980s and heroin was in the 1970s. It is currently the largest drug \nthreat we face in my home State of Missouri. Unfortunately, it may be \ncoming soon to a city or town near you. If you wanted to design a drug \nto have the worst possible effect on your community, you would probably \ndesign methamphetamine. It is highly addictive, highly destructive, \ncheap, and it is easy to manufacture.\n  To give you an idea of the scope of the problem, in 1992 law \nenforcement seized 2 clandestine meth labs in my home State of \nMissouri; by 1994, there were 14 seizures; by 1998, there were 679 \nclandestine meth lab seizures in the State of Missouri alone.\n  When we talk about a clandestine meth lab, we are talking about a \nplace where people are making or manufacturing methamphetamines. Based \non the figures collected so far this year, however, the number will \njump again this year to over 800 meth labs to be seized in the State of \nMissouri.\n  Let us put that in perspective: 2 in 1992, 800 in 1999. By any \ndefinition, this is a problem that commands our attention. And with \nthis growth have come all kinds of difficult challenges and problems. \nAs meth use has increased, domestic abuse, child abuse, burglaries, and \nmeth-related murders have also increased. From 1992 to 1998, meth-\nrelated emergency room incidents increased 63 percent.\n  What is most unacceptable is that meth is ensnaring our children. In \n1997, the percentage of 12th graders who used meth was double the 1992 \nlevel. In recent conversations I have had with local law enforcement \nofficers in Missouri, they estimate that as many as 10 percent of high \nschool students know the recipe for methamphetamines. In fact, one need \nonly log onto the Internet to find scores of web sites giving detailed \ninstructions about how to set up your own meth lab or production \nfacility. This is unacceptable.\n\n  We in the Congress have taken these indicators seriously. In the past \ntwo appropriations cycles, we have appropriated $11 million and then \n$24.5 million for the drug enforcement administration to train local \nlaw enforcement officials in the interdiction, finding, discovering, \nand then cleaning up of methamphetamine labs.\n  Despite these appropriations, the meth problem continues to grow. I \nbelieve it is time we dedicate more resources to stopping this scourge \nonce and for all. So that is why I am so committed to passing S. 486, \nthe Methamphetamine Antiproliferation Act of 1999, as part of this \nbill.\n  This amendment provides the necessary weapons to fight the growing \nmeth problem in this country, including the authorization of $5.5 \nmillion for DEA programs to train State and local law enforcement in \ntechniques used in meth investigation. There is $9.5 million for hiring \nnew Drug Enforcement Administration agents to assist State and local \nlaw enforcement in small and midsized communities. There is $15 million \nfor school and community-based meth abuse and addiction prevention \nprograms; $10 million for the treatment of meth addicts; and $15 \nmillion to the Office of the National Drug Control Policy to combat \ntrafficking of meth in designated high-intensity drug trafficking areas \nwhich have had great success in Missouri and the Midwest in bringing \nattention to, focus upon, and eradication of the methamphetamine \nproblem.\n  This bill also amends the sentencing guidelines by increasing the \nmandatory minimum sentences for manufacturing meth and significantly \nincreasing mandatory minimum sentences if the offense created a risk of \nharm to the life of a minor or an incompetent.\n  As I have traveled across my own State of Missouri, I have learned \nabout cases where methamphetamines were being produced in the presence \nof children--children contaminated chemically by the processes and the \nbyproducts of meth production. It is time we make a clear statement \nthat we will not sacrifice our children on the altar of methamphetamine \nproduction. We must have serious increased, mandatory minimum sentences \nfor putting at risk the life of a child in the creation and development \nof methamphetamines.\n  Furthermore, the amendment includes meth paraphernalia in the Federal \nlist of illegal paraphernalia.\n  For a long time, drug paraphernalia relating to other serious drug \nscourges has been outlawed. The maintenance or development of, and the \nutilization of paraphernalia in those settings has been inappropriate \nand wrong. Now we are going to add meth paraphernalia to that Federal \nlist of illegal paraphernalia.\n  By focusing on reducing the supply through interdiction and \npunishment, we will make some progress, but that progress is not \nenough. The amendment authorizes substantial resources for education \nand prevention targeted specifically at the problem of meth. As I said \nearlier, law enforcement in Missouri tells me 10 percent of the high \nschool students know the recipe for meth. I want 100 percent of the \nhigh school students to know that meth is the recipe for disaster.\n  Meth presents us with a formidable challenge. We have faced other \nchallenges in the past, and we can face this challenge as well. In \nfact, the history of America is one of meeting challenges and \nsurpassing people's highest expectations. Meth is no exception. All it \nwill take is that we marshal our will and we channel the great, \nindomitable American spirit. If we focus our energy on this problem, we \ncan add substantially to the safety and to the health and to the future \nand opportunities for our young people. Through legislative efforts \nlike this amendment, we will meet this new meth challenge and defeat \nit, and I urge Members of this body to work hard to make sure this \neffort to defeat meth becomes a part of the law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleague will yield for 1 second, I ask \nunanimous consent that following the Senator from Utah and the Senator \nfrom Vermont, I may then speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senators Ashcroft, Abraham, Hutchinson, Helms, Grams, and \nAllard that contains new and responsible measures aimed primarily at \ncurbing the manufacturing, trafficking, and abuse of methamphetamine, a \ndestructive drug that is sweeping across our country. We must act now \nto stop this plague before it destroys the lives of many of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I hope that the administration will take advantage of this \nlegislation and finally begin, in its seventh year, to take serious \nsteps to enforce our drug laws. Sadly, the Clinton-Gore administration \nhas failed miserably at keeping drugs away from our youth. The \nadministration recently boasted that reported illicit drug use by \nchildren 12 to 17 years of age is down this year. What the \nadministration is trying to conceal, however, is that, since it took \noffice, drug use among this same group of children more than doubled. \nEven with the current dip, the rate is still nearly twice what it was \nwhen President Clinton and Vice-President Gore took office. America's \nhistory of fighting illegal drugs has been long and tiring, but with so \nmany Americans' lives being ruined by this drug, now is not the time to \ngive up--it is a time to fight smarter and harder.\n\n[[Page S14441]]\n\n  This amendment will provide law enforcement with several effective \ntools, including proven prevention and treatment programs, that will \nhelp us turn the tide of proliferation of methamphetamine use. A \nsignificant portion of this amendment reflects language that was passed \nunanimously in the Judiciary Committee earlier this year. This \nlanguage, which enjoyed the sponsorship of Senators Leahy, Ashcroft, \nFeinstein, DeWine, Biden, Grassley, Thurmond, and Kohl, represented a \nbipartisan effort to combat methamphetamine manufacturing and \ntrafficking in America.\n  Methamphetamine, also known on the streets as ``meth,'' ``speed,'' \n``crank,'' ``ice,'' and ``crystal meth,'' is a highly toxic and \naddictive stimulant that severely affects the central nervous system, \ninduces uncontrollabe, violent behavior and extreme psychiatric and \npsychological symptoms, and eventually leads some of its abusers to \nsuicide or even murder. Methamphetamine, first popularized by outlaw \nbiker gangs in the late 1970's, is now being manufactured in makeshift \nlaboratories across the country by criminals who are determined to \nundermine our drug laws and profit from the addiction of others.\n  So what can we do about the problem? Three years ago, I authored, and \nCongress passed, the Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. This \nlegislation, which also enjoyed bipartisan support, aimed at curbing \nthe diversion of commonly used precursor chemicals and mandated strict \nreporting requirements on their sale. This law has allowed the DEA, \nalong with the help of industry, to stop large quantities of precursor \nchemicals from being purchased in the United States and being used to \nmanufacture methamphetamine. But, as the methamphetamine problem \ncontinues to grow, more can and should be done to help law enforcement \nuncover, arrest, and hold accountable those who produce this drug.\n  The methamphetamine threat differs in kind from the threat of other \nillegal drugs because methamphetamine can be made from readily \navailable and legal chemicals, and because it poses serious danagers to \nboth human life and the environment. According to a report prepared by \nthe Community Epidemiology Work Group, which is part of the National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse, methamphetamine abuse levels ``remain high . . \n. and there is strong evidence to suggest this drug will continue to be \na problem in west coast areas and to spread to other areas of the \nUnited States.'' The reasons given for this ominous prediction are that \nmethamphetamine can be produced easily in small, clandestine \nlaboratories, and that the chemicals used to make methamphetamine are \nreadily available.\n  This threat is real and immediate, and the numbers are telling. \nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration--DEA, the number of \nlabs cleaned up by the administration has almost doubled each year \nsince 1995. Last year, more than 5,500 amphetamine and methamphetamine \nlabs were seized by DEA and State and local law enforcement officials, \nand millions of dollars were spent on cleaning up the pollutants and \ntoxins created and left behind by operators of these labs. In Utah \nalone, there were 266 lab seizures last year, a number which elevated \nUtah to the unenviable position of being ranked third in the Nation for \nhighest per capita clandestine lab seizures.\n  The problem with the high number of manufacturing labs is compounded \nby the fact that the chemicals and substances utilized in the \nmanufacturing process are unstable, volatile, and highly combustible. \nThe smallest amounts of these chemicals, when mixed improperly, can \ncause explosions and fires. And of course, most of those operating \nmethamphetamine labs are not scientists, but rather unskilled \ncriminals, who are completely apathetic to the destruction that is \ninherent in the manufacturing process. It is even more frightening when \nyou consider that many of these labs are found in residences, motels, \ntrailers, and even automobiles, and many are operated in the presence \nof children.\n  I will never forget the tragedy of the three young children who were \nburned to death when a methamphetamine lab, operated by their mother in \na trailer home in California, exploded and caught fire, as reported in \nan article:\n  ``Meth Madness: Home deaths ruled felony murder,'' in the San Diego \nUnion Tribune, 11/30/96. I honestly do not know which is worse: using \nmethamphetamine or manufacturing it. Either way, methamphetamine is \nkilling our kids.\n  Another problem we face is that it doesn't take a lot of ingenuity or \nresources to manufacture methamphetamine. This drug is manufactured \nfrom readily available and legal substances, and there are countless \nInternet web sites that provide detailed instructions for making \nmethamphetamine. Anyone who has access to the Internet has access to \nthe recipe for this deadly drug. In fact, one pro-drug Internet site \ncontains more than 70 links to sites that provide detailed information \non how to manufacture illicit drugs, including methamphetamine.\n  Let me take a moment to highlight some of the provisions of this \namendment that will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement in \npreventing the proliferation of methamphetamine manufacturing in \nAmerica.\n  This amendment will bolster the DEA's ability to combat the \nmanufacturing and trafficking of methamphetamine, by authorizing the \ncreation of satellite offices and the hiring of additional agents to \nassist State and local law enforcement officials. More than any other \ndrug, methamphetamine manufacturers and traffickers operate in small \ntowns and rural areas. Unfortunately, rural law enforcement agencies \noften are overwhelmed and in dire need of the DEA's expertise in \nconducting methamphetamine investigations. In addition, this amendment \nwill assist State and local officials in handling the dangerous toxic \nwaste left behind by methamphetamine labs.\n  Another important section of the bill will help prevent the \nmanufacture of methamphetamine by prohibiting the dissemination of drug \nrecipes on the Internet. As mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of \nsites on the Internet that describe how to manufacture methamphetamine. \nThese step-by-step instructions will be illegal under this bill if the \nperson posting the information or the person receiving the information \nintends to engage in activity that violates our drug laws.\n  In 1992, Congress passed a law that made it illegal for anyone to \nsell or offer for sale drug paraphernalia. This law resulted in the \nclosing of numerous so-called ``head shops.'' Unfortunately, now some \nmerchants sell illegal drug paraphernalia on the Internet. This bill \nwill amend the anti-drug paraphernalia statute to clarify that the ban \nincludes Internet advertising for the sale of controlled substances and \ndrug paraphernalia. The provision will also prohibit a web site that \ndoes not sell drug paraphernalia from allowing other sites that do from \nadvertising on its web site.\n  This amendment contains many references to the drug amphetamine, a \nlesser-known, but no-less dangerous drug. Other than for a slight \ndifference in potency, amphetamine is manufactured, sold, and used in \nthe same manner as methamphetamine. And, amphetamine labs pose the same \ndangers as methamphetamine labs. Indeed, every law enforcement officer \nwith whom I have spoken agreed that the penalties for amphetamine \nshould be the same as those for methamphetamine. For these reasons, \nthis amendment seeks to equalize the punishment for manufacturing and \ntrafficking the two drugs.\n  To counter the dangers that manufacturing drugs like methamphetamine \ninflict on human life and on the environment, this amendment imposes \nstiffer penalties on manufacturers of all illegal drugs when their \nactions create a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the \nenvironment. The inherent dangers of killing innocent bystanders and \ncontaminating the environment warrant a punitive penalty that will \ndeter criminals from engaging in the activity.\n  This amendment also seeks to keep all drugs away from children and to \npunish severely those who prey on our children, especially while at \nschool away from their parents. Indeed, studies indicate that drug use \ngoes hand in hand with poor academic performance. To this end, this \namendment would increase the penalties for distributing illegal drugs \nto minors and for distributing illegal drugs near schools and\n\n[[Page S14442]]\n\nother locations frequented by juveniles. The amendment also would \nrequire school districts that receive Federal funds to have policies \nexpelling students who bring drugs on school grounds either in \nfelonious quantities or with an intent to distribute in the same manner \nas students who bring firearms to school. Additionally, this amendment \nwould allow school districts to use Federal education funds to provide \ncompensation and services to elementary and secondary school students \nwho are victims of school violence as defined by state law.\n  While we know that vigorous law enforcement measures are necessary to \ncombat the scourge of illegal drugs, we also recognize that we must act \nto prevent our youth from ever starting down the path of drug abuse. We \nalso must find ways to treat those who have become trapped in \naddiction. For these reasons, the amendment contains several \nsignificant prevention and treatment provisions.\n  Arguably, the most important treatment provision in this amendment \noffers an innovative approach to how opiate-addicted patients can seek \nand obtain treatment. As science and medicine continue to make \nsignificant strides in developing drugs that promise to make treatment \nmore effective, we must pave the way to ensure that these drugs can be \nprescribed in an effective manner and in an appropriate treatment \nsetting. Indeed, this provision does exactly this, by fostering a \ndecentralized system of treating heroin addicts with the new generation \nof anti-addiction medications that are under development.\n\n  By cutting the existing redtape that serves as a substantial \ndisincentive for qualified physicians to treat drug addicts, this \namendment acts as a spur for private sector pharmaceutical firms, \nworking in close partnership with academic and government researchers \nand the drug abuse treatment community, to develop the next generation \nof anti-addiction medications for opiate addicts. This new system to \ntreat heroin addicts can also act as a model that can be expanded in \nthe future, as anti-addictive medications are developed, to encompass \nthe treatment of other forms of drug addiction.\n  I want to commend Senators Levin, Biden, and Moynihan who have worked \ntirelessly with me in the best spirit of bipartisanship to bring about \nnot just this measure but also to bring about the day in the future \nthat this new treatment paradigm becomes the norm for treating patients \naddicted to drugs. I also want to recognize the efforts of the experts \nat the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services for \nproviding their views on this measure.\n  Learning how to treat drug addiction is an essential component in \nAmerica's battle to conquer drug abuse. I am proud to have worked with \nmy colleagues in creating this new approach that undoubtedly will \nimprove the ability for many to obtain successful treatment.\n  I also support the provision of this amendment that contains the \nPowder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999. This measure strengthens Federal \nlaw by increasing the penalties against powder cocaine dealers by \nreducing from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person \nmust be convicted of distributing in order to receive a mandatory 5-\nyear minimum sentence in Federal prison. By increasing the penalty for \npowder cocaine offenses, this measure fairly and effectively reduces \nthe sentencing disparity between powder and crack cocaine.\n  It is important to our criminal justice system that the disparity in \nsentences between powder and crack cocaine be reduced. Many people whom \nI respect, including law enforcement officials and academics, believe \nthat the harsher penalties for crack cocaine generally unfairly affect \nminority Americans and the poor. Senator Sessions, whom I admire a \ngreat deal, was an accomplished Federal prosecutor for 12 years. He \nbelieves passionately that Congress should reduce the disparity in \nsentences between powder and crack cocaine. While my own solution for \nreducing the disparity differs somewhat from that suggested by Senator \nSessions, he offers a prominent example of an experienced prosecutor \nwho believes that this disparity should be reduced.\n  This legislation will reduce the differential between the quantity of \npowder and crack cocaine required to trigger a 5-year mandatory minimum \nsentence from 100 to 1 to 10 to 1--the same ratio proposed by the \nadministration. But this legislation will accomplish that goal--not by \nmaking sentences for crack cocaine dealers more lenient--but rather by \nincreasing sentences for powder cocaine dealers. We should not reduce \nthe Federal penalties for crack cocaine dealers. It would send \nabsolutely the wrong message to the American people, especially given \nthe disturbing increase in teenage drug use during much of the Clinton \nadministration.\n  This measure is the right approach at the right time. I commend \nSenator Abraham for his tireless efforts in this matter. Reducing the \ndisparity between crack and powder cocaine will help maintain the \nconfidence of all Americans in the Federal criminal justice system and \nwill provide more appropriate punishment for powder cocaine violations.\n  The amendment I have offered also contains a provision that requires \nthe FBI to prepare a report assessing the threat posed by President \nClinton's grant of clemency to FALN and Los Macheteros terrorists. As \nis now well known, the grant of clemency freed terrorists belonging to \ngroups that openly advocate a war against the United States and its \ncitizens. And, the FALN and Los Macheteros--including the clemency \nrecipients--have actively waged such a war by, among other acts, \nplanting more than 130 bombs in public places, including shopping malls \nand restaurants. Those bombs killed several people, maimed others, and \ndestroyed property worth millions of dollars.\n  Over the past several months, the Judiciary Committee has sought \nanswers to the many questions raised by the President's clemency grant. \nUnfortunately, we have been repeatedly stymied by this administration's \ndecision to deploy Executive privilege as a shield against public \naccountability. Despite this stonewalling, the committee's \ninvestigation has led to the troubling conclusion that the release of \nthese individuals may well have increased the risk of domestic \nterrorism posed by the FALN and Los Macheteros. This amendment insures \nthat the FBI can fully assess this risk, and that the Congress and the \nAmerican people are fully apprised of the FBI's findings.\n  In conclusion, I believe that this amendment contains many tools \nessential to our struggle against illegal drug manufacturing and use. \nWe can defeat those who make and sell illicit drugs, and we must fight \nthis plague for the sake of our children and grandchildren. Drug use is \na poisonous, nationwide epidemic; it is a battle we must fight until we \nhave succeeded. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHutchinson, Helms, Allard, and Grams be added as original cosponsors of \nthe Hatch-Ashcroft-Abraham drug amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With the distinguished Senator from Utah and the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa here, I ask unanimous consent to be \nable to proceed not on the amendment but on the bill for certainly not \nto exceed 12 minutes, just to let everybody know where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand this time is not coming out of the time of \neither side, just so people understand.\n  Mr. President, yesterday we made some progress on the bill and were \nable to clear 22 amendments to improve it. Those were amendments \noffered by both Democrats and Republicans. Senator Torricelli, the \nranking member of the appropriate subcommittee, and I have been working \nin good faith with Senator Grassley, the chairman of the appropriate \nsubcommittee, and Senator Hatch, the chairman of the full committee, to \nclear amendments. We will try to make some more progress on amendments \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S14443]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah for their \nwillingness to accept my amendment to provide that the expenses needed \nto protect debtors and their families from domestic violence is \nproperly considered in bankruptcy proceedings. Domestic violence \nremains a serious problem in our society. We need to do all we can to \nprotect victims and potential victims of domestic violence.\n  Some of the other amendments we accepted are also quite important. \nFor example, we improved the bill by accepting an amendment offered by \nSenators Grassley, Torricelli, Specter, Feingold, and Biden, giving \nbankruptcy judges the discretion to waive the $175 filing fee for \nchapter 7 cases for debtors whose annual income is less than 125 \npercent of the poverty level. Bankruptcy is the only civil proceeding \nthat in forma pauperis filing status is not permitted. This amendment \ncorrects that anomaly.\n  We also accepted a Feingold-Specter amendment which improves the bill \nby striking the requirement that a debtor's attorney must pay a \ntrustee's attorney's fees if the debtor is not ``substantially \njustified'' in filing for chapter 7. The bill's current requirement \nthat a debtor's attorney must pay a trustee's attorneys' fees could \nchill eligible debtors from filing chapter 7 because they could fear \nthey would have to pay future attorney's fees. This is something we had \ntried to correct when the committee considered the bill. I am glad we \nhave finally done so.\n  I commend Senators who came to the floor on Friday and Monday and \nyesterday to offer their amendments. Despite only 4 hours of debate on \nFriday, and 4 hours on Monday, and, of course, yesterday we had our \nparty caucuses, and we had extended debate on two nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendments on other matters, Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle have offered 49 amendments to improve the bill. And we \ndisposed of 27 of those so far in this debate.\n\n  I hope all Senators with amendments will continue to come to the \nfloor today to offer their relevant amendments.\n  But unfortunately, while we continue to make progress on the \nunderlying bill in some regards, the Senate's two votes rejecting \nimportant amendments offered by Senators Durbin and Dodd were missed \nopportunities to improve the bill.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment would have allowed us to confront \npredatory lending practices. Senator Dodd's would have provided some \nrestraint on the virtually unrestrained solicitation of young people by \nthe credit card industry.\n  I spoke earlier about the Austin Powers credit card campaign. Kids \ngoing into the movie theater to see ``Austin Powers'' were given a \nchance to get a credit card with a long credit line and get a free \nCoke, too, if they wanted, but they could also end up with 10-, 25- and \nalmost 30-percent interest payments. I think many who got that suddenly \nfound it was the most expensive soft drink they ever got at a movie.\n  These are the practices on which we ought to put some limits. It does \nnot help when the credit card companies come here crying crocodile \ntears that these children they have given credit cards to suddenly \nactually used them and have run up huge debts, or the people who have \nbeen given unrestrained credit cards actually use them and have run up \nhuge debts. So I commend Senators Durbin and Dodd for their amendments. \nWe actually should have accepted both of them.\n  Most importantly, yesterday the Senate took several actions that will \nmake it much harder to enact bankruptcy reform legislation. The Senate \nrejected the Kennedy amendment to provide a real minimum-wage increase \nand, on a virtually party-line vote, chose to adopt an amendment that \nincludes special interest tax breaks that are not paid for, under the \nguise of being a real increase in the minimum wage, when in fact it is \nnot.\n  The President has now promised to veto the bill if it reaches his \ndesk in this form. He noted that the Republican majority used its \namendment ``as a cynical tool to advance special interest tax breaks,'' \nwhich it was.\n  The Senate's actions yesterday in these regards were both unfortunate \nand unwise.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this morning's editorial from the \nWashington Post about the bankruptcy bill and the Senate's action \nyesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, November 10, 1999]\n\n                         What Bankruptcy Bill?\n\n       The Senate spent much of yesterday debating and coming to \n     wrong conclusions on the minimum wage and tax cuts. It \n     intended then to debate propositions having to do with school \n     aid, agribusiness, drug policy and the future of East Timor. \n     Under an agreement between the parties, the results of these \n     deliberations were to be attached as amendments or political \n     ornaments, take your pick, to an underlying bill that would \n     significantly tighten bankruptcy law. But very little debate \n     seemed likely on the bill itself, and that is wrong. Aside \n     perhaps from the minimum wage, the underlying bill is more \n     important than the ornamentation. In several respects it is \n     defective and has the potential to do serious harm.\n       The question in bankruptcy law is always the same: how to \n     achieve a balance between society's interests in seeing that \n     people pay their debts and the need to prevent debtors from \n     being permanently ruined by them. The strong economy in \n     recent years, together with competition in the credit card \n     industry, has produced a sharp increase in consumer use of \n     credit. There has been a related spike, now perhaps \n     subsiding, in bankruptcies. The bill seeks to make sure that \n     people don't take undue advantage of the bankruptcy laws--\n     that those who can reasonably be expected to pay at least a \n     part of their debts aren't excused entirely. That's plainly \n     fair, and there seems to be broad agreement that the law need \n     some toughening. But critics, including the administration \n     and a number of civil rights groups, believe the legislation \n     tilts too far.\n       There are multiple issues, but basically the administration \n     would make it easier for people at or below the median income \n     to qualify for the kind of bankruptcy in which most debts are \n     excused, and harder for creditors to dislodge them. The \n     administration would also like to impose additional \n     disclosure and other requirements on credit card companies, \n     whose blandishments it believes are partly responsible for \n     the current problem.\n       But the House already has passed by a veto-proof 313 to 108 \n     an even tougher bankruptcy bill, and the complexity of the \n     issues together with the impatience of the Senate leaves the \n     administration in a weak position. The Senate yesterday voted \n     along party lines for a slower minimum wage increase than the \n     president wants, together with a costly and regressive tax \n     cut. He says he'll veto a bankruptcy bill to which those are \n     attached, as, at least in the case of the tax cut, he should. \n     What he'll do if eventually the bankruptcy bill is sent to \n     him separately is unclear.\n       What Congress should do, before it sends him the bill, is \n     make sure that in the name of financial responsibility it \n     doesn't unduly squeeze people who, because of job loss, \n     family breakup, medical bills, etc. can't help themselves. It \n     isn't clear that in the episodic legislative process thus far \n     that balance has been achieved.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. In addition to those provisions adopted yesterday, I want \nto raise again the question of the costs and the burdens of this bill. \nWe have not talked here about the costs of this bill. But according to \nthe Congressional Budget Office--and this is what everybody watching \nwho is interested in this debate ought to stop and ask themselves: Is \nthis an improvement in our bankruptcy laws or are the taxpayers going \nto pay for it?\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The \ncost to the Federal Government, estimated by CBO, is at least $218 \nmillion over the next 5 years.\n  Much of the cost will be borne by our bankruptcy and Federal courts \nwithout any provision to assist them in fulfilling the mandates of this \nbill. Dockets are already overcrowded in our bankruptcy courts. We are \nnot providing new judges. We are now suddenly telling those bankruptcy \njudges and Federal judges to carry an even heavier burden, but we will \nnot give them additional resources. As a practical matter, somebody is \ngoing to have to pay. We are going to have to pay because the courts \nwill get so clogged, the reaction will be to improve that, and we will \nhave to pay for that.\n  We have to ask, who are the principal beneficiaries? Right now, they \nare the companies that make up the credit industry. I searched high and \nlow in the bill for the provisions by which these companies are asked \nto pay for these mandates that benefit them or even contribute to the \ncosts and burdens of the bill, a bill that they support. If\n\n[[Page S14444]]\n\nthey are getting these huge benefits, are they required to pay anything \nfor them? They are not. I can find no provisions by which credit card \ncompanies and others who expect to receive a multibillion-dollar \nwindfall from this bill will have to pay the added costs of this \nmeasure.\n  Investing a couple hundred million of taxpayers' money to make \nseveral billion dollars for the credit card industry might seem to be a \ngood business investment but not if the taxpayers have to pick up the \nbill to hand over a multibillion-dollar benefit to the credit card \ncompanies.\n  In addition to these costs to the Federal Government, there are the \nadditional mandates imposed on the private sector. We keep saying how \nwe want to keep Government off the back of the private sector. In fact, \nCBO estimates the private sector mandates imposed by just two sections \nof the bill will result in annual increased costs of between $280 \nmillion and $940 million a year. Are we willing to tell the private \nsector that with this bill we are, in effect, putting a tax on them of \n$280 million to $940 million a year, which over 5 years will amount to \nbetween $1.4 billion and $4.7 billion to be borne by the private \nsector? If we vote for this bill, are we going to tell them we just \ngave that kind of a tax increase to them?\n\n  The CBO estimate explains these costs are likely to be borne by the \nbankruptcy debtors, thereby ``reducing the pool of funds available to \ncreditors.'' You pay at the beginning or you pay in the end, but you \nare going to pay.\n  So all in all, this amounts to a bill of an estimated cost over 5 \nyears of $5 billion to be borne by taxpayers and debtors so the credit \nindustry can pocket another $5 billion. Not a bad day's work by the \ncredit industry lobbyists but not a good result for the American \npeople. They are going to be happy if they get the American taxpayers \nto give them $5 billion just like that. They ought to be awfully happy.\n  I asked last Friday that those who are proposing this bill to come \nforward and answer the simple question I posed then: What language in \nthe bill guarantees that any savings from this bill will be passed on \nto consumers? I continue to ask whether credit card interest rates will \nbe reduced by any savings created by this bill. Certainly the 25- to \n26- and 27-percent interest rates ought to be reduced. I continue to \nask whether credit fees will be reduced by any savings generated by \nprovisions of this bill. I continue to ask how the $400 per American \nfamily the proponents of the bill estimate will be saved by provisions \nof this bill are going to get to these families. Everybody says we are \nsaving money for the American families. So far all I see is a $5 \nbillion transfer from those American families to the credit card \nindustry.\n  I haven't heard or seen any answers to those basic questions. I think \nthose who say this is going to benefit the American public ought to be \nmore specific. CBO doesn't see it that way. They see a great transfer \nfrom the American public to one industry. For all that I can see, any \nsavings generated by this bill will be gobbled up in windfall profits \nfor the credit industry, without any guarantee of benefits for working \npeople, and with a $1 billion per year out-of-pocket cost to taxpayers \nand those in the bankruptcy system.\n  Mr. President, I understand time will now go back on the amendment. I \nthink we had a unanimous consent request at this point that when we \nwent back on the bill, the Senator from Minnesota was going to be \nrecognized.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand my colleague from Michigan \nhas wanted to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, apparently a UC had been entered into \nwhich had set in order speakers through Senator Wellstone. I know \nSenator Allard and I have been here for some time. I noticed Senator \nKennedy has joined us. We were hoping we might come up with another UC \nwhich would ensure continuing order in terms of the speakers; ideally, \nthe order in which we have been here. If that is possible, I would \nappreciate it. Therefore, that leads me to propose that following the \nspeech of Senator Wellstone, if we might then proceed in an order in \nwhich I would be allowed to speak next, followed by Senator Allard, \nfollowed by Senator Kennedy, if that is possible. If it is not, we \nwould be open to adjusting that. I am not sure how.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I prefer not to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What was the general time? I was just trying to \nconclude. I was going to be probably 10 or 15 minutes. If I thought \nthat the two Senators will be finished shortly after 11, that is fine.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I have no idea how long the Senator from \nMinnesota will be speaking. I will be speaking approximately 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I anticipate somewhere around 7 or 8 minutes for my \nremarks.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I want to \nmake sure I understand. Senator Wellstone, Senator Abraham, Senator \nAllard, and then Senator Kennedy, and then, perhaps after that, we \nwould go back and forth. The Senator from Vermont is going to want to \nspeak on the amendment at some point, too.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Vermont wish to add \nhimself to the sequence?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't I add myself after the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I assure the Senator from Iowa, if he wishes to speak at \nthat point, I will yield first to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleagues \ndiscuss this amendment. I want to zero in on what is the poison pill \nprovision of this amendment--no pun intended.\n  The cocaine provision in the Republican drug amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill would raise powder cocaine penalties to unacceptably \nhigh levels, forcing jail overcrowding without offering any concrete \nsolutions to drug addiction. That is the fundamental problem. In short, \nas much affection as I have for my colleague from Michigan and others, \nI think this provision is a disaster.\n  The authors say they want to fix racial disparities in crack \nsentencing by establishing tougher sentences for low-end powder cocaine \noffenders. In practice, this is going to make the disparities worse. \nThat is the problem. This provision capitalizes upon the common \nmisperception that powder cocaine is principally a ``white drug.'' It \nseeks to neutralize complaints of racism in the heavy sentences meted \nout almost exclusively to African American defendants for crack cocaine \noffenses. In reality, this provision will only worsen the problem of \ngross overrepresentation of minorities in prison for drug offenses. To \nthe existing flood of young minority males serving draconian sentences \nfor nonviolent low-level crack offenses, it will simply do the same for \nminor powder cocaine offenses.\n  Only low-end cocaine defendants will have their sentences changed \nunder the Republican proposal. The sentence for a participant in a 50-\ngram powder transaction will more than double from 27 months to 5 \nyears. Further, the Sentencing Commission's mandate will require it to \nmake comparable increases for lesser quantities. Yet the Commission has \ndocumented that as with crack, such low-level street dealers--and these \nare the ones who are going to be affected by this--of powder cocaine \nare ``primarily poor, minority youth, generally under the age of 18.'' \nAnd overall, minorities constitute over three-quarters of all current \npowder defendants. They also found that over half of the Federal powder \ndefendants are couriers or mules or lookouts--categories with the \nlowest income and lowest culpability and the highest representation of \nminorities. This amendment doesn't go after the kingpins. This \namendment, again, is going to have a disproportionate impact on \nminorities, on kids, on the young and on the poor.\n  I use this as an example. I am not trying to pick on the students. \nCollege\n\n[[Page S14445]]\n\nstudents at Yale or Harvard who suffer from substance abuse or sell \ncocaine out of their dorm rooms will not go to jail under this \nprovision. I have no doubt about that. Instead, the vast majority will \nonce again be low-income African American and Hispanic males.\n  I want to read from a statement before the Judiciary Committee--this \nis not my argument--from 27 former U.S. attorneys who now sit as judges \non the Federal court:\n\n       Having regularly reviewed presentence reports in cases \n     involving powder and crack cocaine, we can attest to the fact \n     that there is generally no consistent, meaningful difference \n     in the type of individuals involved. At the lower levels, the \n     steerers, lookouts, and street-sellers are generally \n     impoverished individuals with limited education whose \n     involvement with crack rather than powder cocaine is more a \n     result of demand than a conscious choice to sell one type of \n     drug rather than another. Indeed, in some cases, a person who \n     is selling crack one day is selling powder cocaine the next.\n\n  By raising powder cocaine penalties, the amendment reduces the gulf \nin sentencing between the two drugs, but it doesn't solve the \nunderlying problem. The real problem is that crack penalties are way \nout of proportion to those of other drugs. You are basically trying to \nargue that two wrongs make a right, and they don't. Reducing the \ntrigger quantity for a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for powder \ncocaine makes the penalties for both forms of cocaine \ndisproportionately severe compared to other drugs. The same U.S. \nattorneys say they ``disagree with those who suggest that the disparity \nin treatment of powder and crack cocaine should be remedied by altering \npenalties relating to powder cocaine.''\n  I emphasize this in the former U.S. attorneys' quote:\n\n       The penalties for powder cocaine . . . are severe and \n     should not be increased.\n\n  Mr. President, we need to stop and ask ourselves, what are we doing \nhere? If the trigger amount for powder is lowered, almost 10,000 \naddicts and small-time drug users will be added to the prison \npopulation over the next 10 years. That is what we are doing with this \namendment. The Bureau of Prisons will have to build six new prisons \njust to house these people. This will be at a cost to taxpayers of \napproximately $2 billion. In the next 20 years, the cost will escalate \nto over $5 billion, and in 30 years it will be $10.6 billion.\n  Haven't we learned yet that jails and prisons are not the sole \nanswer? There are more than 1.5 million people incarcerated in State \nand Federal prisons and local jails around the country. Another 100,000 \nyoung people are confined in juvenile institutions. These numbers have \ntripled in the past two decades. On any given day, one out of every \nthree African American men in their twenties is either in prison, in \njail, on probation, or on parole. I remember reading in the paper that \nthere are more African American men in their twenties--far more--in the \nState of California in prison than are in college.\n  We have one of the largest prison populations in the world. If more \nprisons were the sole solution to the problems of drugs and crime, then \nwe should be among the least addicted, safest countries on Earth.\n  Being ``tough on drugs'' makes for a great stump speech, but we also \nought to be smart, and we need to be smart. A landmark study of cocaine \nmarkets by the conservative Rand Corporation found that, dollar for \ndollar, providing treatment for cocaine users is 10 times more \neffective than drug interdiction schemes. A recent study by the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, has \nindicated that 48 percent of the need for drug treatment, not including \nalcohol abuse, is unmet in the United States--48 percent of the need is \nunmet. Surely, if we can find an endless supply of funding for housing \noffenders and building new prisons, then we must be able to rectify \nthis shortsighted lack of treatment.\n\n  Let me simply talk a moment about this disease of alcohol and drug \naddiction which costs our Nation $246 billion annually--almost $1,000 \nfor every man, woman, and child. There is so much new evidence, so many \nstudies, so much good science work, and we are so far behind the curve. \nWhy aren't we looking at the evidence, the data, the research, and the \nwork that is being done? This disease is treatable. Yet our Nation has \nan alcohol and drug treatment gap that is 50 percent nationally, 60 \npercent for women, and 80 percent for youth.\n  Are you ready for this? Since we are now going to throw yet even more \nof these kids--primarily Hispanic and African American--in jail and \nprison, access to youth drug treatment is particularly low, with only \none in five adolescents able to access drug or alcohol treatment \nservices. We don't provide the funding for the services or for the \ntreatment, and now we have an amendment that basically will assure that \neven more of these kids will be locked up--without even dealing with \nthe root of the problem.\n  I have a piece of legislation--and Congressman Ramstad from Minnesota \nhas the same legislation on the House side--which says that, at the \nvery minimum, we ought to stop this discrimination and say to the \ninsurance companies that we ought to be treating this disease the same \nway we treat other physical illnesses because right now, in all too \nmany of these policies, if you are struggling with addiction, you don't \nget any treatment. We are just saying we are not even mandating it. We \nare just saying, for gosh sakes, please stop the discrimination, deal \nwith this brain disease, provide some coverage for treatment.\n  There are all these men and women in the recovery community who can \ntestify about how, when they had access to treatment, they were able to \nrebuild their lives. They are now members of the recovery community; \nthey work; they are successful; they contribute to their families, and \nthey contribute to their communities.\n  What do we have here? We have an amendment that does nothing more \nthan imprison more of these kids and doesn't do a darn thing about \ngetting at the root of the problem. It does nothing about the lack of \ntreatment for these kids. This is a huge mistake.\n  There is one other provision that is now part of this amendment, \nwhich is quite unbelievable, at least in my view. As a part of this \namendment, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have included a \nprovision that says if a child attends a title I school and becomes a \nvictim of violence on school grounds, the district may use the Federal \neducation funds, including IDEA, title I, and other money, to provide \nthe child with a voucher to attend a private school or to provide \ntransfer costs for the child to attend another public school.\n  Well, now, look, I don't know exactly when this provision was even \nput in this amendment. It wasn't part of the original amendment I had a \nchance to see earlier. But I am a little bit skeptical. I think what my \ncolleagues have done is taken a reality--and, God knows, I wish this \nreality didn't exist in our country, which is too much violence in \nchildren's lives, including too much violence in their schools--and \nthen used that as a reason to once again get authorization and funding \nfor vouchers.\n  If for some of these children you were able to transfer money to \nprivate schools, what about the 90 percent of children in America who \nattend public schools, not to mention the fact that the amount of money \nthese kids get to transfer to a private school wouldn't cover anywhere \nthe cost of the private school? And the vast majority of these children \nare low income. What about the rest of our kids in our schools?\n  I say this by way of conclusion. I will be especially brief because I \ndon't believe my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to hear \nthis, and I don't even think they want to debate it.\n  Have you expanded funding for Safe and Drug-Free Schools? No.\n  Are you willing to support essential and sensible gun control, and \ndrug treatment and drug prevention programs? No.\n  Were you willing--I have this amendment--to dramatically expand the \nnumber of counselors in our schools to provide help and support to \nkids? No.\n  Were you willing to support legislation that would deal with the \nreality of children who have witnessed violence in their homes? They \nhave seen their mother beaten up over and over again, have trouble in \nschool, sometimes themselves overly aggressive, sometimes themselves \ngetting in trouble. That amendment passed the Senate. It was taken out \nin conference committee by the Republicans. Do you support that? No.\n\n[[Page S14446]]\n\n  Are you willing to dramatically increase funding for afterschool \nprograms? Law enforcement communities tell us it is so important in \ngetting to a lot of kids who are at risk and who might commit some of \nthis violence or might themselves be victims of this violence. Have you \nbeen willing? No.\n  Have you been willing to invest in rebuilding rotting schools? A lot \nof kids who live in tough neighborhoods who go to tough schools, when \nthey walk into the schools and they see how decrepit they are, say to \nthemselves, you know what, this country doesn't give a damn about us. \nThey devalue themselves and they get into trouble. Have we made any \ninvestment here? No.\n  Have you been willing to increase the amount of funding we put into \ntitle I? In my State of Minnesota, in the cities of St. Paul and \nMinneapolis, after you get to schools that are 60 percent low-income \nschools, then you go to schools that get 50 or 55 percent, and they \ndon't get any of those funds because they have run out of money and \nbecause the title I money reaches, at best, about 30 percent of the \nkids in the country who need additional help. No.\n  I have to say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that I \nwould love to debate somebody on this. It strikes me that this is \ndisingenuous at best.\n  You talk about the violence kids experience in our schools. And then \nyou say, therefore, we will now use this as an excuse to try to push \nthrough a voucher plan. Yet on 10 different things that you could \nsupport that would reduce the violence in children's lives in our \npublic schools, you are not willing to invest one more cent. It is a \nweak argument you make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate having the opportunity to \nspeak on this amendment. I yield myself such time as I might require at \nthis point. I believe it will be probably 15 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment which, in my \njudgment, will help protect our children and our neighborhoods from the \nscourge of drugs and drug-related violence.\n  This amendment contains a number of provisions that are critical to \nour war on drugs.\n  It includes a package of provisions aimed at fighting the production \nand distribution of methamphetamines.\n  Authored by Senators Ashcroft, Hatch, and Grassley, these provisions \ninclude additional money to hire additional personnel, including almost \n$10 million for additional DEA agents to assist state and local law \nenforcement.\n  Also included is a provision raising penalties for offenses involving \nmethamphetamines, including production of methamphetamine precursors.\n  And the amendment includes additional funding for prevention and \ntreatment programs.\n  Contrary to some of the positions and assertions made, in fact, this \namendment includes significant increases in those funding proposals.\n  The amendment also enhances penalties for drug distribution to minors \nand in or near schools. Also to protect our schools, the amendment \nprovides incentives for schools to develop policies expelling students \nwho bring drugs on school grounds and school choice for victims of \nschool violence.\n  Mr. President, today I want to focus in particular on the amendment's \nprovisions concerning sentences for powder cocaine dealers. These \nprovisions are drawn from legislation I introduced earlier this year \nalong with Senator Allard and quite a few other Senators. As the father \nof three young children, I am deeply disturbed by the trend for almost \nall of the last 7 years in teenage drug use. This represents a \nreversal, really, of the decade long progress we had been making in the \nwar on drugs.\n  In 1997, 9.4 percent of teens reported recent use of marijuana, up \n180 percent from 1992. The percentage of teens using cocaine tripled \nduring those same years. And most disturbing of all, the greatest \nincreases took place among our youngest teens. For example, the \npercentage of 12 and 13 year olds using cocaine increased 100 percent \nfrom 1992 to 1996, compared with a 58 percent increase among 17- and \n18-year-olds. This spells trouble for our children. Increased drug use \nmeans increased danger of every social pathology we know.\n  This trend may finally have been arrested for most drugs. In 1998, \nthe Monitoring the Future Study, prepared annually by the University of \nMichigan, showed improvements--although very modest ones--in levels of \nteenage drug use. All three grades studies--8th, 10th, and 12th--showed \nsome decline in the proportion of students reporting any illegal drug \nuse during the previous 12 months. Equally important, use by 8th \ngraders, who started the upward trend in use at the beginning of this \ndecade, declined for the second year in a row.\n  We also are finding heartening news in our war on violent crime. The \nFBI now reports that, since 1991, the number of homicides committed in \nthe United States has dropped by 31 percent. Also since 1991, the \nnumber of robberies has fallen 32 percent. According to the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, robberies fell a stunning 17 percent in 1997 alone.\n  This is good news, Mr. President. And there is widespread agreement \namong experts in the field that the principal cause of this decline in \nviolent crime is our success in curbing the crack cocaine epidemic and \nthe violent gang activities that accompany that epidemic.\n  The New York Times recently reported on a conference of \ncriminologists held in New Orleans. Experts at the conference agreed \nthat the rise and fall in violent crime during the 1980s and 1990s \nclosely paralleled the rise and fall of the crack epidemic.\n  At the same time, there is a warning signal here. The most recent \n``Monitoring the Future'' Study also showed an increase in the use of \ncocaine in all three grades studied. Use of both crack and powder \ncocaine within the past 30 days likewise rose in all three grades, \nexcept for powder cocaine in the 12th grade, where it did not fall but \nat least held steady. This is in contrast to the study's finding that \nthe use of other drugs by kids may finally be leveling off, albeit at \nunacceptably high levels. Yet surprisingly, despite these developments, \nin last year's Ten-Year Plan for a National Drug Control Strategy, the \nadministration proposed making sentences for crack dealers 5 times more \nlenient than they are today.\n  We have already heard the case made by the preceding speaker--and I \nsuspect successive speakers on the other side of the aisle will be \nlikewise making the case--that by somehow making crack sentences more \nlenient, notwithstanding the clear evidence that as we have gotten \ntough on crack cocaine dealers, the spread of crack cocaine and \nincidental crime related to crack cocaine addiction has been going \ndown. This is a strikingly bad idea, and one that this Congress should \nemphatically reject.\n  The President's principal explanation for the proposal to lower crack \nsentences is that the move was recommended by the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to address the disparity in treatment between crack and \npowder dealers. I agree we should reduce this disparity, which produces \nthe unjust result that people higher on the drug chain get lighter \nsentences than those at the bottom. But going easier on crack \npeddlers--the dealers who infest our school yards and playgrounds--is \nnot the solution. Crack is cheap and highly addictive. Tough crack \nsentences have encouraged many dealers to turn in their superiors in \nexchange for leniency. Lowering these sentences will remove that \nincentive and undermine our prosecutors, making them less effective at \nprotecting our children and our neighborhoods.\n  No, there is a better way to bring crack and powder cocaine sentences \nmore in line. Instead of lowering sentences for crack dealers, we \nshould instead raise sentences for powder dealers. Doing so will \naccomplish every legitimate policy objective that can be advanced by \nthe President's proposal--except greater leniency for these \nindividuals, which in my view is not a legitimate policy objective. \nRaising sentences for powder dealers is accordingly what this amendment \nproposes to do. Specifically, it changes the quantity of powder cocaine \nnecessary to trigger a mandatory 5-year minimum sentence from 500 grams \nto 50 grams, and makes a similar change in the amount necessary to \ntrigger a mandatory 10-year sentence. The effect of this will be to \nraise sentences substantially for those who deal in powder cocaine, a \nchange that I think is entirely justified.\n\n[[Page S14447]]\n\n  Even without taking into account the differential treatment of crack, \npowder sentences are currently too low. Powder is the raw material for \ncrack. Yet sentences for powder dealers were set before the crack \nepidemic, without accounting for powder's role in causing it. It is \nalso one of the drugs the use of which continues to increase, not only \namong teenagers but also among adults.\n  Moreover, we occasionally see a large powder supplier get a lower \nsentence than the low-level crack dealer who resold some powder in \ncrack form simply because the powder dealer took the precaution of \nselling his product only in powder form. That is plainly an unjust \nresult and one that our legal system should not countenance.\n  By making the changes in the quantity triggers for mandatory minimums \nI have described, our amendment will reduce the differential between \nthe amount of powder and crack required to trigger a mandatory minimum \nsentence from 100 to 1, the current differential, to 10 to 1. That is \nthe exact same ratio proposed by the administration in their proposal. \nBut our proposal in this amendment will accomplish that goal not by \nmaking crack dealers' sentences more lenient but, rather, by toughening \nsentences for powder cocaine dealers.\n  Now the administration has charged--and we have heard a comment about \nthis on the floor today; I suspect we will hear more--that the proposal \nwe are offering is nevertheless the wrong way to proceed on account of \nits allegedly racially disparate impact. In my judgment, if the \nsentencing structure being proposed is in fact desirable on its merits, \nthat is a dubious basis on which to evaluate the merits of this \nproposal or, for that matter, the administration's.\n  Since the administration has made this charge, I think it is \nimportant to understand it is not true. In fact, if our proposal is \nenacted, overall the percentage of cocaine dealers sentenced to tough, \nmandatory minimum sentences should be less disproportionately African \nAmerican than it is under current law. This is because under current \nlaw and under the administration's proposal, persons convicted of \ndealing between 100 and 250 grams of powder are not subject to \nmandatory sentences. Under the proposal, they are contained in our \namendment.\n  According to the Sentencing Commission statistics in the most recent \nyear for which they were collected, for fiscal year 1996 the percentage \nof non-Hispanic whites in that group, 38.9 percent, was higher than the \npercentage of members in any other racial category. Therefore, imposing \nmandatory minimum sentences on this group of people would accordingly \nreduce the racially disparate impact of current law. Thus, the \nsentencing outcome under our proposal should have a less racially \ndisparate impact than the current proposal which is in place in law.\n  By contrast, the administration's proposal to change the triggers for \nmandatory minimums for crack dealers is highly likely to increase the \npercentage of individuals sentenced to mandatory minimums for dealing \ncocaine who are African American. Had the administration's proposal \nbeen in effect during fiscal year 1996, the proportion of individuals \nsentenced to a mandatory 5-year minimum sentence who are African \nAmerican would have increased--not decreased--increased slightly from \n82.8 percent to 85.2 percent. Thus, contrary to the administration's \ncharge, the proposal contained in this amendment will actually decrease \nthe racially disparate effect of mandatory sentences on cocaine \ndealers.\n\n  On the other hand, what is not true of our proposal and is true of \nthe administration's proposal is to change the quantity trigger for \ncrack dealers. Their proposal will increase the racially disparate \nimpact of mandatory minimum sentences for cocaine dealing compared to \ncurrent law.\n  All that being said, I would like to get away from these numbers and \ntalk about some of the contacts I have had with people in my State who \nare the victims of these drug dealers. Despite the disparity reduction \njustification given for the President's proposal, I have not found \nanyone in my State--any parents, regardless of their race, whose \nchildren have been touched by a crack cocaine dealer--who don't want to \nsee the person responsible suffer serious consequences, no matter who \nthe crack dealer was. Their families are already suffering \nconsequences; their schoolyards are suffering consequences; their \nneighborhoods are suffering consequences. They believe that the people \nbehind it, whether it is the peddler in the schoolyard or the kingpin \nselling the powder cocaine, ought to suffer the consequences, as well.\n  Reverend Eugene F. Rivers II, cochair of the National Ten Point \nLeadership Foundation in inner city Boston, says:\n\n       To confuse the concerns of crack dealers with the broader \n     interests of the black community is at best inane and at \n     worst immoral. Those who are straining to live in inner-city \n     neighborhoods that are mostly adversely affected by the \n     plight of crack and who witness crack's consequences first \n     hand want crack dealers taken off the streets for the longest \n     period of time possible.\n\n  We owe it to the thousands upon thousands of families struggling to \nprotect their children from the scourge of drugs and drug violence. \nThat means staying tough on those who peddle drugs and sending a clear \nmessage to our young people that we will not tolerate crack dealers in \nour neighborhoods or powder dealers who supply the crack dealers.\n  President Clinton had it right 3 years ago when he agreed with this \nCongress in rejecting an earlier Sentencing Commission plan to lower \nsentences for crack dealers. Back then, President Clinton said:\n\n       We have to send a constant message to our children that \n     drugs are illegal, drugs are dangerous, drugs may cost your \n     life, and the penalties for drug dealing are severe.\n\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton's new plan to reduce sentences for \ncrack dealers does not live up to that obligation. It sends our kids \nexactly the wrong message, and it does not do any favor to anybody \nexcept drug peddlers. In contrast, the approach taken by our amendment \nis faithful to this obligation. It achieves a reduction in the \ndisparity between crack and powder cocaine sentencing in the right way, \nthrough legislation making sentences for powder cocaine dealers a lot \ntougher.\n  At this crucial time, we may be making real progress in winning the \nwar on drugs and violent crime in part because we have sent the message \nthat crack gang membership is no way to live and that society will come \ndown very hard on those spreading this pernicious drug. At the same \ntime, our kids remain all too exposed to dangerous drugs, far more \nexposed than we can probably imagine.\n  In light of these two trends, it would be, in my opinion, \ncatastrophic to let any drug dealer think that the cost of doing \nbusiness is going down. This is especially no time for lowering \nsentences for dealing in crack, a pernicious drug that brought our \ncities great danger, violence, and grief. It will be nearly impossible, \nin my judgment, to succeed in discouraging our kids from using drugs if \nthey hear we are lowering sentences for any category of drug dealers.\n  By adopting this amendment, we can send our kids the right message: \nWe will not tolerate crack dealers in our neighbors, and we will make \nthe sentences on powdered cocaine dealers a lot tougher. Success in the \ndrug war depends upon all the efforts of parents, schools, churches, \nthe medical communities, and local law enforcement community leaders. \nThere is no doubt about that. They are doing a great job in the drug \nfight. The Federal Government must do its part, too. We must provide \nneeded resources, and we must reinforce the message that drugs aren't \nacceptable and that drug dealers belong in prison for a long time. Our \nkids deserve no less. That is why I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  To address a couple of the points that were made by previous \nspeakers, first, we have to concern ourselves not just with costs that \nare attendant to incarcerating crack cocaine dealers but with the costs \nthat are brought about when those crack cocaine dealers are running \nwild in our communities. The notion that there are no costs involved \nwhen these folks remain on the streets, in our playgrounds and \nneighborhoods, addicting children, precipitating violence when the \ncrack gangs are busy in their communities, is to miss, I think, a very \nvital part of this debate.\n  The costs of addiction are significant. Who exactly are the targets \nof the addiction? Very often, they are, themselves, members of minority \ncommunities. I don't think we are doing a\n\n[[Page S14448]]\n\nfavor to the minority communities of this country if we allow the \nschoolyards in those communities to be infested with crack cocaine \ndealers. The key is, Do we want to rid our communities of drug dealers? \nIn my judgment, that certainly ought to be our objective. That is what \nwe have tried to do in this amendment, not just with the sections \nrelating to powder cocaine sentences, for the dealers of powder \ncocaine, but the other provisions of the legislation. I am proud to be \na cosponsor.\n  I hope my colleagues understand when they cast their vote on this \nissue, the question is very simple: Do you think it is time for powder \ncocaine dealers to serve tougher sentences for drug kingpins to go to \njail for a longer time or don't you? That is what is at stake. If you \nbelieve in tougher sentences for powder cocaine dealers, we ask for \nyour support for this amendment. If you believe in getting tougher on \nmethamphetamines, we ask for your support for this amendment. If you \nbelieve we should devote more resources to drug treatment programs, \nthen you should vote for this amendment. But don't be fooled by claims \nthat somehow or another we are doing anybody a favor by not moving \nforward in this area, and by letting drug dealers continue to infest \nour schoolyards. That is not doing any favors to anybody. I hope our \ncolleagues will join us and support this amendment.\n\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the section of \nthis amendment that addresses mandatory sentencing guidelines for \nhandling powder cocaine. I thank my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nAbraham, for his leadership on this particular issue. We have been \nworking on this issue for well over 2 years. I know it is important to \nhim. It is extremely important to me. I think he made a great \nstatement, great argument for why we need to toughen penalties on drug \ndealers.\n  One of our colleagues who spoke earlier suggested perhaps we were not \nspending enough money on prevention and education and treatment. I \nhave, in the meantime, pulled out a chart that shows how much money we \nhave spent over the last 10 years in drug treatment and prevention and \nresearch. I would like to go over that for a moment for Members of the \nSenate.\n  Over the last 10 years, we have spent more than $20 billion on drug \nabuse treatment. We have spent more than $15 billion on drug abuse \nprevention. And we have spent, in addition to that, more than $1 \nbillion in prevention research and more than $1.5 billion in treatment \nresearch.\n  We certainly have not been ignoring the treatment and prevention of \ndrug addiction. The fact is, it is complicated. It needs to be part of \nthe formula, as far as I am concerned. But if we do not recognize \nloopholes we have in the current law that allows drug dealers to \ncontinue to carry on their business at an extreme cost to society, I \nthink we are ignoring our responsibilities, trying to address part of \nthe drug problem. That means we have to have tougher penalties.\n  Currently, there is a vast discrepancy between minimum sentencing \nguidelines for those caught dealing cocaine in the form of crack and \nthose dealing it in the form of powder. Under current law, a dealer can \nbe sentenced to 5 years for peddling 5 grams of crack cocaine. If you \nlook on the chart, we have symbolized the amount of 5 grams of crack \ncocaine. In order to receive a similar sentence, a dealer would have to \nbe caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine. That creates a tremendous \nloophole. What happens with our drug dealers is they will bring in \npowder cocaine and just before they put it out on the street for \nconsumption by individuals, it is converted over to crack cocaine. That \nloophole encourages drug dealers to then import more powder cocaine. \nThat is why I think it is so important we pass this particular portion \nof the amendment.\n\n  I have met with many different law enforcement organizations to look \ninto this discrepancy. One effect of this discrepancy is what \nstatistics show to be a racial bias in the sentencing guidelines. Mr. \nPresident, 90 percent of those convicted for dealing crack are African \nAmericans. The majority of dealers caught with powder cocaine are \nwhite--58 percent of powder users are white. It is ridiculous that \nthose who dabble with powder cocaine for all intents and purposes are \nprotected by our sentencing parameters. Drug smugglers and drug dealers \nknow about this caveat in sentencing and they do everything they can to \ntake advantage of it.\n  Cocaine is largely transported in powder form and only converted to \ncrack at the time of sale. This loophole in the current law actually \nreduces the long-term risks to dealers and smugglers. Drug enforcement \ndetectives I have met with have confirmed the going price for 5 grams \nof powder and 5 grams of crack are typically equal now on the street. \nThat varies considerably, but that apparently is the price right now. \nWhy should we continue to support this disparity when we can solve it \ntoday? I believe one way to effectively decrease crime in America is to \npunish criminals through more rigorous sentencing, particularly when we \nare providing the amount of dollars we are today for drug prevention \nand drug treatment and research on drug prevention and research on drug \ntreatment.\n  In order to receive a minimum sentence of 5 years, a criminal would \nonly need to be caught with 50 grams of powder cocaine instead of the \ncurrent 500. This amendment also stiffens the penalty for carrying a \nlarge quantity of powder cocaine. To receive a minimum sentence of 10 \nyears, a criminal would only have to be caught with 500 grams of powder \ncocaine, instead of the current standard of 5 kilograms.\n  Henry Salano, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, \nhas endorsed this effort saying:\n\n       There is a strong rationale for equalizing the powder \n     cocaine penalties and the crack cocaine penalties. The law \n     enforcement community learned years ago the strong sentences \n     meted out to crack cocaine dealers has had a significant \n     deterrent effect on the production and distribution of crack. \n     [These] proposed penalties for powder cocaine will likewise \n     restrict the flow of powder cocaine in this country.\n\n  This comes from an individual who in the past has been on the front \nline, has been on the firing line, has been dealing with this from a \nhands-on position because of his position with law enforcement.\n  We must show criminals that any activity involving illegal drugs will \nnot be tolerated. There is a direct correlation between drug use and \ncrime. Cocaine plays a major role in this connection. A Department of \nJustice study in 1998 discovered the drug most commonly detected among \nall arrestees, from 1990 to 1998, was cocaine. Cocaine use poses a \ndirect threat to the safety of our society. Let's stop treating those \nwho use and deal powder cocaine as if they were special criminals. I \nask all my colleagues to join me and end this inequality in cocaine \nspending.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the issues in this particular \namendment. I think we are taking generally the right steps in \naddressing our drug problem. Obviously, we are not doing it just on \npenalties, but we are doing it in all areas--treatment and prevention. \nThis is an important loophole we must close. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in voting for this amendment and supporting this effort.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there has been focus on different \nprovisions of the amendment before us. I want to address two of those \nin my remarks.\n  One of those provisions is, if a child attends a title I school and \nbecomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, including drug-\nrelated violence, while in or on the public school grounds, the school \ndistrict may use the title I funds or any other Federal funds, \nincluding IDEA funds, to provide a voucher for a child to attend a \nprivate or religious school or pay the cost to transfer the child to \nanother public school.\n  In title I, we are basically talking about $500. I do not know how \none expects to pay tuition to a school for about $500. A variety of \ntechnical\n\n[[Page S14449]]\n\nissues and questions are raised. It, obviously, is creating a sense of \nexpectation by those who put this proposal forward.\n  Nonetheless, on the issue of the value of the measure, even if it did \nhave sufficient funds to do what it intends, it will not make the \nschools any safer and will not improve student achievement. We should \nsupport violence and crime prevention programs in and around public \nschools, not divert precious resources to private schools. Therefore, \nwe should further invest in programs such as the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools and Communities Act, afterschool programs, community crime \nprevention activities, encourage parent and community involvement, and \nhelp communities and schools ensure that all children are safe all the \ntime.\n  We all know that juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between \n3 and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juveniles in Orange \nCounty, CA, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile gang crimes occur on \nschooldays and peaks immediately after school dismissal. We know \nafterschool programs reduce youth crime.\n  The Baltimore City Police Department saw a 44-percent drop in the \nrisk of children becoming victims of crime after opening an afterschool \nprogram in a high-crime area. A study of the Goodnow Police Athletic \nLeague Center in northeast Baltimore found juvenile arrests dropped by \n10 percent, the number of armed robberies dropped from 14 to 7, assault \nwith handguns were eliminated, and other assaults decreased from 32 to \n20 from 1995 to 1998.\n  This demonstrates how we can deal with the problems of violence in \ncommunities, violence around schools, even violence within the schools. \nWe ought to be focusing on what works and supporting those efforts, \nrather than having an untried, untested program that shows on the face \nof it very little difference in safety and security for children in \nschools.\n  In addition to improved youth behavior and safety, quality \nafterschool programs also lead to better academic achievement by \nstudents. At the Beech Street School in Manchester, NH, the afterschool \nprogram has helped improve reading and math scores of students. In \nreading, the percentage of students scoring at or above the basic level \nincreased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third in 1997. In math, the \npercentage of students scoring at the basic level increased from 29 \npercent to 60 percent. In addition, Manchester saved an estimated \n$73,000 over 3 years because students participating in the afterschool \nprogram avoided being retained in grades or being placed in special \neducation.\n  This kind of investment will help keep children safe and help them \nachieve, and that is the right direction for education.\n  There are precious few public funds available, and those public funds \nshould not be funneled to private and religious schools. Public tax \ndollars should be spent on public schools which educate 90 percent of \nthe Nation's children, and the funds should not go to private schools \nwhen public schools have great needs.\n  We should be doing all we can to help improve public \nschools, academically as well as from a security point of view. We \nshould not undermine the efforts taking place in those public schools.\n\n  This amendment will allow any Federal education funds to be used for \nprivate school vouchers, including the title I, IDEA, and Eisenhower \nProfessional Development Program. The Eisenhower Professional \nDevelopment Program is targeted to enhance math and science. Rather \nthan enhancing math, science, and academic achievement for children in \nthe public schools, we are drawing down on those funds to permit some \nstudents to go to other schools. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  Federal funds should not go to schools that can exclude children. \nThere is no requirement for schools receiving vouchers to accept \nstudents with limited English proficiency, homeless students, or \nstudents with disciplinary problems. Precious funds should be earmarked \nfor public schools which do not have the luxury of closing their doors \nto students who pose a problem.\n  The challenges the schools are facing today are much more complex, \nmuch more complicated than they were even a few short years ago. I was \nwith the head mistress of the Revere School in the last week. I said: I \nremember visiting the school 2 years ago and they had nine different \nlanguages.\n  She said: How about 29 different languages now with different \ncultures and traditions?\n  They are facing more complexity in dealing with children, and it is \nnecessary to give them support and not deplete scarce resources. They \nobviously should have accountability in how effectively those resources \nare being used, but when you talk about undermining the Eisenhower \ntraining programs for math and science or IDEA, which is funding needs \nfor special education, and even the title I programs for disadvantaged \nchildren, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n  Our goal is to reform the public schools, not abandon them. Instead \nof draining much needed resources from public schools, we should create \nconditions for improvement and reform, not in a few schools but in all \nschools, not in a few students but in all students. Effectively, what \nwe would be doing is abandoning a great majority of students. That is \nwrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nvarious organizations representing parents and teachers and students \nwho are strongly opposed to the provisions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Organizations That Oppose the Voucher Provision in the Drug Amendment\n\n     American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy\n     American Association of University Women\n     American Counseling Association\n     American Federation of School Administrators\n     American Federation of Teachers\n     Council for Exceptional Children\n     Council of Chief State School Officers\n     Federal Advocacy for California Education\n     International Reading Association\n     National Association for Bilingual Education\n     National Association of Elementary School Principals\n     National Association of Federally Impacted Schools\n     National Association of School Psychologists\n     National Association of Secondary School Principals\n     National Association of State Boards of Education\n     National Association of State Title I Directors\n     National Education Association\n     National PTA\n     National Science Teachers Association\n     New York City Board of Education\n     New York State Education Department\n     People for the American Way\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, drug abuse in our Nation is a menace that \nthreatens the security, health, and productivity of all of our \ncitizens. Every reputable authority who has examined the problem of \ndrug addition knows that there is no army large enough to keep all \ndrugs from crossing our borders and no nation powerful enough to \nimprison all pushers and suppliers. We must use all the constitutional \nenforcement tools at our command to make the criminals who would profit \nfrom the degradation of our fellow citizens pay the price of their \ncrimes.\n  An effective fight against drug abuse must take three approaches: law \nenforcement, prevention and treatment. Each of these three approaches \nis vital; no program can be successful unless it involves them all.\n  The widespread use of illegal drugs is one of the most pressing \nproblems facing our society. Illegal drugs are killing children and \ndestroying families. Vast profits from the sale of illegal drugs have \ncreated a new criminal underworld which promotes violence and feeds on \ndeath.\n  However, this amendment does not go about this problem in the right \nway.\n  By raising powder cocaine penalties, the amendment reduces the \ncurrent 100 to 1 ratio between the two drugs, but it doesn't solve the \nunderlying problem. The real problems is that crack penalties are out \nof proportion to the penalties for other drugs. Increasing the penalty \nfor powder cocaine makes the penalties for both forms of cocaine \ndisproportionately severe compared to other drugs.\n  Twenty-seven former U.S. attorneys who are now Federal judges say \nthey ``disagree with those who suggest that the disparity in treatment \nof power and crack cocaine should be remedied by altering the penalties \nrelating to\n\n[[Page S14450]]\n\npower cocaine. The penalties for powder cocaine, both mandatory minimum \nand guideline sentences, are severe and should not be increased.''\n  Clearly Congress is right to be concerned about excessively lenient \nsentences for serious offenses. but the sentencing guideline system in \nplace today is the most effective way to limit judicial discretion. In \n1984, Senator Thurmond, Senator Biden, I, and others, worked together \nto pass bipartisan sentencing reform legislation. A key reform in that \nlegislation was the creation of the Sentencing Commission, to achieve \ngreater fairness and uniformity in sentencing. since its creation, the \nCommission has developed sentencing guidelines that have eliminated the \nworst disparities in the sentencing process, without seriously reducing \njudicial discretion.\n  Unfortunately, actions by Congress continue to undermine the \nCommission's work. The guidelines system was designed to achieve \ngreater uniformity and fairness, while retaining necessary judicial \nflexibility. Instead, Congress has enacted a steady stream of mandatory \nminimum sentences that override the guidelines and create the very \ndisparities that the guidelines are designed to end.\n  A recent study by the Rand Corporation shows that ``mandatory \nminimums reduce cocaine consumption less per million taxpayer dollars \nspent than does spending the same amount on enforcement.'' On the issue \nof controlling drug use, drug spending, and drug-related crime, the \nsame study found that ``treatment is more than twice as cost-effective \nas mandatory minimums''.\n  One of the important goals of sentencing is general deterrence. We \nshould allow the Commission to do its job, and weigh the Commission's \nrecommendations more carefully before acting to override them.\n  In 1995, the Sentencing Commission issued a formal recommendation to \nCongress to change the crack ratio to 1 to 1 at the current level of \npowder cocaine. Congress rejected the Sentencing Commission's \nrecommendation in a House vote and told the Commission to come up with \nanother solution.\n  Two years later, in 1997, the Sentencing Commission issued a second \nrecommendation to Congress to lower crack penalties and raise powder \ncocaine penalties. Both the Department of Justice and the drug czar's \noffice agreed with this recommendation. Yet, the Commission's \nrecommendation continues to be rejected by Congress. Crack cocaine \npenalties were enacted over a decade ago without the benefit of \nresearch, hearings, or prison impact assessments. Today, we have the \nadvantage of scientific evidence about cocaine in both forms and about \nthe impact of crack sentencing policies.\n  Shame on Congress for ignoring the experts it put in place to address \nthese issues in an informed manner. The Sentencing Commission's \nconclusion is clear--crack penalties are out of line, not powder \ncocaine penalties. Two wrongs don't make a right.\n  The Sentencing Commission reports that more than half of current \npowder cocaine defendants are at the lowest levels of the drug trade, \nand 86 percent are nonviolent. Increasing the penalty will add almost \n10,000 addicts and small-time drug users to the prison population in \nthe next 10 years, at a cost to taxpayers of approximately $2 billion. \nIn the next 20 years, that cost will escalate to over $5 billion, and \nin 30 years it will be $10.6 billion.\n  This amendment will also increase the disproportionate representation \nof minorities in federal prison, because 68 percent of the people \nsentenced federally for powder cocaine offenses are non-white. Of \nthose, 40 percent are Hispanic.\n  Enacting this legislation will worsen current imbalances in drug \npolicy at significant cost. The new powder cocaine sentences will be \nfar above those for many other more serious and violent offenses.\n  We know that merely talking tough is not enough. The war on crime has \nbeen declared again and again--and it has been lost over and over. It \nis clear that we will never succeed in defeating crime if we try to do \nit on the cheap. We can support our State and local police without \nturning any locality into a police state, and without destroying the \nfundamental civil liberties and constitutional guarantees that make \nthis Nation truly free.\n  To combat the drug menace we need local law enforcement programs that \nwork. It is increasingly clear that stronger law enforcement at the \nlocal level can be successful when coupled with enhanced drug treatment \nand education opportunities. One of the most important tools in the war \nagainst drugs is Federal assistance to increase the number of these \nsuccessful local law enforcement programs, not locking up more low-\nlevel drug dealers and throwing away the key.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  First of all, on the issue of the Hatch-Abraham-Ashcroft amendment on \ndrugs that is now before the Senate, I am very pleased that this action \nis being taken on this bill by the Senate because any action we can \ntake to stiffen the laws against drug use, to discourage drug use, or \nanything else connected with the horrors of drug use and abuse in \nAmerica is a very important thing for the Senate to be working on \nbecause drug abuse is a serious problem.\n  I believe the methamphetamine antiproliferation amendment that is \nbefore us will assist Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficials, treatment professionals, prevention groups, and others who \nare on the front lines of the drug fight. So I will take a few minutes \nto highlight some important sections of this amendment.\n  In particular, I am happy to see additional resources in this \nlegislation for training programs for State and local law enforcement \nofficials. That is because methamphetamine is a new challenge for law \nenforcement. Of course, this methamphetamine problem is spreading \nacross America. It may just be a California and Midwest issue right \nnow, but it will not be long before it will be an issue all over the \nUnited States because, unlike other drugs that have to be imported, \nmeth can be produced here in the United States with recipes available \noff the Internet. It can be made from chemicals available at your local \ndrugstore.\n  These home-grown laboratories contain chemicals and chemical \ncombinations that are hazardous both to the environment and to the \npeople. They are potentially explosive. Even in my State of Iowa, some \npeople have been injured in the process of making drugs. Most \nimportantly, when it comes to law enforcement or for an individual who \nis violating the law by making methamphetamines, the disposal of this \nlaboratory requires specialized handling.\n  We have all heard these horror stories about the dangers \nmethamphetamine labs pose to both the manufacturers and to the people \nin the neighborhood. Because of the smell associated with it, you find \na lot of this going on in the really rural parts of our States. So what \nthis means is, the local county sheriff has more risk. Because of this, \nthere is a need for training and for more equipment to clean up these \nlabs.\n  This amendment provides for additional training opportunities for \nState and local law enforcement in techniques used in meth \ninvestigations. It supports training in handling meth manufacturing \nchemicals and chemical waste from meth production.\n  In addition, this amendment provides for additional DEA agents to \nassist State and local law enforcement in small and midsized \ncommunities in all phases of drug investigations, including foreign \nlanguage assistance, investigative assistance, and drug prevention \nassistance. I am pleased to see the proposal Representative Matt Salmon \nand I have worked on to encourage Government web sites to include \nantidrug information in this legislation. This is the second provision \nof this bill about which I am very happy. Positive antidrug messages \nare an affordable and creative way to especially reach the young \naudience. Funding is needed for research to discover chemical agents \nthat can be added to anhydrous ammonia to make it unusable for meth \nmanufacture. This is a long-term solution that has the potential to be \nvery beneficial. The authorized funding provided for in this bill will \nallow continued and expanded research to find an appropriate additive \nto ensure anhydrous ammonia can not be misused.\n\n  In the agricultural regions of the United States, a nitrogen additive \nto\n\n[[Page S14451]]\n\nthe soil is used to get a greater amount of productivity. That is \ninvolved with the raising of corn in the Midwest, as an example. \nAnhydrous ammonia is a source of nitrogen that farmers knife into the \nground. We have seen these clandestine methamphetamine laboratories \nsteal the anhydrous ammonia to use it in manufacturing methamphetamine. \nIt is very dangerous to steal anhydrous ammonia. We have even had \npeople hurt by that. But it is a cheap way to get some of the \ningredients for this product.\n  So what we want to do, through this research--and Iowa State \nUniversity is involved in this research--is to have a chemical agent \nthat can be added to anhydrous ammonia so if a person steals it from \nthe tanks that are around the countryside during the period of time \nwhen farmers are putting it on in the spring of the year, it won't do \nthe manufacturer of methamphetamine any good because it would not be \nable to be used at that point--if such a chemical additive can be made.\n  A vital part of this bill, then, is the growing problem of this theft \nof anhydrous ammonia. States have even adopted tougher laws to combat \nthe theft of anhydrous ammonia. But because these are separate State \nlaws--the laws are not uniform --this has encouraged thieves to steal \nanhydrous in one State and transport it to an adjoining State with \nlesser penalties where it is used for the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine. A Federal statute, as provided for in this amendment, \nwill provide a strong deterrent to thieves who cross State lines to \navoid stiffer penalties back home.\n  Last night, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, came to the floor to offer an amendment \nwhich would essentially gut this entire bill. In the process, they made \nsome statements about the bill which, with all due respect to my very \ncapable colleagues, are very inaccurate statements and analyses of this \nlegislation. I would like to clear the air today on some points they \nmade. I will hit three points they made: First, their analysis of my \nmeans test in this bankruptcy reform legislation; second, what is the \nproper definition of household goods; and, third, their judgment of the \nantifraud provisions, which would prohibit loading up on debt right \nbefore bankruptcy. I will respond to each of these points. This will \nnot take me long, for those colleagues who are waiting to speak.\n  First, the means test we now have in this bill is very flexible. Some \nof my colleagues would say it is too flexible. The means test says if a \ndebtor in chapter 7 can pay $15,000 or 25 percent of his or her debts \nover a 5-year period after deducting living expenses and certain other \ntypes of expenses, such as child support, then that debtor in \nbankruptcy may have to repay some portion of the debts owed. Paying \nsome portion of debts owed is very legitimate because the signal we are \ntrying to send in this bill is, no longer will anybody get off scot-\nfree if they have the ability to pay.\n\n  If a bankrupt is in some sort of unique or special situation, the \nmeans test in this bill allows that person to explain his or her \nsituation to the judge or to the trustee and actually get out of paying \nthese debts.\n  Again, a lot of my colleagues say, why would you have a provision \nlike that in this bill? If somebody has special circumstances or not, \nif they owe, they ought to pay. Well, it is an attempt to make changes \nthat are dramatically different, even with these compromises, than what \nwe have had as a law of the land since 1978.\n  If there are these special expenses which are both reasonable and \nnecessary, and this reduces repayment ability, then, as I said, the \ndebtor doesn't have to repay his or her debt. That is a simple process \nthat everyone can understand. Somehow that has been interpreted by some \npeople in this body as not actually doing what the bill says, or they \nare reading the bill a different way. I want to clear this up. The way \nwe determine living expenses in the bill is to use a very simple \ntemplate established by the Internal Revenue Service for repayment \nplans involved in back taxes.\n  I am going to read from a chart. This study was done by the General \nAccounting Office. It noted, in this June 1999 report to Congress about \nbankruptcy reform, that the template we use as a basis for this \nlegislation, to allow the debtor to declare necessary living expenses, \ndoes include child care expenses, dependent care expenses, health care \nexpenses, and other expenses which are necessary living expenses.\n  Right here is where it says: Other necessary expenses. I want this \nvery clear, that this legislation allows, as you can see, child care, \ndependent care, health care, payroll deductions, on and on, life \ninsurance. Let anybody tell me on the floor of this body that this is \nnot a flexible test to accommodate very extraordinary circumstances or \nvery regular circumstances.\n  So the suggestion last night that the bill is unfair because it \ndoesn't allow for child care expenses or these other expenses \nassociated with raising children is misplaced. According to the General \nAccounting Office, the Internal Revenue Service living standards--and \nthese standards are the basis for the court to decide the ability to \nrepay--in the bill now provide that any --I emphasize any--necessary \nexpense can be taken into account. So, again, how much more flexible \ncan we get? The only living expenses not allowed under our bill are \nvery unnecessary and unreasonable expenses. The only people who oppose \nthe means test, as currently written, are people who want deadbeats \nlooking to stiff their creditors to dine on fancy meals or live in \nextravagant homes and take posh vacations. And there is no reason why \nwe have a $40 billion bankruptcy problem in this country, and that \nhonest people in this country, a family of four are paying $400 a year \nmore in additional costs for the goods and services they buy to make up \nfor deadbeats who aren't paying, and that we have to put up with still \nother people who have the capability of paying to live high on the hog.\n\n  I think what is really behind the effort is the desire to have a \nmeans test which, quite frankly, doesn't do anything. Why have the bill \nat all? We could continue to go on under the 1978 law, where we doubled \nthe number of bankruptcies in the last 6 or 7 years, from 700,000 to \n1.4 million--an irresponsible public policy. Before I ever introduced \nthis bill, I made numerous compromises to make the means test flexible, \nas I have said--more flexible, in fact. Some of the changes have even \nbeen suggested by this Democrat administration. They were suggested at \nthe end of the last Congress when a bill that passed here 97-1 didn't \nget through. This bill has incorporated some of those. It is a \ncompromise bill. I have taken heat from my side of the aisle for that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield before he goes on to his next \npoint?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be recognized after the Senator from Iowa \nis finished, and then the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, and then \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and that I be recognized \nat a later time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and I won't.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It will be on my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is this within the timeframes we already have under the \nagreement?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes. The Senator from Alabama, the Senator from Nebraska, \nand the Senator from New Jersey will be recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield, what is the time agreement \nalready?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Two hours equally divided. Would the Chair please tell \nus how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement was 4 hours equally divided. The \nSenator from Iowa has 48 minutes 47 seconds. The Senator from Vermont \nhas 89 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That seems more than adequate to me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask my colleagues to give a little bit of time for the \nSenator from Vermont who is going to want to speak somewhere in there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I make my final point, and then \nyield the floor--hopefully, the Senator from Vermont will hear this--I \nhope we can get some agreement on both sides\n\n[[Page S14452]]\n\nto yield back some time when the present speakers are done speaking.\n  The issue of household goods is where I left off when the Senator \nfrom Vermont asked me to yield for a minute. On this next statement, I \nmight surprise Senator Dodd and some of my colleagues, but I do \nsomewhat agree with what was said last night. Under the bankruptcy \ncode, household goods can't be seized by creditors. The point, as I \nunderstand it, from the Senator from Connecticut, is that perhaps the \ndefinition of household goods in the bill now could be loosened up so \ncreditors can't get certain essential household items. I do see merit \nin this point. If the Senator from Connecticut were to modify his \namendment just to deal with household goods, I would be pleased to work \nwith him on that to get the bill accepted. But right now, the amendment \nof the Senator from Connecticut does much more than just deal with the \nhousehold goods issue. I simply can't accept the other changes he has \nsuggested.\n  Finally, last night, the Senator from Louisiana raised some criticism \nof the provision of the bill that fights fraud. Here is the problem we \nmust address in doing bankruptcy reform: Some people load up on debts \non the eve of declaring bankruptcy and then, of course, what they try \nto do to wipe those debts away by getting a discharge. Obviously, this \nis a type of fraud that Congress needs to protect against for the \nhonest consumers who are paying that additional $400 per year. The bill \nnow says debts for luxury items purchased within 90 days of bankruptcy \nin excess of $250 and also cash advances on credit cards made within 70 \ndays in excess of $750 are presumed to be nondischargeable.\n  Now, again, this is very flexible on its face. Under the bill now, \nyou can't buy $249 worth of luxury items such as caviar the day before \nyou declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free. Under the bill \nnow, you can get $749 worth of cash advances minutes before you declare \nbankruptcy and still walk away scot-free.\n  The question we have to answer is, How much more fraud do we want to \ntolerate in this bill? Haven't we tolerated enough in this bipartisan \ncompromise, which I thank the Senator from New Jersey for working so \nhard with me on to get it put together? So we go to the amendment \noffered last night. This would allow $1,000 worth of fraud. In my view, \nthat is way off base. So if you want to crack down on out and out \nfraud, you should support this bill Senator Torricelli and I have \nintroduced. If you want to make it easier for crooks to game the \nbankruptcy system and to get a free ride at everybody else's expense, \nthen you should support the amendment that was offered last night.\n  Well, obviously, unless the Senator from Connecticut would modify his \namendment to limit it to household goods, I oppose that amendment, and \nI urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Under the unanimous consent agreement, I am to speak at \nthis time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his \nleadership in the effort against drugs. I am a strong believer that \nthis legislation that focuses on methamphetamine is focusing on \ncritical issues that are important to America. We do have a spreading \nof methamphetamine around the country, and I am inclined to believe \nthat increased penalties, and certainly a lot of other things involved \nin that legislation, is good. It has also been made a part of this \nlegislation--efforts to change the current law with regard to crack \ncocaine and powder cocaine.\n  Complaints have been made that crack cocaine penalties are 100 times \nmore tough than powder sentences, and that this is, in fact, not fair--\na point with which I tend to agree. I prosecuted drug cases for 15 \nyears. Every year since the sentencing guidelines were imposed, until \n1992, I prosecuted drug cases. I understand how it plays out in a \ncourtroom. The proposal that is made a part of Senator Grassley's \namendment is the Hatch-Ashcroft-Abraham drug amendment, I guess it is. \nThat proposal is designed to narrow the gap, saying that crack cocaine \nought not to have 100 times more severe penalty than powder cocaine.\n  An argument has been made that crack cocaine is more utilized in the \nAfrican American community and, therefore, it has a disparity and a \nracial impact, and that we ought to look at this. Few would doubt that \ncrack is a more dangerous drug than powder cocaine. It is smoked, it \ngoes directly into the lungs, directly into the blood system, and \ndirectly to the brain.\n  There are intense highs achieved at once. Some people, they say, are \naddicted the first time they try crack cocaine. It is a dangerous drug. \nPowder is normally sniffed through the nose. It is easy to receive \nthrough the nostrils, into the membranes, into the blood system, and it \nis not quite as intense as crack. It does not cause addiction nearly so \nquickly. So there is a difference.\n  The idea of a 10-to-1 ratio is a movement in the right direction.\n  But my reluctance at this point with this legislation is simply this: \nI believe it is time for us to look at the drug guidelines and the \npenalties we are imposing. This legislation would have no impact on the \ncurrent crack guidelines but would raise the powder guidelines.\n  We are talking about 50 grams of powder cocaine which you could \nvirtually hold in one hand--50 grams of powder cocaine, 5 years without \nparole; 5 grams of crack, which could easily be held in one hand, is 5 \nyears without parole in the Federal system. That is what we are talking \nabout--Federal law, Federal penalties, not States which can have their \nown sentences in any way they want.\n  I say to the Chair that, as a prosecutor, I took the enforcement of \nlaw seriously. We had one of the highest average sentences in the \nUnited States. I think one year we had the highest average sentence \nimposed in the United States in drug cases. We were honest in how we \npresented the case: This is the way it worked; this is what the law is.\n  You charge an individual with selling crack cocaine, and normally the \ncase doesn't just go down on the fact that he is caught with 25, 30, or \n40 grams. Normally, you are prosecuting in Federal court an \norganization of drug dealers. You would bring in the underling who \nworked for that leader. You would ask him how long he had been out on \nthis street corner or selling from this crack house. Then they say a \nyear. How much has he sold over that year? Pretty soon, the amount goes \nup to kilograms, 1,000 grams, multikilograms of crack have been \ndistributed, and that person is looking at literally 30 years, 20 \nyears, or life without parole.\n  I have seen sentences in Federal court of quite a number of young men \nand women to life without parole, and others 30 years, 25 years, or 20 \nyears without parole. I believe strong sentences are effective. I \nbelieve they allow the law enforcement community to break the back of \nan illegal ring such as a drug ring.\n  I don't want to go into any significant reduction in sentences, but I \nthink it is time for us to evaluate whether or not we are approaching \nthe drug penalties in the appropriate way. The judges are concerned. \nJudges think this minimum mandatory which has the effect of driving up \nall of the sentencing guidelines is too tough.\n  General Barry McCaffrey has questioned the crack and powder cocaine \nlaws as proposed in this amendment. He believes there is a better \napproach to it. I think it is time for us to consider that. I believe \nwe have had these guidelines in effect for quite some time now--well \nover a decade. I believe we ought to look at it, have some hearings, \nand study it.\n  I didn't want to, by voting for this amendment, suggest I was \ncomfortable with these guidelines. In fact, my inclination would be not \nto vote for the amendment for that reason.\n  I simply think the best way to reduce drug trafficking by law \nenforcement is to have more prosecutions. It is less important--I did \nthis as a prosecutor for 17 years. I chaired the U.S. Attorneys \nCommittee for the United States here in Washington on drug abuse and \ndrug issues. I am a full and total believer in the sentencing \nguidelines, the tough Federal laws that are out there.\n\n  But if you ask me, my personal view is that I would prefer to have 10 \npeople caught and sentenced to 7 years in jail rather than 5 people \ncaught and sentenced to 14 years in jail. The best way\n\n[[Page S14453]]\n\nfor us to improve our pressure from the law enforcement end on drug \ntrafficking in America is to increase prosecutions and investigations. \nWhether they serve 7 years, 9 years, 12 years, or 6 years is less \nimportant than people who are out dealing drugs who know they are going \nto get caught and they are going to have a big time sentence to serve, \nand it is without parole.\n  Make no mistake about it, in State systems they normally serve a \nthird of the time. This Congress a number of years ago, in a great \npiece of legislation, passed honesty in sentencing that says you serve \nwhat the judge gives you; and not only that, but you have to serve the \nsentence that the sentencing guidelines call for.\n  Based on the amount of drugs literally when the case hits a judge's \nsentencing docket and the judge looks at it, it may be the difference \nbetween 18 and 21 years. If he likes a defendant and feels sorry for \nhim, he gives him 18 years. If he doesn't like him, he gives him 21 \nyears. That is about all the discretion he has.\n  I am not sure we ought not to take time now to reevaluate that to \nmake sure we are properly sentencing and we are using our resources of \nincarceration wisely. What is it, $20,000 a year, to keep somebody in \nprison? Wouldn't it be better to drive down drug use by intensive \nprosecutions across the board, letting the drug dealer know he is soon \ngoing to be caught and will serve a significant amount of time, than \njust taking a few people and sending them off for 30 years without \nparole? I believe that would be a better policy. I am prepared to \nconsider that. I am prepared to work with General McCaffrey and \nAttorney General Reno and others in an open and fair way.\n  I do not believe we ought to eliminate the sentencing guidelines. I \ndo not believe we ought to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for \ncertain amounts of drugs. I believe that is appropriate. I don't \nbelieve we ought to retreat from a tough law enforcement presence with \nregard to illegal drug use.\n  Just this morning, Senator Coverdell hosted with General McCaffrey a \nbreakfast for the Attorney General of Mexico. I was able to sit at his \ntable and share thoughts about what we can do as two nations to improve \nour war against drugs. Mexico is in a crisis perhaps bigger than they \nrealize. As the power of that illegal drug empire grows, the harder and \nharder it is for that country to contain it. They have to, not because \nwe pressure them, out of their own self-interest save that country from \nbeing corrupted and destabilized by a powerful, wealthy drug empire. I \nhope we can encourage that and work together to assist with that.\n  We in the United States need to continue our effective efforts over \nthe years to do education, prevention, treatment, prosecution, and \nincarceration of drug dealers. If we continue that effort and the \ninterdiction effort, I believe we can bring drug use down. Everybody in \nthis country will benefit from that.\n  I wanted to share my thoughts on this. I hope to be able to vote for \nthis amendment. But I am not sure I can. I believe we need to seriously \nevaluate the sentencing guidelines and the mandatory sentences for drug \nuse in America to make sure they are rational, that they are \neffectuating our effort as much as they possibly can to reduce drug use \nand illegal distribution of drugs in America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bankruptcy \nbill. I have supported a number of amendments to it. I believe this \nbill does achieve a balance between society's interest of people paying \ntheir debts and preventing debtors from being permanently ruined.\n  Senator Grassley and Senator Torricelli have made a good-faith effort \nto strike that balance. I am an original cosponsor of the bill. I \nsupported some reasonable changes that will improve the bill. If those \nchanges are adopted by a majority of the Senate, I intend to support \nfinal passage of what I consider to be a very important piece of \nlegislation that will make certain people don't take undue advantage of \nthe bankruptcy laws, especially those who can reasonably be expected to \npay at least part of their debts. These individuals are not excused \nentirely. That is, in essence, what Senator Grassley and Senator \nTorricelli have attempted to do. I believe they have struck a fair \nbalance and gotten that done.\n  I understand this is the last legislative vehicle heading, hopefully, \ntoward the President's signature.\n  I want to speak about the methamphetamine amendment that has been \noffered that we will vote on relatively soon. Staff has advised me I \nshould vote for it, that I should not be seen as being weak on fighting \nthe battle against methamphetamines. I have come to the floor and I \nwish the author of this amendment were on the floor to ask him, why \nshouldn't I be angry that this amendment has been converted from a good \npiece of legislation that would provide additional resources, that \nwould give additional resources to our DEA agents to enable law \nenforcement to fight in Nebraska the battle against methamphetamines? \nThat is what we are trying to do.\n  I have worked with almost every single sheriff, almost every single \nlaw enforcement officer--whether chief of police or the head of our \nhighway patrol--trying to win this battle, and we are not winning it. \nWe have the juvenile justice bill tied up in conference; why don't we \npass it? Because we can't reach agreement on how to regulate gun \nownership. It provides additional resources to win this battle, to \nenable us to say we are doing all we can to keep our kids safe against \na drug that will destroy their lives.\n  What do we have before the Senate? An amendment that has a school \nvoucher proposal in it. I hear from my judges, from my law enforcement \nofficers, that the net effect of the changes in the penalties on crack \nand powder cocaine, to increase the penalty to the mandatory minimum on \npowder cocaine, will be we divert more resources from fighting the \nbattle on dealers and high-level drug usage to fighting the battle \nagainst those individuals using cocaine occasionally or on a one-time \nbasis. We will be arresting and putting college kids in jail. That is \nwhat we will be doing.\n  I am angry we have interfered with a good faith effort. The \nunderlying provisions of this methamphetamine bill I find to be \nattractive with the urgency of this problem. In Nebraska, we started \nthis 5 or 6 years ago when the problem of methamphetamine first came to \nlight. We devoted more resources as part of the HIDTA--High Intensity \nDrug Trafficking Area--effort, part of the multiagency effort. Law \nenforcement people say they are starting to get this under control; \nthey are making more arrests; they are putting people away. The tougher \npenalties in here I support because we need to have tougher penalties \nin place. They say they are getting the job done, but all of a sudden \nwe are playing politics with it again.\n  I favor the underlying methamphetamine effort that is in this \namendment. But to attach a school voucher proposal to it and additional \nmandatory minimums that will redirect resources away from the real \nserious problems in my community is offensive to me personally. Not \nonly will I vote against it, I intend to write a letter to every law \nenforcement officer in Nebraska and say to them, they also should be \nangry. We haven't passed the Juvenile Justice Act. We are not providing \nresources necessary to solve this problem, and we are playing politics, \nworst of all, trying to seek advantage, trying to put an amendment up \nthat is difficult to vote against.\n  It won't be difficult for me to vote against this amendment. I am sad \nthat is what I have to do because we are playing politics rather than \ntrying to actually provide our law enforcement officers with the \nresources they need to solve what has become in Nebraska one of my most \ndifficult law enforcement problems to solve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am opposed to amendment No. 2771 to S. \n625, the bankruptcy bill, because it contains a provision allowing \nschool districts to use funds from any federal education program to \nprovide a school voucher to any student attending a Title I school that \nhas been the victim of a violent crime on school grounds. I believe \nthat providing vouchers to students to attend private or parochial \nschools is a wrong-headed policy notion that would do nothing to \nimprove the education system that 90% American\n\n[[Page S14454]]\n\nchildren depend upon. Further, the Hatch amendment attempts to relieve \nonly those students against whom a violent crime has been committed, \nbut does nothing to improve school safety for students remaining in the \npublic schools.\n  Federal funding must be focused on improving educational excellence \nin our nation's public schools. Money provided by the federal \ngovernment to state and local education agencies is critical to \nincreasing student achievement and improving teacher quality. A \ndisservice to the public school system is done with this money is \ndirected to private or parochial schools. School reform should not \ntranslate into an abandonment of our nation's public schools.\n  I agree with Mr. Hatch in that there is a crisis of violence and \ndisruption undermining too many classrooms. Last year 6,000 children \nwere expelled from public schools and there were 4,000 cases of rape or \nsexual battery reported. Parents, students, and educators know that \nserious school reform will only succeed in a safe and orderly learning \nenvironment. But Mr. President, my solution for stemming the tide of \nviolence differs radically from that of Mr. Hatch. Instead of \nabandoning the public schools, the legislation that Mr. Smith of Oregon \nand I introduced would establish a competitive grant program for school \ndistricts to create ``Second Chance Schools.'' In order to receive the \nfunds, school districts would need to have in place district-wide \ndiscipline codes which use clear language with specific examples of \nbehaviors that will result in disciplinary action and have every \nstudent and parent sign the code. Additionally, schools could use the \nfunds to promote effective classroom management; provide training for \nschool staff and administrators in enforcement of the code; implement \nprograms to modify student behavior including hiring school counselors; \nand establish high quality alternative placements for chronically \ndisruptive and violent students that include a continuum of \nalternatives from meeting with behavior management specialists, to \nshort-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration in-school \nsuspension rooms, to off-campus alternatives. Schools could implement a \nrange of interventions including short-term in-school crisis centers, \nmedium duration in-school suspension rooms, and off-campus \nalternatives. Mr. President, I advocate a solution to the problem of \nviolence in our schools that would help troubled students and ensure \nthose students do not act out again, in their schools, in their homes, \nor in their communities.\n  Mr. President, I also oppose this amendment because it would require \nlocal school officials to determine whether a student has committed a \ndrug felony on school property. Administrators and educators in this \ncountry's public schools are not trained or well-suited to perform the \njob of law enforcement officers. Their job is to establish policies \nregulating drugs, alcohol, and tobacco on school grounds, but the \nbusiness of suspected drug felonies should clearly be handled by law \nenforcement officers.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Hatch and Ashcroft that will help to \nreduce drug abuse and illegal narcotics trafficking throughout the \nUnited States. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation.\n  I am very concerned about the rate of illegal drug abuse across the \nnation. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, there \nare over 13 million current users of any illicit drug among those aged \n12 or over, and 4 million chronic drug users in America.\n  These national statistics are similar to drug abuse patterns in my \nhome state of Minnesota. The 1998 Minnesota Student Survey conducted by \nthe Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning and the \nMinnesota Department of Human Services revealed increased marijuana use \nin each age group studied--sixth graders, ninth graders, and high \nschool seniors--over the past three years. In 1998, 30 percent of \nMinnesota seniors surveyed reported using marijuana in the previous \nyear.\n  In addition, the high volume of illegal methamphetamine trafficking \nand production in Minnesota has placed enormous strain upon the \nresources of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies \ninvestigating the abuse of this deadly substance. In recent years, the \nnumber of methamphetamine treatment admissions to treatment centers and \n``meth'' arrests of juveniles and adults has increased dramatically \nthroughout our communities. Methamphetamine has become the drug of \nchoice throughout Minnesota and is closely associated with increased \ncrime and gang violence.\n  I am also troubled by the large number of national drug trafficking \norganizations that have established operations in Minnesota. The \nalarming rate of meth production and trafficking in my state has been \ncaused by independent organizations that run clandestine laboratories \nin apartment complexes, farms, motel rooms and residences with \ninexpensive, over-the-counter materials. The secretive nature of the \nmanufacturing process involves toxic chemicals, and frequently results \nin fires, damaging explosions, and destruction to our environment. Meth \ntrafficking in both Minnesota and the United States has severely \nthreatened the health and safety of our citizens, and crippled our \nnational movement against drug abuse.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased that the amendment offered by \nSenators Hatch and Ashcroft includes the major provisions of \nlegislation that I have recently cosponsored, the ``DEFEAT Meth Act'' \nintroduced by Senator Ashcroft. This amendment will increase penalties \nfor meth crimes, provide additional federal assistance to local law \nenforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute meth trafficking, \nimplement community-based methamphetamine treatment and prevention \nprograms, and safely cleanup illegal meth labs.\n\n  In my view, any proposal to combat illegal meth trafficking should \nalso provide added security to our nation's farmers and farm businesses \nwho must protect their farms from the theft of anhydrous ammonia, a \ncrop fertilizer which is often used as an ingredient in the illegal \nmanufacture of methamphetamine. Importantly, this amendment makes it \nillegal to steal anhuydrous ammonia or to transport stolen anhudrous \nammonia across state lines if a person knows that this product will be \nused to illegally manufacture a controlled substance such as \nmethamphetamine.\n  As someone working to secure High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \ndesignation for the State of Minnesota, I am also very pleased that \nthis proposal provides additional resources to investigate and \nprosecute meth production and trafficking in HIDTA regions throughout \nthe country. This program administered by the nation's drug czar is a \ncritical component of our federal drug control strategy.\n  The Hatch-Ashcroft amendment also toughens federal policy toward \npowder cocaine dealers, building upon the ``Powder Cocaine Sentencing \nAct of 1999'' which I have supported throughout this Congress. As my \ncolleagues know, the current law provides that a dealer must distribute \n500 grams of powder cocaine to qualify for a 5-year mandatory minimum \nprison sentence, and distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine to qualify for \nthat offense. These sentencing guidelines result in a 100-to-1 quantity \nratio between powder and more severe crack cocaine distribution \nsentences.\n  The Hatch-Ashcroft amendment represents a fair and effective approach \ntoward federal cocaine sentencing policy. Rather than make federal \ncrack cocaine sentences more lenient, this amendment would reduce from \n500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted \nof distributing before receiving a mandatory five-year sentence. This \nlegislation would adjust the current 100-to-1 quantity ratio to 10-to-1 \nby toughening powder cocaine sentences with reducing crack cocaine \nsentences.\n  I share the concern of parents and families regarding the violence \nwhich is occurring at an alarming rate at our nation's schools. Our \nchildren should be provided with the opportunity to learn in a safe and \ndrug-free environment. We should make it clear that drug offenders will \nnot be allowed to prey upon the innocence of young people and students.\n  In my view, the Hatch-Ashcroft amendment will help local school \ndistricts stop the flow of illegal drugs into our classrooms. \nSpecifically, this proposal increases the mandatory minimum penalties \nfor distribution of\n\n[[Page S14455]]\n\ndrugs to minors and for distribution of illegal drugs near schools and \nother locations frequented by juveniles. The amendment also requires \nschool districts that receive federal funds to have expulsion policies \nfor students who bring large quantities of drugs on school grounds. \nThis is consistent with the current law which requires similar policies \nfor students who bring firearms to school.\n  I understand the concerns expressed by some Members of Congress, \nfederal judges, and the public regarding the fairness of mandatory \nminimum sentences. However, I believe mandatory minimum sentences for \ncertain drug offenses is an important part of our national drug control \npolicy and contributes to safer schools, work places, and communities.\n  Mr. President, the sale, manufacture and distribution of illegal \ndrugs is one of the most difficult challenges facing our country. Drug \nabuse is a daily threat to the lives of young people and the health and \nsafety of our communities. I believe a strong national anti-drug \nmassage should include the proposals contained within this amendment. \nPassage of this proposal will provide greater protection to Americans \nfrom drug offenders, and drug-related crime and violence.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndisappointment concerning amendment 2771 to the Bankruptcy bill that we \nare voting on today. Earlier this year, I was an original cosponsor of \nS. 562, the methamphetamine bill introduced by Senator Harkin, to \nimplement a coordinated effort to combat methamphetamine abuse. I am \nvery concerned about the abuse of methamphetamine in my home state of \nNew Mexico, and I am very concerned about the rise in meth labs in my \nstate. That is why I wholeheartedly supported the provisions aimed at: \n(1) combating the spread of methamphetamine; (2) treating abusers of \nmeth; (3) developing prevention programs; and (4) researching meth. I \nwas glad to see that Senator Hatch accepted the treatment, prevention \nand research provisions that were in S. 562 when drafting this \namendment.\n  Meth is a highly addictive drug and I have supported efforts to stop \nthe spread of meth in our rural communities. I support tougher \npenalties for meth lab operators and traffickers. I support resources \nto law enforcement to cover the cost of dismantling toxic meth labs.\n  However, because of the provision added to this amendment at the last \nminute, concerning school vouchers, I am unable to vote for an \notherwise good meth bill. I regret that the drafters of this amendment \nfelt it necessary to politicize this bill with issues like school \nvouchers that are unrelated to the methamphetamine issue. These \nattempts to undermine the bipartisan support for this meth bill are \nunfortunate.\n  While I support providing resources to law enforcement to battle the \nmethamphetamine epidemic and have been a strong advocate for ways to \nimprove school security, I cannot support the use of federal funds to \nsend students to private or parochial schools under a legislative \nprovision riddled with problems.\n  The provision allowing schools to use federal funds to send a student \nto a private school, including a religious school, if they become a \nvictim of a violent crime on school grounds, will do nothing to make \nour schools safer and will only divert crucial funding from our public \nschool system. In addition, the language is overly broad. If a student \nis injured on school grounds, at any time, the student will be entitled \nto attend the school of his or her choice anywhere in the state. This \nprovision would allow the child who gets into a fight following a \nweekend basketball game to enroll in a private school--free of charge. \nThe amendment would even allow federal funds to be used to transport \nthe student to the private schools, even though federal funds could not \nbe used to transport a student to a public school within the student's \ncurrent school district.\n  Instead of pushing an overly broad voucher proposal which will damage \nour schools rather than improve them, we should focus on supporting \nviolence and crime prevention programs for our youth. We should support \ncommunity crime prevention activities that encourage parent and \ncommunity involvement, and help communities and schools ensure that all \nchildren are safe all the time. For example, the juvenile crime bill--\nthat has been sitting in Conference since this summer--properly \naddresses school safety in a comprehensive manner. My Republican \ncolleagues have blocked final passage of that bill.\n  In addition, we should invest in initiatives such as the Safe and \nDrug-free Schools and after-school programs, since we know that most \njuvenile crimes occur between 3:00 and 8:00 p.m. As my colleague \nSenator Harkin pointed out, the Republican leadership passed a bill \nthat allocates only 50% of the amount that the President requested for \nthis purpose.\n  Instead of draining much-needed resources from public schools, we \nshould create conditions for improvement and reform--not in a few \nschools, but in all schools; not for a few students, but for all \nstudents.\n  By attaching these voucher provisions and issues unrelated to meth \nand the underlying bankruptcy bill, this entire amendment has been \npoisoned. If the Majority Leader was serious about passing a meth bill \nto aid law enforcement and reduce meth abuse, he could have offered a \nmeth bill as a freestanding bill. However, by offering it as a non-\ngermane amendment to the bankruptcy bill, this meth bill has little \nchance of surviving a bankruptcy conference committee and is a shallow \nattempt to help the groups fighting the spread of drugs in our states. \nLike many of my colleagues here today, I am angry that the poison pill, \nadded to this meth bill at the final hour, converted a good piece of \nlegislation into a bill that I cannot vote for.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns \nabout the provision of this amendment which authorizes vouchers for \nprivate schools.\n  Nearly all year we have had an ongoing debate over education. We have \ndiscussed funding, flexibility, accountability and numerous other \nissues. And each side has claimed they were on the side of the angels--\nthe children and the schools--in these debates.\n  But in these last few weeks the masks have finally slipped off--\nHalloween is over and today we can see what direction my colleagues on \nthe other side want to take education in this country.\n  In appropriations, they are fighting hard, very hard, against a \nnational commitment to reduce class size. We all, even my colleagues on \nthe other side, know, through research and from the voices of teachers \nand parents across the country, that class size is a key barrier to \nachievement particularly in the early grades. Too many children in a \nclass overwhelm even the best teacher--discipline issues, control, \nnoise and lack of focus define these classes of 25-30 children. But no, \nthe Republicans claim they just will not accept a continued federal \nfocus in this area.\n  On this bill, they will offer one amendment to block grant teacher \ntraining and professional development programs and reduce \naccountability in the critical area of improving teacher quality.\n  And they have slipped into this ``drug'' amendment a major voucher \nprogram for private schools.\n  Vouchers, block grants, and no class size--their position on \neducation is clear.\n  They are not for improving public schools for all children. They are \nnot for parents or students or teachers. They instead are for their own \nspecial interests--they are for private schools, not neighborhood \nschools; for state bureaucracy, not a focus on class size; for revenue \nsharing, not accountability.\n  This commitment to a few rather than all of our children is no where \nmore clear than in the provision before us authorizing private \nvouchers.\n  Our universal system of public education is one of the very \ncornerstones of our nation, our democracy and our culture.\n  In every community, public schools are where America comes together \nin its rich diversity. For generations, educating the rich, poor, \nblack, white, first-generation Americans--be they Irish, English, \nJapanese or Mexican-Americans--and all Americans has been the charge \nand challenge of our public schools. It is clearly not the\n\n[[Page S14456]]\n\neasiest task. But its importance cannot be undervalued.\n  These efforts are essential to our democracy which relies on an \neducated citizenry, to our communities which require understanding of \ndiversity to function, and to our economy which thrives on highly \neducated and trained workers. Education--public education--is also the \ndoor to economic opportunity for all citizens individually.\n  However, voucher proposals, like the one before us today, \nfundamentally undermine this ideal of public education.\n  Supporters of these programs never argue they will serve all \nchildren. They simply argue it is a way for some children to get out of \npublic schools.\n  I do not argue that our public schools do not face challenges--\nviolence, disinvestment and declining revenues plague some of our \nschools, just as they do many other community institutions.\n  And our schools are not ignoring these problems--even with limited \nresources.\n  Many are digging themselves out of these problems to offer real hope \nand opportunities to students. James Comer in Connecticut has led a \nrevolution in public schools across the country by supporting parents \nand improving education through community involvement and reinvestment \nin the schools. Public magnet and charter schools are flourishing \noffering students innovative curriculum and new choices within the \npublic school system. School safety programs, violence prevention \ncurriculum and character education initiatives are making real gains in \nthe struggle against violence in our schools and larger communities.\n  And these reform efforts are beginning to show results. Our schools \nare getting better. Student achievement is up in math, science and \nreading. The reach of technology has spread to nearly all of our \nschools. The dropout rate continues to decline.\n  We clearly have a ways to go before all our schools are models of \nexcellence, but our goal must be to lend a hand in these critical \nefforts, not withdraw our support for the schools that educate 90 \npercent of all students in America--public schools.\n  And there is no question about it, private school vouchers will \ndivert much needed dollars away from public schools. Our dollars are \nlimited. We must focus them on improving opportunities for all children \nby improving the system that serves all children--the public schools.\n  Proponents of private school choice argue that vouchers will open up \nnew educational opportunities to low-income families and their \nchildren. In fact, vouchers offer private schools, not parent's choice. \nThe private schools will pick and choose students, as they do now. Few \nwill choose to serve students with low test scores, with disabilities \nor with discipline problems. Vouchers will not come close to covering \nthe cost of tuition at the vast majority of private schools.\n  There are also important accountability issues. Private institutions \ncan fold in mid-year as nearly half a dozen have done in Milwaukee \nleaving taxpayers to pick up these pieces--only the pieces are \nchildren's lives and educations.\n  Our public schools are not just about any one child; they are about \nall children and all of us. I do not have any children, but I pay \nproperty taxes and do so happily to support the education of the \nchildren I am counting on to be tomorrow's workers, thinkers, leaders, \nteachers and taxpayers.\n  Our future is dependent on nurturing and developing the potential of \nevery child to its fullest. Investing in our public schools is the best \nway to reach this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the scourge of illegal drugs is one of \nthe greatest problems facing our nation today. We have all heard \nstories about the wreckage of crime and shattered lives that drugs \nleave in their wake. Tragically, after years of steady progress in the \nwar on drugs we have seen a reversal in hopeful trend lines under the \ncurrent administration. I believe that the Ashcroft-Hatch-Abraham \namendment can be an important step towards reducing the trend of \nincreased drug use and putting our nation back on the road to victory \nin the war on drugs.\n  I am pleased that this legislation takes special aim at \nmethamphetamines. In recent years, ``meth'' as it is called, has \nemerged as the leading illegal drug of choice, replacing cocaine as the \nmost popularly used drug. In some ways ``meth'' is even worse than \ncocaine. It is cheap, easy to produce, highly addictive, and it kills. \nThis drug is proving especially devastating in rural America. In my \nState of Kentucky, ``meth'' labs have been springing up like a deadly \ncancer in our communities. The methamphetamines produced in these labs \nare addicting adults and children at an alarming rate. We need to do \nsomething to combat this threat to our families and communities.\n  This antidrug legislation contains some important provisions to \nstrengthen the war on drugs. The increased sentences for \nmethamphetamines related offenses will send a clear message to dealers, \nproducers, and users that we will not tolerate the problems they are \nbringing to our communities. This legislation also directs the DEA to \nmount a comprehensive offensive against this drug. Finally, it will \nprovide additional resources for hard hit areas--especially those in \nrural America--that are struggling with the rising tide of ``meth'' \nproduction and use. The legislation will help these areas combat \nmethamphetamine trafficking and implement abuse prevention efforts.\n  Mr. President, methamphetamine production and use has become a very \nserious problem in our country. It is time that Congress took aim at \nthis issue. I support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to \ndo likewise.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President. I rise in support of the Republican crime \namendment (#2771) to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. This amendment \ntakes a multi-faceted approach to combating the problem of drugs. \nHowever, I am particularly pleased with the methamphetamine component \nof the amendment, which will help my own state of Arizona combat a \nveritable meth epidemic.\n  Arizona law enforcement continues to seize a record number of meth \nlabs. Meth lab seizures are up to 30 percent over last year, with over \n400 labs projected to be dismantled by the end of this fiscal year. An \naverage of 26 labs per month are seized--that's almost one lab per day.\n  Meth usage is up, I am sad to report. Phoenix has the second highest \nrate for meth emergency-room admissions in the United States, according \nto the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). Phoenix also has the second \nhighest percent of arrestees testing positive for meth in the U.S. \naccording to the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring program (ADAM).\n  Meth prosecutions are up, as well. The number of meth cases \nprosecuted by the Maricopa County Attorney's office in the first five \nmonths of this year was equal to all of the cases prosecuted during \n1990.\n  This amendment provides a well-balanced approach to tackling meth by \nnot only increasing penalties for certain meth-related crimes but also \nproviding money to law enforcement (DEA and HIDTAs) for training, \npersonnel, and meth lab cleanups, and providing money for prevention. \nThe amendment also pays special attention to the anti-meth needs of \nrural communities by providing funding so the DEA can assist rural law \nenforcement in meth investigations. Many rural counties in my state \ncannot afford the latest and safest equipment, so they use old and \nunsafe equipment. Limited personnel and expansive terrain hinder meth-\nlab seizures. For example, Mohave County law enforcement seized about \none lab per week last year and could have seized double that if they \nhad the resources.\n  Because of Arizona's meth problem, I have fought for additional \nfunding for Arizona law enforcement. Last year, I secured $1 million \nfor Arizona law enforcement to use for equipment, personnel, and \ntraining in order to combat meth. This was in direct response to a \nfield hearing I held in Phoenix highlighting the problem of meth and \nmeth labs. During the hearing I heard from urban and rural law \nenforcement on the dangers posed by meth labs as well as their drain on \nresources.\n  I support this amendment because it will give law enforcement the \nresources needed to combat the problem of meth in my state.\n\n[[Page S14457]]\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate amendment \n2771 to S. 625 because it will provide additional federal resources to \ncombat the dramatic increase in the production, use and distribution of \nmethamphetamine which I believe must be stopped.\n  Methamphetamine is particularly insidious because it is highly \naddictive, cheap, easy to produce and distribute, popular with youth, \nand tends to make its users paranoid and violent. Thus, crimes like \nburglaries, theft, shoplifting, robberies, and murder can be traced to \nmethamphetamine use. In fact, the prosecuting attorney of my home \ncounty, Benton County, Arkansas, estimates that 70% of the felony court \ndocket is directly or indirectly related to methamphetamine. Another, \noften-forgotten but tragic problem which accompanies methamphetamine \nuse is child abuse. Children of methamphetamine users have specific \nproblems associated with their parents' drug addictions: medical, \nenvironmental, and educational neglect; malnutrition; and sometimes \nphysical abuse. According to child welfare workers, parents who use \nmeth are more likely to physically abuse their children than parents \nwho use other drugs.\n  Methamphetamine is a serious and growing problem in my home state of \nArkansas because the state of Arkansas possesses many of the \ncharacteristics which allow drug trafficking to flourish: it is \nsparsely populated with remote areas; it suffers from a high rate of \npoverty and joblessness and a low per capita income; it has a large \npopulation of illegal immigrants; and it has two major interstate \nhighways which facilitate the transportation of drugs to Oklahoma City, \nKansas City, Memphis, St. Louis, and throughout the rest of the nation.\n  The rapid increase and magnitude of the methamphetamine problem is \nillustrated in my home state's experience. In 1995, the Arkansas State \nPolice seized 24 methamphetamine labs; in 1996, the number of labs \nseized more than tripled to 95, then more than tripled again to 242 in \n1997, and doubled again to 434 labs in 1998. Recently, the DEA \nidentified Arkansas as one of the top three methamphetamine-producing \nstates in the nation, based on per-capita figures. The growth of the \nmethamphetamine problem in my home state is also seen by the increase \nin the amount spent to clean up clandestine lab sites, which is one of \nthe most dangerous activities law enforcement officers must undertake. \nIn 1998, $567,000 was spent on clandestine lab cleanups associated with \nfederal agencies in Arkansas whereas five years before, only $71,000 \nwas expended.\n  I support this amendment because it provides an additional $15 \nmillion a year to the Office of National Drug Control Policy to \nfacilitate the hiring of federal, state, and local enforcement \npersonnel to combat methamphetamine trafficking in designated HIDTAs. \nIt is my hope that such an increase will result in the designation of \nadditional HIDTAs in areas, like my home state, where the greatest \nincrease in the methamphetamine problem is occurring. I also support \nthis amendment because of the additional $9.5 million it provides to \nenable the DEA to hire new agents to help state and local enforcement \nofficials in the small and mid-sized towns with limited resources where \nmethamphetamine is so often found to conduct more methamphetamine \ninvestigations. This amendment also will provide an additional $5.5 \nmillion for the DEA to train state and local law enforcement officials \nin one of their most dangerous duties, the cleanup of methamphetamine \nlabs.\n  Finally, I wish to commend and thank Senators Hatch, Ashcroft, \nGrassley, and my other colleagues who have worked so tirelessly on this \nbill and to address the methamphetamine problem and urge my colleagues \nto pass this amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the drug \namendment to the bankruptcy reform bill introduced by my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  S. 486, the Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999, has been \ndrastically altered to give us the amendment we are now debating. I was \na proud cosponsor of that bipartisan bill. It would provide needed law \nenforcement training and resources to combat meth, as well as \nprevention and treatment resources for meth users, to my state, \nWisconsin, and all states in the Midwest that have been overrun by this \nhorrible drug. The Judiciary Committee explored the extent of the meth \nproblem and the urgent need for federal resources and support to fight \nthe spread of meth. Hearings and a mark-up of the Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act were held. The bill was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee only after extensive negotiations between members from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Now, as we debate bankruptcy reform, I am greatly troubled to see \nthat this well-crafted bill has been contorted into a bill with all \nsorts of provisions that have nothing to do with methamphetamine and \nare bad policy, pure and simple. First, the bill has been saddled with \nthe Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act. The powder cocaine bill is \nobjectionable because it raises powder cocaine penalties to extremely \nhigh levels--ensuring further prison overcrowding without offering any \nconcrete effort to promote cocaine use prevention and treatment. The \npowder cocaine bill has been attached to this amendment, even though it \nhas not been considered by the Judiciary Committee. The Committee \nhasn't even had a hearing this year on the bill. Second, the drug \namendment is bad policy because it includes a voucher provision that \nwould provide federal funding for some children to attend private \nschool at taxpayer expense, without providing any resources to improve \nthe overall quality of education for the children who remain in our \npublic schools.\n  As a result, I cannot support the drug amendment to the bankruptcy \nreform bill. I want to be clear. I am committed to fighting the spread \nof meth in Wisconsin and across the country. But I cannot support an \namendment that will do harm to our nation's schools and to our effort \nto punish cocaine offenders fairly. If the drug amendment passes, I \nurge the conferees on this bill to remove the troubling provisions \nrelating to powder cocaine and school vouchers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2655\n\n (Purpose: To provide for enhanced consumer credit protection, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the \npending amendment aside and call to the floor amendment No. 2655, and \nthat the Senate then return to the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], for himself, \n     Mr. Grassley, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2655.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, \nNovember 5, 1999, under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, at the outset of this debate for \nbankruptcy reform, I made clear my own feelings that, as important as I \nthought it was to reform the bankruptcy laws, in fairness, the \nlegislation needed to be balanced by addressing some of the abuses in \nthe credit industry.\n  In recent days, Senators Durbin and Dodd have come to the floor with \ntheir own variations to protect consumers and the credit industry's own \nexcesses. Those amendments have not been successful.\n  I offer what I believe is a balanced and is clearly a bipartisan \neffort to include some consumer protection in this legislation. It is \nnot based on a theory of government intervention or restriction on \ncredit. It is based on the theory of giving consumers information to \nmake their own judgments. I offer this amendment with Senator Grassley, \nwho has been both accommodating and has offered leadership in fair \nconsumer protection, with Senator Leahy and Senator Biden.\n  As I outline the amendment, I think it will be clear we borrowed \nheavily from ideas offered by Senators Grassley, Biden, and Leahy but \nalso consumer protection initiatives in part\n\n[[Page S14458]]\n\npreviously offered by Senator Schumer, Senator Reed, Senator Hatch, and \nSenator Gramm. That is why it is all inclusive and why it is balanced.\n  There has been a great deal of attention on the rise of consumer \nbankruptcy in recent years. The numbers bear some repeating. Since \n1980, there has been a 350-percent increase in bankruptcy filings. \nIndeed, there are many reasons for it. Part of the crushing debt \nforcing millions of Americans into bankruptcy clearly is the \navailability of credit. In the last 23 years, the debt burden by \nAmerican families has quadrupled. Twenty percent of families earning \nless than $10,000 have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of \ntheir income.\n  As this chart indicates, consumer bankruptcies and consumer credit \ndebt are nearly identically tracking each other. One cannot separate \nthe rise in bankruptcies from the level of consumer debt. They are one \nand the same problem.\n  Therefore, as certainly as we deal with other reasons for the abuse \nof bankruptcies, we must at least deal in part with this issue of \navailability of credit and whether consumers are fully informed.\n  In 1975, total household debt was 24 percent of aggregate household \nincome. Today, the number is more than 100 percent. That bears \nrepeating: Household income and household debt have now matched each \nother in an extraordinary and dangerous statistic. Certainly, one of \nthe factors that has led to this radical rise in household debt is the \namount of solicitation of consumer credit card debt, which include both \naggressive and dubious solicitation techniques.\n\n  In 1998, the credit industry sent out more than 3.5 billion \nsolicitations. That is 41 mailings for every American household; 14 \ncredit solicitations for every man, woman, and child in America. This \ndoes not simply represent aggressive marketing for Americans with high \nincomes who can afford this increase in credit; it includes high school \nand college students, a situation so serious, as Senator Dodd pointed \nout yesterday on the floor of the Senate, that 450 colleges and \nuniversities have banned the marketing of credit cards on their \ncampuses; so serious that credit card debt is a leading reason for \ncollege students dropping out of school.\n  I recognize the problem. Our amendment does not restrict access to \ncredit, as many Senators would not support that. There is no mandatory \ncontrol. All we are doing is simply ensuring that before people with \nlow income or students incur this debt, they at least know the \nconsequences of the debt they are accepting. If this is true for \nstudents, it is equally true for low-income people. Just in this \ndecade, Americans below the poverty line have doubled their credit \nusage. Indeed, that is one of the reasons credit card debt now accounts \nfor 31 percent of all consumer debt, putting not only students but low-\nincome people on a treadmill from which they will never, ever escape.\n  Yet I recognize why many Senators would never accept restricting \naccess to credit because the availability of credit to low-income \npeople, even to students, in a free economy is part of how they make \ninvestments, make their own judgments. The answer is not to restrict \ncredit to poor people or working people or students. The Senate has \nrejected that technique, and I do not offer it today. I offer full \ndisclosure. Full disclosure means the 55 to 60 million households in \nAmerica that carry a credit card balance on average, month to month, of \n$7,000, which incurs interest and fees of $1,000 a year, will \nunderstand the consequences of that debt before and during incurring \nthat debt. Too few consumers understand making only the minimum payment \nmeans their balance will grow and they may never, in a reasonable \namount of time, have that debt paid.\n  Specifically, what are we asking under this amendment? First, we are \nrequiring a warning as appears on this chart which, in my own office, \nhas modestly been dubbed ``the Torricelli warning.'' It has provisions \nin it specifically that will warn that, with a balance of $1,000 and \n17-percent interest, if the consumer pays only the minimum payment, it \nwill take 88 months to pay off the balance. Here is that warning:\n\n       Minimum payment warning: Making only the minimum payment \n     will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to \n     repay your balance. For example, making only the typical 2-\n     percent minimum monthly payment on a balance of $1,000 at an \n     interest rate of 17 percent would take 88 months to repay the \n     balance in full. For an estimate of the time it would take to \n     repay your balance making only the minimum payments, call \n     this toll-free number.\n\n  First, in this Torricelli warning, we put a 1-800 number that is \navailable for people to call to get the specifics of how long it will \ntake to pay down your account. That is one.\n  No. 2, we will require creditors to disclose that interest on loans \nsecured by a dwelling is tax deductible only to the value of the \nproperty because too many consumers are being told if they secure their \ndebt with their real estate, it is tax deductible, only then to find if \nthey have a debt beyond the value of the property, it is not tax \ndeductible. We want full disclosure of this fact.\n\n  This is based on an amendment previously offered by Senator Reed. It \nhas great merit. I have included it in this amendment that I offer with \nSenator Grassley and others of my colleagues.\n  No. 3, we require that with credit solicitations containing an \nintroductory or teaser rate, which is so popular, the date at which the \nintroductory rate will expire must be clearly and conspicuously \ndisclosed, so people understand these low interest rates will expire \nand when they expire, so they can make an informed judgment as \nconsumers. This is based on legislation previously offered by Senator \nSchumer. I think it is invaluable.\n  No. 4, we require that disclosure of the standard truth-in-lending \ninformation now required for paper solicitations also be required for \nInternet solicitations. What we are already requiring on paper \nsolicitations we simply apply to the Internet. This is also based on an \namendment offered in committee by Senator Schumer. I think it is \nextremely valuable.\n  No. 5, we require prominent disclosure of the date on which a late \nfee will be charged and the amount of the fee. If people are subjecting \nthemselves to late fees, that fact and what the fee would be must be \ndisclosed in the amendment Senator Grassley and I are offering. This, \nas well, is based on something Senator Schumer has done in the past, \nand we are very grateful for his valuable contribution to it.\n  No. 6, finally, we prohibit a creditor from terminating an account \nprior to its expiration date because a consumer has not incurred \nfinance charges. To me, this is the most outrageous of the abuses of \nthe credit industry. A person uses their credit card, they pay off the \nbalance in full, therefore not availing themselves of the credit that \ncould be used, and there is no interest rate because they are paying \noff their balance, and they are getting their credit card taken from \nthem. We would prohibit that. Good consumers who use their credit card \nand do not incur any debt do not have to pay, and should not be \npenalized, for being responsible consumers. We prohibit that practice.\n  I believe, therefore, what we have done with Senator Leahy and \nSenator Biden, under the leadership of Senator Grassley, is balanced, \nit is fair, it is at this point the only chance in the bankruptcy bill \nto have real consumer protection. It is the only amendment being \noffered on a bipartisan basis. It is based on the very good work of \nSenator Reed and Senator Biden, Senator Leahy, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Durbin. I hope, based on that work, this amendment can be \nadopted.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their contributions to \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2650\n\n         (Purpose: To control certain abuses of reaffirmations)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 2650 \nproposed by Senator Reed and myself, and I send a modification to the \ndesk and ask that the amendment be agreed to as modified and the motion \nto reconsider be agreed to and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2650), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Seven-zero.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair and my good friend from Montana.\n  Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama \nfor his comments and others who have spoken on this. He and I belong to \nthat great fraternity which I have always considered the best \nfraternity--former prosecutors. I have sometimes said the best job I \never had was as a prosecutor, although I must admit, when I told the \nU.S. attorney of our State, Charles Tetzlaff, who is a superb U.S. \nattorney, I often wanted to trade with him, he said: ``Yeah, sure you \ndo.'' In my view, it is one of the best positions one can have in \ngovernment, also one that requires the most concern for the public.\n  I wear both hats of a Senator and also as a former prosecutor in \nopposing this amendment. I am not opposing the motivation of Senators \nwho want to stop what has become a scourge of drug use in our country. \nWhen I think of the young people in this country whose lives are \ndamaged by drugs, when I think of families who are damaged, when I \nthink of the people who are victims of crime from those seeking money \nto buy drugs, I fully appreciate what a scourge it is.\n  Right on Capitol Hill, one of the most beautiful parts of our Nation, \nwe have seen people suffer burglaries, muggings, thefts, and assaults \nby people trying to get money for drugs. It is a problem our country, \nprobably more than any other country, has to face because we are the \nwealthiest nation on Earth and we, as a nation, fuel the drug trade \nbecause of all the money we put into it.\n  It is ironic, in a way, that we send in troops and helicopters and \nchemicals to countries to stem the drug production and trade from their \ncountry, when the answer, of course, is within our borders. If we \nworked harder stopping the demand for drugs in the United States, that \ndrug traffic would dry up. If you could turn off the drug production in \na country in Central America and could somehow hermetically seal that \ncountry, as long as there are tens of billions, even hundreds of \nbillions, of dollars willingly spent by U.S. citizens for drugs, drug \nproduction will just take place somewhere else. It is the ultimate \nexample of supply and demand. The supply is always going to be there. \nWe do far too little to stop the demand.\n  We are not going to stop the demand by this amendment because it \ntakes the wrong approach to combating illegal drug use in this country. \nThe amendment would dramatically increase mandatory minimum penalties \nfor cocaine trafficking. It would throw the principle of federalism out \nthe window by telling local schools and school districts how they must \ndeal with illegal drug use by students. Frankly, how my State of \nVermont may want to deal with this may be far different than the State \nof Montana, the State of Alabama, or any other State. I have to think \nwe know our people the best within our States and they are capable of \nmaking those decisions.\n  The amendment attempts to solve the unfair discrepancy between \nsentences for powder and crack cocaine.\n\n[[Page S14461]]\n\n There is an unfair discrepancy, and I do not think people are that far \noff when they say that discrepancy may have racist overtones. We should \nall agree the discrepancy is unfair. In solving that discrepancy \nbetween powder and crack cocaine, this amendment is going about it in \nprecisely the wrong way by increasing the use of mandatory minimums for \nthose who manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to \ndistribute powder cocaine.\n\n  Under the current law--and this is how we get into the improper and \nunfair discrepancy--the quantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimum \npenalties for crack offenders is 100 times more severe than for powder \ncocaine offenders. Let me put this in a different way.\n  If you have an offender charged with a 5-gram-crack-cocaine offense, \nthey would be subject to the same 5-year minimum sentence that would \napply to somebody who was caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine. \nThese harsher crack sentences have resulted in a disparate impact on \nthe African American community. African Americans constitute 12 percent \nof the American population but account for 40 percent of our prison \npopulation. Anybody looking at those numbers know something has gone \nastray. Eighty-eight percent of those convicted of crack offenses are \nblack and, of course, crack offenses always carry the higher penalties. \nIn 1993, the number of African American men under the control of the \ncriminal justice system was greater than the number of African American \nmen enrolled in college. Something has gone dramatically astray in our \ncountry.\n  While it is true that Federal courts have held the disparate impact \ncaused by the crack and powder cocaine mandatory sentencing thresholds \ndoes not violate constitutional protections, the fact existing laws \nfall within the judicially determined boundaries of constitutional \nacceptability does not absolve Congress of its ongoing responsibility \nto implement the most just and effective ways to combat drugs in \nAmerica.\n  Just because an act of Congress may be constitutionally acceptable \ndoes not mean it makes sense. On national highways we could probably \nconstitutionally set a $500 fine for somebody driving 5 miles an hour \nover the speed limit. It would probably be upheld constitutionally, but \ndo we have any constituents who would say it made sense? Of course not.\n  I have repeatedly stated my objections to the shortsighted use of \nmandatory minimums in the battle against illegal drugs because of the \nway they are applied. My objections are all the more grave when an \nattempt is made to increase the use of mandatory minimums through \nprovisions placed in the middle of--what?--an amendment to a bankruptcy \nbill offered as the adjournment bells are almost ringing at the end of \nthe session.\n  We can debate whether mandatory minimums are an appropriate tool in \nour critically important national fight against illegal drugs. I \nbelieve they have not made that much difference. Others would believe \notherwise. In my view, simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums \nundercuts and even subverts the more considered process Congress set up \nwith the Sentencing Commission.\n  The Federal sentencing guidelines already provide a comprehensive \nmechanism to mete out fair sentences. They allow judges the discretion \nthey need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances. In \nother words, sentencing guidelines allow judges to do their jobs.\n  The Sentencing Commission goes through an extensive and thoughtful \nprocess to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-\nmethamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties \nafter very careful analysis of sentencing data, especially recent \nsentencing data. They studied the offenses. They had information from \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, \nprice, and drug quantity. They took all those matters into \nconsideration. Simply increasing arbitrarily, in the middle of a \nbankruptcy bill, mandatory minimums goes too far in taking sentencing \ndiscretion away from judges.\n  Would it not make far more sense if we set this amendment aside, and \nat the Judiciary Committee, which certainly has jurisdiction over this \nissue, have real hearings and have people discuss whether it is a good \nidea or bad idea? Bring in drug enforcement people, bring in local \nauthorities, bring in everybody else involved, and have a real hearing. \nIf we simply do it because it sounds good at the moment, I think we \nmake a mistake.\n  That is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating \nnew mandatory minimum penalties, including as recently as in August, \nwhen the methamphetamine bill that has contributed many of this bill's \nprovisions was considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The meth bill, which was reported by the Judiciary Committee, is \ncontained in this amendment to the bankruptcy bill. It contains a \nprovision directing the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines \nto make penalties for amphetamine offenses comparable to the offense \nlevels for methamphetamine.\n  Congress recently increased mandatory minimum sentences for \nmethamphetamine. Stiff mandatory minimum penalties were slipped into \nlast year's omnibus appropriations bill. As a result, now \nmethamphetamine penalties are the same as crack penalties. This \namendment in the bankruptcy bill would now order the Sentencing \nCommission to increase penalties for amphetamine crimes by a number of \nbase offense levels so the same penalties apply to both meth and \namphetamine offenses.\n  So what do we get for a result? Even without the question of \nmandatory minimums, you are going to have dramatic increases in the \npenalties for amphetamine offenses.\n  We ought to first pass a resolution saying, we are all against \nillegal drug use. We live in neighborhoods. We are parents or \ngrandparents. We walk the streets of America. We have seen the dangers \nof illegal drug use--all Senators, Republican and Democrat. We are all \nagainst it. That should be a given. But do we need to stand up here, \nthe 100 of us who are suppose to represent a quarter of a billion \nAmericans, and prove over and over and over again that we are against \nillegal drug usage by imposing harsher and harsher penalties, without \nany regard to whether spending more taxpayer money on more prisons and \nmore prison guards is really the most cost-effective way to address \nthis problem?\n\n  In many parts of this country we spend far more money building new \nprisons than we do building new schools. We spend far more money \nincreasing the number of prison guards and on their pensions and their \npay, and everything else that goes for them, than we do in hiring new \nscience teachers or math teachers or language teachers. We ought to ask \nourselves: Does this picture make that much sense?\n  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, \nthat we have put a misplaced emphasis on long mandatory minimum \npenalties as the primary tool we use to fight illegal drug trafficking. \nWhen I was a prosecutor, I must admit, there were many times I asked \nfor a stiff penalty, when the case called for it. But I also knew \nenough to know that stiffer penalties by themselves are not the whole \nanswer. There are a whole lot of other things involved. For one thing, \na lot of people committing a crime do not get too concerned about the \npenalty if they think they are not going to get caught.\n  So the example I have used before is, you have two warehouses side by \nside. One has all kinds of alarm systems and security personnel. The \nother has a rusted old padlock, no lights, and nobody around it. They \nboth are filled with, say, television sets. The penalties for breaking \nin and stealing those TV sets are the same, whether you break into the \nwarehouse that has its security system, the lights, and the guards, or \nif you break into the one with the rusty old padlock with no guards and \nno lights. It does not take a criminologist to know which one is going \nto get broken into. Why would somebody break into one where they might \nget caught when they can go into the one where they assume they will \nnot get caught? The penalties are the same, so the penalty is not the \ndeterrent.\n  We have to make drug dealers feel vulnerable and make drug dealing a \nrisky business. We do this by making\n\n[[Page S14462]]\n\nsure they are caught and prosecuted, not simply piling on lengthier \nprison terms with increased mandatory minimum penalties for the few on \nthe fringes who do get caught.\n  These mandatory minimums also carry with them significant economic \nand social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nannual cost of housing a Federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year \nfor minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high-\nsecurity facilities.\n  Mr. President, you and I and every taxpayer is paying for that. It is \ncritical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we \nshould not ignore the costs of this one-size-fits-all approach to \nmandatory minimums.\n  We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our \nprison population. Let me just tell you about this. In 1970--5 years \nbefore I came to the Senate--the total population in the Federal prison \nsystem was 20,868 prisoners, of whom 16.3 percent were drug offenders.\n  By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 \nsentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced \nfor drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal \ncriminal justice system is staggering. The portion of federal drug \ncontrol spending attributable to the criminal justice system grew from \n$415 million in 1981 to over $8.5 billion in 1999. Imprudently lowering \nthe cocaine sentencing threshold without considering the fiscal \nconsequences would further encumber our already overworked system. We \nignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on \nmandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not \njustifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine \nconsumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.''\n  Reducing the disparity between sentences for powder and crack cocaine \nin the manner proposed in this amendment is simply wrongheaded. \nSentencing parity at any cost is not the smartest way to wage our war \non drugs. Drastically increasing the mandatory minimum penalties for \npowder cocaine in this hasty, end-of-session amendment will be costly \nto taxpayers far into the future, as we will have to build numerous new \nprisons to house non-violent drug offenders who are subject to lengthy \nfederal prison terms under this amendment. Indeed, when a bill seeking \nto make identical changes to our powder cocaine laws was introduced in \nthe last Congress, I wrote to the Attorney General requesting a prison \nimpact assessment. I received a letter from the Justice Department on \nJune 1, 1998, estimating that the total cost of this legislation over \n30 years would be over $10.6 billion, including construction of nine \nnew medium security federal prisons to house 11,000 more prison beds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This is in response to the letter you \n     and two colleagues wrote to the Attorney General requesting a \n     prison impact assessment for S. 2033, which would alter \n     federal sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine \n     offenders. I hope the following information is helpful to \n     you.\n       S. 2033 would mandate a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence \n     for 50 grams of powder cocaine, instead of the current 500-\n     gram threshold. In addition, the proposal would impose a 10-\n     year mandatory minimum sentence for 500 grams of powder \n     cocaine, instead of the current 5 kilogram threshold. The 5- \n     and 10-year mandatory minimum thresholds for crack cocaine \n     would remain at 5 and 50 grams, respectively.\n       Table 1 estimates the impact of the proposed change on \n     prison costs and population for the 30 years following \n     enactment. Using its 1996 data set, the U.S. Sentencing \n     Commission produced estimates of the number of individuals \n     who would be incarcerated under this scenario. These \n     estimates, which were based on a review of all defendants \n     sentenced for drug trafficking and related offenses (U.S.S.C. \n     2D1.1) involving a single drug type, were then used by the \n     Bureau of Prisons to project prison costs. While our \n     estimates assume a constant rate of prosecutions for the next \n     30 years, it is important to understand that changes in \n     sentencing during that time period could alter prosecution \n     practices, thus affecting the cost and population estimates \n     we provide here. Additional cost analysis assumptions are \n     contained in Enclosure A.\n       We estimate that, in the fifth year after enactment, S. \n     2033 would require us to provide over 5,500 additional prison \n     beds than currently projected in order to handle those \n     inmates who would be spending more time in prison. The \n     cumulative additional cost over five years would be almost \n     $794 million, including construction of seven new medium \n     security federal prisons. In the thirtieth year after \n     enactment, we would need approximately 11,000 additional \n     beds. The total cumulative cost over thirty years would be \n     over $10.6 billion, including construction of a total of nine \n     new medium security federal prisons.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you have \n     additional questions concerning this or any other issue. We \n     have sent similar letters to Senators Biden and Kennedy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 L.

BOP's projected \n     construction and operating costs presented in this prison \n     impact assessment are consistent with costs required by \n     medium security facilities, which are designed for a capacity \n     of 1,152 prisoners.\n       If the estimated impact of enacted legislation will result \n     in fewer than 1,152 additional prisoners, the prisoners will \n     be added to existing facilities and be charged at marginal \n     costs. If the estimated impact of enacted legislation will \n     meet or exceed 1,152 additional prisoners, construction of a \n     new facility will be necessary. While construction is \n     underway, space will be found in existing facilities. Once \n     the prisoners are transferred to the newly built facility, \n     those prisoners are charged at full per capita cost to meet \n     the full expense of operating an additional facility.\n       The increase in costs over time due to inflation is assumed \n     to be approximately 3.1% per year.\n\n                                             TABLE 1.--5/50 RATIO FOR FIVE YEAR MANDATORY MINIMUM THRESHOLD*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                 Cumulative operating\n             Year and number of inmates                Annual operating cost             cost              Construction cost      Total cumulative cost\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1: 358..............................................               $3,122,476               $3,122,476             $327,168,000             $330,290,476\n2: 1,321............................................               11,878,432               15,000,908               84,327,552              426,496,460\n3: 2,777............................................               25,745,567               40,746,475               86,941,440              539,183,467\n4: 3,756............................................               35,899,848               76,646,323                        0              575,083,315\n5: 5,529............................................              126,303,054              202,949,377               92,415,744              793,802,113\n10: 9,163...........................................              251,592,061            1,235,564,127         Yr 7: 98,234,496            1,924,651,359\n20: 10,868..........................................              426,305,688            4,721,379,782       Yr 13: 117,980,928            5,528,447,942\n30: 11,066..........................................              580,578,254            9,793,498,397                        0          10,600,566,557\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Whenever a 5 year mandatory minimum threshold ratio is discussed, we are presuming that there is also a 10 year mandatory minimum threshold at a drug\n  weight equal to 10 times the amount of the 5 year mandatory minimum threshold weight.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are going to see the effects of this amendment much \nearlier than 30 years from now. Most of us won't be here 30 years from \nnow to answer for it; some may be. We have to look at this and ask, do \nthese costs justify what we wanted to do?\n  We also will be focusing a lot more Federal resources on lower-level \ndrug dealers. We will have to hire a whole lot of new drug enforcement \nofficers right off the bat, but we are going to be refocusing them on \nlower-level drug dealers. I do not believe this is the most cost-\neffective allocation of Federal resources.\n  In addition to being costly, another consequence of lowering the \npowder cocaine threshold is that more federal resources will be focused \non lower-level drug dealers. We must ask whether this is the most cost-\neffective allocation of federal resources. In adopting the federal \nsentencing scheme, Congress intended state and local drug enforcement \npersonnel to investigate and prosecute small-time offenders, while\n\n[[Page S14463]]\n\nthe federal government was to use its more sophisticated law \nenforcement weapons to investigate and prosecute higher-level drug \ntraffickers. Recently, Congress has made great strides toward balancing \nthe federal budget and has opted to devolve many federal programs to \nstates in the belief that certain programs can be more efficiently \nadministered by state and local governments. Likewise, Congress should \nbe wary of assuming the costs associated with federal intrusion into \nthe traditional domain of the states in prosecuting criminal offenses. \nIll-considered expansion of the federal criminal justice system has \nrecently come under fire from Chief Justice Rehnquist, who criticized \nthe Congress for federalizing the criminal justice system during a \nperiod in which the Senate has failed even to keep the federal bench \nadequately filled.\n  A 50-gram powder cocaine offense is a serious criminal charge. No one \nis debating whether a 50-gram powder cocaine dealer should be subject \nto the possibility of incarceration. What is debatable, however, is \nwhether a 50-gram powder cocaine offender is the type of high-level \ndealer that should be dealt with harshly by federal rather than state \nauthorities. It is inevitable that the possibility of harsh federal \nsentences will encourage more federal prosecutions. The question is \nwhether a 50-gram powder cocaine dealer is the type of sophisticated \ndrug trafficker that requires the expense of federal technical \nexpertise. If not, then we should be looking very seriously at more \ncost-effective ways of distributing law enforcement, prosecution, and \nincarceration obligations between the federal and state governments in \norder to maximize the efficiency of our nation's drug control strategy. \nBy restructuring the federal sentencing scheme, we can ensure that \nstate and local governments can assume greater responsibility for the \ninvestigation and prosecution of low-level dealers, whose offenses are \nof particular local concern. Federal resources can then be freed to \npursue traffickers higher in the distribution chain.\n  Other aspects of this amendment also turn principles of federalism on \ntheir head. For example, the amendment contains a federal mandate for \nthe disciplinary policies of local schools. It would require local \nschools to adopt certain specific policies on illegal drug use by \nstudents, including mandatory reporting of students to law enforcement \nand mandatory expulsion for at least one year of students who possess \nillegal drugs on school property. This turns on its head our \ntraditional idea that state and local governments should have the \nprimary responsibility for education, even though that idea is one that \nis constantly put forward by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, and indeed is currently being used by them to justify their \nopposition to the President's plan to provide funding for schools to \nhire additional teachers and reduce class size.\n\n  I am particularly concerned about this one-size-fits-all mandate on \nthe expulsion of students. Expulsion is an option that schools need to \nhave so they can deal with particularly intractable behavior problems \namong their students. But only local teachers and principals can know \nwhich students who violate policies or laws should be expelled, and \nwhich deserve a different punishment.\n  I can just see the school principal in Tunbridge, VT getting a \ndirective from the Federal Government, based on something we passed in \na bankruptcy bill, telling them how they are going to run disciplinary \nprocedures in Tunbridge. We may find ourselves back to the days when \nVermont decided they wanted to be a republic.\n  I am not willing to tell thousands of school principals and \nadministrators around the country, the U.S. Congress will tell you when \nto expel your students. If I did that, I would almost expect a recall \npetition and expulsion petition from the people of my State.\n  Finally, I object to the provision in this amendment that authorizes \nthe use of public funds to pay tuition for any private schools, \nincluding parochial schools, for students who were injured by violent \ncriminal offenses on public school grounds. Such a provision obviously \nraises serious Establishment Clause questions that deserve a fuller \nairing than is possible in an end-of-session amendment. It also gives \nrise to the numerous policy questions surrounding the issue of school \nvouchers, which could cause significant damage to our public school \nsystem. As a practical matter, this provision also raises the very real \npossibility of fraud and collusion to manufacture injuries in order to \nattend a private school at the taxpayers' expense.\n  I do believe that there are good things contained in the parts of \nthis amendment that deal with our methamphetamine and amphetamine \nproblems, most of which are borrowed from a bill that was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee in August. That bill managed to help local law \nenforcement in its daily battle against drugs, provide funding for the \nhiring of new DEA agents, and increase research and prevention funding, \nall without imposing mandatory minimums. I supported each of those \nprovisions. But the good things included within this amendment are \noutweighed by the amendment's return to the failed drug policies of the \nrecent past and its unwise and likely unconstitutional educational \npolicies. Therefore, I will vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I know others wish to speak. I know the distinguished \nSenator from New York was waiting to speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Is the Senator asking unanimous consent that he speak \nnext? Otherwise, the Senator from Michigan is due.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 minutes 59 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. When next this side is recognized, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Schumer of New York be recognized. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan is ready to be recognized on the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nLautenberg, be recognized after the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, Senator Ashcroft, and \nmyself.\n  I wish to be somewhat responsive to a few of the statements made in \nsome of the speeches in opposition to this amendment, as they pertain \nspecifically to the issue of changing the mandatory minimum sentences \non dealing with powder cocaine. I think it is important that we reflect \non how we got to where we are today. There has been for some time, as \nreflected in actions of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, concern about \nthe disparity between the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine \ntriggers of 5-year mandatory minimums for the dealing of 5 grams, of 10 \nyears for dealings of 10 grams, and the mandatory minimums for powder \ncocaine, which are 100 times greater with the 5-year mandatory minimum \ntrigger at 500 grams and the 10-year trigger at 1,000.\n  The Sentencing Commission has tried on a couple occasions to address \nthis issue. The first time they tried this we were forced to take \naction as a Congress to stop their proposal from going into effect. I \nremind my colleagues that we overwhelmingly voted, I believe \nunanimously voted, to say no to the proposal of addressing this \ndisparity by simply changing the powder cocaine thresholds to the same \nas crack cocaine. We thought it was a big mistake to make the cost of \ndoing business go down.\n  The President signed that legislation into law, making the very same \nstatement, that the message we would be sending to young people, to \ndrug dealers, to everybody, was the wrong message if we made crack \ncocaine sentences more lenient.\n  The Sentencing Commission came back with a second proposal--that was \na proposal actually in response to a study we requested--that we would \nsimultaneously make the crack cocaine mandatory minimum sentences more \nlenient while making powder tougher. The Sentencing Commission decided \nthat a ratio of a 10-to-1 difference in the thresholds versus a 100-to-\n1 difference was the appropriate ratio.\n  A number of us found this second suggestion also unacceptable \nbecause,\n\n[[Page S14464]]\n\nonce again, it would require making the sentences for crack cocaine \ndealers more lenient. I speak for myself, but I think others who \ncosponsored this legislation share the view that we should not be \nmaking drug sentences more lenient, particularly for crack cocaine \ndealers.\n  I want to talk about why we should not do that because the only way \nto change the disparity between powder cocaine mandatory minimums and \ncrack cocaine mandatory minimums is either make the mandatory minimums \nfor crack cocaine more lenient and the mandatory minimums for powder \ncocaine tougher or do a little of each.\n  I think anything that changes the crack cocaine mandatory minimum \nthreshold is a mistake, for several reasons. First, the current \nmandatory minimum with respect to crack cocaine, the 5-gram threshold, \nto trigger a 5-year mandatory, has been a very effective device in \nterms of getting the lower end drug dealers to begin giving up to \nprosecutors up the drug chain so we can begin prosecuting people higher \non the drug chain. If we make those mandatory minimums more lenient, if \nin fact the sentences being confronted by people at the bottom end of \nthe drug chain aren't very severe, they are not going to cooperate. \nThey are not going to provide the evidence or finger the higher-ups in \nthe drug chain itself.\n  A second argument not to change the crack cocaine thresholds is that \nwe have differences in a lot of States already between what the State \nmandatory minimums punishments are and the Federal mandatory minimum \npunishments are.\n  In Michigan, we have a pretty tough set of State laws, similar to the \nFederal laws. They are sufficiently similar so that if somebody is \nbeing pursued for crack cocaine dealing, they don't really gain \nanything by playing off the State versus the Federal law enforcement \nofficials. But if we begin to make crack cocaine thresholds for \nmandatory minimum sentences more lenient, in Michigan, what is going to \nhappen--and I predict in a lot of other States--is that the crack \ncocaine dealer is going to begin to make a deal with the Federal \nprosecutors, as opposed to the State prosecutors, to get the lighter \nsentence. I can't imagine that is what we want to do here in the \nCongress of the United States.\n  The third issue I think is important is to understand exactly how \ncrack cocaine is sold. I have talked to people who are in our drug task \nforces in Michigan. They have pointed out that you really can't \nincrease the thresholds very much beyond 5 grams because people don't \nwalk around with larger quantities of crack cocaine in their possession \nwhen they are dealing. They hide their stuff, and they deal in \nquantities smaller than 5 grams or slightly greater than 5 grams. If \nyou change that as significantly as has been proposed by the Sentencing \nCommission, if you make the thresholds more lenient, you are not going \nto find anybody carrying around or being apprehended with sufficient \nlevels of crack cocaine to be pursued under the mandatory minimum \nstructure.\n\n  Fourth, if we make the sentences for crack cocaine more lenient, we \nare going to be sending a terrible message as well as providing \nincentive for people to pursue crack dealing in greater amounts. Do we \nreally want to send the message to young people that we are getting \nless tough on crack cocaine dealers? Do we want to send the message to \ncrack dealers that the cost of doing business just got cheaper? Do we \nwant to tell the families that we want to, in fact, make it harder to \npursue, prosecute, and ultimately confine and incarcerate crack cocaine \ndealers who are in their neighborhoods, their schoolyards and \nplaygrounds, selling dope to their kids? Is that the message we want to \nsend? I hope not.\n  Finally, of course, as we know, crack is both cheaper and more \naddictive than cocaine in powder form. That is the reason there is a \ndisparity to begin with, much the same as between heroin and opium.\n  For all these reasons, it does not make a lot of sense to make the \nmandatory minimum threshold for 5-year or 10-year sentences for dealing \nin crack cocaine more lenient. If you rule out the notion of making \ncrack cocaine sentences more lenient, then the only other way to \naddress the disparity between powder and crack cocaine is to make the \npowder cocaine sentences tougher.\n  So if people are on the other side of this issue and want to \nsimultaneously make the disparity between crack and powder closer, \nlower that disparity, and oppose this amendment, then the only thing \nthey can be saying is they want to make sentences for crack cocaine \ndealers more lenient. I can't believe many Members of this body want to \ndo that. That is the only option we have. That is why we have pursued \nan option that will reduce the disparity by making sentences for powder \ncocaine dealers tougher.\n  What we have done in setting the standard we have chosen in this \namendment is to use the ratio that was agreed upon by the Sentencing \nCommission in their proposal, and by the administration, of a 10-to-1 \nratio between the triggers of mandatory minimum sentences for crack \ndealers and for powder dealers. But we have reduced the disparity from \n100-to-1 to 10-to-1 by making tougher sentences for powder cocaine \ndealers--the change in our proposal.\n  I want to address two or three other points that were made in some of \nthe earlier speeches. First, we have heard talk about the cost of \nincarceration. I addressed this earlier in my first speech because I \nget frustrated when I hear people talking about how much it costs to \nkeep crack dealers and drug dealers out of the playgrounds and \nneighborhoods of our communities. The impression is that the only cost \non which we should focus is exclusively the cost of incarceration. But \nwhat is the cost to us as a society and of having larger numbers of \nchildren becoming addicted to crack cocaine, having these people not in \nprison but in our neighborhoods? What about those costs? Can we \npossibly equate the cost of someone who dies as a result of their drug \naddiction or kills somebody in pursuit of the resources to be able to \nmeet their drug addiction? What are the costs of that?\n  So I think it is a little bit unfair to only add up the costs on one \nside of this equation. I think we should also be talking about the \ncosts to our communities of allowing larger numbers of drug dealers to \navoid sentencing and to stay in business.\n  The other point I make, as I did earlier today, is that we have seen \na dramatic reduction in the last few years in both the number of \nmurders and robberies and other numbers of violent crimes across the \nboard in our country, in city after city. Those with expertise on this \nissue have consistently cited that the reason for these declines in the \nmurder rates, the rates of armed robbery, and so on, is the \neffectiveness with which we are finally beginning to address the crack \ncocaine epidemic in America.\n  So, Mr. President, the notion that we would do anything that would \nreverse our course with regard to cracking down on the dealers of crack \nseems to me to be a mistake.\n  Finally, I say our goal should be to lower the disparity so that more \npeople up the drug chain are subject to mandatory minimum sentences. \nThat is a good reason, in my judgment, by itself, to make tougher the \nthreshold for mandatory minimum thresholds for the sale of powder \ncocaine.\n  In addition, by doing that, we will reduce this disparity that \nexists. I believe if we accomplish both objectives, we will make a \ngreater impact on our fight against drugs in this country. But our \ncolleagues should make no mistake about the fact that if we don't take \nthis approach and want to reduce this disparity, their only option is \nto make the sentences for crack dealers lighter and more lenient. I \ndon't believe the Members of this Chamber want to go on record as \nsaying they want to move in that direction. So we have offered an \namendment that constructively addresses the disparity without making \ncrack sentences more lenient.\n  I think the other components of this amendment are also good--those \nthat deal with methamphetamines, the increased amount of support for \ndrug treatment programs, and the variety of other components of this \namendment.\n  I say, finally, with respect to the question of why it should be in \nthe bankruptcy bill, there are a lot of issues that were agreed upon \nwhen we moved to the bankruptcy legislation that were going to be \nincluded in the debate here, the so-called nongermane\n\n[[Page S14465]]\n\namendments, ranging from amendments dealing with East Timor, to \nagriculture, and so on, and this amendment as well. Perhaps this isn't \nthe ideal spot for this debate. I only say that was the agreement that \nwas reached by 100 Senators, that we would have amendments that were \nnot specifically germane to bankruptcy as part of the final bill we \nwill deal with on the floor this year.\n\n  I hope those who argue somehow that we shouldn't be dealing with this \nissue will be equally vocal in complaining about the insertion of other \nless germane issues in the bankruptcy debate because clearly we are \ngoing to hear it argued from both sides that some of the issues are \ninappropriate in this context. The fact is, I think the American people \nwant us to take a tough stand on drugs and want us to take a tough \nstand in favor of tough drug sentences. Our amendment accomplishes \nthat. I sincerely hope our colleagues will join us in supporting its \npassage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how is the time apportioned?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 45 minutes, \nand the other side has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I will try to save some time for \nmy friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I raise my voice in opposition to this amendment \nbecause I think it is a wrong-headed distraction from the real issue \nthat parents all over this country care about--the epidemic of gun \nviolence in our society at large and especially in our schools.\n  This amendment would allow Federal education funding to be shifted \nfrom special education, computer technology, bilingual education, and \nother key programs to provide vouchers to students who are victims of \nschool violence.\n  In a way, I have to tell you that I think this amendment has a cruel \ntwist to it because we all want to be of help wherever we can be to \nthose who are victimized by violence. But look at the way the program \nis designed.\n  Vouchers to schools? It doesn't, in my view, really make a lot of \nsense when in fact, if we could keep guns away from our schools, we \nwould not have to be thinking about vouchers but, rather, about how we \neducate our children. We could bring the teachers into the schoolrooms, \nas the President would like to have us do--100,000 teachers. Perhaps \nthe workloads of many would be able to be confined to a serious review \nof the educational requirements.\n  This amendment is disturbing on many levels--so many that I am not \nsure where we begin.\n  Is this the answer to school violence--ignore the causes, do nothing \nto remedy the issue, but ship certain kids out of public schools?\n  Does the Republican majority really believe schools should cut \nspecial education and computer funding in public schools to fund \nvoucher programs?\n  We are approaching the 21st century. Everyone knows that whatever the \n20th century brought by way of technology, computers, et cetera, is \nlikely to be dwarfed in the earliest years of the 21st century. It all \nstarts with a computer base. Why we would want to take funds away from \nthose programs is really hard to understand. It is not what America's \nparents want. They want answers. We had one of the answers on the floor \nof this Senate. It passed this body. They want to see a juvenile \njustice bill passed, but the majority has buried this legislation in \nconference and declared it dead for the year. It is hardly a way to \nrespond to the anguished calls we hear all over this country.\n  It includes, yes, stricter punishments for those who would violate \nthe rules of behavior in our society. But it also closed a gun show \nloophole that took the anonymous buyer out of the equation. It reduced \nthe possibility that anyone who is on the 10 Most Wanted List of the \nFBI could walk into a gun show and buy a gun. As outrageous as that \nsounds, that is the truth.\n  I don't know when the Congress is going to catch up with the American \npeople. The American people are so far ahead of Congress that it is \nembarrassing. Poll after poll after poll pleads with the Senate and \npleads with the House to take away the availability of guns. At least, \nif you are not going to take it away, make sure that those who buy guns \nare qualified; that they know what to do; that they are mature; that \nthey are not likely to use them for a violent ending.\n  The public is demanding an end to the gun violence. It has reached \nepidemic proportions. The events of last week prove no one is safe from \nmaniacs who amass arsenals of deadly weapons and use them to gun down \nwhole groups of people--people from Hawaii to Seattle, from Colorado to \nTexas to Kentucky.\n  Just think about it. Schoolchildren, high school children at \nColumbine--everyone remembers that and will never forget the picture of \nthat child hanging out the window pleading for help before he fell to \nthe ground. Then the next one is office workers running away from a \ngunman in Atlanta, GA; the next, a picture of youngsters gathering \ntogether to pray while being assaulted by a gunman and running for \ntheir lives.\n  We have to do something to stop this insanity. We have to do \nsomething about a system that makes it easier for someone to buy a gun \nthan to get a driver's license.\n  We are about at the end of this legislative session. One thing is \nclear--we have given in to the extremists, to the gun lobby, the NRA \nthat opposed even the most commonsense proposal to stop gun violence. \nIf I were their adviser, or counselor, I would say: Listen, guys and \nwomen. Let's give in on this one. It doesn't hurt us a darned bit, and \nit makes us look as if we are in touch with the American people. But \nno; the extremists went out, and they have their hand in this place. \nThey have their hand in the House, and they turned our programs away \nfrom public opinion and public demand.\n  Most Americans assumed that the horrific shootings in Columbine would \nbe enough--the ultimate outrage. Most Americans thought that the vision \nof 2 high school students systematically killing 12 classmates and a \nteacher and wounding 23 others would finally spur Congress to action, \nwould finally say ``that is enough,'' ``that is enough.''\n\n  After that terrible incident, 89 percent in one poll and 91 percent \nin another poll asked for the elimination of the gun show loophole. But \nit was ignored here. The public ought to look at why it was ignored.\n  The reason I think it was ignored is that campaign contributions \noverwhelmed the good judgment and the demand of the American people--\ncampaign contributions. Get elected; that is what counts. There is more \nto it than that.\n  It was 7 months ago when that happened. Congress hasn't acted even \nwhile the body count rises. Just last week, nine more people were shot \nand killed in rampages by two gunmen. One of these gunmen owned 17 \nhandguns.\n  In May of this year, the Senate--with Vice President Gore's help--\npassed my gun show loophole amendment as part of the juvenile justice \nbill. The gun show loophole amendment said that where gun shows, where \nso many guns are bought, traded, and sold, had a place for nonlicensed \ngun dealers, non-Federally-licensed gun dealers, anyone--it didn't \nmatter who you were--could walk up to one of those gun dealers and say, \n``Give me 20 guns, and here is the money.'' There would be no questions \nasked: What is your name? Where do you live? What do you do for a \nliving? Have you been in jail? Have you been a drug addict? Have you \nbeen an alcoholic? Have you been known to have bursts of temper, \noutrage, beaten your wife, your children? Not one question. It is \noutrageous--not one question. We tried to close that loophole. It was a \ncommonsense measure that would have stopped lawbreakers, underage \nchildren, and the mentally unstable from walking into a gun show and \nwalking out with a small arsenal.\n  We passed it 51 to 50. But as soon as the Senate passed my amendment, \nthe NRA sounded its alarm and its allies went to work to defeat the \nproposal in the House.\n  The gun lobby spent millions on radio and TV ads, but, of course, \nthose ads didn't mention the gun massacres that followed Columbine. \nThey didn't mention that. In the first week of July, a violent racist \nwent on a shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana killing two people \nand injuring nine. Or that a few weeks later, a deranged day trader in \nAtlanta shot 9 people to death in an\n\n[[Page S14466]]\n\noffice and wounded 13. Or that in August, a man with a .44-caliber \nGlock gun killed three coworkers in Alabama.\n  No State is safe. There is no group of people that is safe--no ethnic \ngroup, religious group, or otherwise.\n  Five days after that, a white supremacist killed a Filipino postal \nworker and shot four young people at a Jewish day-care center. Who will \nforget that scene--these little kids, like my grandchildren, being led \nby policemen out of the schoolhouse, where they went to learn and have \nfun, running away from a killer? Last month, a well-armed maniac walked \ninto the Baptist Church in Ft. Worth, TX, and killed seven young people \nwho were at a prayer gathering.\n\n  Day by day, the death toll mounts. Our family, children, friends, and \nneighbors are being gunned down in our schools, in our houses of \nworship, where we work and live.\n  More than 34,000 people are killed by guns every year, more than lost \nduring the Korean war. Additionally, we wind up treating 134,000 \ngunshot wounds, and the cost to the country is over $2 billion; \ntaxpayers pay almost half of that.\n  While the NRA may be on the Republican side, law enforcement is on \nour side. I worked with law enforcement drafting my gun show amendment, \nand I received numerous letters from law enforcement organizations \nsupporting that amendment and other gun safety measures the Senate \npassed.\n  I ask unanimous consent copies of those letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         International Brotherhood\n\n\n                                           of Police Officers,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: The International Brotherhood of \n     Police Officers (IBPO) is an affiliate of the Service \n     Employees International Union, AFL-CIO. The IBPO is the \n     largest police union in the AFL-CIO.\n       On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO I wish to \n     express our strong support of the gun-related provisions \n     adopted by the Senate as part of S. 254. The IBPO knows that \n     passage of these measures will keep guns away from children \n     and criminals.\n       The IBPO requests that the conferees continue to focus on \n     the need for adequate time to conduct background checks at \n     ``gun shows.'' As I am sure that you are aware, the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation has estimated that over 17,000 \n     disqualified individuals would have been able to purchase a \n     gun if a twenty-four hour time limit was required for a \n     background check. Accordingly, if such time requirement is \n     legislated 17,000 more felons will be able to purchase guns.\n       The IBPO is also in support of extending the requirements \n     of the Brady Act to cover juvenile acts of crime. Our union \n     has supported legislation which seeks to comprehensively \n     control crime. The Brady Act is a major part of such efforts.\n       Thank you for your consideration of these issues that are \n     significant to all law enforcement officers and the citizens \n     of the United States of America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth T. Lyons,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                               Alexandria, VA, September 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: On behalf of the more than 18,000 \n     members of the International Association of Chiefs of Police \n     (IACP), I am writing to express our strong support for \n     several vitally important firearms provisions that were \n     included in S. 254, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender \n     Accountability Act of 1999.\n       As conference work on juvenile justice legislation begins, \n     I would urge you to consider the views of our nation's chiefs \n     of police on these important issues. Specifically, the IACP \n     strongly supports provisions that would require the \n     performance of background checks prior to the sale or \n     transfer of weapons at gun shows, as well as extending the \n     requirements of the Brady Act to cover juvenile acts of \n     crime.\n       The IACP has always viewed the Brady Act as a vital \n     component of any comprehensive crime control effort. Since \n     its enactment, the Brady Act has prevented more than 400,000 \n     felons, fugitives and others prohibited from owning firearms \n     from purchasing firearms. However, the efficacy of the Brady \n     Act is undermined by oversights in the law which allow those \n     individuals prohibited from owning firearms from obtaining \n     weapons, at events such as gun shows, without undergoing a \n     background check. The IACP believes that it is vitally \n     important that Congress act swiftly to close these loopholes \n     and preserve the effectiveness of the Brady Act.\n       However, simply requiring that a background check be \n     performed is meaningless unless law enforcement authorities \n     are provided with a period of time sufficient to complete a \n     thorough background check. Law enforcement executives \n     understand that thorough and complete background checks take \n     time. The IACP believes that to suggest, as some proposals \n     do, that the weapon be transferred to the purchaser if the \n     background checks are not completed within 24 hours of sale \n     sacrifices the safety of our communities for the sake of \n     convenience.\n       Requiring that individuals wait three business days is \n     hardly an onerous burden, especially since allowing for more \n     comprehensive background checks ensures that those \n     individuals who are forbidden from purchasing firearms are \n     prevented from doing so.\n       Finally, the IACP believes that juveniles must be held \n     accountable for their acts of violence. Therefore, the IACP \n     also supports modifying the current Brady Act to permanently \n     prohibit gun ownership by an individual, if that individual, \n     while a juvenile, commits a crime that would have triggered a \n     gun disability if their crime had been committed as an adult.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have \n     any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 703/\n     836-6767.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ronald S. Neubauer,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office,\n\n                                Littleton, CO, September 15, 1999.\n     Chairman Orrin Hatch,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: As you and other conferees meet to \n     craft juvenile justice legislation, I urge you to adopt the \n     gun-related provisions adopted by the Senate as part of S. \n     254, The Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability \n     and Rehabilitation Act of 1999. We at the National Sheriffs' \n     Association (NSA) appreciate your efforts to curb violent \n     juvenile crime.\n       We feel that S. 254 combines the best provisions of each \n     legislative attempt to reform and modernize juvenile crime \n     control. As you know, sheriffs are increasingly burdened with \n     juvenile offenders, and they present significant challenges \n     for sheriffs. The so-called core mandates requiring sight and \n     sound separation, jail removal and status offender mandates \n     are so restrictive, that even reasonable attempts to comply \n     with the mandates fall short. We welcome modest changes to \n     the core mandates to make them flexible without jeopardizing \n     the safety of the juvenile inmate. We agree that kids do not \n     belong in adult jail and therefore we appreciate the \n     commitment to find appropriate alternative for juvenile \n     offenders.\n       Additionally, NSA supports the Juvenile Accountability \n     Block Grant program. S. 254 sets aside $4 billion to \n     implement the provisions of the bill and this grant funding \n     will enable sheriffs to receive assistance to meet the core \n     mandates. NSA is also hopeful that the prevention programs in \n     the bill will keep juveniles out of the justice system. Kids \n     that are engaged in constructive activities are less likely \n     to commit crimes than those whose only other alternative is a \n     gang. We applaud the focus on prevention, and we stand ready \n     to do our part to engage America's youth.\n       In addition, you may be asked to consider the following \n     amendments that I support.\n       Four ways to close loopholes giving kids access to \n     firearms:\n       1. The Child Access Loophole.\n       Adults are prohibited from transferring firearms to \n     juveniles, but are not required to store guns so that kids \n     cannot get access to them. This Child Access Prevention (CAP) \n     proposal would require parents to keep loaded firearms out of \n     the reach of children and would hold gun owners criminally \n     responsible if a child gains access to an unsecured firearm \n     and uses it to injure themselves or someone else.\n       2. The Gun Show Loophole:\n       So-called ``private collectors'' can sell guns without \n     background checks at gun shows and flea markets thereby \n     skirting the Brady Law which requires that federally licensed \n     gun dealers initiate and complete a background check before \n     they sell a firearm. No gun should be sold at a gun show \n     without a background check and appropriate documentation.\n       3. The Internet Loophole Similar to the Gun Show Loophole:\n       Many sales on the internet are preformed without a \n     background check, allowing criminals and other prohibited \n     purchasers to acquire firearms. No one should be able to sell \n     guns over the internet without complying with the Brady \n     background check requirements.\n       4. The Violent Juveniles Purchase Loophole:\n       Under current law, anyone convicted of a felony in an adult \n     court is barred from owning a weapon. However, juveniles \n     convicted of violent crimes in a juvenile court can purchase \n     a gun on their 21st birthday. Juveniles who commit violent \n     felony offenses when they are young should be prohibited from \n     buying guns as adults.\n       The National Sheriffs Association and I welcome passage of \n     this legislation. We look forward to working with you to \n     ensure swift enactment of S. 254.\n           Respectfully,\n     Patrick J. Sullivan, Jr.,\n\n[[Page S14467]]\n\n       Sheriff, Chairman, Congressional Affairs Committee and \n     Member, Executive Committee of the Board of Directors, NSA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                     School Resource Officers,\n\n                            Boynton Beach, FL, September 16, 1999.\n     Chairman Hatch,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Daer Chairman Hatch: The National Association of School \n     Resource Officers (NASRO) is a national organization that \n     represents over 5,000 school based police officers from \n     municipal police agencies, county sheriff departments and \n     school district police forces. On behalf of our entire \n     membership nationwide, I am writing today in strong support \n     of the gun-related provisions adopted by the Senate as part \n     of S. 254. These measures are crucial in reducing child and \n     criminal access to guns.\n       As you and other conferees meet to craft juvenile justice \n     legislation, NASRO urges you to focus on an important issue \n     to law enforcement--the need for at least three business days \n     to conduct background checks at gun shows. This is the same \n     period of time currently allowed when a firearm is purchased \n     from a licensed gun dealer.\n       As law enforcement officials we know from experience that \n     it is critical to have at least three business days to do a \n     thorough background check. Law enforcement officials need \n     time to access records that may not be available on the \n     federal National Instant Check Background System (NICS) such \n     as a person's history of mental illness, domestic violence or \n     recent arrests. What is important to law enforcement is not \n     how fast a background check can be done but how thorough it \n     is conducted. Without a minimum of three business days, this \n     will increase the risk that criminals will be able to \n     purchase guns.\n       NASRO is concerned that 72 or 24 hours is not an adequate \n     amount of time for law enforcement to do an effective \n     background check. The FBI analyzed all NICS background check \n     data in the last six months and estimated that--if the law \n     had required all background checks to be completed in 72 \n     hours--9,000 people found to be disqualified would have been \n     able to obtain a weapon. If the time limit for checks had \n     been set at just 24 hours, 17,000 prohibited purchasers \n     would have gotten guns in just the last half year. The FBI \n     also found that a gun buyer who could not be cleared by \n     the NICS system in under two hours was 20 times more \n     likely to be a prohibited purchaser than other gun buyers.\n       It is impossible to tell precisely how many lives will be \n     saved by applying the same background check system that now \n     applies to gun store sales to gun shows. We know, however, \n     that without such equivalent treatment gun shows will \n     continue to be the purchase points of choice for murderers, \n     armed robbers and other violent criminals like Hank Earl \n     Carr, who was a frequent gun show buyer despite being a \n     multiple convicted felon. Carr's crimes didn't stop until \n     1998, when he shot his stepson and three police officers \n     before turning a gun on himself.\n       On June 23, 1999 a Colorado man shot and killed his three \n     daughters, ages 7, 8 and 10 just hours after purchasing a gun \n     from a licensed dealer. The dealer completed a NICS check, \n     but the check failed to reveal that the man had a domestic \n     abuse restraining order against him. If law enforcement had \n     consulted local and state records using both computerized and \n     non-computerized data bases than the man probably would have \n     never been able to purchase the gun.\n       The other Senate passed provisions NASRO supports include \n     requiring that child safety locks be provided with every \n     handgun sold; banning all violent juveniles from buying guns \n     when they turn 18; banning juvenile possession of assault \n     rifles; enhancing penalties for transferring a firearm to a \n     juvenile; and banning the importation of high capacity \n     ammunition magazines.\n       It is important to adopt the Senate-passed gun-related \n     provisions in order to protect the safety of our families and \n     our communities. The police officer on the street understands \n     that this legislation is needed to help keep guns out of the \n     hands of children and violent criminals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Curtis Lavarello,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n        National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives,\n\n\n                           Alexandria, VA, September 15, 1999.\n\n     Hon.

The police officer on the street understands \n     that this legislation is needed to help keep guns out of the \n     hands of children and violent criminals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jess Quintero,\n     National Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Police Executive Research Forum,\n\n                              Washington, DC, September, 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: The Police Executive Research Forum \n     (PERF) is a national organization of police professionals \n     dedicated to improving policing practices through research, \n     debate and leadership. On behalf of our members, I am writing \n     today in strong support of the gun-related provisions adopted \n     by the Senate as part of S. 254. These measures are crucial \n     in reducing children's and criminals' access to guns.\n       As you and other conferees meet to craft juvenile justice \n     legislation, PERF urges you to focus on an important issue to \n     law enforcement--the need for at least three business days to \n     conduct background checks at gun shows. This is the same \n     period of time currently allowed when a firearm is purchased \n     from a licensed gun dealer.\n       As law enforcement officials, we know from experience that \n     it is critical to have at least three business days to do a \n     thorough background check. While most checks take only a few \n     hours, those that take longer often signal a potential \n     problem regarding the purchaser. Without a minimum of three \n     business days, the risk that criminals will be able to \n     purchase guns increases. The FBI analyzed all NICS background \n     check data in the last six months and estimated that, if the \n     law had required all background checks to be completed in 72 \n     hours, 9,000 people found to be disqualified would have been \n     able to obtain a weapon. If the time limit for checks had \n     been set at just 24 hours, 17,000 prohibited purchasers would \n     have obtained guns in just the last half year. The FBI also \n     found that a gun buyer who could not be cleared by the NICS \n     system in under two hours was 20 times more likely to be a \n     prohibited purchaser than other gun buyers.\n       PERF also strongly supports measures that impose new safety \n     standards on the manufacture and importation of handguns \n     requiring a child-resistant safety lock. PERF helped write \n     the handgun safety guidelines--issued to most police agencies \n     more than a decade ago--on the need to secure handguns kept \n     in the home. Our commitment has not wavered. I also urge you \n     to clarify that the storage containers and safety mechanisms \n     meet minimum standards to ensure that the requirement have \n     teeth.\n       PERF also encourages the enactment of proposals that \n     prohibit the sale of an assault weapon to anyone under age 18 \n     and to increase the criminal penalties for selling a gun to a \n     juvenile. PERF all supports banning all violent juveniles \n     from buying any type of gun when they turn 18, and supports \n     banning the importation of high-capacity ammunition \n     magazines. PERF knows we must do more to keep guns out of the \n     hands of our nation's troubled youth.\n       PERF supports strong, enforceable ``Child Access \n     Prevention'' laws. Once again, we have witnessed the carnage \n     that results when children have access to firearms. PERF has \n     supported child access prevention bills in the past because \n     we have seen first hand the horror that can occur when angry \n     and disturbed kids have access to guns.\n       We must do more to keep America's children safe--not just \n     because of recent events, but because of the shootings, \n     accidents and suicide attempts we see with frightening \n     regularity. It is important to adopt the Senate-passed gun-\n     related provisions in order to protect our families and our \n     communities. The police officer on the street understands \n     that this legislation is needed to help keep guns out of the \n     hands of children and violent criminals. Thank you for \n     considering the views of law enforcement. We applaud your \n     efforts to help make our communities safer places to live.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chuck Wexler,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, some of my colleagues may recall that \nformer President George Bush resigned from the NRA because the \norganization referred to law enforcement people as ``jack-booted \nthugs.'' What a twist to refer to our law enforcement people \ncourageously out there risking their own lives to protect others and \nreferring to them as ``jack-booted thugs.'' I saluted President Bush \nfor that one.\n  We ought to be skeptical when the NRA says it supports law \nenforcement. We ought to be skeptical when they use the second \namendment to promote extremist views. What does the second amendment \nsay?\n\n       A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of \n     a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, \n     shall not be infringed.\n\n  It doesn't say one ought to be able to buy it without a license. It \ndoesn't say if someone is crazy, they ought to be able to buy a gun. It \ndoesn't say if one is 12 years old, they ought to be able to buy a gun. \nIt doesn't say one ought to be able to buy as many guns as they want. \nNo matter how broadly one interprets that, there is nothing that says \none shouldn't have to have a license to buy a gun.\n  The interpretation of the amendment has been broadened and the courts \ndon't hold or support that. That is the kind of gobbledygook that \naccompanies that. It is like saying guns don't kill; people kill. Who \npulls the trigger? Animals. I guess maybe in some ways they are.\n  We never hear the NRA talk about the first 13 words in that \namendment:\n\n       A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State . . .\n\n  They only cite the last 14 words when they argue that the amendment \ncreates an unlimited right for individuals to bear arms.\n  Nonsense. The NRA knows the history of the second amendment doesn't \nsupport the organization's radical views. When the Constitution was \nbeing debated, each State had its own militia. Most adult males were \nrequired to enlist and to supply their own equipment, including their \nown guns. The second amendment was written in response to concerns that \nexcessive Federal power might lead to the Federal Government passing \nlaws to disarm those State militias.\n  The United States has changed a great deal since then. We no longer \nhave State militias where citizens are required to provide their own \narms. Thank goodness we have a National Guard--a State-organized \nmilitary force--that is more limited and depends on government-issued \nweapons. They are there to respond to protecting the public.\n  If my colleagues are interested in reading more about reality and the \nmyths surrounding the second amendment, I urge them to read some recent \nscholarly articles written by independent historians whose research has \nnot been funded by the NRA. These include articles by Saul Cornell, a \nhistory professor at Ohio State University; an editorial by Garry \nWills, a Pulitzer Prize-winning history professor at Northwestern \nUniversity; and an article by historian Mike Bellesiles of Emory \nUniversity.\n  I ask unanimous consent these articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 24, 1999]\n\n                           Real and Imagined\n\n                           (By Saul Cornell)\n\n       Three words are routinely invoked by opponents of gun \n     control: the Second Amendment. So it was during the debate \n     last week in the House.\n       In reality, however, the amendment was never meant to ban \n     virtually all efforts to regulate firearms. Indeed, the \n     Founding Fathers viewed regulation as not only legal but also \n     absolutely necessary, and colonial America enacted all sorts \n     of regulatory legislation governing the storage of arms and \n     gunpowder.\n       The mythology of the Second Amendment, however, has turned \n     history on its head. Herewith, the truth about the Second \n     Amendment and its place in history.\n       Myth: The right to bear arms has always been an individual \n     right.\n       Reality: States retained the right to disarm law-abiding \n     citizens when the good of the community required such action.\n       In Pennsylvania, as much as 40 percent of the adult, white \n     male population was deemed to lack the requisite virtue to \n     own guns.\n       Myth: The armed citizen militia was essential to the cause \n     of American independence.\n       Reality: If Americans had relied on their militia to \n     achieve independence, we would still be part of the British \n     empire. There were never enough guns in the hands of citizens \n     to pose a threat to a well-equipped army. The Continental \n     Army, not the militia, won the American Revolution.\n       Myth: The militia included all able-bodied citizens.\n       Reality: The list of groups excluded from the militia in \n     Massachusetts ran to two paragraphs.\n       Myth: The militia was an agent of revolution.\n       Reality: While the militia became a powerful agent of \n     political organization, it was invariably used by states to \n     repress rebellions by citizens and slaves.\n\n[[Page S14469]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                      [From the Chicago Sun-Times]\n\n                  Shooting Holes in Age-Old Gun Myths\n\n                            (By Garry Wills)\n\n       For a number of years now, historian Michael Bellesiles of \n     Emory University has been amassing a great body of evidence \n     that demolishes the myths of the gun's role in American \n     history. I have wondered by no one in the popular press has \n     picked up on this work published in scholarly journals. Now \n     that a news magazine finally has done that, the magazine, it \n     turns out, is not an American one but the Economist, \n     published in London. Its current issue runs a very full and \n     important summary of Bellesiles' findings.\n       By a sophisticated bit of sleuthing, Bellesiles has put \n     together probate reports on what people owned in the 18th and \n     early 19th centuries, government surveys of gun ownership \n     (something the NRA would go crazy at today), records of the \n     number of guns produced in America and imported from abroad--\n     all to establish this fact, which runs contrary to romantic \n     notions of the frontiersman's reliance on his weapon: Up \n     until 1850, fewer than 10 percent of Americans owned guns, \n     and half of those were not functioning.\n       Guns were expensive in early days; they cost the equivalent \n     of the average man's wages for a year. They were inefficient \n     and hard to maintain. Few were made in America. Repairs were \n     not readily executed (mainly by blacksmiths who worked on \n     farm implements). How did people protect themselves then? Not \n     by guns. Only 15 percent of the violent deaths inflicted in \n     the period 1800 to 1845 were brought about by guns--about the \n     same number as were caused by ax attacks and fewer than those \n     caused by knives. The leading cause of violent death was \n     being beaten or strangled (twice as many died that way as by \n     shooting or stabbing).\n       So much for the NRA argument that if guns are taken away, \n     people would just find other means of killing one another. \n     People certainly will kill, but the rate just as certainly \n     would drop. When is the last time you heard of a drive-by \n     strangling, or the case of a school where a dozen children \n     were mowed down with an ax? that is why the murder rate is so \n     low in the countries that do have gun control.\n       Another myth that Bellesiles demolishes is that of the \n     militias. Most militias did not have guns, or powder, or the \n     training to use what few weapons they had. They were not made \n     up of the whole male citizenry--how could they have been, \n     when no more than 10 percent of the citizens had guns. \n     Militias usually were mustered for immediate emergencies from \n     the unemployed, the drifting or those too poor to buy \n     substitutes for their service. One of the few exceptions to \n     this condition was militias in the South that were kept in \n     fighting condition in order to patrol the slaves. So far from \n     being a great bastion of freedom, the militias were a support \n     of slavery.\n       When Bellesiles' findings are put together with Robert \n     Dykstra's study of the cowboy legend (towns such as Tombstone \n     and Dodge City had gun control laws, so that only 1.5 deaths \n     occurred annually during the cattle drives of their most \n     famous years) and with Osha Gray Davidson's history of the \n     NRA (which did not oppose gun control until the 1960s), there \n     is nothing left standing to vindicate the myth that \n     individually owned guns were a source of American freedom and \n     greatness.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From the Economist, July 3, 1999]\n\n                            Arms and the Man\n\n       America's love affair with the gun is the eternal stuff of \n     fiction. It has not always been the stuff of fact.\n       Richard Henry Lee, one of the signers of America's \n     Declaration of Independence, wrote that ``to preserve \n     liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people \n     always possess arms and be taught alike, especially when \n     young, how to use them.'' This association between guns and \n     liberty seems hard-wired into the American consciousness. It \n     has produced a country with more guns than people. It has \n     made national heroes of the armed frontiersman, the cowboy \n     and Teddy Roosevelt, the president who carried a big stick \n     and a hunting rifle. Above all it has engendered such a \n     powerful cult of the gun that whether you glorify it, fear it \n     or accept it as a necessary evil, hardly anyone questions its \n     basis in fact. Have guns really been an essential part of \n     American life for 400 years?\n       At first glance it seems absurd to doubt it. From the time \n     of the earliest settlement on the James River, the English \n     colonies required every freeman to own a gun for self-\n     defence. More than a century and a half later, the notion of \n     the citizen-soldier was enshrined in the constitution. ``A \n     well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a \n     free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms \n     shall not be infringed,'' holds the second amendment of the \n     Bill of Rights, which establishes additional safeguards for \n     Americans' freedom.\n       Yet in ordinary life people were not armed to the teeth a \n     couple of centuries ago. Wills from revolutionary times \n     present a different picture. Probate records that list the \n     belongings passed on to heirs often give valuable insights \n     into everyday activities and possessions. Michael Bellesiles, \n     a professor at Emory University in Atlanta, has trawled \n     through more than 1,000 probate records dating from between \n     1765 and 1850. Here is a typical finding: ``He takes note of \n     his favourite chocolate pot [says Mr. Bellesiles]. The record \n     notes broken bottles, bent spoons. It notes every scrap of \n     land and every debt and credit he holds. There's not a single \n     gun listed. And this is the commander of the Virginia \n     militia.'' Between 1765 and 1790, fewer than 15% of probate \n     inventories list guns of any kind (see chart 1 on), and more \n     than half of those listed were broken. The larger-than-\n     average proportion in the South was probably due to \n     difficulties in persuading people to be slaves by peaceful \n     means.\n       Official surveys of private-gun ownership show much the \n     same thing. (Amazingly, to modern sensibilities, state and \n     federal governments were able to undertake surveys of this \n     sort without any debate in state legislatures about their \n     right to do so.) The state of Massachusetts counted all \n     privately owned guns on several occasions. Until 1840, at any \n     rate, no more than 11% of the population owned guns--and \n     Massachusetts was one of the two centres of gun production in \n     the country. At the start of the War of 1812, the state had \n     more spears than firearms in its arsenal. What was true at \n     the state level was true nationwide. ``It would appear,'' \n     says Mr. Bellesiles, ``that at no time prior to 1850 did more \n     than a tenth of the people own guns.''\n       So, contrary to popular belief and legend, and contrary \n     even to the declarations of the founding fathers, gun \n     ownership was rare in the first half of America's history as \n     an independent country. It was especially low in parts of the \n     countryside and on the frontier, the very areas where guns \n     are imagined to have been most important. By no stretch of \n     the imagination was America founded on the private ownership \n     of weapons.\n       But what about the civilian militias of the period, in \n     which all adult men were supposed to serve? These included \n     bodies such as the Minutemen of Massachusetts, embattled \n     farmers who agreed to turn out at a minute's notice and \n     managed to take on the British at Lexington and Concord. \n     Surely they at least exemplified the republican ideal of \n     universal military service by the citizenry?\n       Not really. Most militias were a joke. Describing a \n     shooting competition at a militia muster in Pennsylvania, one \n     newspaper wrote cruelly: ``The size of the target is known \n     accurately, having been carefully measured. It was \n     precisely the size and shape of a barn door.'' The \n     soldiery could not hit even this; the winner was the one \n     who missed by the smallest margin. No wonder the militias \n     of Oxford, Massachusetts, voted in 1823 to stop their \n     annual target practice to avoid public humiliation. South \n     Carolina fined people who heckled or disrupted the militia \n     muster--to no avail.\n       Militias, it seems, were neither adept nor well-armed. In \n     1775 Captain Charles Johnson told the New Hampshire \n     Provincial Congress that his company had ``perhaps one pound \n     of powder to 20 men and not one-half our men have arms.'' The \n     adjutant general of Massachusetts complained in 1834 that \n     only ``town paupers, idlers, vagrants, foreigners, \n     itinerants, drunkards and the outcasts of society'' manned \n     his militias. Delaware was one of several states that fined \n     people for non-attendance at musters. In 1816 it gave up the \n     unequal struggle and repealed all the fines; and when the \n     legislature dared to enact a new militia law in 1827, it was \n     turfed out at the next elections and the law repealed. In the \n     1830s, General Winfield Scott discovered the Florida militia \n     to be essentially unarmed--and this was during a war against \n     the Seminole Indians.\n       These and other bits of information confirm the evidence of \n     the probate records: guns were rare. Perhaps the fact should \n     not surprise. Gunpowder and firing mechanisms had to be \n     imported, so a gun cost about a year's income for an ordinary \n     farmer. (For comparison, a basic rifle now costs the \n     equivalent of three days' work at the average wage.) And guns \n     were hard to maintain: muskets were made mostly of iron, \n     which rusted easily and needed constant attention. Many busy \n     farmers had better things to do with their time.\n       Even if farmers had wanted and been able to buy guns, they \n     would usually have found them hard to obtain. Before the \n     civil war, America had only two armouries, at Harper's Ferry, \n     Virginia, and Springfield, Massachusetts (see chart 2). Their \n     joint output was not enough even for basic national defense. \n     In an attempt to equip the militias sufficiently to protect \n     the newly independent country, Congress ordered the purchase \n     of 7,000 muskets in 1793. A year later, it had managed to buy \n     only 400.\n       Strikingly, the citizen-soldiers could not be bothered to \n     arm themselves even when guns were both available and free of \n     charge. In 1808 the government made its biggest attempt to \n     arm and organise the citizenry, offering to buy weapons for \n     every white male in the country. All the militias had to do \n     to get guns was apply for them, reporting how many members \n     they had. By 1839 only half the companies in Massachusetts \n     had taken the trouble to do this.\n       Across the country, popular neglect was killing the \n     militias. In 1839 the secretary of war complained that ``when \n     mustered, a majority of [the militias] are armed with walking \n     canes, fowling pieces of unserviceable muskets.'' Practically \n     every militia commander reported that his members did not \n     look after their guns properly. All complained of non-\n     attendance. All worried about the low esteem in which the \n     militias were generally held. In 1840 most states gave up \n     filing militia returns altogether. Militias as the founding \n     fathers had envisaged them were finished.\n\n[[Page S14470]]\n\n                       Arming America by mistake\n\n       So when did mass ownership of guns begin to develop, if not \n     at the start? It was during the civil war, from 1861 to 1865, \n     and the agent of change was industrialisation. The American \n     civil war was the first conflict in history in which the new \n     techniques of mass production and transport played vital \n     roles. Armies were ferried around by train and issued with \n     the latest weapons from the most modern factories.\n       Naturally, weapons production soared. In the 12 months to \n     July 1864, the state-owned Springfield armory produced over \n     600,000 rifles, nearly as many as in the whole of its 70-year \n     history. The Union government's Ordnance Department spent \n     $179m (about $2.5 billion at today's prices) from 1861 to \n     1866 on buying or making weapons.\n       Much of the money was collected by the dozens of new \n     private factories that opened or grew to meet the increased \n     demand. Chief among them was Samuel Colt's, the first private \n     company to manufacture guns on a large scale. Between 1836, \n     when Colt's factory first opened, and 1861, when the civil \n     war began, production averaged a few thousand weapons a year. \n     By 1865 Colt had become the largest private supplier to the \n     Union army, selling 386,417 revolvers in the course of the \n     conflict. Like other gun makers, Colt started to reap huge \n     economies of scale, as the war went on, and the costs of \n     production dropped sharply. In 1865 the Colt Peacemaker \n     revolver cost $17 to buy--about two months' earnings for a \n     labourer.\n       The civil war expanded not just the production but also the \n     ownership of guns. At its outset the Union government owned \n     300,000 muskets and 27,000 rifles; the Confederacy had \n     another 150,000 guns of various sorts; and there were tens of \n     thousands of guns in private hands. During the war, the \n     Ordnance Department of the Union government bought or made \n     3.5m carbines, rifles, revolvers, pistols and muskets, as \n     well as over 1 billion cartridges and 1 billion percussion \n     caps. In addition, it imported $10m-worth of rifles, muskets \n     and carbines from Europe. In all, the Union issued at least \n     4m small arms to its soldiers in five years--perhaps eight \n     times as much as the total stock of guns at the beginning of \n     the war.\n       The men were not only issued with firearms but also taught \n     how to use them. At its peak, the Union army counted around \n     1.5m enlisted men and the Confederate army another 1m. These \n     were easily the largest military forces ever assembled. Most \n     important, these weapons were left in the hands of the \n     soldiers at the end of the war. Anxious to press ahead with \n     reconstruction, the victorious Union government allowed all \n     soldiers, including those of the Confederacy, to take their \n     guns home. (In theory, soldiers were supposed to buy their \n     guns but no one made any serious effort to collect the money \n     that was due.)\n       The civil war thus transformed America from a country with \n     a few hundred thousand guns into one with millions of them. \n     it was this war, rather than any inherent belief in the right \n     of individuals to carry guns, that first armed America--and \n     then created the first crime wave to go with it. In the \n     decade immediately after the war, murder rates soared, and \n     guns became the murder weapon of choice (see chart 3). This \n     crime wave was one important reason why the ownership and \n     production of guns did not fall away after the ``late \n     unpleasantness between the states'', as some Southerners put \n     it.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Colt was a self-publicist of genius. When his brother, \n     John, unfraternally chose a mere axe with which to commit \n     murder in 1841, Samuel persuaded the court to let him stage a \n     shooting display inside the courtroom to demonstrate the \n     superiority of the new revolver over the axe as a murder \n     weapon. Using these publicity skills, and displaying \n     precocious evidence of lobbying ability (he gave President \n     Andrew Jackson a handgun and pioneered the practice of wining \n     and dining members of Congress), Colt aimed his campaign at \n     the growing middle class. He devised advertising campaigns \n     showing a heroic figure wearing nothing but a revolver \n     defending his wife and children. His guns were given \n     nicknames (Equalizer, Peacemaker and so forth). Since most of \n     his customers did not know how to use a firearm, he printed \n     instructions on the cleaning cloth of every gun. His initial \n     success shows up in the probate records: the percentage of \n     wills listing firearms among their legacies rose by half \n     between 1830 and 1850.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The big industrial cities back East were actually far more \n     violent than even the most notorious cowboy town. Robert \n     Dykstra writes that ``during its most celebrated decade as a \n     tough cattle town, only 15 persons died violently in Dodge \n     City, 1876-85, for an average of just 1.5 killings per cowboy \n     season.'' Towns such as Tombstone (in Arizona) and Dodge City \n     (in Kansas) had very low murder rates, mainly because drovers \n     had their guns confiscated at the town limits. Not so in the \n     East. In 1872 the Missouri Republican, for example, called \n     New York a ``murderer's paradise'' and criticized its \n     ``chronic indifference'' in the face of ``the murdering \n     business [that] is carried on with impunity.''\n       Nonetheless, by the end of the 19th century, two elements \n     of America's present gun culture were in place: widespread \n     individual ownership of guns, and large numbers of factories \n     that were turning out affordable weapons to meet popular \n     demand. More was required, however, to create a true ``gun \n     culture'': in particular, as Mr. Bellesiles points out, \n     ``there needed to be a conviction, supported by the \n     government, that the individual ownership of guns served some \n     larger purpose.'' The notion that the right to own \n     firearms was somehow the quintessential American freedom \n     had yet to come.\n\n\nthe cult of the gun\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       After the second world war, the organization's character \n     altered. It began to represent sportsmen more, organizing \n     training courses for hunters, teaching classes in gun safety \n     and even putting together a rifle team to represent the \n     United States in the Olympic games. Though it did some \n     lobbying, the question of influencing gun laws came low on \n     its list of priorities. The NRA was, in fact, a little like \n     the Boy Scouts.\n       Two developments changed that. The first was the Gun \n     Control Act of 1968, which forbad selling guns by post after \n     President Kennedy was assassinated by a weapon that had been \n     bought in this way. The act was supported by the NRA's \n     leaders but opposed by many of its members.\n       The other event was the appearance of Hanlon Carter at the \n     head of a dissident group within the NRA. A tough Texan who \n     had had a murder conviction overturned on appeal, he \n     transformed the NRA from a sporting club into what is widely \n     seen today as one of the most powerful lobbying organizations \n     in America. In 1997, incensed at plans for training in \n     environmental awareness at the NRA's new national shooting \n     range, Carter organized what was in effect a takeover of the \n     association. When the smoke cleared, his headliners were in \n     charge.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The courts have interpreted the second amendment in a \nstraightforward and commonsense way. In the United States v. Miller, \ndecided in 1939, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment guarantees the \nright to be armed only in service to a well-regulated militia. In other \nwords, no one has an automatic right to own a firearm.\n  The NRA is simply wrong. If they were right, anyone could carry a gun \nany time they wanted to. People could carry machine guns anywhere they \nwanted to--to work, restaurants, on airplanes. That is exactly why \nformer Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative appointed to the \nSupreme Court by President Nixon, and a gun owner himself, called the \nNRA's distortion of the second amendment a fraud on the American \npublic. That is a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I hope my colleagues will put aside the false rhetoric of the \nextremist NRA and listen to other American people, people of every \nreligion, race, color, creed, and profession coming together to try to \nstop gun violence, people joining together because the right to bear \nand raise children safely must come before the right to bear arms. \nPeople are joining together because there is no need for 200 million \nfirearms in a civilized society. The people are joining together to say \nif citizens want a gun, they ought to prove they can use it safely.\n  Vouchers are not the answer; a voucher to go to different schools \nwon't solve the problem. Ignoring the problem is not an answer. Instead \nof wasting our time today on this meaningless amendment, the Senate \nought to be working to pass a gun safety bill to close dangerous \nloopholes. I hope the constituents back home will watch how their \nSenators vote on matters to control gun violence and compare it to what \nkind of vote we get on the school voucher issue.\n  On this issue, we will prevail because there is no force stronger \nthan the people united to protect their children. There aren't enough \ngun lobby dollars to protect politicians who stand in the way. Lord \nhelp us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I associate myself with the eloquent and erudite remarks \nmade by my colleague, the Senator from New Jersey. He is right on \ntarget.\n  This amendment we are about to vote on misses the mark by a mile in \nterms of what we ought to do. The Senator from New Jersey has been the \nleading advocate on the Senate floor for focusing razor-like on the \nreal problem, which is the proliferation of guns, the ready access to \nguns of the youth of this country. He is right on target. I compliment \nthe Senator for his leadership in that area and the statements made \ntoday.\n  Again, the majority has taken a measure which has strong bipartisan \nsupport and added a poison pill--nothing more or less than a blatant \npolitical maneuver. Most of the provisions\n\n[[Page S14471]]\n\nof this amendment provide critical resources to law enforcement and \ncommunities to battle the methamphetamine epidemic. This started as a \nstrong measure, one I wholeheartedly endorsed and have cosponsored. We \nhave in the Midwest, the West, the Southwest, a major problem with this \ndangerous and highly addictive drug. We need additional resources to \nstop the spread of meth in our rural communities and urban centers.\n  I am a cosponsor of the bill authored by Senators Hatch and Ashcroft, \nincluding provisions to help law enforcement investigate and clean up \nhighly toxic meth labs. It includes $15 million for meth prevention and \neducation, $10 million for meth treatment, and authorizes funding for \nneeded research on the treatment of meth. It also includes tougher \npenalties for meth lab operators and traffickers. Many of these \nprovisions, about a third of them, are taken from the bill I introduced \nearlier this year called the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Abuse \nReduction Act.\n  Over the past 3 years, I have worked very hard to increase the \nresources for law enforcement and communities to reduce the supply and \ndemand of these illegal drugs through millions of dollars in grants for \nlaw enforcement, prevention, treatment, and research. So the \nmethamphetamine bill is a good bill. It has strong bipartisan support. \nThe methamphetamine amendment is a good amendment--until last-minute \nadditions were included to undermine the bipartisan support. We now \nhave a couple of poison pills added to it.\n  The first is a school voucher program, private school vouchers that \nwill divert Federal education dollars from public schools to private \nschools. It says for a victim of a crime at a school--a situation that \nno one condones--that Federal education funds could be used to send \nthat student to a private school anywhere in the State. That sounds \ngood, but it doesn't do anything to make schools safer. Plus there is a \nbig loophole in the amendment. If you read the amendment, it says here:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law [et cetera, et \n     cetera] if a student becomes a victim of a violent criminal \n     offense, including drug-related violence, while in or on the \n     grounds of a public elementary school or secondary school \n     that the student attends. . . .\n\n  Then they can use these funds to send the student to a private \nschool, including a religious school, anywhere in the State, wherever \nthe parent wants the student to go.\n  So, obviously, a student could be on the school grounds after school, \nin the evening, on the weekend, as most of these grounds are available \nas playgrounds, basketball courts, things like that, and if the violent \nact occurred then, which has nothing to do with the school whatsoever, \nthese funds could be diverted. There is a big loophole in that \namendment. Aside from that, that is not the way to address violence in \nschools. We should, instead, support violence and crime prevention \nprograms in and around public schools, not divert resources from public \nto private schools. We should invest in initiatives such as the Safe \nand Drug-Free Schools Act and afterschool programs, since we know most \njuvenile crimes occur between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.\n\n  I am on the Appropriations Committee for education. As soon as I \nfinish my statement, I am going downstairs to continue negotiations. \nThe President wanted $600 million for afterschool programs to keep \nthese kids off the streets and put them into afterschool programs. The \nRepublican leadership knocked that down in half, to $300 million. That \nis where we ought to be putting our money, not saying take money out of \npublic schools and put them in vouchers. Let's do what the President \nwanted to do: Put $600 million in afterschool programs so these kids \nwill be safe.\n  We also need more counselors in schools, especially in our elementary \nschools, to prevent problems before they start. Public tax dollars \nshould be spent on public schools which educate 90 percent of our \nNation's children. Taxpayers' money should not go to vouchers when \npublic schools have great needs, including providing a safe \nenvironment.\n  Again, there is another part of this that is a poison pill, and that \nis the mandatory minimum provisions which were put in the amendment. \nThe Department of Justice, all of the U.S. attorneys, including the two \nU.S. attorneys from the State of Iowa, oppose this provision. It does \nnot fix the problem. Our prisons are already full. We are building new \nprisons. In fact, the most rapidly growing part of public housing today \nis our building of prisons. Yet what this amendment would do is crowd \nmore people into those prisons and require us to build more prison \ncells. That is not the answer. Building more prisons, making mandatory \nminimum sentences, getting young people who may be first-time abusers \ninto these prisons, is not the answer. We need more education; we need \nmore prevention; we need more treatment; and we need more counseling \nfor kids in elementary and secondary schools.\n  With these two poison pills, I do not see how anyone could support \nthis. The methamphetamine part was a good part when it started out. \nThen the majority decided to add some poison pills in a political \nmaneuver. I understand the politics of it, but the politics does not \nmean we have to shield our eyes and cast a blind vote.\n  I am hopeful that sometime--probably not this year--next year we will \nbe able to bring up again a targeted methamphetamine bill, one that \ngets to, yes, penalties but also gets to education, prevention, \ntreatment, and research, and put this package together in an \nantimethamphetamine drug bill that we can bring up and pass without all \nthese riders and poison pills.\n  I yield the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We also yield the remainder of the time on this side. I \nassume we can go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back. Has someone \nrequested the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The yeas and nays were ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 360 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2771) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I voted against the Hatch ``drug'' \namendment. I voted against this amendment with some regret because I \nvery much wanted to support one provision in this amendment--Senator \nHatch's Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999.\n\n[[Page S14472]]\n\n  Senator Hatch's Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999 is a \nbipartisan bill that would go a long way toward attacking the \nproliferation of methamphetamine trafficking and abuse that \nparticularly plagues the Midwest. I know my friend Senator Harkin and \nothers have worked tirelessly with Senator Hatch to improve the bill \nand to ensure that prevention and treatment programs targeted at young \npeople tempted by or addicted to methamphetamine are included in any \nsolution to this problem. Because I feel strongly about this issue, I \nco-sponsored Senator Harkin's bill the ``Comprehensive Methamphetamine \nAbuse Reduction Act,'' and many of the provisions of Senator Harkin's \nbill are now included in this amendment.\n  We have a serous problem in South Dakota with the production, \ntrafficking and use of methamphetamine. I have met with many members of \nSouth Dakota's law enforcement community about this problem, and I know \nthat cracking down on meth traffickers and users has become more and \nmore difficult as this highly addictive drug has increased in \npopularity, particularly among our young people. The number of \nmethamphetamine arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs \ncontinues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine \nmethamphetamine labs confiscated and destroyed in 1998 was nearly \ntriple the number confiscated and destroyed in 1997.\n  It has become evident that methamphetamine is fast becoming the \nleading illegal drug in our region, and efforts to combat its spread \nare complicated by the fact that the drug does not discriminate. Its \nusers range from teenage girls who use the drug to decrease their \nappetite in an effort to lose weight, to middle class men looking for a \ncheap high. This highly addictive drug can lead to devastating \nconsequences for its users, and far too often methamphetamine use has \nbeen a major factor in a number of violent crime cases. In recent \nyears, the Drug Enforcement Agency has registered an increase in the \npercentage of arrests due to methamphetamine in South Dakota from \naround 20% of the total arrest rate to 70%, and several high profile \ncrimes, including murders, in South Dakota have been attributed to \nmethamphetamine abuse.\n  Though, we have taken some important steps to combat methamphetamine \nabuse in recent years, such as securing targeted funding to fight \nmethamphetamine production and trafficking in South Dakota, Iowa, \nNebraska, Kansas and Missouri, I believe it is time to do more. \nAccordingly, I would have liked to support the provisions in this \namendment that increase penalties for amphetamine manufacturing and \ntrafficking and provide more money for law enforcement personnel to \naddress the methamphetamine problem in high intensity drug trafficking \nareas. That is why I would have liked to support the provisions that \nprovide needed funds for hiring and training law enforcement officers \nto combat methamphetamine trafficking and manufacture. And that is why \nI would have liked to support the provisions that would fund increased \nmethamphetamine abuse research, grants to states and Indian tribes to \nexpand treatment activities, and grants to schools and local \ncommunities for methamphetamine prevention activities. But \nunfortunately, I could not because the Republicans added, at the last \nminute, a poison pill provision aimed at weakening our public education \nsystem.\n  The Hatch amendment includes a provision allowing school districts to \nuse federal funds to provide vouchers to students who have been victims \nof violent crime on school grounds. This means that money that is \nsupposed to be used to help public schools improve technology, to \ndevelop charter schools, or that has been set aside for special \neducation students, could be used on vouchers for private schools. The \namendment does nothing to make schools safer for children and will do \nnothing to increase student achievement.\n  Let there be no mistake about what this amendment is trying to do. \nThis is just a back-door attempt to take federal resources necessary to \nimprove our public schools and squander them on vouchers to send a few \nchildren to private schools. While the proponents claim that parents \ncould send their child to any school, this provision actually creates \nan incentive to send the child to private or parochial schools by \ndisallowing transportation expenses for public school students, while \nallowing transportation expenses along with tuition and fees for \nprivate or religious schools.\n  Federal resources should be invested in improving public schools for \nall children through higher standards, smaller classes, well-trained \nteachers, modern facilities, more after-school programs, and safe and \nsecure classrooms. They should not be frittered away on ineffective and \nunproven programs to help just a few children.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the education provisions in this \namendment will necessitate that this amendment be dropped in \nconference. Thus, this is not a meaningful vote. I will continue to \nwork to enact legislation to provide law enforcement officials the \ntools they need to combat the methamphetamine problem in this country. \nBut I don't want to be part of an effort that may jeopardize the \nBankruptcy Reform Act of 1999--a bill that is aimed, rightly, at \nreducing the abuses of the bankruptcy system. We should be focused on \nenacting meaningful bankruptcy reform, and not encumbering this bill \nwith decisive partisan issues. We need to send a bankruptcy bill to the \nPresident which he can sign into law--this amendment, unfortunately, \ndoes not further that end.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Republican drug amendment to the \nbankruptcy bill would authorize private school vouchers for students \nwho are injured by offenses on public school grounds. It allows school \ndistricts to use funds from other Federal education programs, including \nIDEA funds, technology funds and others, to provide vouchers. I will \nvote against this amendment. I will do so because it will not make our \nschools safer and it will not invest in student achievement. Ninety \npercent of students are educated in our nation's public schools. Our \npublic tax dollars should be used for improving public schools, through \nsmaller class size, well-trained teachers, more after-school programs, \nmodern facilities, higher standards, and safe and secure classes. I \nrepeat, vouchers are the wrong way to go.\n  My decision to oppose this amendment is bitter-sweet because while I \noppose the voucher provisions of this amendment, I strongly support a \nprovision of the amendment which is, in fact, legislation which I co-\nauthored and introduced with Senator Hatch, Senator Moynihan and \nSenator Biden in January of this year--S. 324, the Drug Addiction \nTreatment Act. It addresses a long-time crusade of mine--that of \nspeeding the development and delivery of anti-addiction medications \nthat block the craving for illicit addictive substances. This is one \nway in which we can fight and win the war on drugs--by blocking the \ncraving for illegal substances. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act is \naimed at achieving this goal. It was originally reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee as Sec. 18 of the Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act of 1999, and provides for qualified physicians to \nprescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in their \noffices, under certain strict conditions. I was pleased to have \nintroduced S. 324 along with my distinguished colleagues. I regret that \nthis vital legislation, which can be a tool for fighting and winning \nthe war on drugs, is included in an amendment that I cannot support.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise now to echo the sentiment of my \nfriend and colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, that the passage of \nthe Republican drug amendment marks a bittersweet moment. I, too, \nregret that I had to vote against the Republican drug amendment today, \nbecause it contains a provision that is very important to me, which I \nwill address in a moment. I voted against the Republican drug amendment \nas a whole because of the provision that would expand the number of \npeople who would come within the reach of mandatory minimum sentences \nfor certain offenses involving cocaine. I feel very strongly that the \ncorrect way to address the problem of addiction is not by increasing \nthe reach of mandatory minimum sentences, but rather to increase access \nto treatment. And that is why passage of the Drug Addiction Treatment \nAct of\n\n[[Page S14473]]\n\n1999 (S. 324), in Subtitle B, Chapter 2, of the Republican drug \namendment, marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate dependence. The \nDrug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new medications, such \nas buprenorphine, to treat addiction to certain narcotic drugs, such as \nheroin. I thank my colleagues Senator Levin, Senator Hatch, and Senator \nBiden for their leadership and dedication in developing this Act, and \nregardless of the outcome of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, one way or \nanother, I look forward to seeing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of \n1999 become law.\n  Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new \ntopic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of \n1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader Robert Byrd, with Sam Nunn, to \nco-chair a working group to develop a proposal for drug control \nlegislation. We worked together with a similar Republican task force. \nWe agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under our bill \nbetween demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply reduction \nactivities (40 percent). And we created the Director of National Drug \nControl Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand Reduction and \na Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.''\n  We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by \ninterdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no \npossibility.\n  I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply \nof drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon \nCabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from \ncentral Turkey to Marseilles to New York--``the French Connection''--\nbut we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. \nThat was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was \ndemand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do.\n  Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the \nscience continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of \n1999 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it.\n  Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and \nharsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug \nproblems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now \nknow and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing \ndisease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and \nphysiological changes which may not be reversible.\n  What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to \ncut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it \nas such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion \nthat such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction. The Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act of 1999 is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \nvotes be limited to 10 minutes in length each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun, of \nIllinois, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the \nUnited States of America to New Zealand and Samoa.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nvoting on the nomination of our friend and former colleague Carol \nMoseley-Braun to be U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, as well as \nAmbassador to Samoa.\n  I am confident that Senator Moseley-Braun will be an excellent \nambassador. She has all the requisite skills--political savvy, personal \ncharm, and street smarts--to represent the United States in the finest \ntradition of American diplomacy.\n  I would like to make a few comments about the remarks made yesterday \nby the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the senior senator \nfrom North Carolina.\n  During yesterday's session, the chairman spoke on the floor about \nthis nomination. While he essentially conceded that Senator Moseley-\nBraun will be confirmed by the Senate, he proceeded to make several \narguments which I believe deserve a response.\n  First, the chairman stated that there had been a ``successful \ncoverup'' of serious ethical wrongdoing. I believe such a loaded \naccusation should be supported by facts, yet the chairman offered not a \nshred of evidence that anyone has covered up anything.\n  On the contrary, during the consideration of the nomination, the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations was provided with several thousand pages \nof documents requested by the Chairman, documents which were produced \nin a very short period of time. Included in these materials were \nseveral internal memoranda from the Department of Justice and the \nInternal Revenue Service; Committee staff members were even permitted \nto read the decision memos related to the IRS request to empanel a \ngrand jury.\n  Second, the chairman suggested that Senator Moseley-Braun has ``been \nhiding behind Mr. Kgosie Matthews,'' her former fiance, who, the \nchairman charged, is now ``conveniently a missing man.'' Mr. Matthews, \nit should be emphasized, is Senator Moseley-Braun's former fiance, and \nit is ludicrous to suggest that she is somehow responsible for his \nwhereabouts or actions.\n  Third, the chairman suggested that the request of the Internal \nRevenue Service for a grand jury to investigate the Senator was blocked \nby political appointees in the Justice Department, ``no doubt on \ninstructions from the White House'' and that it was somehow odd that \nthe request was blocked.\n  Here are the facts: in 1995 and 1996, the Chicago field office of the \nInternal Revenue Service sought authorization to empanel a grand jury \nto investigate allegations that Senator Moseley-Braun committed \ncriminal violations of the tax code by converting campaign funds to \npersonal use (which, if true, would be reportable personal income). The \nIRS request was based almost exclusively on media accounts and some FEC \ndocuments. When the first request was made in 1995, the Department of \nJustice urged the IRS to do more investigative work to corroborate the \ninformation that was alleged in the media accounts. Justice invited the \nIRS to resubmit the request.\n  The IRS resubmitted the request in early 1996; but it had not added \nany significant information to the request. In other words, it did not \nprovide the corroborative information that the Justice Department had \nrequested.\n  The decision to deny the request for authorization of the grand jury \nwas made in the Tax Division, after consultation with senior officials \nin the Public Integrity Section.\n  Although it is not that common for grand jury requests to be refused, \nthe Department of Justice is hardly a rubber stamp--for the IRS or \nanyone other agency. It is guided by the standard of the United States \nAttorneys' Manual, which requires that there be ``articulable facts \nsupporting a reasonable belief that a tax crime is being or has been \ncommitted.'' (U.S. Attorneys' Manual, 6-4.211B). The committee staff \nwas permitted to review, but not retain, the internal memos in the Tax \nDivision rejecting the IRS request. From the trial attorney up to the \nAssistant Attorney General for the Tax Division--four levels of \nreview--all agreed that there was not a sufficient predicate of \ninformation that justified opening a grand jury investigation. In \nshort, there were not the ``articulable facts'' necessary for \nempaneling the grand jury.\n  There is no evidence--none--that this decision was influenced by \npolitical considerations or outside forces.\n  Last year, when the story became public that Senator Moseley-Braun \nhad been investigated by the IRS--and that the requests for a grand \njury had been denied--the Office of Professional Responsibility at the \nDepartment of Justice opened its own inquiry. They investigated not \nSen. Moseley-Braun, but\n\n[[Page S14474]]\n\nthe handling of the case within the Department of Justice. Their \ninquiry concluded that there was no improper political influence on the \nprocess. So, far from the ``Clinton White House blocking the grand \njury,'' all the proper procedures were followed, and there is no \nevidence of White House intervention in the case. Equally important, \nthe Office of Professional Responsibility review concluded that the \ndecision on the merits was appropriate.\n  Next, the chairman suggested that the decision to reject the grand \njury request was somehow tainted because the senior official at the \nJustice Department who made the decision, Loretta Argrett, ``was a \nMoseley-Braun supporter, who had made a modest contribution'' to \nSenator Moseley-Braun's campaign, ``who had a picture of Ms. Moseley-\nBraun on her office wall'' and that the Senator had ``even presided \nover Ms. Argrett's confirmation in 1993.''\n  Here are the facts: Ms. Argrett, the Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Tax Division, was the senior official at Justice who approved the \ndecision not to authorize the grand jury request. It is true that Ms. \nArgrett gave money to the Senator's campaign: the grand sum of $25. It \nis also true that the Senator chaired Ms. Argrett's hearing, a hearing \nat which several other nominees also testified. I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee at that time. I routinely asked other members of the \nCommittee to chair nomination hearings, just as Senator Thomas chaired \nlast week's hearing on Senator Moseley-Braun. Finally, it is also true \nthat Ms. Argrett had a photograph of her and the Senator hanging in her \noffice--a photo taken at that confirmation hearing.\n  All of these facts were disclosed to the Deputy Attorney General at \nthe time, Jamie Gorelick, for a determination as to whether Ms. Argrett \nshould be involved in the case. On June 2, 1995, Assistant Attorney \nGeneral Argrett disclosed these facts to the Deputy Attorney General \nand concluded that, based on the minimal contact she had with the \nSenator, she believed she could act impartially in this case. Deputy \nAttorney General Gorelick --one of the most capable public officials I \nhave known in my years in the Senate--approved Ms. Argrett's continued \nparticipation in the case.\n  Mr. President, I will not delay the Senate any further. The Committee \ndid its job and gathered the available evidence. There is no evidence \nin the record that disqualifies Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  She will be an excellent ambassador, just as she was an excellent \nsenator. We are lucky that she still wants to continue in public \nservice. I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Senator Carol Moseley-\nBraun.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I submit this statement in opposition \nto the nomination of former Senator Carol Moseley-Bruan as Ambassador \nof the United States to the governments of New Zealand and Samoa. The \npeople of Illinois are intimately familiar with Senator Moseley-Braun's \npublic career, as am I. Based on my extensive knowledge of her record, \nI cannot in good conscience support her nomination. While her tenure \ninvolved a significant number of controversies, many of which are \ntroubling, her secret visits to, and relations with, the late General \nSani Abacha and his regime are themselves a disqualifier for any kind \nof position that involves representing the United States in a foreign \nland. They demonstrate a lack of judgment and discretion that should be \nrequired of any ambassadorial nominee.\n  According to her written responses provided to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee on November 6, 1999, the Senator traveled to \nNigeria in December, 1992; July, 1995; and August, 1996. According to \nthe same documents, Senator Moseley-Braun met with Sani Abacha during \nall three trips. Abacha was one of the world's most brutal and corrupt \ndictators, an international pariah, widely reviled. After taking power \nin 1993, he jailed Nigeria's elected president, reportedly imprisoned \nas many as 7,000 political opponents, hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-\nWiwa and eight other activists and allegedly stole more than $1 billion \nin oil revenues while presiding over the nation's economic collapse.\n  During her appearance before the East Asian and Pacific Affairs \nsubcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nMoseley-Braun likened her meetings with General Abacha to meetings \nbetween other Senators and Members of Congress with leaders of \ncountries accused of violating human rights. This analogy is \ninappropriate; her visits were of a chilling and distinctly different \nnature. Senator Moseley-Braun's visits with Abacha were secret \nencounters, condemned by the U.S. State Department, hidden not just \nfrom the government but even from her own staff. Moreover, her former \nfiance, Mr. Kgosie Matthews, was at one time a registered agent for the \nNigerian government. Mr. Matthews accompanied her to Nigeria, although \nit is not clear how many times he did so. In response to written \nquestions, Senator Moseley-Braun stated that she was ``unaware of \nwhether . . . Mr. Matthews `directly or indirectly received any money \nor anything of monetary value' from the Nigerian government.'' To \nsecretly visit a corrupt despot like Abacha, remaining unaware of \nwhether a fiance, a one-time agent of the regime, is profiting in any \nway from Abacha or the Nigerian government, demonstrates a profound \nlack of judgment.\n  The confirmation hearing briefly touched upon areas of concern other \nthan Senator Moseley-Braun's relations with Abacha. During her tenure, \nthe Internal Revenue Service requested a grand jury investigation of \nSenator Moseley-Braun, suggesting a number of areas of inquiry. In her \nwritten responses to questions posed by the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the nominee stated that ``I was unaware that I was the \nsubject of any criminal investigation by the Internal Revenue Service \nprior to the July, 1998 WBBM report.''\n  The WBBM-TV report, to which Senator Moseley-Braun referred, \ndisclosed that the IRS twice sought to convene a grand jury to explore \nallegations concerning the personal use of campaign funds as well as \nallegations relating to ``possible bank fraud, bribery and other \nfederal crimes.'' The committee record established that the Department \nof Justice rejected the requests for grand juries, citing a lack of \nsufficient evidence, thus halting the ability of the IRS to proceed \nwith the very subpoena power necessary to acquire sufficient evidence. \nThe circularity of this process--the IRS requests for grand juries and \nDepartment of Justice refusals--as well as the inability of these \nconcerns to be probed to conclusion, leaves a host of unanswered \nquestions. These questions should have been resolved prior to a vote on \nthe confirmation.\n\n  Senator Moseley-Braun refers to an FEC audit report that she believes \nrebuts the IRS concerns. First, assuming for the sake of argument that \nthe FEC audit refutes the personal use of campaign funds, it \nnevertheless clearly does not refute the other allegations reportedly \nraised by the IRS such as ``possible bank fraud, bribery and other \nfederal crimes'' reportedly going back to her tenure as Cook County \nRecorder of Deeds.\n  Second, it is unclear to what extent the FEC investigated the \npersonal use of campaign funds. There are countless ways a diversion of \ncampaign funds for personal use could occur. Discussion in the \nconfirmation hearing centered around just campaign credit cards. \nSection I. D. of the FEC audit report does not mention the diversion of \ncampaign funds as being within the scope of the audit, but instead \nlists, in specific detail, eight other areas of inquiry. On the other \nhand, the last page of the audit report indicates that the FEC audited \nthe activity of the campaign credit cards. FEC working papers provided \nto the Senate further indicate that the FEC found that the cards were \nused to pay $6,258.14 of Mr. Matthews' personal expenses, but that, \nafter deducting sums which the campaign argued it owed him, these \npersonal expenses totaled only $311.28. It is unclear whether the FEC \nprobed the possible diversion of campaign funds by other, less blunt, \nmore oblique means, such as by cash purchases or by cashier's checks \npurchased with cash, or by other mechanisms. To the best of our \nknowledge, major allegations of diversion, such as those discussed in \nthe Dateline NBC report, did not arise until after the FEC audit was \ncompleted.\n  Third, the FEC itself pointedly said that no inferences should be \ndrawn\n\n[[Page S14475]]\n\nfrom its failure to resolve its examination of Senator Moseley-Braun's \ncampaign fund. According to a Chicago Tribune article dated April 8, \n1997, FEC spokeswoman Sharon Snyder mentioned ``a lack of manpower, a \nlack of time'' and cited the impending expiration of the statute of \nlimitations. She went on to say: ``There's no statement here: no \nexoneration, no Good Housekeeping seal of approval, just no action.''\n  Thus, with respect to the FEC investigation, as with the IRS requests \nfor grand juries, many questions remain unresolved. However, the visits \nwith General Sani Abacha are undisputed and, in their context, they are \nso unusual and bizarre as to alone disqualify her as an ambassador.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the Senate must fulfill its constitutional \nobligation. This body has given Senator Carol Moseley-Braun a select \nresponsibility. While I cannot in good conscience support her \nnomination, I wish her well in her new post.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support our distinguished \nformer colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, and I urge the Senate to \nconfirm her as Ambassador to New Zealand. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun \nserved the people of Illinois with great distinction during her six \nyears in the Senate. She fought hard for the citizens of Illinois and \nfor working men and women everywhere, and it was a privilege to serve \nwith her. In her years in the Senate, she was a leader on many \nimportant issues that affect millions of Americans, especially in the \nareas of education and civil rights. She worked skillfully and \neffectively to bring people together with her unique energetic and \ninspiring commitment to America's best ideals.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun has been breaking down barriers all her life. \nShe became the first African-American woman to serve in this body. Her \nleadership was especially impressive in advancing the rights of women \nand minorities in our society. As a respected former Senator, she will \nbring great stature and visibility to the position of Ambassador to New \nZealand. That nation is an important ally of the United States, and it \nis gratifying that we will be sending an Ambassador with her experience \nand the President's confidence.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the nomination of my friend and former colleague, Carol \nMoseley-Braun, to be Ambassador to New Zealand.\n  I had the pleasure of serving with Senator Moseley-Braun for six \nyears and I know her to be a dedicated, caring, intelligent, and hard-\nworking public servant. I am confident she will carry these qualities \nto her new post in New Zealand.\n  Prior to her service in the United States Senate, Senator Moseley-\nBraun distinguished herself as a member of the Illinois Legislature and \nas the Recorder of Deeds for Cook County, Illinois. From 1973 to 1977 \nshe also served as Assistant District Attorney in the Northern District \nof Illinois.\n  In 1992, Carol Moseley-Braun made history by becoming the first \nAfrican American female elected to the United States Senate. As a \nUnited States Senator, she dedicated herself to issues that would make \na difference in the lives of ordinary Americans: increased funding for \neducation, HMO reform and family and medical leave.\n  Following her service in the Senate, Senator Moseley-Braun continued \nto stay involved in the issues that mean most to her and become a \nconsultant to the United States Department of Education.\n  On October 8, 1999, President Clinton presented her with a new \nchallenge and nominated her to be United States Ambassador to New \nZealand. I am sure her tenure as Ambassador will only add to this long \nand distinguished career.\n  The overwhelming and bi-bipartisan vote in favor of her nomination by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee should answer any critic that \nquestions her qualifications to be the next ambassador to New Zealand.\n  New Zealand is an important ally and a vital part of our relations in \nthe Asia-Pacific region. We need an ambassador who will be able to \nhandle all aspects of United States-New Zealand relations and best \nrepresent our interests. Carol Moseley-Braun is the right person for \nthat job.\n  Mr. President, I was proud to serve with Senator Moseley-Braun, I am \nproud to call her a friend and I am proud to support her nomination to \nbe Ambassador to New Zealand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Carol Moseley-Braun, of Illinois, to be \nAmbassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of \nAmerica to New Zealand and Samoa?\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Linda Joan Morgan, of \nMaryland, to be a Member of the Surface Transportation Board for a term \nexpiring December 31, 2003.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nLinda J. Morgan. Today we are considering the nomination of Linda \nMorgan to be reappointed as the chairman of the Surface Transportation \nBoard. I am proud to say that I have known Chairman Morgan for many \nyears. Although we may not always agree, I have a great deal of respect \nfor her and know that two qualities she possesses in abundance are \nfairness and integrity. Those qualities, coupled with her commitment to \npublic service, make her an outstanding chairman.\n  Before I discuss Chairman Morgan's abilities and accomplishments, I \nwould like to comment briefly on the agreement reached between railroad \nmanagement and labor this week on the cram down issue. As many of you \nknow, the carriers and their employees have been working on the terms \nof an agreement which would create new rules pertaining to the \nabrogation of\n\n[[Page S14476]]\n\ncollective bargaining agreements. Yesterday, the parties agreed to a \nmoratorium on the filing of section 4 notices while the negotiations \ntake place to establish new rules. I am pleased that the parties were \nable to reach a compromise on this important issue and urge the STB to \nlook favorably on this agreement. In addition, I expect to address this \nissue legislatively next year when we take up the STB reauthorization \nbill.\n  As many of you know, Linda Morgan served as counsel for the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee for 8 years and then as general counsel for \nthe full Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for seven \nyears. During that time I found Linda Morgan to be one of the most \nintelligent and thorough professionals that I have worked with. She is \nsmart and she cares about the issues--I know that she is committed to \nserving the public in her capacity as the chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Board.\n  Linda Morgan has served as chairman of the Surface Transportation \nBoard (STB) since it was created in 1996. Prior to that, she served as \nchairman of the ICC. In 1996 she was responsible for implementing the \nchanges that Congress envisioned in the Interstate Commerce Commission \nTermination Act. She pared down the ICC and established a new, more \nstreamlined agency in its place, the STB.\n  Chairman Morgan is to be commended for her achievements and \ncommitment to the mission of the STB during her first term. The STB \noperates with only 135 people, less than half the staff of it \npredecessor, but it is charged with regulating the entire railroad \nindustry. Among her accomplishments, Chairman Morgan has facilitated \ncreating a more efficient process for resolving rate disputes between \nshippers and carriers. Additionally, under her leadership, she has \nhelped the private sector come to agreements on short line access and \nagricultural services arbitration which have benefited the entire \ntransportation industry.\n  Chairman Morgan has done an outstanding job moving the agency through \nseveral different places. She successfully transitioned the agency from \nthe ICC to the STB. She has seen the railroad industry through three \nvery large merger transactions. She helped resolve the service issues \nin the west. And last year she ended the practice of using product and \ngeographic competition in determining appropriate rates for shippers.\n  Linda Morgan has done a lot of heavy lifting during her tenure as \nchairman of the STB. She has my full confidence and I support her \nnomination.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of \nLinda Morgan. During her tenure as the chairwoman of the Surface \nTransportation Board, Ms. Morgan has failed to achieve a primary goal \nof this independent agency--protecting the rights of shippers using \nrail transportation. Earlier this year, I along with a number of other \ncolleagues, introduced a bill, S. 621, that would help to create \ncompetition among rail carriers where that competition does not \ncurrently exist due to regional monopolization.\n  This bill would resolve the economic inequities found around our \nnation. In my State of Montana, our farmers pay dramatically more for \ntransportation costs than farmers anyplace else in the State. In fact, \non a proportionate comparison, Montana's farmers pay more than most \nother shippers in the world. Why? I'll tell you why--because nearly the \nentire State of Montana is captive to the Burlington Northern Santa Fe \nrailroad. In the case of Montana farmers, Montana is captive to BNSF.\n  I cannot blame Ms. Morgan for this. The board's decision are based on \nmisinterpreted statute that was legislated in the early 80's.\n  However, I cam blame Ms. Morgan for not recognizing this as the case \nbefore the shippers asked me and several of my colleagues for \nassistance. It is inexcusable to treat the Nation's shippers so \npitifully. It is arrogant on behalf of the railroads to think that they \ncan take advantage of small shippers using strongarm tactics to \ndetermine shipping costs. It should not cost more to ship from Montana \nto the Pacific Northwest than it costs to ship from the Midwest to the \nPacific Northwest--over the same tracks. This is an absurd manner in \nwhich to allow a railroad to operate.\n  Back to Ms. Morgan. It is about time for Congress to recognize the \ninequities in the rail industry. Competition is based on choice. \nWithout multiple competitors to choose from, we are left with a \nmonopoly. BNSF has a monopoly in Montana and the four behemoths that \nhave evolved since the early 80s when we had over 40 large railroads \nhave monopolies all across this Nation.\n  Let me quote Ms. Morgan from hearings held earlier this year:\n  Ms. Morgan has stated, ``If Congress feels the statute doesn't work, \nit's up to Congress to provide a revision to the statute.'' Mr. \nPresident, Ms. Morgan is the chairwoman of the STB and a very \nintelligent woman. Ms. Morgan has recommended to this body that \nCongress would need to change the law in order to create an equitable \nenvironment. If the STB is saying this, if hundreds of shippers are \nsaying this, if economists are saying this, why won't Congress react? \nI'll tell you why. Railroad interests in this city have a stronghold on \nlegislation that would take away their ability to charge unchallenged \nrates.\n  Ms. Morgan has also stated the following:\n  ``The role of the STB is to allow competition where it exists and \nprotect those where it does not exist.'' Let me give you an example of \nwhere competition does not exist. Competition does not exist in the \nentire state of Montana. Competition does not exist in the entire state \nof North Dakota. With four major railroads in the country, regional \nrail monopolies are very common. Montana was one of the first--we've \nbeen captive since 1980.\n  Another statement from Ms. Morgan.\n  ``The board is there to make sure that no rate is unreasonable. The \nequalization of rates is not inherent in the statute.'' A goal of the \nSTB is to make sure that no rate is ``unreasonable''. The STB could \ndefine as unreasonable the rate paid by Montana's farmers. These rates \nare unreasonable! Lastly, Ms. Morgan has indicated that, ``The statute \ndoes not make competition a priority.'' I agree with her and that is \nwhy I am sympathetic, Her's is a thankless job and until Congress gives \nthe STB the proper tools to decide cases in an equitable manner, it \nwill continue to be a thankless job.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity to do what is right for \nAmerica. I will not support Ms. Morgan but I will support reform of the \nSTB.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote to reappoint \nSurface Transportation Board, STB, Chairman Linda J. Morgan to serve \nanother term on that panel even though I am troubled by some STB \ndecisions concerning the CSX and Norfolk Southern acquisition of \nConrail properties in New York State. I am encouraged, however, by \nChairman Morgan's responsiveness to my requests, and those of my \ncolleagues, to monitor the freight rail problems that have plagued New \nYorkers since the June 1, 1999 implementation of the CSX/Norfolk \nSouthern acquisition. Just last month, Chairman Morgan came to Buffalo \nto hear the concerns of local shippers.\n  As she begins her second term as Chairman of the STB, Linda Morgan \nhas presided over the largest rail mergers in this Nation's history. \nNow the hard part begins. If service failures persist, Chairman Morgan \nmust exercise her statutory authority to impose conditions upon the \nrailroads. This will be no easy task. Revising one's work in the face \nof significant opposition requires courage. But I am confident that \nshould the public interest so require, Chairman Morgan will respond \nboldly. Nothing short of the future of freight rail in the United \nStates is at stake.\n  One additional thought is the role of organized labor in the freight \nrail industry. I would note that I do not find it fair that an \ninterpretation of current Federal law permits the STB to revisit \ncollective bargaining agreements dozens of years after a merger has \nbeen completed. There is a certain logic to providing the STB with the \nauthority to abrogate local, State, and Federal laws to ensure the \nsuccess of a merger. But the prospect that collective bargaining \nagreements--private contracts--can be the subject of renegotiation and \nmediation years after a merger has been consummated is troubling. In \nthe 2nd session of the 106th Congress I will seek legislation to \nconstrict the window of time following the\n\n[[Page S14477]]\n\napproval of a merger in which unions can be compelled to renegotiate \ncollective bargaining agreements.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the Surface Transportation Board faces \nextraordinarily difficult decisions in the next few years. I believe \nthat Linda Morgan's experience as a trusted advisor and counsel to the \nSenate Commerce Committee and her chairmanship of the STB have prepared \nher well for the challenges that lie ahead. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the continuing resolution.\n\n       A joint resolution (H. J. Res. 78) making further \n     continuing appropriations for the fiscal year 2000, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, we are about to pass a resolution to keep \nthe Government operating for approximately a week. The question I ask \nis, What are we doing for the victims of Hurricane Floyd? Keeping this \nGovernment open is not important unless it does the things it should \nand needs to do for its citizens.\n  We keep telling the people of this country that this is their \nGovernment, it belongs to them. Every week they get their paycheck, and \nthey have a huge deduction for Federal taxes. They wonder every time \nthey get their paycheck and their paycheck stub where that money is \ngoing.\n  The truth is, now is the time, in the wake of the devastation of \nHurricane Floyd, when they are entitled to expect their Government will \nrespond and respond in a responsible way to what has been done to them.\n  The people of eastern North Carolina--I know because I have been \nthere over and over, including this past weekend--are wondering how \nthey are going to make it through the winter. They are completely and \ntotally innocent. These are people who had a hurricane drop inches and \ninches of water on them. It devastated their homes and, thereby, \ndevastated their lives. In many cases, it devastated their workplaces.\n  What they are saying to us now is: What is my Government to which I \nhave been paying taxes for all these years going to do? The reality is, \nif the Government does not respond to this disaster and this terrible \nsituation, the Government serves no purpose.\n  We had 50 people die in North Carolina as a result of this hurricane \nand 5 people are still missing. We have 3,000 people who are still in \ntemporary housing. More than 30,000 homes have been damaged and \napproximately 20,000 have been completely destroyed. The damage \nestimate for housing alone is approximately $400 million, and that \nnumber will grow. We have eight counties that still have damaged water \nsystems where people are required to boil their water to use it.\n  Over 2 months after this hurricane ravaged eastern North Carolina, \nour people are still struggling and suffering and will continue to \nstruggle as we go forward.\n  I ask my colleagues these questions:\n  No. 1, do they take for granted the roof over their heads?\n  No. 2, do they assume when they turn the tap on that they will be \nable to drink the water that comes out of that tap?\n  And No. 3, do they assume their children will be able to go to \nschool?\n  Let me tell my friends and colleagues in the Senate that there are \ntens of thousands of North Carolinians who no longer take those things \nfor granted and no longer assume they are going to be able to do those \nthings because they know they cannot. The question they ask me and, \nmore important, the question they ask us as their representatives in \nthis Government is, What are we going to do to respond to what has \nhappened to them?\n  We have kids in eastern North Carolina who are going to school in \nsmall trailers in a gravel parking lot of the National Guard grounds in \nTarboro. In order to go to the restroom, they have to leave these small \ntrailers and travel to the one small trailer that has a restroom. They \nare already going to school in little trailers on a gravel parking lot, \nand there is not even a restroom in the trailer they are using for a \nclassroom. In order to use the restroom, they have to leave their \ntrailer and go down the parking lot to another small trailer.\n  The water rose in this area, for example, 88 inches in an elementary \nschool in Tarboro. The school was completely destroyed.\n  Transportation--we have more than 90 sections of State roads and 12 \nbridges still washed out.\n  Agriculture--our farmers are hurting as they have never hurt before. \nBefore this hurricane went through eastern North Carolina, our farmers \nwere teetering on the edge from low crop prices and many years of \nhaving a very difficult time financially.\n\n  What is the effect of a hurricane coming through? This is the time of \nyear when many of our farmers in eastern North Carolina would be doing \nthe bulk of their work. They would be harvesting their crops. Not this \nyear. Many of our farmers have lost all of their crops. The current \ncrop loss estimate is $543 million--over $\\1/2\\ billion. The livestock \nloss is estimated at about $2 million. We have more than $200 million \nin damage to structures on farms, the structures that are necessary for \nthese farmers to operate their farms day to day. Many of these \nstructures have been destroyed.\n  In addition, they have lost the machinery that is necessary to \noperate their farms on a daily basis. In almost all cases, the \nstructures are not covered by insurance, and, in many cases, the \nmachinery is not covered by insurance.\n  The bottom line is we have many farmers in eastern North Carolina who \nhave lost their crops. They have lost the buildings from which they \noperate and they have lost the machinery they use to farm. They are out \nof business. What they say to us in Washington is: What is my \nGovernment going to do to respond? I have paid my taxes. I have been a \ngood, law-abiding citizen all these years, and I have always been told \nthis is my Government. So my question to Washington now is, What is my \nGovernment going to do to respond?\n  The reality is, nobody in North Carolina is asking for a handout. Our \npeople have responded heroically to this situation. Our businesses have \nbeen extraordinary.\n  They have made millions and millions of dollars worth of donations to \nhelp the people who have been devastated by Hurricane Floyd. Our \nindividual citizens have made contributions. They have not only made \ncontributions with funds to help the victims of Hurricane Floyd, they \nhave taken time off from work, with their employers' permission; they \nare taking their weekends and their time off to go to eastern North \nCarolina to work to try to help the folks who have been devastated. \nThey have done everything they can. Every person in North Carolina is \ndoing what they can to help our people who have been damaged by this \nstorm.\n  That is not enough. We need this Government to respond in a way that \naddresses the needs.\n  No. 1, we need housing relief. We have thousands of families who have \nlost their homes as a result of this storm. They have no way to rebuild \ntheir homes and rebuild their lives without our assistance. It is \nassistance to which they are entitled. They have paid their taxes all \nthese years, never knowing this disaster, this devastation was coming. \nNow that it has hit them, it is time for this Government to respond and \nto get them back into houses.\n  They do not need help 6 months from now or a year from now; they need \nhelp right now. Right now is the time they are living in small \ntrailers, on gravel parking lots. They want to get back into a home, a \nreal home, the kind of home they had before Hurricane Floyd came. We \nhave a responsibility to do everything we can to put them in those \nhomes.\n  Agriculture: We have over 25,000 farmers who desperately need help \njust to make it through the winter. I am talking about an intense and \nimmediate financial crisis that our farmers are confronted with.\n  So we have two things we must do before we go home. We have to \naddress the housing needs in North Carolina, people who are not going \nto be able to get through the winter unless we do something for them; \nand, secondly, we have to help our farmers who are already in trouble \nand have been completely devastated.\n  I want us to compare the needs and the devastation in eastern North \nCarolina to some of the things on which we spend money. While I am \nstrongly in support of spending funds for the defense of this country, \nwe have spent\n\n[[Page S14481]]\n\nbillions of dollars on projects the Pentagon did not ever suggest they \nwanted. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on relocating \nbureaucrats and renovating or restoring Federal buildings, millions on \ndebt forgiveness for foreign governments, tens of millions on foreign \ncultural exchange programs, and on top of all that, a congressional pay \nraise.\n  Surely these folks in North Carolina, whose lives have been \ndevastated--totally innocent victims of Hurricane Floyd--are entitled \nto at least that level of priority. Those are things we have already \ndone. And we ought to do things for these Third World countries. We \nought to do things to help other countries that are in need. But the \nreality is, we have North Carolinians and Americans who are in \ndesperate straits. They do not have anyplace to live. We have farmers \nwho are literally out of business. Their families have, for \ngenerations, farmed the land of eastern North Carolina, and they are \nnow out of business.\n  It is time for their Government to step to the plate and do the \nresponsible thing, to give them the help they need to put our folks in \neastern North Carolina back into houses, to put our farmers back on \ntheir feet and back in business.\n  If we cannot do that, what function do we serve as a Government? For \nall those people who, for all these years, we have been saying, this is \nyour Government; this is not some foreign thing up in Washington that \nhas nothing to do with your lives, now they are asking us to make good \non that promise and to make good on our responsibility to them for all \ntheir years--year in and year out--of doing the responsible thing: \nPaying their taxes and being good Americans.\n  So I close by saying, I understand that we are nearing the end of \nthis session. I understand the needs and priorities on which we are all \nfocused: Education, health care, responsible fixes for the BBA, and \nhospitals and health care providers around this country. We have many \nneeds that need to be addressed.\n  But I want to make clear that when it comes to Hurricane Floyd and my \npeople in North Carolina who do not have a place to live and are \nworried about getting through this winter, and our farmers who are \nliterally out of business, that I intend to use absolutely everything \nat my disposal and to take whatever action is necessary to assure that \nour people in North Carolina are taken care of.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer a second-degree amendment to \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Brownback, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2778 to amendment No. 2516, as modified.\n       Strike the period at the end and insert the following: ``. \n     The provisions of this section shall not apply to debtors if \n     applicable State law provides by statute that such provisions \n     shall not apply to debtors and shall not take effect in any \n     State before the end of the first regular session of the \n     State legislature following the date of enactment of this \n     Act.''\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could take a moment to explain \nthe amendment. We have agreed to 30 minutes equally divided. I would \nthen turn it over to Senator Kohl to explain the underlying amendment.\n  Basically, Senator Kohl and Senator Sessions are going to try to put \na cap on the homestead exemption that would apply uniformly to every \nState. I think that is a mistake because every State is different. The \nvaluation of property is different in every State. This does not make \nany allowance for those variations in property.\n  The Kohl-Sessions amendment has a $100,000 cap in bankruptcy \nproceedings on homestead exemptions, but the median value of a home in \nCalifornia is over $215,000; in Oklahoma it is $92,500. So right there \nyou can see there are differences in America.\n  Secondly, 11 homestead exemptions around the country would be \nimmediately overturned if we have a Federal standard for a homestead \nexemption. The States of Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, Texas, \nMinnesota, Nevada, Oklahoma, California, Massachusetts, and Rhode \nIsland would all have their caps lifted in favor of a Federal rule that \nwould attempt to be one size fits all.\n  In my home State of Texas, it is actually a constitutional provision; \nit is not a statute. It does not refer to money at all. It refers to \nacreage. There is the urban acreage and there is the rural acreage. So \nI think it is very important that we have the ability to address this \nby every individual State.\n  For 130 years in our country, the Federal Government has allowed the \nStates the ability to set its own laws in this area. The homestead \nexemption does differ State to State. For 130 years, the Federal \nGovernment has said the States may do this.\n  The Kohl-Sessions amendment would overturn the 130 years of \nprecedence and have a national standard, a one-size-fits-all approach. \nThat reminds me of a lot of other Federal Government programs. I am \nsure it rings true with other Americans because that is the Federal \napproach: One size fits all. We do not need one size fits all. For 130 \nyears, we have not had it.\n  In this country the States have done very well in setting their own \nhomestead exemptions--what works for them, what works for the elderly \nin their States, what works for families in my State of Texas--and they \ndo not want to take homes away from the elderly who are most \nsusceptible to having health crises. That would take away their \nsavings. That might put them into financial difficulty. They do not \nwant to throw the elderly people out of their homes, even if their \nhomestead might be valued at over $100,000, the median value.\n\n  Secondly, what if it is a young family where the wage earner gets \ninto financial difficulty? Do we want to put a family out on the \nstreets? This has been sacrosanct in my State and in many other States; \nthat whatever we were doing to try to make people pay their debts--and \nwe do want people to pay their debts--we don't want to make them wards \nof the State. We want their families to be able to continue to have a \nroof over their heads while they are working out of their financial \ndifficulties.\n\n[[Page S14482]]\n\n  I support the concept of this bill. I commend Senator Grassley for \nworking hard to improve the bankruptcy laws in our country. But the \namendment that is before us today would take away 130 years of \npreemption by the States to create their own homestead exemptions, \nespecially rural States where farms may have a bigger valuation. They \ndon't want to make people who are in financial difficulty wards of the \nState.\n  Let me show two very important letters from the State leaders of our \ncountry. The National Governors' Association, in a letter signed by \nGovernor Jim Hodges and Governor John Rowland, wrote:\n\n       We also urge you to resist efforts to impose a uniform \n     nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. The ability to \n     determine their own homestead exemptions has been a long-\n     standing authority of states. Furthermore, the median price \n     of a single family home varies widely from state to state. A \n     one-size-fits-all approach is simply not appropriate when the \n     median home price may be more than two-and-a-half times as \n     high in one state as it is in another.\n\n  The second letter is from the National Conference of State \nLegislatures. It says:\n\n       The [National Conference of State Legislatures] is \n     concerned, however, that an amendment may be offered during \n     Senate consideration that would preempt state laws by setting \n     a cap of $100,000 on homestead exemptions, thus forcing \n     debtors with over $100,000 in homestead equity to sell their \n     homes and farms. Recent real estate trends have shown that in \n     all but four states, the median price of a single family home \n     is well over $100,000. While state legislators believe that \n     the bankruptcy code should strongly encourage consumers to \n     pay their debts to the extent possible, my colleagues and I \n     would be equally concerned about the disruption to family \n     life, particularly the harsh impact on the children of \n     debtors that may result by the establishment of such a limit \n     on homestead exemptions.\n\n  We have the National Conference of State Legislatures and the \nNational Governors' Association speaking for the State leadership \nsaying this is an area that should be left to the States. It has been \nleft to the States for 130 years. We do not need to overturn 130 years \nof laws that are working in individual States.\n  I hope we can pass this bill. I certainly will support the Kohl \namendment, if we have the State ability to opt out. That is the key. I \nthink if we can have that kind of accommodation, then it will be a good \namendment. Let the States decide for themselves if $100,000 is right \nfor them.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto ask for the yeas and nays on both the Hutchison amendment and the \nKohl-Grassley-Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was diverted. I didn't hear the \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KOHL. I asked that it be in order for the yeas and nays on both \nthe Hutchison amendment and the Kohl-Grassley-Sessions amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order that the Senator now make that \nrequest.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the \nHutchinson/Brownback ``opt-out'' amendment, then vote for the Kohl/\nSessions/Grassley $100,000 cap. Let me tell you why; an opt-out doesn't \nchange a thing. A few states have already basically ``opted out'' of \nreasonable homestead exemptions and that's a problem. This amendment \nwould let these states continue to go on like nothing happened. The \nKohl-Sessions-Grassley amendment, on the other hand, will stop this \nabuse, pure and simple.\n  You can not support our cap and also support an opt-out: It's either \none or the other, Mr. President.\n  They say this is really just about states' rights. Nothing could be \nfarther from the truth. Anyone who files for bankruptcy is choosing to \ninvoke federal law in a federal court to get a ``fresh start,'' which \nis a uniquely federal benefit. In these circumstances, it's only fair \nto impose federal limits.\n  And don't take my word for it: just listen to one of Texas' leading \nnewspapers, the Austin American-Statesman. It recently editorialized \nthat: ``The U.S. Constitution gives the federal government supremacy \nover the states in bankruptcy matters, so arguments that the federal \ngovernment should let states do as the wish on this particular fact of \nbankruptcy law make little sense.'' The editorial goes on to urge \nCongress to limit the homestead exemption.\n  Besides, we're only capping the homestead exemptions in states like \nFlorida and Texas as they apply to bankruptcy and not for other \npurposes. That is, if you lose a multi million-dollar lawsuit in Texas \nand can't ``pay-up,'' you can still keep your expensive home if you \ndon't file for bankruptcy. While that may not seem right, what state \ncourts do is a matter of state law--and we do not touch it. On the \nother hand, anyone who wants to take advantage of the federal \nbankruptcy system should live with a federal $100,000 cap.\n  Now let's turn to why our proposal is so important to effective \nbankruptcy reform. Our proposal closes an inexcusable loophole that \nallows too many debtors to keep their luxury homes, while their \nlegitimate creditors--like children owed child support, ex-spouses \nowned alimony, state governments, small businesses and banks--get left \nout in the cold. Last year, the full Senate unanimously went on record \nin favor of the $100,000 cap and emphasized that ``meaningful \nbankruptcy reform cannot be achieved without capping the homestead \nexemption.''\n  Curently, a handful of states allow debtors to protect their homes no \nmatter how high their value. And all too often, millionaire debtors \ntake advantage of this loophole by moving expensive homes in states \nwith unlimited exemptions like Florida and Texas, and declaring \nbankruptcy--and then continue to live in style. Let me give you a few \nof the literally countless examples:\n  The owners of a failed Ohio S, who was convicted of securities \nfraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still \nheld on to the multi-million dollar ranch be bought in Florida.\n  A convicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owning at \nleast $50 million in debts and fines, but still kept his $5 million \nFlorida home--with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms.\n  And just last year, movies star Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 \nmillion in debt through bankruptcy, but he still held into his $2.5 \nmillion Florida estate.\n  Unfortunately, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. We \nasked the GAO to study this problem and, based on their estimates, 400 \nhomeowners in Florida and Texas--all with over one hundred thousand \ndollars in home equity--profit from this unlimited exemption each and \nevery year. While they continue to live in luxury, they wrote off \nannually an estimated $120 million debt owned to honest creditors.\n  Mr. President, this is not only wrong, I believe it is not \nacceptable. Without our amendment, the pending bill falls far short. \nInstead of a cap, it only imposes a 2-year residency requirement to \nqualify for a State exemption. And while that is a step, it will not \ndeter a savvy debtor who plans ahead for bankruptcy, and it won't do \nanything about instate abusers such as Burt Reynolds. This $100,000 cap \nwill stop these abuses without affecting the vast majority of States.\n  Let me make one final point. Some opt-out supporters have circulated \nmisleading information about how many States would be affected by this \ncap. While a few States would be impacted, they are mistaken about \neight States in particular; they are: Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, \nMichigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oregon, and Rhode Island. We asked the \nCongressional Research Service to take a look, and CRS concluded that \nour cap would have ``no effect'' on these States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the memorandum from CRS be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S14483]]\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Sen. Subcommittee on Antitrust, Business Rights, and \n         Competition. Attention: Brian Lee.\n     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Effect of proposed amendments to S. 625 on selected \n         state homestead exemptions.\n\n       This responds to your request for a legal opinion on the \n     effect of language that may be offered as an amendment to S. \n     625, 106th Cong., 1st Sess. 1999, the Bankruptcy Reform Act \n     of 1999.\n       The proposed language would add a new subsection (n) to 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 522 governing bankruptcy exemptions to provide \n     that the aggregate value of homestead exemptions in op-out \n     states may not exceed $100,000 in value.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Specifically, proposed subsection (n)(1) states:\n     Except as provided in paragraph (2), as a result of electing \n     under subsection (b)(3)(A) to exempt property under State or \n     local law, a debtor may not exempt any amount of interest \n     that exceeds in the aggregate $100,000 in value in--\n     (A) real or personal property that the debtor or a dependent \n     of the debtor uses as a residence;\n     (B) a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a \n     dependent of the debtor uses as a residence; or\n     (C) a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the \n     debtor.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       You have asked what effect this provision, if enacted, \n     would have on the homestead exemptions in Alabama, Colorado, \n     Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oregon and Rhode \n     Island. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the \n     proposed federal cap on state homestead exemptions would have \n     no effect in these states.\n       Several of these states provide for the possible exemption \n     of a substantial amount of real property, for example, up to \n     160 acres of land, which could theoretically exceed $100,000 \n     in value. In each case, however, the scope of the exemption \n     is limited by a monetary cap on its aggregate value:\n       Alabama Code Sec. 6-10-2 (1993): homestead ``with the \n     improvements and appurtenances, not exceeding in value $5,000 \n     and in area 160 acres[.]''\n       Colorado Rev. Stat. Sec. 38-41-20 (1997): homestead shall \n     be exempt ``not exceeding in value the sum of thirty thousand \n     dollars in actual cash value in excess of any liens or \n     encumbrances.]''\n       Louisiana Rev. Stat Ann., Title 20, Sec. 1 (West. 1999 \n     supp.): homestead consists of ``a tract of land or two or \n     more tracts of land with a residence on one tract and a \n     field, pasture, or garden on the other tract or tracts, not \n     exceeding one hundred sixty acres. . . . This exemption \n     extends to fifteen thousand dollars in value[.]''\n       Michigan Comp. Laws. Ann. Sec. 600.6023 (West 1999 supp): \n     ``A homestead of not exceeding 40 acres of land and the \n     dwelling house and appurtenances . . . not exceeding in value \n     $3,500.''\n       Mississippi Code Ann. Sec. 85-3-21 (West 1999): ``[A] \n     householder shall be entitled to hold exempt . . . the land \n     and buildings owned and occupied as a residence by him, or \n     her, but the quantity of land shall not exceed one hundred \n     sixty (160) acres, nor the value thereof, inclusive of \n     improvements, save as hereinafter provided, the sum of \n     Seventy-five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00[.]''\n       Nebraska Rev. Stat. Sec. 40-101 (1997 supp.): ``A homestead \n     not exceeding twelve thousand five hundred dollars in value \n     shall consist of the dwelling house in which the claimant \n     resides . . . not exceeding 160 acres of land[.]''\n       Oregon Rev. Stat. Ann. (1998 supp., part 1) \n     Sec. Sec. 23.240, -250: ``The homestead mentioned in ORS \n     23.240 shall consist, when not located in any town or city \n     laid off into blocks and lots, of any quantity of land not \n     exceeding 160 acres, and when located in any such town or \n     city, of any quantity of land not exceeding one block. \n     However, a homestead under this section shall not exceed in \n     value the sum of $25,000 or $33,000, whichever amount is \n     applicable under ORS 23.240.''\n       Rhode Island Gen. Laws Sec. 9-26-4.1 (1998 supp.): In \n     addition to exempt property, ``an estate of homestead to the \n     extent of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) in the land \n     and buildings may be acquired[.]''\n       Although several of the state provisions cited above couch \n     their exemptions in terms of acreage, in all cases, the \n     monetary cap is a limitation which qualifies the value of the \n     land permissibly exempted. With the exception of Rhode \n     Island, the state laws cited above have monetary caps \n     substantially less than the proposed federal cap of $100,000.\n       Several states, such as Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South \n     Dakota, and Texas define their homestead exemptions by \n     reference to quantities of land or acreage without a monetary \n     cap. But those states which define the exemption in terms of \n     land and value do so conjunctively, not disjunctively. Hence, \n     a federal cap of $100,000 on the value of a homestead \n     exemption would not appear to have any effect on the extant \n     state exemptions cited above.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the facts speak for themselves. Simply put, \nthe Hutchison-Brownback amendment is a bad idea, a backdoor way to \nallow rich deadbeats to continue to live as kings while their honest \ncreditors go to the poor house. I urge my colleagues to oppose it and \nto support our bipartisan $100,000 cap instead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Kohl on \nthis amendment. We have spent over 2 years now working to reform the \nabuses in bankruptcy law. Senator Kohl has served on the Judiciary \nCommittee. As we have gone through it, we have tried to eliminate a lot \nof the abuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Chair correct that the Senator is under \ntime yielded by Senator Kohl?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to eliminate abuses that are in \nthe bankruptcy system. There are many of them. We have some things in \nthis bill that are good and true and honest and fair. It says right now \nthat a person making $70,000 a year who owes $100,000, under Federal \nbankruptcy law, can go into chapter 7, wipe out all their debts, and \nstill be living with a $100,000-a-year income and not have to pay the \npeople from whom they receive benefits and to whom they owe money. We \nare saying if you have a certain level of income, then you ought to pay \na part of your debt, and you would be required by the judge to develop \na repayment plan for 30 percent, 50 percent, or 100 percent of the \nmoney, if you can pay it back. It is not just automatically wiping out \nall your debt.\n  Some have said this is abuse on the poor. But it would not affect \nanybody whose income did not fall below the median American income, \nwhich today for a family of four is $49,000. So this is for high-income \npeople, and only if you make above that can you be required to pay back \nsome of your debts. We think that is an abuse, and we think it ought to \nbe ended.\n  Another abuse--one that may be the greatest abuse in the whole \nbankruptcy system--Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard professor, said is ``the \nsingle biggest scandal in the consumer bankruptcy system.'' It is the \nunlimited homestead exemption. She said it is a scandal, and I agree. \nIt is an absolute scandal.\n\n  First of all, bankruptcy law is handled in Federal court. It is all \ndone in a Federal bankruptcy court. All the laws and all the rules are \nFederal laws. In one area, the Federal law says, for the purpose of \nbankruptcy homestead exemptions, that will be left to what the State \nlaw is. But that is a Federal law.\n  What we found is that the Bankruptcy Commission, after 3 years of \nstudy, which included judges and other experts, recommended that we \ntake this exemption to $100,000 and it be uniform across the country. \nThere is no reason, or history, or logical justification for a State \nhaving an unlimited bankruptcy exemption--a fact recognized, as the \nSenator said, by the Austin American Statesman newspaper, which said \nthis is clearly a matter of Federal law. The scholars do not dispute \nit. All other aspects of bankruptcy law are determined by the Federal \nlaw. I wanted to say that first.\n  Second, we are having serious problems and abuses--a Federal \nbankruptcy judge in Miami, FL, one of the States that has such an \nunlimited exemption, like Texas, has been very critical of this. The \ncurrent system ``is grossly unfair,'' said A. Jay Cristol, the chief \nFederal bankruptcy judge in Miami. ``This law was written to give \neveryone a fresh start after bankruptcy, not to allow people to keep \nluxury homes.''\n  How has this abuse been playing out? Here is an article in the New \nYork Times listing some of the examples of what we are talking about:\n\n       The First American Bank and Trust Company in Lake Worth, \n     FL, closed in 1989.\n\n  This is in the New York Times of last year:\n\n       . . . its chief executive, Roy Talmo, filed for personal \n     bankruptcy in 1993. Despite owing $6.8 million, Mr. Talmo was \n     able to exempt a bounty of assets.\n\n  Exempt--that means those assets could not be used to pay people to \nwhom he lawfully owed debts. It goes on:\n\n       During much of the bankruptcy proceeding, Mr. Talmo drove \n     around Miami in a 1960 Rolls Royce and tended the grounds of \n     his $800,000 tree farm. . . .\n       Never one to slum it, Mr. Talmo had a 7,000-square-foot \n     mansion with five fireplaces, 16th-century European doors and \n     a Spanish-style courtyard, all on a 30-acre lot. Yet, in Mr. \n     Talmo's estimation, this was chintzy. He also owned an \n     adjacent 112 acres, and he tried to add those acres to his \n     homestead. The court refused.\n\n\n[[Page S14484]]\n\n\n  Another example:\n\n       Talmadge Wayne Tinsley, a Dallas, TX, developer, filed for \n     chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 after he incurred $60 million in \n     debt, largely bank loans. Under Texas law, Mr. Tinsley could \n     keep only one acre of his 3.1-acre estate.\n\n  Texas recently had laws up to change that 1-acre limitation if you \nlive in a city to which you can exempt from 8 to 10 acres. At any rate, \nhe wanted to exempt more than that. He wanted the whole 3.1-acre \nestate.\n\n       His $3.5 million, magnolia-lined estate included a five-\n     bedroom, six-and-a-half-bath mansion with two studies, a pool \n     and a guest house. All that fit snugly onto one acre.\n       Yet, when the court asked Mr. Tinsley to mark off two acres \n     to be sold to pay off his debts, his facetious offer was for \n     the trustee to come by and peel off two feet around his \n     entire property.\n\n  He signed off for that debt. At any rate, he was able to sell his \nhouse for $3.5 million, and he used the proceeds of this sale, after \ndeclaring bankruptcy, to write a $659,000 check to the IRS, whose debt \nstill continues to be owed after bankruptcy, and another for $1.8 \nmillion to pay off his mortgage. That left him $700,000 after all his \nexpenses, and he could spend that on whatever he wanted to, without \npaying legitimate people to whom he owed money. That is not a fair \ndeal, I submit.\n  There are other examples of this. There is Dr. Carlos Garcia-Rivera, \nwho filed for bankruptcy protection. He lives in Florida. The State law \ngives him an unlimited deduction, and he was able to keep a $500,000 \nresidence, which is pictured in the newspaper article, free and clear.\n  The problem is this. A lot of people can see bankruptcy coming. They \ncan see the problems coming down the road. They live in a State such as \nAlabama or New Jersey, where the laws don't give them these values. In \nfact, two-thirds of all the States limit your homestead value to \n$40,000 in equity. So what do they do? They can see the bankruptcy \ncoming. They can move to a State such as Texas or Florida, buy a \nbeautiful home on the beach, take every asset they have, quit paying \nany of the people to whom they owe money, collect all their money, put \nit in that house, and then file bankruptcy and say: You can't take my \nhome. It is my homestead, and I don't have to give you anything.\n  That is a problem. That is a national problem, and it is a growing \nproblem. We have increased bankruptcies. Lawyers are more \nsophisticated. People are more willing to move today than they used to \nbe. That is why Senator Kohl and I feel so strongly about this.\n\n  I want to mention a couple more important things. The New York Times, \nin an editorial in August of 1999, argued against protecting rich \nbankrupts and criticized this very provision in law.\n  There were other complaints made in previous remarks suggesting this \nchange would require States to change their constitution or their \nexisting State law. That is not the case. The homestead exemption in \nTexas or Florida would be valid for every other State law purpose the \nState chose to apply it for. It simply would not be valid in the \nFederal bankruptcy court if that law called for an exemption to exceed \n$100,000, the amount the Bankruptcy Commission, after 3 years' study, \nconcluded was the appropriate amount. It certainly strikes me as a fair \nand legitimate amount.\n  This is not the sale price of the house but the equity in the house. \nIf an individual owned a mansion with $500,000 of equity in that \nmansion, they would not be able to live in that mansion and stop paying \ntheir creditors, the people they duly and lawfully owed money to, but \nwould be able to keep $100,000 of it. They could keep $100,000 in \nequity. They would end up better than a person who files bankruptcy in \nAlabama or most other States who have less than $100,000. We think that \nis fair, just, and appropriate and ought to be confronted. I know some \nbelieve it is somehow an advantage for a State to not have this cap, to \nhave unlimited exemptions, but I argue it hurts local creditors in \nthose States, too, because they are not being paid back their debts.\n  A man living in a mansion in downtown Dallas who is not paying his \nDallas creditors and all the people he owes in Dallas, TX, he gets to \nlive in the mansion, is not an advantage for Texas. For years, the \nTexas legislators, Members of Congress, have believed passionately they \nshould defend this as being a part of their constitution.\n  I think that is a misunderstanding of the role of Federal bankruptcy \nlaw. The goal of a good bankruptcy law is to make sure a person who \nowes debts pays all he can, liquidates all his assets, is able to keep \na reasonable home, and work in the future without having any debts, but \nthat he not be able to abuse the system and defeat creditors who he \ncould legitimately pay.\n  I enjoyed working with Senator Kohl.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Sessions.\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. \nSecond, I thank the Senator for being a very cooperative member of the \nJudiciary Committee to help Members move the bill out of committee, \nparticularly on this very issue that he has brought to the floor. He \nwas hoping to bring this up in committee. It would have been very \ndivisive in committee. It probably would have kept Members from getting \nthe bill out of committee. He cooperated fully. I said when he brought \nit to the floor I would speak for and support his amendment. I am here \nto do that. But I think it is more important I tell him and his \nconstituents who are interested in bankruptcy reform that he has been \nvery helpful through this process.\n  One of the most unfair aspects of the bankruptcy code is the ability \nof very wealthy people to shield large amounts of assets in homesteads. \nAs do many parts of our bankruptcy laws, the homestead exemption has a \nnoble purpose. I don't deny that. That noble purpose is to protect the \npoorest of the poor from being thrown out into the streets to pay \ncreditors. Everybody is entitled to a roof over their head.\n  As so many parts of our bankruptcy laws, this noble idea has been \nperverted by rich scoundrels and well-paid bankruptcy lawyers. \nObviously, we need to do something about any part of the law that lets \npeople hide money while paying nothing to their creditors.\n  We said one of the motivations of this legislation is to make sure \nthat the people who have the ability to pay who go into bankruptcy are \nnot going to get off scot-free. Allowing people to shield assets while \npaying nothing to their creditors creates perverse incentives for \nwealthy scoundrels.\n  A recent General Accounting Office study on this subject confirms the \nhomestead exemption is used by a select few to avoid paying their \nbills. Unlike other areas where Congress attempts to regulate with very \nlittle constitutional basis for doing so, the text of the Constitution \nin this instance gives Congress the authority to set uniform bankruptcy \nlaws, one of the specific powers of Congress in article I.\n  A homestead cap with a provision allowing some States to opt out and \nto have unlimited homestead will continue the unfairness of current law \nand will run counter to our constitutional mandate to have uniform \nbankruptcy laws. I support a strong cap and oppose a State opt-out. I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Our colleagues should also be aware the underlying bill deals with \nvery wealthy people in bankruptcy by pushing them in chapter 11 with \nspecial modifications designed to deal with individuals instead of \ncorporations. Allowing the super rich to live high on the hog is a more \nwidespread problem than homestead abuse.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership in this area.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Grassley.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Harkin as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent to reserve the remainder of our \nremaining time.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Brownback whose time is charged to the \nother side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S14485]]\n\n  Mr. President, I think there are a number of things that need a \nresponse. Let me first set this in the context of being from Kansas. \nKansas has in its constitution a provision allowing for the homestead \nto be protected. That homestead is defined in Kansas law as a home in \ntown on 1 acre or in the country on 160 acres. It is based on original \nFederal law. That Federal law was the Homestead Act that settled much \nof the Midwest. The Federal Government said the Federal Government \nowned this land, but if you could go out there and work those 160 acres \nand stay there for 5 years, the 160 acres was yours. That was the \nhomestead.\n  There is a sanctity about the issue of the homestead. That is why it \nwas built into our State constitution. That is why it has been so \nprotected in the past and why I rise in support of the Hutchison-\nBrownback amendment and its amendment to what Senator Kohl would do. I \nwill support the Kohl amendment if the Hutchison-Brownback amendment \npasses but not otherwise. This is an important part of our State.\n  What is being attempted by Senator Kohl and others--and I have great \nrespect for them and their desires for what they are putting forward--\nis to take a right away from States that they have had for over 100 \nyears. Bankruptcy law is in the Federal Constitution, but for over 100 \nyears they have allowed States to set that homestead provision and said \nthey would allow the States to determine the homestead issue.  Now we \nwould be taking that right that the States have had for over 100 years \nand federalizing it. That is wrong. It is contrary to the devolution of \nStates' rights. It is contrary to the Homestead Act that the Federal \nGovernment set, and it is harmful to farmers.\n\n  I used to practice agricultural law. I taught agricultural law. I \nhave written books on this subject. The homestead provision in my State \nand many others has helped save family farmers.\n  These are not cases that make the newspaper or that are quoted here \non the floor. Those, unfortunately, have happened as well. But listen \nto some of these cases that have occurred in Kansas.\n  A farm couple--the husband is age 52, and the wife is age 66--are \ncattle ranchers in eastern Kansas. They have been farming the same \nranch since 1965. In 1997, the husband was cleaning out a swine lagoon \nand received a staph infection in his eye. He lost nearly 80 percent of \nhis vision and became legally blind. At this time, his wife was also \nforced to take her mother in for health care reasons. She had to stay \nwith them. This brought on numerous hardships for the family. It forced \nthem into chapter 12 bankruptcy in December 1997. It doesn't sound very \nglitzy or a high-profile, newspaper-type case at this point.\n  Under chapter 12, they were not required to sell the homestead and \n160 acres because of that homestead provision. These were paid for. \nThey had these paid for. They were entitled to them under Kansas \nstatute and under the Kansas Constitution. If not for this exemption, \nthis family would have been forced to sell everything and would have \nbeen forced out onto the street and from their farm for which they \nworked so hard. The wife's exact words describing the homestead \nexemption were ``a godsend.''\n  After an extensive reorganization, they are rebuilding their cattle \nherd. They are still repaying debts from the bankruptcy according to \nthe reorganization. They have currently applied for a loan from Farm \nCredit to purchase more cattle and are very optimistic about the \nfuture.\n  That doesn't sound like a case that would make the newspaper.\n  This is a very practical thing that has happened throughout the \nhistory of Kansas that I can cite for you at various times. Typically, \nwhen we have the prices of farm commodities dropping and dropping \nsubstantially, farmers are caught with too much credit and too low \nprices. They will get in the squeeze, and the only thing they can save \nis the homestead. I have read abstracts of land titles across the State \nof Kansas, where this has been used time and time again, and none of \nthose make the newspaper. Yet it is a part of their being able to build \nback. In this case, and many others, it is a part of them being able to \npay their creditors in the future. This isn't about them moving to \nFlorida or to Texas to bilk this law.\n  Here is another case. I will read to you about a farming couple from \neastern Kansas. He is now 71. The wife is 55. They declared chapter 12 \nbankruptcy. They had trouble with their bank because of low commodity \nprices and many other typical struggles of a family farm. This is a \ntypical case. Their homestead-exempted property consists of 160 acres \nvalued at approximately $800 an acre, including the house and \nbuildings. With the exemption, they were able to retain all of  their \nproperty for use as equity to start farming again.\n\n  Listen to what happened. The situation 3 years later is that this \ncouple is about to pay off all of their creditors under the chapter 12 \nplan within the next few months and are now able to continue profitably \nwith their farming operation. It is a happy ending that would have \nsadly ended without this sort of homestead provision.\n  There is a lot of talk about fraud that has taken place. I want to \npoint out something in addressing this issue.\n  Currently in bankruptcy law, if there is a fraudulent transaction of \ntaking money that should go to a creditor and placing it in an exempt \nproperty, the court can come in and set that aside and get that money \nback. That is under current bankruptcy law.\n  Also, in the base bill there is a provision that if you purchase a \nhome within 2 years of bankruptcy, that can be brought back into the \ncreditor estate so that the creditors can get hold of that.\n  There is a lot already built into the bankruptcy law as it is \ncurrently practiced, and as it has been interpreted by the courts. I \nhave practiced in front of bankruptcy courts. There is also built into \nthis change that within 2 years of purchasing a homestead, you can come \nback and get those assets.\n  What about some of these high-profile cases? In many of those cases, \nI think you will find that the courts go after and later set aside the \ntransaction as a fraudulent transaction. But particularly, let's look \nat the case of Burt Reynolds, who has become kind of a poster boy in \nthis situation.\n  He has not filed under chapter 7 bankruptcy. He is not in chapter 7 \nwhere you have this homestead provision. He is in chapter 11, which is \na reorganization in bankruptcy usually reserved for corporations. But \nthere are also some higher income individuals who can qualify for \nchapter 11.\n  An amendment offered in the Judiciary Committee by Senator Grassley \nwould close this chapter 11 loophole for wealthy individuals. \nFortunately, that much needed amendment was passed during the markup \ndespite some opposition from the others.\n  Mr. President, my simple plea is on a couple of fronts.\n  No. 1, this is contrary to what this Congress has been committed to \ndo, which is devolution of power and authority to States and local \nunits of government. Here we have an area of law that has been devolved \nto the States for over 100 years, and we are going to grab it. And we \nare going to pull it up here back from the States that built it into \ntheir constitutions, such as Kansas and Texas. We are going to grab it. \nThe Federal Government is going to say this is ours. We are taking it \naway. That is completely contrary to devolution.\n  No. 2, this is very harmful to family farmers, many of whom have used \nthese homestead provisions during times of bad commodity prices--in my \nState, and in others--to protect that 160-acre homestead, which is, as \nI mentioned at the outset, the sacrosanct unit--the family farm, to be \nable to protect it.\n  No. 3, it is already taken care of if these are fraudulent \ntransactions that are occurring, that can be set aside by the \nbankruptcy judge under current law. If they were planning to go into \nbankruptcy and move those assets, they can come within 2 years and \nstill get that asset back. So this has taken care of it.\n  It is harmful to family farmers. It is against devolution. It is \nagainst States rights, and this is the wrong way for us to go. It is \ngoing to hurt a lot of family farmers who use this day in and day out \nand don't make the newspaper but are just simply trying to make a \ndecent living and they get caught in a bad commodity cycle.\n\n[[Page S14486]]\n\n  During the 1980s, I worked with a lot of family farmers who got \ncaught in a bad commodity cycle and used this homestead provision. They \ndid not make the newspaper. But today, many of them are still farming \nsimply because of the possibility of doing this, and they worked extra \nhard to pay their creditors even over and above what was required in \nbankruptcy law because they felt this is the honorable thing to do.\n  There are abuses under bankruptcy law. I would like to be able to \nsupport this bill at the end of the day. But this is not the right way \nto go for us. It is harmful for us to do this to family farmers and to \nStates.\n  I support strongly the Hutchison-Brownback amendment and hope that it \ncan be added to the Kohl amendment so that we can press forward with \nthis bankruptcy reform. Otherwise, this Senator will certainly have to \noppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. President, may I inquire as to how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Hutchison amendment has 11 minutes 46 \nseconds under the control of the Senator from Texas, and Senator Kohl \nhas 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one thing we have raised is the \nsituation of the farm person.\n  First of all, Senator Grassley has been a champion of the new \nbankruptcy laws. And we have made those permanent in this bill to give \nadded protections to farmers, unlike the kind of protections that are \ngiven a manager of a restaurant, a gas station, or a small factory that \ngoes bankrupt. They have a number of good protections.\n  But what I want to say to you is that a person who owes a lot of \ndebt, who has received legal benefits and owes money, and then goes \ninto bankruptcy, will be able to keep up to $100,000 in equity. The \nhouse can be a $500,000 house. The farm can be $1 million farm--\nwhatever. But the equity simply has to be no more than $100,000. I \nthink that is as generous as we can possibly be. I don't see how we \ncould be more generous than that. Why should a businessman, or any \nperson, be able to have unlimited assets?\n  Let me make no mistake about it, the Hutchison amendment that is \nfiled today would allow an individual in Texas or Florida to maintain a \n$50 million mansion and not pay the people they owe just debts to--$50 \nmillion in equity that they own and paid into that house, and not pay \npeople they owe. That is the kind of disparity I do not believe we can \naccept and is what the Bankruptcy Commission has rejected. That is what \nprofessors have called a national scandal.\n  I have been pleased to work on this because I believe we owe it to \nthe working Americans who go through bankruptcy, who will never ever \nhave the possibility of claiming these kinds of great equities and do \nnot live in mansions--I don't see why we need to be providing special \nprotections for the rich in these circumstances. It is time to end this \nprocess. It is time for Congress to act.\n  I yield back my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to be notified in 5 \nminutes because I have two other speakers who have asked for time. I \nknow we are running the clock down now.\n  Let me just refute a couple of the points that have been made. First \nof all, for over 100 years in this country, States have been able to \ndetermine what the homestead exemption would be. In some States a \nhomestead would be valued at $15,000 while in other States it might be \n$215,000. California and Florida have higher valuations on homesteads. \nSo I think a one-size-fits-all approach is not in anyone's best \ninterests.\n  The Senator from Alabama, who is my friend, talks about a $50 million \nmansion. I do not know of anyone who has a $50 million mansion on one \nacre of land, because the standard in Texas happens to be on the number \nof acres rather than on valuations. That was put in our Constitution.\n  This would be overriding our Constitution. It would override the \nKansas Constitution. There are other States that believe so strongly in \nthe right of a person to be able to keep a homestead for children or \nfor an elderly person that they do not put in a dollar valuation, they \nput in an acreage valuation. In Texas, it is one acre. That is for \nurban homesteads. I think you can talk about a $50 million mansion, but \nthat is not reality here.\n  What I think we ought to do, when we are making policy that is this \nimportant, is say: How much damage are we going to do to people who are \ntrying to restructure their lives in order to get a few people who may \nabuse the system? We have had GAO studies, we have had all kinds of \nstudies, that have showed that maybe 1 percent of the people are not \ndoing right by the system. But we have taken one important step to stop \nthat abuse, which will apply in this bill if it is passed, and that is \nthat you cannot declare a homestead exemption on a home that is bought \nwithin 2 years of declaring bankruptcy.\n  So the idea is if someone is going to leave all their debts in \nFlorida and move to Alabama to buy a house and claim bankruptcy, there \nare safeguards against that by requiring that the person live there 2 \nyears before they can declare bankruptcy. So they cannot flee \nbankruptcy to go buy a homestead and be protected. And, second, the \nbankruptcy laws today and in the new law always provide for fraud, that \nyou can go after someone who has fraudulently transferred assets. I do \nthink we have fraud addressed in this bill.\n  We get down, though, to the bottom line. That is, this has been a \nStates rights issue for 132 years. People in Alabama may do it \ndifferently from people in Florida. People in Wisconsin may do it \ndifferently from the way they do it in Texas. What is wrong with that? \nWhat is wrong with people in Idaho having the ability to set their own \nstandards for homestead exemptions? What is wrong with a rural-\ndominated State having a different standard from an urban-dominated \nState? This country was formed with the thought that States would have \nthe right to make State laws where they are closest to the people. Only \na very few laws are made at the Federal level. I think that is a good \nstandard. I think it is good the Federal Government has allowed the \nStates, for over 132 years, to set homestead exemptions.\n  I hope we will keep that 132-year precedent. I think it has worked. I \nwould love to support this bill. I want debtors to have to pay the \npeople they owe. I have been in a small business, and I have had people \nstiff me. I know what it is. I know what it is to have to pay my \nworkers regardless of the fact that I am not being paid by people to \nwhom I have supplied products.\n  I will not support this bill unless we allow the States the right to \nhave the homestead exemption be set State by State. I want to tighten \nup the laws. I think that is the right thing to do. But we do not have \nto preempt the States rights in this area. I think it will be a better \nbill if we do not.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I inquire of the Senator from Texas if I could have \njust 2 minutes to explain an item that has been coming up in this \ndebate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how many minutes remain on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wanted to point out two things. No. \n1, there is a recent study of U.S. bankruptcy filings by the Executive \nOffice of the United States Trustees. The Trustees are the people who \nactually do the bankruptcies. They are the ones who handle the \nfinancial transactions. They concluded that the homestead abuse is--and \nthis is their quote--``a rare phenomenon.'' That was a quote from the \nUnited States Trustees, Executive Office of the United States Trustees.\n  The second point I wanted to make is, my State of Kansas has a \nhomestead provision under the State constitution that dates back to \n1859. Kansans have\n\n[[Page S14487]]\n\nused this for a long time. However, in the U.S. bankruptcy code, many \nsmall family farmers would not qualify for what is defined as a family \nfarmer because they or their spouse have earned off-farm income. \nBecause of that, under this particular provision, in farming States \nsuch as mine with similar homestead provisions, they would be impacted \nbecause they would not be able to qualify there. I want to make the \npoint, that adds doubly to the difficulty we have here.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me inquire of the Senator from \nWisconsin if he is ready to finish. I will go ahead and close out the \ndebate if we are ready to close earlier. What was his intention?\n  Mr. KOHL. I say to the Senator from Texas, we have, I think, 5 \nminutes. I will not use all of it. If the Senator wants to conclude, I \nwill speak for a couple of minutes, Senator Sessions for 1 minute, and \nthen we are finished. If the Senator would like to go first.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would it be possible for the Senator to let me have 2 \nminutes, perhaps, toward the end, in case Senator Graham of Florida and \nSenator Grams from Minnesota, who have both requested time, arrive? We \nare getting down to the end, so I do not want to foreclose them if they \ndo show. If they do not, I think we should go forward.\n  Mr. KOHL. I will be happy to wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator requesting an additional 2 \nminutes at the end reserved from her time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. I am only saying I will stop 2 minutes ahead in \norder to reserve that time for the Senator from Florida or the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. If they are not able to come, then I think we should \nclose the debate because Members are waiting to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator when 2 \nminutes remain.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say, the Governors of our \ncountry have written a very powerful letter saying: Do not do this. Do \nnot set a Federal standard for homestead exemptions. The Governors \nwrote very clearly:\n       We urge you to resist efforts to impose a uniform \n     nationwide cap on homestead exemptions. The ability to \n     determine their homestead exemptions has been a longstanding \n     authority of States. Furthermore, the median price of a \n     single family home varies from State to State.\n\n  This is not something that should be a Federal approach. It has not \nbeen a Federal approach. Every Governor in our country is saying: Let \nus handle it.\n  If the people of Wisconsin do not like the way they handle it in \nTexas, that does not hurt the people of Wisconsin. That should be a \ndecision made at the local level based on local value, local \ntraditions, and local law.\n  Secondly, the National Conference of State Legislatures has written a \nletter along the same lines saying they are concerned that setting a \nlaw that would preempt State laws on homestead exemptions would not be \nin the best interest of the American people.\n  I hope our Members will not break 130 years of precedent in this \ncountry to set yet another one-size-fits-all Federal solution. This is \nsomething very important to States, so important that some States have \nput it in their constitutions, and today voting against the Hutchison \namendment for the Kohl-Sessions amendment will most certainly damage \nour ability to let the States make these determinations.\n  Senator Brownback, Senator Graham of Florida, and Senator Rod Grams \nfrom Minnesota are cosponsors of this amendment. Many people are very \nconcerned about this 130 years of precedent being overturned.\n  I yield 2 minutes to Senator Grams.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and also the \nSenator from Kansas for their work on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the bankruptcy \nhomestead cap proposed as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I \nappreciate the fact that the sponsors of this amendment are attempting \nto curb abuse of the system, but I fear that in these difficult times \nfor family farmers the homestead cap amendment could disproportionately \nimpact struggling producers.\n  I will remind my colleagues that the Senate recently unanimously \napproved extension of chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, which in part \nallows farmers to stay on their land if they are able to make rental \npayments to creditors. Just as farmers have needed extension of chapter \n12 to weather the current economic downturn, they also need an adequate \nbankruptcy homestead exemption that will protect their homes and \nlivelihoods from foreclosure as well.\n  I am aware that the Sessions/Kohl amendment exempts ``family \nfarmers'' from the homestead provision, but many farmers will not \nqualify because of off-farm income earned by the family. This off-farm \nincome has become necessary for survival for may farm families, and as \nlong as such families are not eligible for the exclusion, I must oppose \nthe amendment.\n  As the Senator from Texas mentioned, in Minnesota, the current \nhomestead exemption is $200,000 property value and 160 acres. This is a \nreasonable, time-tested level of protection. We must remember that this \nproperty is not merely where the farmers make their home, but also \nwhere they earn their living. Congress recently passed $8.7 billion in \nemergency farm assistance to help family farmers continue the tradition \nof producing America's most basic needs, and we should not \nsimultaneously undermine the position of these same farm families by \ndenying them important bankruptcy protections.\n  Again, I know that the amendment sponsors are trying to stop abuse of \nthe system by those who have irresponsibly accumulated debt, but I am \nafraid many hard working Minnesota farmer who are barely covering their \nfamilies necessities may be adversely impacted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Brownback amendment \nallowing states to affirmatively opt out of the cap on the homestead \nexemption.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I do not think we should be misled by the \nHutchison-Brownback amendment that it will save the family farm. No one \nhas done more for family farmers, as we all know, than Senator Grassley \nand Senator Harkin, and they are supportive and cosponsors of our \namendment.\n  Our amendment does have a specific exemption for farmers in each \nState so that the family farmer, whether they come from Texas, Iowa, or \nWisconsin, can be specifically dealt with in that State in the event of \na bankruptcy.\n  If we are serious about reform, now is the time to stop the most \negregious abuse of our bankruptcy laws--by capping the homestead \nexemption and supporting the Kohl-Sessions-Grassley amendment. But \ndon't take my word for it. Listen to voices from across the country.\n  For example, the New York Times recently editorialized that: ``Like a \nbill that passed the House, [the Senate bill] would do nothing to limit \nthe ways that the formerly wealthy have of stiffing creditors, of which \nthe unlimited homestead exemption is only the best known. . . . [If the \nbill] is to be passed, it should at least be amended to keep Texas and \nFlorida from providing such blatant protection to once-wealthy \ndeadbeats.''\n  Of course, the New York Times may not be the most unbiased source. So \nI took a look at my home state paper, the Wisconsin State Journal. That \nnewspaper says the same thing. According to its recent editorial, the \nHouse and Senate bankruptcy bills: ``deserve criticism for what they \nfail to include. Neither bill took a step toward closing the loophole \nthat allows bankrupt' wealthy to shelter assets in an expensive home. \nIrresponsible but shrewd debtors sneak assets through bankruptcy via a \nprovision permitting them to take advantage of state homestead \nexemptions.'' It adds that our $100,000 cap is a ``sound'' measure.\n  Finally, even leading papers from Texas and Florida--the two states \nmost invested in this issue--find the case for reigning in the \nunlimited homestead exemption compelling. In an editorial earlier this \nyear, the Austin American-Statesman praised the recent GAO report for \npointing out\n\n[[Page S14488]]\n\nthat the unlimited homestead exemption: ``[p]rimarily . . . is the \nrefuge of a few high-living debtors, not the schoolteachers and small \nfarmers it was intended to protect.''\n  The Austin newspaper went on to dismiss appeals to states' rights as \na false defense for the unlimited exemption, explaining that: ``The \nU.S. Constitution gives the federal government supremacy over the \nstates in bankruptcy matters, so arguments that the federal government \nshould let states do as they wish on this particular facet of \nbankruptcy law makes little sense.''\n  Indeed, even this Texas opinion-maker is supportive of reform, \ndeclaring that: ``State officials in Austin and Washington should be at \nleast willing to discuss limiting homestead protection. A few well-\nheeled and clever bankruptcy filers shouldn't be able to mess over a \nstate law designed to protect average Texans. That mocks the state's \nmuch-celebrated populist image.''\n  And the Tampa Tribune echoed these sentiments, complaining that the \nSenate bill does not go ``far enough toward closing the loophole that \nallows debtors unlimited homestead exemptions that protect the \nwealthiest from having to repay a significant portion of their debt.''\n  Everyone recognizes that this abuse must be stopped, including \nleading papers from the two states that traditionally have stood by the \nunlimited exemption. I ask unanimous consent that these editorials be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nExhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, indeed, even Senator Grassley and Senator \nHarkin, who have cosponsored our $100,000 cap, also recognize that we \nare in the right, even though their home state of Iowa is one of the \nfew states with an unlimited exemption.\n  Let me make one final point: some opt-out supporters, especially \nthose from Texas, cite history as a justification for their position. \nBut just because something has historical ``significance'' doesn't mean \nit's right. For example, we don't have debtors' prison anymore. We \ndon't have sweatshops for children anymore. And Texas, as a matter of \nfact, is no longer part of Mexico. All of these changes altered \nsomething of ``historical significance;'' all were for the better. And \ngetting rid of the unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy would \nalso be a change--a dramatic change--for the better.\n  Mr. President, you can't support our cap and also support an opt-out: \nIt's one or the other. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Hutchison/\nBrownback amendment and to support our bipartisan $100,000 cap instead.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 13, 1999]\n\n                       Protecting Rich Bankrupts\n\n       If you are going to go bankrupt in America, the best places \n     to do it are in Florida and Texas. Both states have unlimited \n     homestead exemptions, meaning that bankrupts can protect \n     their homes from creditors no matter how much they are worth.\n       Now, with the little public debate, Texas is on the verge \n     of making its bankruptcy protections even more generous. \n     Currently a bankrupt person can shelter from creditors a home \n     and no more than one acre of land in an urban area. But a \n     proposed amendment to the Texas Constitution would raise that \n     limit to 10 acres. The limit would remain at 200 acres in \n     rural areas.\n       Even more generously, the amendment, which has passed the \n     Texas legislature and goes to the voters in November, \n     provides that if you operate your business from your home, \n     the business property is also protected. Advocates say that \n     would protect small family businesses, but it is written so \n     broadly that it could allow a Houston property developer to \n     shelter a huge office building, so long as he lived in an \n     apartment in it.\n       In Washington, the Senate is expected to consider a \n     bankruptcy reform bill next month. Like a bill that passed \n     the House, it would do nothing to limit the ways that the \n     formerly wealthy have of stiffing creditors, of which the \n     unlimited homestead exemptions is only the best known. But \n     the bill would be a boon to the credit card companies, which \n     have pushed hard to get it enacted. It would help them by \n     making it much harder for bankrupts to get our from under \n     credit card debt. That would primarily affect middle-income \n     and poor people forced into bankruptcy by a job loss or large \n     medical bills.\n       The bill deserves to be defeated, but if it is to be \n     passed, it should be at least be amended to keep Texas and \n     Florida from providing such blatant protection to once-\n     wealthy deadbeats.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Wisconsin State Journal, Sept. 7, 1999]\n\n                       Bankruptcy Bill Needs Work\n\n       If credit card issuers want to protect themselves from \n     deadbeats, let them do it with sound lending practices--not \n     by rigging federal bankruptcy law in their favor. It's time \n     for Congress to stop letting the credit card industry call \n     the shots on legislation to reform federal bankruptcy law.\n       It's time instead to listen to a couple of guys from \n     Wisconsin: Senator Herb Kohl, sponsor of an amendment to the \n     reform bill that would close an outrageous loophole, and \n     Madison lawyer Brady Williamson, chairman of the National \n     Bankruptcy Review Commission, which spent two years studying \n     the state of bankruptcy.\n       Unless Congress pays attention to Kohl, Williamson and \n     others who speak up for balance in bankruptcy law, Americans \n     are going to get a law tilted to give the credit card \n     industry carte blanche.\n       The House already has passed such a proposal, and the \n     Senate is to consider its version this month.\n       The campaign to reform bankruptcy law is based on evidence \n     showing that the number of people filing for protection from \n     creditors under bankruptcy law has been skyrocketing, despite \n     a strong economy. In 1981 about 300,000 consumers filed \n     petitions for bankruptcy. Last year the total was 1.4 \n     million.\n       Furthermore, there is evidence that a few people are \n     abusing the law to escape debts while they live it up on \n     wealth protected from creditors' reach.\n       In response, Congress began work on bankruptcy reform \n     legislation. For guidance, the House and Senate had before \n     them 172 recommendations from the National Bankruptcy Review \n     Commission, led by Madison's Williamson. But the senators and \n     representatives were also heavily influenced by the lobbying \n     of the credit card industry.\n       The industry's goal was selfish. The banks and retailers \n     that  issue credit cards make money when their card holders \n     run up large balances and pay the cards' high interest \n     rates. That's why the card issuers try to put their cards \n     in the hands of as many people as possible, even people \n     who are poor credit risks.\n       But there's a consequence for credit card issuers: \n     Sometimes people file for bankruptcy protection, and their \n     debts are reduced or discharged.\n       The credit card industry wants to escape that consequence. \n     Card issuers want to design the law to keep people out of \n     bankruptcy court, so the debts can be collected and, \n     moreover, so the issuers can escape the expense of being \n     careful about whom they issue cards to.\n       To satisfy the credit industry, the House and Senate \n     included in their bills provisions to make it harder for \n     people to file under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy law, which \n     basically allows a filer to wipe away debts and start fresh, \n     or harder to file for bankruptcy at all.\n       By caving in to the credit card industry, the Senate and \n     House violated a principle of bankruptcy law that Williamson \n     of the Bankruptcy Review Commission has championed: Balance. \n     The law must work for creditors and debtors. It should not \n     become a creditors' collection aid.\n       For including the pet provisions of the credit card \n     industry, the House and Senate bills deserve rebuke. But the \n     bills also deserve criticism for what they fail to include. \n     Neither bill took a step toward closing the loophole that \n     allows the ``bankrupt'' wealthy to shelter assets in an \n     expensive home.\n       Irresponsible but shrewd debtors sneak assets through \n     bankruptcy via a provision permitting them to take advantage \n     of state homestead exemptions. Wisconsin's homestead \n     exemption is a modest $40,000. But five states--Texas, \n     Florida, Iowa, Kansas and South Dakota--have unlimited \n     exemptions. That's how actor Burt Reynolds, former Major \n     League Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and others have held \n     on to luxurious homes while leaving millions in unpaid bills.\n       Sen. Kohl, D-Wis., has offered an amendment to limit \n     homestead exemptions to $100,000. The amendment allows states \n     to offer an exception for family farms.\n       Kohl's provision is sound. The Senate ought to take its \n     bankruptcy bill back to the drawing board, incorporate the \n     homestead exemption limit and revise other provisions until \n     the result is balanced between the interests of creditors and \n     debtors.\n       If credit card issuers want to protect themselves, let them \n     do it with sound lending practices, not by rigging the law in \n     their favor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Austin American-Statesman, July 25, 1999]\n\n               Homestead Protection Popular, Not Populist\n\n       When it comes to their homesteads, don't mess with Texans.\n       Texas congressional leaders vigorously oppose federal \n     attempts to limit an unusual state law that prevents debtors \n     from losing the equity in their homes in bankruptcy \n     proceedings.\n       Texas is one of five states that offers unlimited homestead \n     protection to the bankrupt. The century-old constitutional \n     exemption reflects Texas' historic support of private \n     property rights and its populist past.\n\n[[Page S14489]]\n\n       But a recent federal study by the federal General \n     Accounting Office indicates that the exemption is more \n     popular than populist. Primarily it is the refuge of a few \n     high-living debtors, not the schooteachers and small farmers \n     it was intended to protect.\n       Texas political leaders need to heed the report and \n     consider some limits.\n       Last year, the Task Force congressional delegation helped \n     defeat a $100,000 limit on the home equity (market value \n     minus mortgage debt) that could be sheltered during \n     bankruptcy. A uniform limit, of $100,000, is being proposed \n     in the U.S. Senate. Such a limit would adequately protect all \n     but a tiny percentage of Texas debtors.\n       Of the approximately 14,000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases \n     closed in the Northern District of Texas in 1998, about half \n     involved a homestead exemption claim, GAO found. But only 83 \n     of those claims, or just over 1 percent, involved more than \n     $100,000 in home equity.\n       Texas' unlimited protection is subject to abuses, such as \n     the case of a bankruptcy attorney who protected $386,000 in \n     homestead assets while seeking to escape $1.5 million in \n     debts. Some debtors who plan to file for bankruptcy \n     preemptively shield assets from seizure by investing in an \n     expensive home.\n       While even the bankrupt need and deserve a roof over their \n     heads, gross abuses of the bankruptcy system shouldn't be \n     tolerated. Besides the unfairness, overly generous state laws \n     threaten lenders, who then raise lending rates for other \n     consumers.\n       The U.S. Constitution gives the federal government \n     supremacy over the state in bankruptcy matters, so arguments \n     that the federal government should let states do as they wish \n     on this particular facet of bankruptcy law make little sense.\n       Congress has long declared reform of federal bankruptcy \n     laws, which debt-happy consumers have been using in large \n     numbers. American consumer debt totals more than $1 trillion, \n     according to the Federal Reserve. And uncollected debt is \n     rising.\n       Consumer advocates have criticized bankruptcy reform \n     legislation for being skewed in favor of creditors and high-\n     rolling debtors.\n       Though he supports the state exemption for homesteads, Sen. \n     Phil Gramm, R-Texas, says it should be modernized to prevent \n     abuses. ``I do not support allowing people to go by real \n     estate office to buy a $7 million house before they go by the \n     law office to declare bankruptcy,'' he said in an interview \n     with the American-Statesman last week.\n       Gramm says one solution would be to allow the exemption \n     only if the home purchase preceded the bankruptcy filing by a \n     certain length of time.\n       The state's homestead protection law has bipartisan \n     support, from Gov. George W. Bush to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson \n     Lee, D-Houston.\n       State officials in Austin and Washington should at least be \n     willing to discuss limiting homestead protection. A few well-\n     heeled and clever bankruptcy filers shouldn't be able to mess \n     over a state law designed to protect average Texans.\n       That mocks the state's much celebrated populist image.\n\n                 [From the Tampa Tribune, July 6, 1999]\n\n   Congress is on the Right Track in Acting to Reform Bankruptcy Law\n\n       Even during the unprecedented economic good times of the \n     past year, some 1.39 million individuals and 44,000 \n     businesses have sought protection from creditors in federal \n     bankruptcy courts--more than ever before. The majority of \n     these debtors, faced with medical emergencies or other \n     crisis, had no other choice. Others, however, used the system \n     to escape debts they knowingly built up, costing the average \n     family $550 a year and American companies billions.\n       That's why it is time to reform the nation's bankruptcy \n     laws and return the concepts of fairness and responsibility \n     to the system. Last year, with elections looming, Congress \n     failed to reach an agreement. This year, however, it looks \n     like Congress will finally act, potentially by a veto-proof \n     margin. The House passed its version of reform in May, and \n     the Senate is scheduled to take up its bill this month. There \n     is bipartisan support among the senators for reform, and \n     compromise with the House is likely to result in new law. \n     That is good news for all of us.\n       Those supporting reform include retailers, banks and other \n     lenders, as well as many responsible consumers sick of having \n     to pick up the tab for those who default on their debts. \n     Those opposed include some in the bankruptcy bar, who contend \n     the legislation favors big business at the expense of \n     consumers who truly need help, and consumer groups, which \n     blame the ease with which consumers receive credit for \n     increased bankruptcy filings.\n       Much has been written and said about who is to blame for \n     this ``bankruptcy crisis.'' Consumer groups blame banks, \n     credit card companies and retailers who tempt borrowers to \n     live beyond their means. Indeed most Americans, whether they \n     can afford credit cards or not, know what it's like to open a \n     mailbox filled with applications guaranteeing lines of \n     credit.\n       ``Credit-card issuers are shameless to lobby for personal \n     bankruptcy restrictions while they aggressively market and \n     extend credit,'' says Stephen Brobeck, the Consumer \n     Federation's executive director.\n       But access to credit has not been altogether bad. For \n     decades the federal government has encouraged industry to \n     make credit and financial services available to a broader \n     segment of society. As a result, strapped Americans have been \n     able to buy what they need when they need it. It has allowed \n     for emergency purchases and long-term investments. Ultimately \n     it has benefited the American economy.\n       But the benefits of credit are not free, and that is what \n     Congress has recognized in pushing reform of the bankruptcy \n     system.\n       Consumers share the blame. Filings are up in part because \n     bankruptcy no longer carries with it a sense of shame, and \n     debtors have failed to act fiscally responsible. Too many of \n     these debtors equate plastic with money-in-hand. They use one \n     credit card to pay off another or play a continuing and \n     sloppy game with balance transfers, all the while watching \n     their debts increase. For them, walking away from their \n     responsibilities is an easy answer.\n       The parallel bills making their way through Congress would \n     make it harder for debtors to escape scot-free. Both \n     encourage personal responsibility by requiring those who are \n     able to pay their debts to do so. At the same time no \n     suggested changes are so drastic as to crush hard-working \n     debtors who have had a run of bad luck.\n       The most controversial part of the House bill would block \n     most middle- and upper-in-come debtors from using the \n     bankruptcy courts to walk away from their debts. Those with \n     annual family incomes above $51,000 who have the resources to \n     pay at least 20 percent of what they owe over five years \n     would be prohibited from wiping the slate clean. This means \n     they would have to restructure their debts under Chapter 13 \n     of the bankruptcy code rather than the more lenient Chapter \n     7, which erases debts.\n       Significantly, the bill allows bankruptcy judges to take \n     into account a debtor's account a debtor's ``extraordinary \n     circumstances,'' such as a decline in income or unexpected \n     medical expenses, before making the decision to shift a \n     debtor into Chapter 13.\n       Nevertheless, opponents say the provision is unfair because \n     the debtor has the burden of proving those circumstances \n     exist. In our view that is not unfair. The debtor is the one \n     receiving the benefit of the bankruptcy.\n       The Senate bill is less stringent and would give greater \n     discretion in the matter to the bankruptcy judge, who would \n     have to consider a debtor's ability to repay his debts. The \n     Senate's version requires only a showing of ``special \n     circumstances'' for a debtor to avoid a transfer to Chapter \n     13.\n       Both bills recognize the obligation of a parent to pay \n     child support. Both make sure a debtor cannot put off \n     collection efforts or delay making child support payments \n     simply by filing for bankruptcy. And child support payments \n     have been made a top priority when determining which debts \n     will be paid first.\n       Unfortunately, neither bill goes far enough toward closing \n     the loophole that allows debtors unlimited homestead \n     exemptions that protect the wealthiest from having to repay a \n     significant portion of their debt. Last year's Senate bill \n     would have made it impossible for states to let a bankrupt \n     person keep more than $100,000 equity in a home, which would \n     certainly hurt a lot of debtors who headed to Florida to live \n     in their multimillion-dollar mansions.\n       But the conference committees threw out the provision and \n     instead said simply that states could let a bankrupt person \n     retain any house owned for at least two years before filing, \n     no matter what its value. Both 1999 versions retain this \n     language. We would prefer Congress cap the amount of equity a \n     debtor can retain in a home.\n       In a consumer-friendly mode, House lawmakers adopted an \n     amendment requiring credit-card companies to clearly disclose \n     their fees for late payments and how long it would take \n     customers to pay off balances when they make only minimum \n     monthly payments. The House would also require companies to \n     clearly reveal the expiration dates of introductory ``teaser \n     rates'' and the higher interest rates replacing them.\n       Although we have only mentioned some of the proposed \n     changes, the basic thrust of the legislation in both the \n     House and Senate is the same--requiring at least some \n     repayment by those who have the ability to pay. The \n     differences in the two measures are not beyond compromise, \n     and either approach would be an improvement over current law.\n       As we said last year, the goal of the bankruptcy system is \n     to match bankruptcy relief to debtor need. Chapter 13 \n     repayment plans accomplish this objective and restore \n     personal responsibility to the system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL.

According to the Washington Post, \n``Homestead exemptions aid well-off feud'':\n\n       Findings suggest the unlimited homestead exemption is not \n     the popular shield it has often been cracked up to be but a \n     convenient protection for a few affluent people.\n\n  Judge Edith Jones on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from Texas \nsaid recently as a member of the Bankruptcy Commission:\n\n\n[[Page S14490]]\n\n\n       I agree with cap supporters that debtors have used liberal \n     homestead laws, like that of my home State Texas, to shelter \n     large amounts of wealth from their creditors.\n\n  She went on to add:\n\n       In principle, I do not oppose a $100,000 cap on homestead \n     exemptions, particularly if it were indexed to account for \n     inflation.\n\n  This will be indexed, and I think Judge Jones is correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been said that the core issues in \npolitics are: Who wins, who loses, and who decides. Historically, the \ndecision as to the level of exemption of a person's homestead has been \nset by the States.\n  In my State, it has been set in a constitutional amendment which \nrequired a vote of a majority of the citizens of Florida. I believe \nthat is where the decision should continue to rest.\n  The amendment that is being offered by the Senator from Texas, and \nher supporters, would provide for the States to continue to exercise \nthat authority, by making an affirmative election to opt out of the \narbitrary $100,000 limit which is being proposed by the advocates of \nthe underlying amendment.\n  I urge adoption of the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is recognized to offer an \namendment relative to agriculture, and there are 4 hours of debate \nprovided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is--let me see if I \nget this right--that we are in the process of trying to work out some \nkind of arrangement which may work better for colleagues in terms of \ntheir schedules, in which case soon we would start on this debate. We \nmight very well finish up when we come back with a final vote.\n  If that is the case, I would agree to Senator Ashcroft speaking now \nfor 7 minutes while we are working out this agreement; with the \nunderstanding that after Senator Ashcroft speaks for 7 minutes, then \nthe pending business would be this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Reserving the right to object, and when people \nunderstand what we are up to, there will not be any objection. We have \na unanimous consent request on the managers' amendment that will take \n30 seconds. I would like to get that out of the way.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wellstone \namendment be set aside for purposes of this managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized to offer his amendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2515, As Modified\n\n (Purpose: To make technical and conforming amendments, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will be somewhat repetitive of what \nSenator Reid has said, but I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside, and that the Senate now proceed to amendment \nNo. 2515, and following the reporting by the clerk, the amendment be \nmodified with the text I now send to the desk, and that the amendment \nbe agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n\n[[Page S14491]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the amendment is agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.\n  The amendment (No. 2515), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Reed-\nSessions amendment to the manager's amendment to S. 625, the bankruptcy \nreform legislation we have been considering over the past few days. I \nurge my colleagues to support the passage of this important amendment.\n  The Reed-Sessions amendment deals with the reaffirmation of one's \ndebt, and it reflects a compromise that has been worked out at length \nbetween myself, Senator Sessions, the Treasury Department and \nconsumers. I believe it is a fair and balanced amendment that seeks to \ntreat those who enter into reaffirmation agreements with their \ncreditors in a fair and just manner, and to provide them--as well as \nthe bankruptcy courts--with the greatest amount of information they \nneed in order to make the wisest decisions possible.\n  For those of my colleagues unfamiliar with these agreements, a \nreaffirmation is an agreement between a debtor and a creditor in which \nthe debtor reaffirms his or her debt and willingness to pay the \ncreditor back, even after many of the other debts may have been \ndischarged during bankruptcy. The creditor must then file this \nreaffirmation agreement with the bankruptcy court. The court then has \nthe opportunity to review this agreement, but in most cases, for one \nreason or another, does not.\n  Recently, there have been some documented cases in which creditors \nhave used coercive and abusive tactics with consumers in order to \npersuade them to reaffirm their debt, when in many of these cases there \nis no question that the individual can in no way afford to do so. The \nmost visible of these cases occurred with Sears, in which the company \ndid not even file these reaffirmation agreements with the court, \ntherefore negating even the option of the court to review these cases.\n  The Reed-Sessions amendment would essentially provide for clear and \nconcise disclosures when a debtor chooses to enter into a reaffirmation \nagreement with a creditor. Our amendment would create a uniform \ndisclosure form, whereby everyone who is filing a\n\n[[Page S14496]]\n\nreaffirmation agreement must fill this form out. Based on the \ninformation provided on the form, certain situations will then obligate \nthe court to review such agreements in order to determine if the \nreaffirmation agreement is truly within the debtor's best interests.\n  In constructing this compromise amendment, I think we have achieved \nsome very important goals. First and foremost, we want everyone to \nrecognize that a reaffirmation agreement is a very weighty decision, \nand that the individual needs to understand--whether they are \nrepresented by counsel or not--all the ramifications of the agreement \ninto which he or she is entering. In fact, the individual needs to \nunderstand that they in no way need to file a reaffirmation agreement.\n  Another vital issue is to have the court review such cases in which \nthe debtor wants to reaffirm his or her debt, but in calculating the \ndifference between the person's income and all their monthly expenses, \nit remains impossible for the debtor to do so. In other words, there \nexists a presumption of undue hardship upon the person. It is at that \npoint that we want the court to have the ability to step in and say to \nthis person, that either they have the ability to repay some of this \ndebt because of other sources of funds--such as a gift from the \nfamily--or that they do not, and therefore the reaffirmation cannot be \napproved by the court.\n  Without this amendment, we are concerned that the abuses in the \nreaffirmation system that we have seen will continue to occur, and the \ncourts may continue to be left in the dark with respect to the \nexistence of these agreements, let alone have the option to review \nthem. This amendment is not perfect, and if given the choice, I \nprobably would have preferred to go even further than we have in our \nlanguage. With that said, I think it's still important to note that \nwith this amendment, we have given our courts and consumers the \nappropriate tools that will provide them with the necessary information \nto make decisions that are in the individual's best interests, not the \ncreditor's. That is a crucial point that I wanted to emphasize.\n  I appreciate all the efforts of those involved in the process that \nwent into constructing this compromise amendment, and I am confident \nthat it strengthens the hands of our courts, and more importantly, the \nminds of our consumers as they make decisions that will weigh upon them \nfor the rest of their lives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The debate time on that \nwould be----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Five minutes on our side and 5 minutes on the other \nside.\n  Mr. REID. Following the disposition and a vote on the Dodd amendment, \nSenator Wellstone, who has been waiting all week to offer his \namendment, would get the floor to which he is now entitled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the present time, there is a unanimous \nconsent agreement for the Senator from Missouri to speak for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Objection. I object, and I do so, Mr. President, on the \nbasis of----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was already agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. No, it wasn't.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am afraid it was. Senator Ashcroft has 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK, the Senator from Missouri.\n  Following that, is Senator Dodd going to be recognized? Has the \nunanimous consent request been accepted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has not been an agreement to that \neffect. The Chair will entertain one.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would object. The only thing I agreed to is Senator \nAschroft being allowed to speak for 7 minutes; then I retain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to talk \nabout one of Missouri's most important natural resources, and that is \nthe Missouri River. There is a bill that another Member is trying to \npass by unanimous consent that would threaten the Missouri River. I am \nmaking it clear that I have an objection to this bill, and I am firm on \nthis issue.\n  On Friday around 4 p.m., 52 bills were hot-lined to be passed by \nunanimous consent in the Senate. Most of the time, Members pass bills \nby unanimous consent that are noncontroversial. However, buried in this \nlist of 52 bills was one that I am opposed to, S. 623, the Dakota Water \nResources Act. I am opposed to it because it would divert a substantial \namount of water out of the Missouri River. The bill that I am objecting \nto authorizes $200 million to divert additional water from the Missouri \nRiver system to the Cheyenne River and the Red River systems. This is \nan inter-basin transfer of water which could have substantial impacts \nall along the Missouri River basin. I do not blame the North Dakota \nSenators for fighting for this, but it hurts my State and it hurts \nother States, and I cannot consent to its approval by unanimous \nconsent. Apparently, this bill has broad opposition by many different \nparties along the Missouri River. It is a very controversial provision \nand should not be passed in the dead of night on a consent calendar \nwith a lot of noncontroversial bills.\n  This is opposed strongly by the Governor and the Department of \nNatural Resources in Missouri. It is opposed by Taxpayers for Common \nSense. It is opposed by a host of environmental groups--including the \nNational Wildlife Federation, the National Audubon Society, Friends of \nthe Earth, and American Rivers. The Canadian Government opposes this \nbill and has opposed the program it authorizes for decades, claiming \nthat it violates a 1909 United States-Canada Boundary Waters Treaty. \nThe Governor of Minnesota opposes this measure. The Minnesota State \nDepartment of Natural Resources opposes it, and the list goes on.\n  It is too early in the process for me to clear this bill. There are \ntoo many questions that remain to be answered. There are too many \nrelated issues that the States are negotiating at this time. We are \nawaiting the recommendations of the Corps of Engineers on how much \nadditional water they intend to reserve for Dakota purposes. The senior \nSenator from Missouri and I will continue to object. As a result of our \nobjections, the sponsor of the bill is holding up 51 other unrelated \nbills.\n  Let me be clear. These 51 holds are not related to the longstanding \ndispute between North Dakota and Missouri and many other parties over \nthe water allocation in the Missouri River. Therefore, Senator Bond and \nI will not be pressured into lifting our hold on a bill that will harm \nthe livelihood of the people of Missouri. These types of interstate \nriver disputes that have been going on for years simply should not be \nresolved without all interested parties involved and without adequate \nconsideration given to the ecological and commercial effects.\n  From the farm to the factory, the Missouri River creates jobs in the \nMidwest. The Missouri River is a stable water supply and a source of \nhydro power for major cities. We must be very cautious about changing \nwater levels along the Missouri River in order to maintain the \nrecreational opportunities for local communities, as well as hatcheries \nfor fish and flyways for migratory birds.\n\n[[Page S14497]]\n\n  I regret that important unrelated and noncontroversial measures are \nbeing held up by the sponsors of S. 623, but I cannot consent to \npassage of this bill at this time. The water flow of the Missouri River \nis too important to the livelihood of numerous metropolitan areas and \nsmall cities, and transportation and industry not only in Missouri but \nall along the waterway. We must deal with this measure reasonably and \nin the context of real negotiations, not as a matter of consent to be \nundertaken without full discussion by the parties.\n  I thank the Senate for my opportunity to reference my position on \nthis issue. I yield the remainder of the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14497-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14497-S14498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized to introduce an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2752\n\n (Purpose: To impose a moratorium on large agribusiness mergers and to \n      establish a commission to review large agriculture mergers, \n                    concentration, and market power)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2752.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of Friday, \nNovember 5, 1999, under ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to colleagues that I will start \nout--though my guess is that very soon we will probably have an \nagreement that will enable us to go to an amendment that will be 10 \nminutes altogether and then a vote for those who need to leave town. I \nwill start out. I want to say to colleagues, this isn't going to be a \nlong debate, and we'll go back to it on Wednesday. Several colleagues \nhave questions and I will start out that way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I must respond to the comments made by our \ndistinguished colleague from Missouri and comments made by his \ncolleague from Missouri yesterday, as well, with respect to the Dakota \nWater Resources project in North Dakota. The legislation that was being \nreferenced is profoundly misunderstood. In fact, the Dakota Water \nResources Act (S.623) reduces the authorization of the water project. \nIt doesn't expand it; it dramatically reduces it--cutting authorized \nirrigation from 130,000 to 70,000 acres and deauthorizing several \nproject features.\n  It also fully protects the interests of the State of Missouri. \nNevertheless, one letter from the State of Missouri, written today and \ndelivered to us, complains about the Dakota Water Resources project. In \nso doing, the letter describes a completely separate and unrelated \nproject (the Devils Lake outlet), which has nothing to do with this at \nall. So there is a profound misunderstanding here about the facts and \ncircumstances affecting two distinct projects.\n  I might say, additionally, that the Dakota Water Resources Project is \nnot some dream somebody just had in the last day or two. My State has a \nRhode Island-sized flood that has visited us permanently, forever. The \nFederal Government said, if you will keep a flood forever, you can move \nsome of the water behind the dam around North Dakota for your \nbeneficial purposes. Why did the Government want the permanent flood in \nNorth Dakota? The reason was to prevent Missouri River flooding at St. \nLouis and dozens of other downstream communities.\n  North Dakota said, fine. The downstream states have flood protection \nand a lot of the benefits. We agree with that. We support that.\n  But we have not gotten the benefits, after these many decades, that \nwe were promised, in turn, from a multi-purpose water project. It has \nbeen pared back and back, and the legislation just discussed on the \nfloor by my colleague from Missouri shrinks it even further. In fact, \nwe have proposed further protection for Missouri, because one of the \nobjections by the Senator from Missouri was that this project would use \nwater from the Missouri River and Missouri really wants that water. He \ndoesn't feel that the equivalent of one-tenth of a foot off the \nMissouri River at St. Louis should be used in North Dakota. So we have \nproposed there be no reduction in water going through St. Louis. We \nwould manage the water impounded by the Garrison Dam in a way that \nguarantees there would be no reduction in the Missouri River water for \nSt. Louis.\n  I make the point that the comments made by the Senator from Missouri \nand his colleague from the same State, in my judgment, and with great \nrespect, profoundly misstate what we are doing. This bill shrinks the \nauthorized project dramatically and would not produce anything like the \nkind of results that have been alleged. In fact, we believe this \nproject is good for Missouri and all of the States in the Missouri \nBasin and in the region.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a unanimous consent request. \nI ask unanimous consent that I regain the floor following the \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nconsent regarding the Wellstone amendment be temporarily suspended and \nthe Senate now resume the Dodd amendment No. 2532, and there be 10 \nminutes remaining and a vote occur on or in relation to the amendment \nat the end of that time. I further ask consent that the Senate then \nturn to the Wellstone amendment and that all debate but 1 hour equally \ndivided be used during the session of the Senate today. I also ask that \n1 hour of debate occur on Wednesday, November 17, and a vote occur on \nor in relation to the amendment at the conclusion or the yielding back \nof time, provided that a vote in relation to the Wellstone amendment \noccur prior to a cloture vote, if cloture is filed on the bill.\n\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding there would be a vote on the Dodd amendment this evening, \nis that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, I would \nlike 5 minutes before we go to the vote to have a chance to also \nrespond to statements made by the Senators from Missouri over the last \ncouple days with respect to the water project in North Dakota. If I \ncould get that consent, I certainly would not object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I could \nsay to the proponent of the unanimous consent request, it has been \nbrought to my attention that instead of 10 minutes, we will need 15 \nminutes equally divided. I am sure he would have no objection to that. \nWe have no objection, I say to the Senator from North Dakota. Does \nanybody else need to respond to that?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have no objection to the statements of the Senators \nfrom North Dakota. I made my position clear. This issue has been well \nknown for a couple of decades now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have \ntwo amendments that have been moved and laid aside. I would like to \nhave a time when I might take those amendments off the desk and have a \nbrief period of debate and a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond, I say to my friend from \nCalifornia that we are now using the good graces of the Senator from \nMinnesota to get this agreement. One reason the two leaders want us to \ncome back for a vote in 15 or 20 minutes is so they can advise the \nSenate as to what is going to transpire in the next few days. I don't \nknow, under the present framework, how--this may be the last vote. I \nwould assume this would be the last vote tonight.\n\n[[Page S14498]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What I am concerned about is, I have made this known \nfor a number of days now. I have been patient and I have tried to get \nin the queue. I have waited. I have no objection if this is Wednesday \nor Wednesday afternoon, but I would appreciate having some time. I am \nprepared to object if I can't get that time.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, objecting doesn't help her cause. It \njust prevents us from having everybody gathered to know what is going \nto happen. Otherwise, there will be no vote and Senator Wellstone will \nargue his amendment, and we will be out of here anyway. On the \nDemocratic side, we probably have 8 or 9 Senators on the same position \nthat the Senator from California is in. They have offered amendments, \nand they are waiting to have a vote on those amendments. I have worked \nwith----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. But my experience is that if they come to the floor, \nthey are often accommodated. I don't see why that same accommodation \nshould not be made for me, most respectfully.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator certainly is a great advocate. We would like to \nconcede that she has the right above everybody else to a vote, but \nright now we don't have the parliamentary ability to do that.\n  I say to my friend that I think Senators Feingold, Durbin, Johnson--I \ncan go through the whole list--have also been here making the same \nrequests the Senator from California has and we haven't been able to \nget the votes up because of the nongermane amendments being debated on \nminimum wage and everything. It isn't as if the Senator from Iowa \nhasn't wanted votes. We haven't been able to get to them.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My amendment is germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to point out that if there is an \nobjection, people can't leave. I am trying to accommodate people's \nschedules. I think it would be unfortunate if because of an objection \nSenators who want to leave to get back for Veterans Day are not able to \nleave tonight. I was trying to accommodate.\n  I hope the Senator from California will reconsider. Basically, the \nimplication is that many people have many other amendments. This \nhappens to be one of the three amendments that was part of the original \nagreement about how we would proceed. That is the only difference. Many \nof us have other amendments.\n  If the Senator wants to object, go ahead.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have no objection to proceeding with the amendment. \nWhat I suspect is going to happen come Wednesday is it will be closed \ndown, and we will not have an opportunity to offer an amendment. One of \nthese amendments I have made to the bankruptcy bill. The Senator from \nIowa knows I have been a supporter of this bill. He is supportive of \nthis amendment. If there is an opportunity, I believe it will pass. \nSenator Jeffords and I are cosponsors of the amendment. I, again, would \nlike an opportunity to offer it before there is a cloture motion or \nsomething and there will be no more amendments on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from California that none of us here \nhave power to do anything about it. The Senator from Iowa and I will be \nhappy to put the Senator from California in line to vote tonight. But \nthere may not be any more votes tonight and we may have votes next \nWednesday. There may be only one vote on the Wellstone amendment. We \ndon't know. There is no problem having the amendment as one of the next \nones to come up--whenever that will be, this year or next year--on this \nbill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First, I say to the Senator from Iowa, I hope we can \nwork it out so Senators can leave.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am trying to satisfy the Senator from California, \nalthough I don't think I can do any better than the Senator from Nevada \nhas just done. But I pled for two reasons. No. 1, I still hope to work \nwith the Senator from Texas, the chairman of the Banking Committee, to \nsee what we can do to facilitate the amendment, whether it is now or a \nweek from now or next year, if we aren't finished with this bill. No. \n2, we are trying to get to a situation where we can get to a vote, \nwhich is something we promised a Member who has been waiting for a \nlong, long time.\n  We still have the third situation where Senator Reid and I are going \nto sit down with our staffs to see what we can do with all of the \namendments so we know where we are and have a complete picture. That is \nwhy I would plead with her to let the unanimous consent request go \nthrough.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My understanding is that at some point I will have an \nopportunity to offer this amendment, whether that is on Wednesday, \nanother day, or next year. Is that the correct understanding?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As far as I am concerned, the answer is yes. But let me \nsay it is my understanding under the agreement we have now that there \ncan be an objection to the Senator offering her amendment if, for \ninstance, somebody on the Banking Committee----\n  Mr. REID. She already offered it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Then the answer is yes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I understand that.\n  I will not object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can we get the agreement?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Can we move forward with the agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I repeat my request to \nhave 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is part of the agreement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then I certainly do not object.\n  Mr. REID. In fairness to the Senator from California, I don't know \nwhat is going to happen. I am not in a position to do anything about \nit. But it is possible there could be some procedural thing that will \nstop a lot of votes from going forward. The Senator from Iowa says, all \nthings equal, the Senator's amendment will go forward. I can't stand \nhere and guarantee it will happen. I don't know what will happen. \nProcedurally, a lot of amendments may not go forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I still have the floor. I know we want \nto move forward. I am trying to move forward. I would like to yield 3 \nminutes to the Senator from Oregon. He has been waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thought \nthis was part of the agreement. It is unclear to the Senator from North \nDakota what the agreement was. My understanding was I would be \nrecognized after this agreement was reached for the purpose of \nresponding to the statements that have already been made on the floor. \nI was assured that was part of that agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement provides 5 minutes for the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to have that 5 minutes at this time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is that the Senator from Oregon be \nrecognized for 3 minutes. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14498-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14498-S14499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SECRET HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

The secret holds are a breach of all that \nthe Senate is supposed to stand for in terms of openness and public \naccountability.\n  I hope Senators will comply with that new policy set out by Senators \nLott and Daschle.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14499-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DAKOTA WATER RESOURCES ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to respond to \nstatements that have been made about the Dakota Water Resources Act \nover the last several days by the Senator from Missouri. Yesterday we \nwere told that North Dakota is seeking somehow to steal water from our \nneighbors to the south. That is factually incorrect. It is untrue. We \nare not making any claim on anybody's water but our own.\n  Under the current law, North Dakota has a right to water flowing \nthrough the Missouri River. That is in the law today. In the law today \nthere is authorized a very large water project for North Dakota called \nthe Garrison Diversion Project. The reason it is authorized is because \nNorth Dakota accepted the permanent flood of 550,000 acres of the \nrichest farmland in North Dakota--permanently inundated to provide \nflood protection to downstream States, including Missouri. We have \nsaved billions of dollars of flood damage in those States because North \nDakota has accepted this permanent flood of over half a million acres. \nThat is the fact.\n  The new legislation before us is designed to substantially alter what \nis currently authorized in the law to reduce its costs by $1 billion to \nreduce dramatically the number of irrigated acres, and instead to have \nwater supply projects for cities and towns that desperately need it.\n  The assertion has been made that this would somehow deplete the water \ngoing to Missouri.\n  The fact is, the flow of the Missouri River in Missouri is 50,000 \nCFS. We are talking about 100 CFS to meet the legitimate water needs of \nthe State of North Dakota, water needs that are already recognized in \nthe law.\n  Today, in order to respond to the legitimate concerns of the Senators \nfrom Missouri, we offered to go even further and to put into law an \nassurance that they would not lose water at their key navigation time, \nduring this key period when they are concerned with losing even half an \ninch. That is what this translates into: A reduction of one half an \ninch, the water level of the Missouri River in the State of Missouri. \nWe are prepared to assure them they don't even lose that half an inch. \nThis is in response to the documented need for water that is so \ndesperately required in my State. We have people who are turning on \ntheir tap right now in North Dakota and what comes out looks filthy. It \nlooks filthy because it is filthy.\n  North Dakota was made a promise that, if you accept the permanent \nflood to provide flood protection for downstream States, we will \ncompensate you by allowing you to improve the water supply for your \ncitizens. That is what this bill is about. It is not designed in any \nway to hurt the State of Missouri. We are prepared to make changes in \nthe legislation to make that clear.\n  Let me conclude by saying we received a letter today that totally \nconfuses this project with the Devil's Lake outlet which is required to \nsolve another problem in another part of the State. These two projects \nare not the same. We hope officials in Missouri will get it \nstraightened out in their own minds that these are two totally distinct \nprojects. An outlet from Devil's Lake has nothing whatever to do with \nthe Dakota Water Resources Act Project.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14499-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14499-S14512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2532, as Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes equally divided on the \nDodd amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield myself 4 minutes under the agreement.\n  This chart explains the amendment I am offering. As most of my \ncolleagues are aware, there is $43 billion in uncollected child support \nin this country. If we could collect a fraction of the child support \nthat is outstanding, we could make a huge difference in the lives of \nchildren and families all across this country.\n  Despite the good efforts of those who have authored this bill on \nbankruptcy, there is a major gap in this bill. The major gap affects \nthe very people this number reflects for child support recipients. This \nbill places at a significant disadvantage women and children who may \nget caught up in the turmoil of a bankruptcy proceeding and leaves them \nat a significant disadvantage with respect to meeting the basic \nnecessities in their lives.\n  This morning's Washington Post made the case abundantly clear in the \nlead editorial. It said that the Congress should make sure that in the \nname of financial responsibility it does not unduly squeeze people who, \nbecause of job loss, family breakup, medical bills, et cetera, can't \nhelp themselves. These are the people affected by this amendment \nSenator Landrieu and I have offered and on which we will ask for your \nvotes shortly.\n  Children and families are the most vulnerable. The median income of a \nperson who files for bankruptcy is around $17,000 a year; for a woman \nfiling for bankruptcy, that number is a lot lower than $17,000 a year.\n  Unfortunately, this bill does not appear to treat these people as we \nhave for almost 100 years. Since the first bankruptcy law was passed in \n1903, women and children came first in the line of distributable assets \nin bankruptcy. They are going to be protected no matter what other \ntragedy has befallen. No matter what other rights creditors may have, \nthey will not be allowed to disadvantage innocent children and women \nwho have to depend upon some income in order to provide for their \nfamilies. Unfortunately, this bill leaves gaping holes in this area.\n  The amendment we have offered has been endorsed by 180 organizations, \nevery imaginable family organization in this country. It does the \nfollowing four things:\n  First, we say creditors can't seize or threaten to seize bona fide \nhousehold goods, such as books, games, microwave ovens, and toys. As \nwritten today, S. 625 provides no protection against repossession of \noperations of business, coming into a home and removing such items from \na family. Needless to say, that would be an unsettling, intimidating \noccurrence for families and children. I don't think this body wants to \ngo on record ratifying these kinds of scare tactics. I appreciate \nSenator Grassley's support for this provision.\n  Second, we say if people in bankruptcy are put on a budget and they \ncannot repay some of their debts, it ought to be a realistic budget. \nThe bill puts them on a budget based on IRS guidelines for people who \nowe back taxes. Unfortunately, those guidelines ignore obligations such \nas child care, school supplies, and church tithes. We say the \nbankruptcy judge ought to be allowed to at least consider these kinds \nof valid, often necessary expenses when it comes to family needs.\n  Third, we say money for kids should go to kids, not creditors. We \nmean that funds a parent receives for the benefit of children--like \nchild support payments or earned income tax refunds--should not be \ndivvied up among creditors. They ought to be reserved for the children.\n  I want the manager of the bill to have a chance to make his argument \nagainst the amendment, and then I will respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this bill, the original bill, contains \nmany\n\n[[Page S14500]]\n\nprovisions to help collect past due child support. This is not just the \nauthors saying this. These provisions are endorsed by the prosecutors \nwho actually enforce child support laws.\n  On another point, in response to what the Senator from Connecticut \nhas said, if one is under the median income, the means test doesn't \neven apply to that person. The people Senator Dodd is worried about \nwon't be affected.\n  In a more broad sense, this amendment should be defeated. First, the \nmeans test we now have in the bill is very flexible. The charge has \nbeen that we are not flexible enough. I will point out that \nflexibility. If a bankrupt is in a unique or special situation, our \nbill, the means test, allows that person to explain his or her \nsituation to the judge or to the trustee and thus get out of paying \nthese debts if there are special expenses. If these special expenses \nare both reasonable and necessary and this reduces repayment ability, \nthe debtor doesn't have to repay his or her debts.\n  The way we determine living expenses in this bill is to use a \ntemplate established by the Internal Revenue Service for repayment \nplans involving back taxes.\n  I have a chart and a study of the bill which was done by the General \nAccounting Office. The General Accounting Office noted in its June 1999 \nreport, which was to Congress, and a report about bankruptcy reform, \nthat this template includes a provision allowing a debtor to claim \nchild care expenses, dependent care expenses, health care expenses, or \nother expenses which are necessary living expenses. Tell me, with all \nthese things included, and with the General Accounting Office backing \nup the intent of our legislation, that this bill is not flexible, that \nthis bill does not take into consideration the living expenses and \nneeds of the potential person in bankruptcy.\n\n  This is, frankly, as flexible as you can get. According to the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Internal Revenue Service, living \nstandards in the bill now provide that any necessary expense can be \ntaken into account. The only living expenses not allowed under this \nbill are unnecessary and unreasonable expenses. What is wrong with not \nallowing unreasonable and unnecessary expenses? The only people who \noppose the means test as currently written are people who want \ndeadbeats looking to stiff their creditors to dine on fancy meals and \nto live in extravagant homes and to take posh vacations.\n  On the issue of household goods, this might by a surprise to the \nSenator from Connecticut, but I tend to agree with some of what he said \nnow and last night. If Senator Dodd were to modify his amendment, just \nto deal with household goods, I will be pleased to work with him on \nthat, to get the amendment accepted. But his amendment does much more \nthan just deal with the household goods issues. I simply cannot accept \nthese other changes.\n  Finally, this amendment by the Senator from Connecticut makes fraud \nmuch easier because the problem we must address in doing bankruptcy \nreform is that some people load up on debts on the eve of bankruptcy \nand then try to wipe out those debts, wipe them all away, by getting a \ndischarge. Obviously, this is a type of fraud which Congress needs to \nprotect against. The bill now says that debts for luxury items \npurchased within 90 days of bankruptcy in excess of $250, and cash \nadvances on credit cards made within 70 days in excess of $750, are \npresumed to be nondischargeable. This is pretty flexible on its face. \nUnder the bill now, you can buy $249 worth of luxury items such as \ncaviar the day before you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-\nfree. Under the bill, you can get $749 worth of cash advances minutes \nbefore you declare bankruptcy and still walk away scot-free.\n  But this is not enough for the people proposing this amendment. So \nthe question we have to answer is how much fraud do we want to \ntolerate? This amendment is way off base. If you want to crack down on \nout-and-out fraud, and that is what we are talking about, you should \nsupport the bill and you should be against this amendment because by \nsupporting the amendment, you make it easier for crooks to game the \nbankruptcy system and get a free ride at everyone else's expense. \nConsequently, if you do not want to do that, you will not support the \nDodd amendment. I oppose the amendment and I ask my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, crooks and scam artists there may be, but in \nour appetite, to go after the scam artist, we should not make women and \nchildren pay the price. To suggest somehow that someone is scamming the \nsystem because they buy $251 worth of goods and services they may need \nfor their children, that they are somehow ripping off the system, is to \napproach being ludicrous when it comes to this.\n  I have great respect for prosecutors, and the General Accounting \nOffice. But when 180 organizations representing every family group in \nthis country from the right to the left, if you will, strongly support \nthis amendment because it tries to do something to protect these \nfamilies, then we have achieved a new low when it comes to speaking \nabout families and children with one voice and then turning around and \ndoing violence to them.\n  The IRS schedule is not terribly flexible.

DODD. Find for me the word ``children'' anywhere in this \nschedule. It does not show up, not once. There is no flexibility at \nall. It is very rigid in terms of how it applies. There is no \nconsideration for the regions of the country where people live, whether \nyou live in New York City or Iowa or Connecticut or the State of Ohio. \nIt is a one-fix system, across the board.\n  I appreciate the Chairman and others who have tried to do something \non the means test. If you think it is so flexible, then merely adopt \nthis amendment. What you have also left out, of course, is that you \nstill allow for funds that a parent receives to the benefit of children \nto be dissipated. Things like child support payments and earned-income \ntax credits, which you do get if you are making $17,000 a year, should \nnot be divided up among creditors. As the bill presently reads, that \ncan happen. That is why 180 organizations are vehemently opposed to the \npresent language of this bill.\n  Let me go on. With regard to the seizing of household goods, again \nthere is nothing in this bill, nor the managers' amendment that \nprohibits these repossession operations from coming in and taking toys \nand books and VCRs that may be necessary for the education of children.\n  Lastly, the bill says if a consumer buys food, clothing, medicine, \nand similar items on credit within 90 days of a bankruptcy filing, and \nif the value of those items exceeds $250, then they are presumed to be \nluxuries and the person filing the bankruptcy has to hire a lawyer to \ndefend such purchases, make the case they were not luxury items. That \nis what the bill says. That goes far beyond anything we have ever done \nin 100 years in bankruptcy law, to turn around and say the present law \nsays $1,075 over 60 days. Our amendment says $400 per item or service \nin 60 days. The bill provides for a total of $250 in 90 days, while \nmine provides a more rational and reasonable itemized sum--per item or \nservice--in 60 days. The managers' amendment does not say anything \nabout that at all.\n  This would be a travesty, an absolute travesty to say we are going to \nmake families go into court and prove, when they went to Kmart and \nbought $251 worth of goods in the last 60 days, that they are not scam \nartists. Maybe there are some out there, but let's not let the millions \nof people who get caught in a bankruptcy proceeding because someone is \nsick and they lose a job, that somehow they are going to have to hire a \nlawyer and defend themselves for $250. This amendment is critical.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. This amendment is as critical as it gets to this bill. We \nare doing a lot to help the credit card companies. This is going to \nreduce the number of bankruptcies. But in our zeal to do that, do not \nallow this to happen. This would really be a major setback. Since 1903, \nwe have put children and families in the exalted position of not \nallowing them to be brought in and damaged in bankruptcy proceedings.\n  They are not going to get off scot-free. They have obligations to \npay. But to say, somehow, we are putting families first because we have \na flexible means test, disregarding all the other things that are in \nthis bill, would be a major setback of significant proportions.\n  The Washington Post editorial this morning is right on point. This is \nthe amendment they were talking about. We urge our colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the Senator from Delaware 1 minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, under the present law there are \nnondischargeable items with cash advances. It is a little over $1,000. \nThis goes down to $750. There is a difference, but it is not what the \nSenator from Connecticut makes it out to be.\n  No. 2, in the means test in terms of ``other necessary expenses,'' it \nincludes such expenses as charitable contributions, child care, \ndependent care, health care, payroll deductions--that is taxes, union \ndues, and life insurance. It is not true they are not able to be viewed \nas ``other expenses'' to be considered within bankruptcy.\n  I understand the Senator's point. I think he doth protest too loudly. \nIt is not $1,000; it is $750. That is true. It is a $250 difference. \nThat is what we are arguing about.\n  I have no more time, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Mr. Dodd and others, which has many components that \nundermine the kind of bankruptcy reform we are seeking to accomplish in \nthis bill. The amendment creates new windfalls for debtors in \nbankruptcy. It imposes an artificial definition of gross income which \nexcludes major sources of income. This would undermine both the means \ntest and the obligation that debtors pay all their disposable income to \ncreditors in chapter 13 plans. Furthermore, the amendment undercuts the \nbill's definition of household goods, allowing virtually any frivolous \nitem a debtor owns to qualify as a ``household good''.\n  The amendment claims to be ``pro-family'', but it takes a tremendous \nstep backward with respect to families--particularly those who work \nhard to pay their bills every month. I have worked very hard, along \nwith Senator Torricelli, provision by provision, to ensure that this \nbill is an important for families over current bankruptcy law. I \ndescribed in considerable detail last week the particular provisions in \nthe bankruptcy bill that are designed to help families, along with the \namendment Senator Torricelli and I developed to further enhance these \nprovisions. Therefore, I am deeply concerned by the fact that this \namendment inexplicably allows debtors to discharge debts without being \nresponsible to repay what they can afford.\n  A practical effect of this amendment is to allow rich debtors to \ndefraud their creditors. Debtors with high income who are receiving \nchild support could subtract child support from the calculation of \ntheir ability to repay. Thus, a debtor who earns $100,000 per year and \nreceives an additional $25,000 in child support, and who has mortgage, \ncar, and household expenses equaling $100,000, can go bankrupt in \nchapter 7 and walk away with $25,000 a year. This windfall to the \ndebtor is passed on the hardworking families that end up subsidizing \nthe cost of bankruptcies of others.\n\n[[Page S14502]]\n\n  Furthermore, the definition of household goods in the amendment \nallows debtors to avoid a security interest in expensive items like \n$2,000 stereo systems. I am mystified by why windfalls to debtors of \nthis kind are viewed as pro-family. I have been reminded many times \nduring the course of this debate that bankruptcies end up costing every \nAmerican family at least $400 per year. When these windfalls are \nincorporated into our bankruptcy laws, hardworking American families \nend up paying for them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute so \nI can have the same 1 minute the other side had.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to point out the big deal the \nSenator from Connecticut made about the IRS regulations and the \nguidelines not mentioning the word ``children.''\n  The point is very clear, from the General Accounting Office, but in \ntheir study of the IRS guidelines, under a category ``other necessary \nexpenses,'' if it does not mention children, if it does not take the \nneeds of children into consideration, what in the heck do the words \n``child care'' mean? What does ``dependent care'' mean, if the needs of \nchildren are not taken into consideration? It may not be mentioned in \nthe IRS guidelines per se, but under ``other necessary expenses,'' it \nis very clear that the needs of every child will be taken care of.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2532, as modified.

Mr. President, could I have order in the Chamber?\n  Mr. President, we are now dealing with amendment 2752. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we will start this debate tonight, and we will \nconclude the debate on Wednesday. There will be an hour of debate on \nWednesday as well. I want to give this a little bit of context. Mr. \nPresident, could I have order in the Chamber? Would Senators please \ntake their conversation outside the Chamber?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will start out with some narrative that was written \nby Jodi Niehoff, who works with me, and who is the daughter of dairy \nfarmers, Jane and Loren Niehoff, in Minnesota from Melrose, MN, and \nclose thereby.\n  Grove Township is 6 miles by 6 miles. It is a typical Midwest \ntownship. Fields of wheat, corn, some oats, and alfalfa span across the \ntownship line. In Grove Township, as in surrounding townships, the \nbiggest topic of conversation is the economic farm crisis.\n  There are fewer and fewer folks attending to local board meetings. It \nis not because fewer folks care. It is because there are fewer farmers \naround.\n  In Grove Township, regardless of which gravel road one chooses to \ntravel along, one will inevitably drive by an abandoned farm. Let me \nbegin by illustrating how the farm crisis affects rural communities. \nI'll use Grove Township as an example.\n  Sometimes we have these debates, and we never talk about it in terms \nof people.\n  Reuban Schwieters--Reuban just recently quit farming. Reuban and his \nwife Paula and their young boys sold half of the farm. Reuban is now \npouring cement at a local construction company.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Senators will \nplease take their conversations elsewhere.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just keep speaking, and if you \ncan't get order, I will get order.\n  Mr. President, I would say to colleagues that we could have had a 4-\nhour debate tonight. Colleagues wanted to go home. So I was \naccommodating because I think all of us want to get back for Veterans \nDay. We start this debate tonight about agriculture. It is taken me \nprobably about 8 weeks to get this amendment on the floor.\n  I would appreciate it if colleagues would take their conversations in \nthe back of the room outside. If we would have order in the Chamber, I \nam not going to speak until we do.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I don't like reading about people's lives, many of whom have lost \ntheir farms, and have Senators out here on the floor and others \nspeaking as if it makes no difference.\n  Reuban Schwieters--as I said, Reuban just recently quit farming. He \nand his wife Paula and three young boys sold half their farm. Reuben is \nnow pouring cement at a local construction company. Bear again in mind, \nthese loss of farms is just in Grove Township in my State of Minnesota.\n\n  Steve and Lori Sand lived about 3 miles from Reuben and Paula. Steve \nand Reuben went to school together. Steve began farming next to his \nfather's farm since at that time his father Wally was not ready to \nretire. Steve and Lori, their three daughters, and son could not hang \non to the farm. The prices were too low to maintain a household of six \nand still run the family farm. They moved to Cottage Grove, MN, where \nSteve does construction and his wife Lori is now a computer technician. \nIncidentally, Steve's father Wally has retired, but none of his \nchildren or grandchildren has taken over the family farm.\n  These are Minnesotans willing to let their names be used so I can \ntell their story, which is the story of what is happening in \nagriculture.\n  Allen Nathe closed down his farm and is now doing small engine \nrepairs. Gloria Schneider sold the farm to her son Glen. Glen and his \nwife farmed only a few years before they sold their family farm and he \nand his wife and small daughter moved to Minneapolis.\n  Dave Feldewerd sold his farm and is also driving a truck. Mike \nEllering recently sold his farm and is working construction. Danny \nFrieler and his family quit farming. They still live on the farm, but \nthe barns stand hollow. Marcy Wochnik recently retired and sold her \nfarm to her son, and her son tried for a few years before he threw in \nthe towel. Marcy moved into a house only a mile from a farm. No one has \nyet purchased the farm.\n\n[[Page S14503]]\n\n  I am going through the story of farmers and farm families who have \nquit farming in Grove Township, one township in the State of Minnesota, \na small story that tells a large story of what is happening to \nagriculture and the ``why'' of the amendment I introduced tonight with \nSenators Dorgan, Daschle, Johnson, Leahy, and other Senators.\n  Alvin and Mary Hoppe also recently sold their farm and moved off the \nfarm. Mary commutes to St. Cloud, and her husband has been doing \nmechanical jobs. Their son Jason is 12 years old, but he has always \nbeen by his father's side eager to learn farming. Despite Jason's \nenthusiasm and interest to farm, given the current conditions in \nagriculture, it is difficult for his parents to recommend this \noccupation.\n  This is only a corner of Grove Township in my State. If one crosses \nthe water, one will be in Oak Township, where I could go through \nanother list of farmers who have also had to quit farming. About a \nquarter of a mile from the Grove and Oak Township line lies the small \ntown of New Munich. Since 1996, New Munich has also declined in \nresidents. The effects of the farm crisis are apparent just walking \nalong Main Street. Ostendorf Grocery closed. Marvin, who is known as \nBud, and his wife Rosie have moved on. Rosie commutes to St. Cloud and \nsells retail clothes, and Bud works at a factory. Ostendorf Grocery was \na practical general store. After Sunday mass, folks from the \ncongregation would make quick stops for any last-minute items or simply \nvisit with Rosie and Bud. During the week, farmers often would run into \ntown to pick up a needed ingredient or item at the store. As in most \ntowns, Ostendorf Grocery also served as the news and information \ncenter. Rosie always knew of the current events in the area, and folks \nenjoyed spending a few minutes to talk to her and Bud. Gone.\n  Since 1996, the elementary school closed. The school closing affected \nthe local businesses. The school also has been used for community \nevents. Schoolchildren, particularly farm kids, now face much longer \nbus rides to school.\n  Thielen Meats will close by the end of this year. Thielen Meats was a \nlittle mom-and-pop meat shop located across from the J.C. Park. Many \nfarmers would bring a hog or a cow to be butchered by their family. The \nlarger shipments of livestock delivered to Thielen Meats were sold \ndirectly to residents in the town or in the surrounding area.\n\n  Kenny and Rita Revermann may also be closing the True Value Hardware \nstore. After the school closing, the grocery store closing, and the \nrecent news of the meat shop closing, the trips made by farmers to New \nMunich will grow fewer and fewer.\n  I have letters from farmers from Minnesota, Kentucky, Iowa, Kansas, \nMontana, and Missouri. Over and over again, if I had to summarize, \nthese farmers say: We have record low prices, we have record low \nincome, we are not going to be able to make it, it doesn't matter \nwhether we work 19 hours a day, it doesn't matter how good a manager we \nare, there are economic forces that are destroying our lives.\n  So far, Senators have not helped. So far, we have acted as if this \ncrisis didn't exist. This amendment tonight, which calls for a \nmoratorium on all of these mergers and acquisitions of the huge \nconglomerates makes it hard for our family farmers and producers to \nhave any leverage when they are only dealing with three buyers. If you \nare at an auction and you have three buyers for a product, what kind of \nprice do you get?\n  This is just the first amendment. The first vote next week will be \nthe beginning of a major floor fight over and over again until we \nchange farm policy in the country. It is not just a question of people \nlosing their farms, it is a question of our rural communities. When \npeople lose their farms, it is more than just a family. We are seeing a \nrising incidence of divorce. We are seeing all kinds of tensions within \nfamilies. We have too many suicide lines that are being used now. We \nhave too much depression. We have too many farmers without any life \ninsurance, too many farmers without any health insurance, too many \nfarmers without any health and dental care, too many farmers with too \nlittle self-esteem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. He has been waiting a long time to get this \nopportunity. We told him he would get it, and he has it.\n  For the information of all Senators, the Senate will now debate the \npending Wellstone agriculture amendment. However, no further votes will \noccur this evening. I want to make that clear. We will hotline both \nsides so our Members will know there are no further votes this evening.\n  The Senate will not be in session on Veterans Day, and we will \nconvene next on Tuesday, November 16. On Tuesday, I expect the Senate \nto debate and possibly complete action on any number of items arriving \nfrom the House of Representatives relative to the appropriations \nprocess and perhaps other conference reports. I will be discussing the \nspecifics of what the schedule will be with Senator Daschle, and we \nwill keep Members informed of the subject matter.\n  By a previous order, the Senate will conduct a vote relative to the \nWellstone agriculture amendment on Wednesday of next week. I suspect \nadditional votes will be required in order to finish the necessary \nitems pending between the two Houses of Congress. The continuing \nresolution we passed will expire at midnight on Wednesday. I think that \nwill give the Senate more than enough time for final negotiations to be \ncompleted, for the House to act, for the package to be received in the \nSenate, and complete action on Wednesday. However, that is a deadline I \nbelieve we can meet, and we should work to complete our work for the \nyear by then.\n  We will let Senators know, of course, if there is to be a big package \nof votes during the day on Wednesday. We will notify Senators exactly \nwhat time that will be. Senators should be prepared for the voting to \nbegin as early as 10 o'clock on Wednesday on the Wellstone amendment.\n  I urge all Senators to be patient and accommodating during the next \nfew days of the session. I thank all Members in advance for their \ncooperation.\n  We have a number of nominations we have been working assiduously to \nclear on both sides of the aisle. These are judicial nominations and \nother nominations. We have a couple more issues we have to check on to \nconfirm everything we agreed to has been worked out. Also, Senator \nDaschle and I have talked at great length about how to handle the \njudicial calendar. I think we have a fair arrangement.\n  I ask unanimous consent a colloquy between the two of us be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it's my understanding that the majority \nleader has committed to proceeding to the nominations of Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon to the ninth circuit court of appeals no later than \nMarch 15, 2000. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I will move to proceed to each of these \nnominations no later than March 15 of next year.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is also my understanding that the majority leader \nwill work to clear the remaining judges left on the executive calendar \nthis year, and if they can't be cleared, he will move to proceed to \neach of the remaining judicial nominees no later than March 15 of next \nyear. Is that also correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my hope. In addition I do not believe that \nfilibusters of judicial nominations are appropriate and, if they occur, \nI will file cloture and I will support cloture on the nominees.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It's my understanding that Senator Hatch supports your \nview of cloture on these nominations. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Hatch will have to speak for himself but it is my \nunderstanding that he supports all of these nominations and will \nsupport cloture if necessary.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, tonight I speak, Wednesday I speak, and \nWednesday we debate a crisis that is\n\n[[Page S14504]]\n\nravaging rural America. I started out speaking about this crisis in \npersonal terms, in human terms. On present course, the conservative \nestimate is we will lose 7,000 farmers this next year, but it could be \nmore in Minnesota. On present course, over the next couple of years we \nare going to lose a whole generation of producers, if we do not change \nour course of policy.\n  I do not believe family farmers in my State of Minnesota, or family \nfarmers in America, will be able to continue to farm or will their \nchildren be able to farm, unless we change the structure of \nagriculture. Bob Bergland, who was Secretary of Agriculture in the late \n1970s, commissioned a report called ``The Structure of Agriculture.'' \nHe now lives in northwest Minnesota. It was prophetic.\n  In the past decade and a half, we have seen an explosion of mergers \nand acquisitions and anticompetitive practices that have raised \nconcentration in agriculture to record levels. Everywhere family \nfarmers look, whether it is who they buy from or who they sell to, it \nis but a few firms that dominate the market.\n  The top four pork producers have increased their market share from 36 \npercent to 57 percent. The top four beef packers have expanded their \nmarket share from 32 percent to 80 percent. The top four flour millers \nhave increased their market share from 40 percent to 62 percent. The \nmarket share of the top four soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \npercent to 80 percent.\n  The top four turkey processors now control 42 percent of production. \nMr. President, 49 percent of all chicken broilers are now slaughtered \nby the four largest firms. The top four firms now control 67 percent of \nethanol production. The top four sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn \nprocessors now control 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent and 57 \npercent of the market, respectively. The four largest grain buyers \ncontrol nearly 40 percent of elevator operators.\n  The effect of this concentration has basically been to squeeze our \nproducers out. Our family farmers no longer have the leverage or the \npower in the marketplace to get a decent price. This amendment is a cry \nfrom the countryside. Everywhere I go in Minnesota and other States, \nfarmers say: We cannot get a decent price because of this concentration \nof power, because of this monopoly power. We are not able to survive. \nWhen we look at the packers and we look at the grain companies and we \nlook at the exporters and we look at the processors, they are making \ngood profits, sometimes record profits, but we cannot get a decent \nprice.\n  Farmers say to me: Where is the competition in the food industry? \nThis amendment is an effort to put some competition back into the food \nindustry. We are talking about an 18-month moratorium.\n  We are saying what we need to do is take some time out. Something is \nnot working. We passed the Sherman Act. We passed the Clayton Act. \nEstes Kefauver was a great Senator who talked about antitrust action. \nBut we have had this wave of mergers and acquisitions that have led to \nprecious little competition. Again, these conglomerates have exercised \ntheir power over our producers and our producers cannot get a decent \nprice.\n  This amendment is not the be-all or the end-all, but I say to my \ncolleagues, if you believe in competition and if you believe family \nfarmers ought to have a chance in the marketplace, then the very least \nwe can do is pass an amendment that says when it comes to these large \nagribusinesses, these large conglomerates with $100 million and over \nrevenue buying up a company with at least $10 million, we ought to say \nwe are going to have a moratorium on this.\n  For 18 months, we set up a review commission and then we come up with \nrecommendations and we pass some legislation that gives our producers a \nfair chance in the marketplace. If we pass that legislation in 2 months \nor 3 months, then this moratorium is no longer operative.\n\n  Built into this amendment I introduced with Senator Dorgan and other \ncolleagues is the opportunity, if you will, the waiver that any \nbusiness can file with the Justice Department, where a business can \nsay: We have to merge or we have to buy because we are facing financial \ninsolvency. We allow for that. But we have to pass this kind of \namendment now because over and over again, every single day, we are \nseeing these acquisitions and mergers; more and more concentrated \npower, more and more concentrated power which is harmful to our \nproducers and harmful to our consumers and harmful to America.\n  On present course, we are going to see a few large conglomerates that \nare going to control every phase of the food industry from the seed to \nthe supermarket or grocery shelf. We are going to have a few \nlandowners. Somebody is going to own the land and somebody is going to \nown the animals, but it is going to be just a few conglomerates.\n  That is dangerous for our country. Thomas Jefferson told us it was \ndangerous; Andrew Jackson told us it was dangerous; Abraham Lincoln \ntold us it was dangerous; Teddy Roosevelt, later on, told us it was \ndangerous. Why are we not, in the Senate and House of Representatives, \nwilling to pass some legislation which will promote competition, which \nwill protect consumers, and which will give our farmers and our \nproducers who are going under some leverage in the marketplace? This \nlegislation is also important to the environment, to our rural \ncommunities, and to democracy.\n  Just yesterday the Wall Street Journal reported that Novartis and \nMonsanto, two of the biggest agribusiness giants, may be merging. The \nWall Street Journal accurately states:\n\n       The industry landscape seems to be changing every day.\n\n  In fact, the ground is constantly shifting beneath our feet and it \nsoon may be too late to do anything about it. That is why we need a \ntime out. That is exactly what this amendment calls for.\n  Too many corporate agribusinesses are growing fat and too many \nfarmers are facing extinction and very lean times. Clearly, we cannot \ncount on the current antitrust statutes and antitrust authorities to \naddress this rapid consolidation. We are going to have to do better. We \nare going to have to change our laws to enable someone like Joel Klein, \nwho is so skillful and so gifted, to be representing family farmers. \nWhether or not our antitrust agencies have the authority, we need to \nmove forward. We have to develop a new farm policy and we know it is \ngoing to take some time. But we do not have much time left.\n  The question for Senators is, Whose side are we on? Whose side are we \non? Are we on the side of the packers and the grain companies, or are \nwe on the side of family farmers? I mean this. I mean this very \nsincerely. I know, because I have heard from other Senators, that you \nhave a lot of these big companies and they are sending in faxes and \nletters and they are lobbying hard.\n  But aren't we going to be for the producers? Aren't we going to be \nfor the family farmers in our States? For Senators who are not from the \nfarm States, who do you want to control agriculture? Isn't food a \nprecious item? Should we not give these producers a fair shot? Wouldn't \nit be better for the environment to have family farmers? Wouldn't it be \nbetter for our rural communities? Wouldn't it enable us to continue to \ncount on being able to purchase food at a reasonable price? Why in the \nworld would we want to move to a corporatized, industrialized \nagriculture, where a few conglomerates control the whole food industry?\n  That is not competition. That is not Adam Smith's invisible hand. \nThat is not the United States of America. I offer this amendment \ntonight with my colleagues. We will have the debate again next week, \nand then we will have the vote because we need to take some action.\n  We have to act now, otherwise there are going to be more mergers and \nit is going to be too late, and we are going to lose, as I said \nearlier, a whole generation of family farms.\n  I have seen some of these faxes and letters that have come in. I do \nnot even have this in writing before me, but I can almost remember it. \nSome of them say: Oh, my gosh, this is a threat to co-ops.\n  Co-ops are not covered.\n  Some of these letters say: But if you want to sell your farm, then \nyou can't sell your farm.\n  This does not apply to farms, it applies to these agribusinesses.\n\n[[Page S14505]]\n\n  Then some say: This is going to stop all mergers and acquisitions.\n  That is not true either. We set up a test. There is a Hart-Scott-\nRodino test right now where, if you have a big company, the Justice \nDepartment has to take a look at you to see whether or not you are in \nviolation of antitrust laws. We are applying this to the large \nconglomerates and large agribusinesses.\n  Then there is the argument, if a company is going under this, this \nwould prohibit them from selling or buying. That is not true either. \nThere is a waiver with the Justice Department for companies faced with \nfinancial insolvency.\n  The question is whether or not the Senate is willing to take some \naction right now that will make a difference. I cannot think, I say to \nevery single colleague, of any vote that we will cast when it comes to \nfamily farms and agriculture that is more telling in terms of what the \nSenate is about.\n  We have a few conglomerates. My case is compelling. They control well \nover 50 percent of the market. When farmers look to from whom they buy \nand to whom they sell, it is monopoly or oligopoly at best. They cannot \nget a decent price.\n  This amendment to the bankruptcy bill--by the way, on present course, \nmore and more farmers will be faced with bankruptcy--let us have at \nleast a moratorium on these mergers of these large conglomerates. Let's \nat least step back for 18 months, set up a commission, study this, and \ncome up with legislation that will provide some protection for family \nfarmers so they can get a decent price in the marketplace. If we pass \nthat legislation in January or February, then this moratorium is no \nlonger operative.\n  I come from a remarkable State. I want to quote a remarkable \nMinnesotan, Ignatius Donnelly. I want to quote from a speech he gave at \nthe People's Party Convention in 1892. It reads as if it could have \nbeen written yesterday. He was an implacable foe of monopoly power. \nDonnelly in his speech affirmed that the interests of rural and urban \nlabor are the same. He called for a return to America's egalitarian \nprinciples. He said:\n\n       We seek to restore the Government of the Republic to the \n     hands of the plain people with whom it originated.\n\n  We should do no less. If we want to sustain a vibrant rural economy \nand a thriving democracy, we need urgently to reform our farm and \nantitrust laws, and we have to act now. Time is not neutral. Time \nrushes on, and if we are not willing to take this action next week, \ntime will leave many farmers behind. Now is the time to act.\n\n  Next week, I will read from letters of support from any number of \ndifferent farm organizations, and I will start out with the Farmers \nUnion, which has been so helpful in this whole effort. I especially \nthank Tom Buis for all of his policy work.\n  This may be the final vote of this session this year. This vote will \nbe very telling for Senators who value a family farm structure of \nagriculture, for Senators who have seen the anguish of farmers in our \nrural communities, and for Senators who have seen in personal terms \nwhat record low farm prices and record low farm income means. It is \nimportant to come to the floor and fight for people.\n  Tonight is the first speech. Wednesday we come back with 1 hour more \nof debate. Between now and Wednesday, I am going to do everything I can \nas a Senator to make sure a lot of grassroots people in our farm States \nand in other States contact Senators because this is a tough fight. A \nlot of these large companies and a lot of their associations that \nrepresent these large companies--and I will read the names of the \ndifferent organizations that are opposed to this legislation--pour in \nthe faxes and pour in the letters. By the way, I say to my colleagues, \na good part of what they are saying is not accurate.\n  I understand there are certain interests who give a lot of money and \nare heavy hitters, who are well connected and who are the players and \ninvestors, maybe too much so in both parties. I understand that a call \nfor antitrust action or at least to call for a moratorium on these \nmergers and acquisitions of these large companies goes directly at that \npower. But the truth is--and I conclude on this note--this is but a \nglimpse of what is to come.\n  In some ways, our country today reminds me a little bit of the gilded \nage of the 1890s, moving into the next century. We moved into the 20th \ncentury. As we went through the 1890s, we had a tremendous \nconsolidation of power which gave rise to the populist movement, gave \nrise to progressives, gave rise to Teddy Roosevelt, the Sherman Act in \n1890, the Clayton Act in the teens, and then the Stockyard Act of 1921 \nor 1922. This feels the same way.\n  We have CBS being bought by Viacom. We have banks merging, a few \nbanks, a few large insurance companies, a few airlines--concentration \nof power in telecommunications, concentration of power in agriculture--\nthe list goes on and on.\n  I am a Senator from a farm State. I am a Senator from an agricultural \nState. I am a Senator from the Midwest. I am a Senator from the State \nof Minnesota, and when I look at the need to do something about this \nmonopoly power and I look at the need to do something that will give \nour producers, our family farmers a fair shake, I cannot think of any \nmore important action we can take than to at least have this temporary \nmoratorium on these mergers.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have left this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator has 55 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the rest of the time I have \nthis evening to Senator Harkin. I was going to suggest the absence of a \nquorum, but if my colleague from Oregon is going to speak, I will not \ndo so. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to respond to Senator \nWellstone, not with any personal animus at all, but to give a \nperspective on this issue that perhaps I uniquely can give because, I \nsay to Senator Wellstone, before I came into politics, I was a pea \nprocessor.\n  I say to the Senator, his amendment covers everybody I know in the \nindustry, save those who are in farm cooperatives.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a quick \nquestion? I have to leave to try to get back to Minnesota to mark \nVeterans Day, but I want to ask my colleague, is he talking about a \ncooperative with which he was involved?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ran a stock company, a food processing \ncompany. But its ownership was not by farmers but by stockbrokers.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I see. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I come to the floor, I say to Senator Wellstone, \nwith the same interest that he has in farmers. I care very deeply about \nthe rural economy. I note, with great concern, what is happening to my \nfarmer friends and the rural economy. And I simply come here, in \nrespect, and say, while as well-motivated as I believe the Senator from \nMinnesota is with his amendment, it is too broad and too wrong when it \ncomes to what we believe in in this country, which is a free market.\n  I look at what has affected the farmers in my area and much of rural \nOregon. I know in Oregon the Asian flu had a great deal to do with a \nloss of markets and low commodity prices. I have watched, in horror, as \nthis administration has attacked the grazing industry in my State, \ngoing after their grazing rights, making sure the little guy can't \nutilize public lands anymore. I have watched, with amazement, that in \nthe Columbia Basin there is actually serious talk about taking out \ntransportation systems provided by hydroelectric dams that are able to \ntransport hundreds of millions of tons of wheat and grain inland from \nIdaho all the way to the Port of Portland and out into the Pacific rim. \nWhat happens to those farmers? This bill does not help at all.\n  I look at the Food Quality Protection Act being administered by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. While I support the Food Quality \nProtection Act, I have been one who has pled with this administration \nto employ good science as they review chemical tolerances. As they take \naway the pesticides, the herbicides that these farmers have depended \nupon--which have greatly contributed to their ability to be good\n\n[[Page S14506]]\n\nfarmers and to produce high-quality crops with low production costs--\nthey leave farmers with no effective alternatives. This bill does not \naddress these farmers' concerns.\n  I have to say that the way the Senator from Minnesota has described \nthis day of decision with respect to farmers, I think he has forgotten \nthat we in this Congress have already voted out $8.7 billion in \nemergency assistance to farmers to help tide them through this very \ndesperate season.\n  Many of us have gone to the U.S. Trade Representative and pled that \nthis time, in Seattle at the WTO meetings, agriculture not be left out. \nOne of the predicates of the Freedom To Farm Act was that we would \nincrease markets and we would decrease regulations. We have not done \neither of those things. We have diminished markets, and we have \nincreased regulation. We have, I am afraid, perhaps cut the farmer too \nshort a deal. That is in part why we had to send another $8.7 billion \nin assistance this year.\n  In addition to that, I have tried to help farmers with the whole \nissue of immigrant labor, trying to reform the H-2A program. I am \namazed at the things that are said about those of us who actually \nbelieve immigrant workers should have some legal stature to be here, to \ndo labor that they want to do and that agricultural employers need them \nto do if they are going to have a harvest. I have been amazed at the \nway that we, who are trying to improve their legal standing, are \ncharacterized by those who are in the labor shortage business.\n  If you want to hurt a farmer, just make sure he does not have the \nability to have his crops harvested. The amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota does nothing for these farmer's concerns.\n  I want him to know, and anyone else interested in this issue, that \nSenator Hatch, of the Judiciary Committee, has announced that there \nwill be hearings on agricultural concentration so we can examine the \ninstances where perhaps the Federal light ought to be put on a few \nmergers and acquisitions. We have laws to take care of those things. \nThey need to be enforced. Perhaps they are not being enforced to the \nextent some would prefer. Senator Hatch's hearings I believe will get \nat that issue.\n\n  But the thing I would really to impress upon my colleagues in the \nSenate is that Senator Wellstone's amendment exempts farm cooperatives. \nI have nothing against farm cooperatives. They do a lot of business in \nmy State, and they do a lot of good in my State. They play a very \nimportant role in agriculture. About one-third of the farmers in this \ncountry have a farm cooperative for the outlet of their production. How \nabout the other two-thirds? The other two-thirds grow their products \nfor stock-owned companies.\n  What the Senator's amendment is proposing to do is to say that in \nthis 18-month moratorium, no market conduct, no mergers, no \nacquisitions can occur among stock-held companies. However, this same \nactivity, among farm cooperatives, is no problem. That makes no sense \nto me. In fact, a lot of farm cooperatives buy stock companies. To me, \nthis is just patently unfair. If we should do something this un-\nAmerican, this countermarket, we should do it to all. But, frankly, \nlet's not do it to any.\n  There are many ways to help the farm community without this kind of \nmarket intrusion by the Government. This really is an amendment that \nwill ask every Senator what they believe about the free market system, \nnot what they believe about helping farmers.\n  My Heavens, there is almost nothing you could bring to this floor \nthat would actually help a farmer that I would not vote for or have \ntried to vote for and have taken a lot of heat for because I have voted \nfor things that really do help a farmer to survive. But to go in and \nsay one class of farm processors is exempt but two-thirds of you cannot \nparticipate in the free market, frankly, strikes me as strange.\n  I will tell you another thing that really is troubling based on my \nexperience. I have seen many farm cooperatives be very good at \nproducing lots of food, lots of surplus. In some instances, some have \nnot been as good at marketing that surplus. So in a backhanded way, \nwhat we are saying is, if you organize yourself in this way, you get \nthe benefit of the free market, but if you organize yourself as a stock \ncompany, you are limited as to how you can merge, sell, and acquire.\n  What does that mean to two-thirds of the farmers in this country? \nWhat does that mean to them, if their output goes to a stock food \nprocessor? It means the food processor, if he or she is in trouble, has \none option because they can't sell. They can't merge. They could go \nbankrupt. So what have you done to help the two-thirds of the farmers \nin this country, if you put their outlet of production in that kind of \njeopardy?\n  This amendment is a shotgun blast at the marketplace. I plead with my \ncolleagues, I appeal to their commitment to free enterprise not to \ninterfere in the marketplace in this way. This does not work. This is \nnot fair. This is not the American way.\n  If there are antitrust problems, we have laws for that. If there is \nillegal conduct, we have laws to go after crooks. But why penalize all \nof the agricultural community that organizes themselves in stock \ncompanies as opposed to farm cooperatives? It makes no sense. I, \nfrankly, don't know of a precedent for that in our Nation's history. \nPerhaps someone can show me one. This is not the way to help farmers. \nThis is wrong. This penalizes hundreds and thousands of food processors \nwho are trying to deliver to the farmer a good outlet for their product \nand to pay them a fair price.\n  I am aware of one farm cooperative this year that has said to their \ngrowers, the dollar you put in for a crop, we are going to pay you 75 \ncents this year. And, in this instance, all of the stock food \nprocessors are paying 100 cents on a dollar, plus the profit that they \nguaranteed by the contract. So we are going to punish the processor \nthat is delivering 100 cents and more on the dollar? We are going to \nadvantage those who are delivering less than that?\n  This amendment is misguided and must not pass, or we will be \npunishing farmers and food processors that simply do not deserve this \nkind of treatment from the Senate.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment being brought forward by the \nSenator from Minnesota. While I recognize the concern among farmers in \nhis state and mine over agribusiness concentration, I believe we would \nbe making a profound mistake if we were to respond to the current \nsituation by adopting this amendment today.\n  I, too, am concerned about the future of family farmers and American \nagriculture. Agriculture is one of the largest industries in Oregon. It \nrepresents more than 140,000 jobs including on-farm employment, food \nprocessing, marketing, and all the other factors that go into bringing \nfine Oregon produce to restaurants, grocery stores, and dining room \ntables around the country. It is the dominant industry in many Oregon \ncounties, and it flourishes just a short drive from the urban centers \nof Portland and Eugene. So when farmers are concerned about something, \nI am too.\n  I am well aware that many people in farm country are suffering these \ndays from another year of low commodity prices. Most of the farmers \nthat have spoken to me about this current farm crisis believe it is \nmainly due to the lack of overseas market access, expensive \nenvironmental and labor regulatory burdens, and in some areas, natural \ndisasters. For a state like Oregon that exports much of its produce \nacross the Pacific, the recent Asian financial crisis has had a \ndevastating impact on farmer's bottom lines. Moreover, in the Northwest \nespecially, I have been witness to an Administration that has not been \nparticularly friendly towards the interests of rural communities by \ncontinuously threatening long-standing grazing rights and the essential \ngrain transportation network afforded by the lower Snake River dams.\n  So I have tried to be very sensitive and responsive to the needs of \nfarmers in rural America that have fallen into something of a mini-\ndepression while watching their urban counterparts enjoy an economic \nboom. Here in the Congress, we have decided to direct billions of \ntaxpayer dollars in assistance to help tide farmers over during these \nlean years--another $8.7 billion was sent out to farm country this \nfall. I have voted for these assistance packages knowing that they are \nshort-term\n\n[[Page S14507]]\n\nfixes and that much work remains to be done to improve the long-term \noutlook. Part of this is improving the demand side of the equation \nthrough the expansion of trade opportunities. I have been very \nsupportive of unilateral sanctions reform, tearing down agriculture \ntrade barriers through the WTO, and full funding for the promotion of \nAmerican commodities overseas utilizing the Market Access Program. \nThese efforts are all vital to induce a rebound in world demand, and, \neventually, a rebound for our farmer's prices here at home. An equally \nimportant part of the equation is to reduce costs of production for \nfarmers that come in the form of excessive federally-mandated \nregulations. I have worked hard to overhaul the currently impractical \nH2A guest worker program and free farmers from INS and Social Security \nAdministration intimidation by giving them a legal workforce. I have \nconsistently pushed for a science-based implementation of the Food \nQuality Protection Act, and an even-handed review of pesticide \ntolerances. I believe that continued work to open market opportunities \nfor farmers while fulfilling our promises to ease regulatory burdens--\nin other words keeping the Congress' promises under the Freedom to Farm \nbill--will be necessary in order to get the farm economy back on track.\n  With that said, I am also aware that many farmers in my state and \naround the country have reservations about the pace of change and \nconsolidation underway in certain agriculture sectors. The meat packing \nand grain processing industries have seen a number of headline-grabbing \nmergers and acquisitions in recent years. Critics of these mergers \noften cite the 3% rise in consumer food prices that has come over the \nlast 15 years while the farmer's percentage of the food dollar has \nsimultaneously dropped 36%. Others note the high profits attained by \nlarge agribusinesses at a time when many farmers continue to suffer \nfrom historically low commodity prices. Certainly, the pace of the \nconcentration and how it affects the bargaining power of average \nproducers and the overall future of family farming warrant careful \nreview by appropriate federal agencies and continued study by the \nCongress. I note that this issue of concentration and competitiveness \nin agriculture was the subject of a recent hearing in the House \nJudiciary Committee just a few weeks ago. In addition, Chairman Hatch \njust announced last week that his Judiciary Committee will be looking \ninto this issue in a comprehensive way early next year. I also want to \npoint out that we in the Congress, largely in response to concerns \nabout the competitiveness within the meat packing industry, just passed \na provision to the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations bill that \nrequires mandatory price reporting for meat packers. So I want farmers \nto know that the issue of agribusinesses concentration has not gone \nunnoticed by the Congress.\n  I concur with the Senator from Minnesota that this is an important \nissue. However, I must respectfully disagree with his conclusion that \nan outright moratorium on agribusiness mergers is the right response.\n  His amendment would impose a moratorium on mergers and acquisitions \namong agribusinesses with annual net revenue or assets of more than \n$100 million for one party, and $10 million for the other. This would \naffect agriculture brokers, commission merchants, commodity dealers, \nagricultural suppliers such as seed and chemical producers, and food \nprocessors. This moratorium would remain in effect for 18 months or \nuntil Congressional legislation on this issue is enacted. In addition, \nthis amendment would create a new 12 person federal panel to \ninvestigate the issue and report back to the Congress and the \nPresident. I find it remarkable that one week after tearing down \nbarriers to mergers and increased efficiencies in the financial sector, \nwe are now considering doing the opposite for agribusiness, an industry \nin part responsible for delivering the safest and most economical food \nsupply in the world. What kind of message for American competitiveness \nwould we be sending to the business world by placing such an arbitrary \n18 month moratorium on only certain actors within a particular \nindustry?\n  Unlike most people here in the Senate, I have actually run a food \nprocessing business. I have had to meet a payroll, efficiently produce \na high quality product, endure all of the bureaucratic government \nregulations--and do it all at a competitive price the consumer was \nwilling to pay. I had to go out there and compete in the marketplace. \nFrom my experience, I can tell you that it is a lot more competitive, \nat least in the frozen vegetable business, than proponents of this \namendment would have you believe. I am afraid that the Wellstone \namendment, which has not been subject to Senate hearings or markup in \ncommittee is overreaching and blatantly unfair to many honest business \npeople in the agriculture sector.\n\n  We all know that revolutionary innovations have developed in \ntechnology, marketing, and food production and processing over the last \none hundred years. Our country has shifted from an agrarian economy to \nan industrial economy to an information technology and service economy. \nToday American agriculture has become part of a global marketplace. \nThis is a far cry from the turn of the century when many if not most \nAmericans were directly employed in food production and many producers \ndistributed their goods largely within their own local area. The \nagribusiness sector--from processors and brokers to suppliers and \ngrocers--has changed with the times as well; just like the small farmer \nbuying land from his neighbor to add production acreage, many food \nprocessors and agribusinesses have found it helpful, if not imperative, \nto band together to meet the challenges of the new economy and, \nultimately, the demands of the consumer.\n  It is demand of the consumer that I believe is a large reason for the \ngrowing disparity between the food dollar paid at the retail level and \nthe cash received by farmers for their crops. Today's consumer is \ndemanding greater convenience, enhanced nutritional value, choices in \npackaging, low fat and nonfat products, faster and easier to prepare \nitems--all values usually added to the product after it leaves the \nfarm. In addition, all of these new products have to be marketed in \nsome way so that the customer knows they are available and attaches \nvalues to the brand names. And, of course, these products must be \noffered at a price the consumer is willing to pay.\n  There are a host of reasons why companies find it in their best \ninterest to merge or why one company agrees to be acquired by another. \nCertainly, any of my colleagues that have experience in the business \nworld understand that there are occasions when businesses, searching \nfor the greatest efficiencies and competitive advantage, find the need \nto sell an underperforming or unprofitable division. There may be \nanother business out there with the right mix to take these divisions \non and make them efficient and profitable. In some instances, \nbusinesses that are failing would have to close their doors altogether \nif there is no willing buyer to come in and restructure the company. If \nthere is no buyer for these businesses, the alternative is simply to \nsee these jobs lost. This ability to adjust to the market and the \nchanging demand of consumers is a fundamental component of our free \nenterprise system. Now, I am aware that a provision of the Wellstone \namendment might allow businesses in severe financial distress to \nrequest a waiver from Janet Reno, but that option strikes me as \nespecially bureaucratic and time-consuming.\n  Despite their portrayal as the oppressor of family farmers, many \nagribusinesses are family-owned operations or small businesses. \nAlthough $10 million in assets or annual sales sounds like a lot, when \nconsidering the capital-intensive nature of many of these food \nprocessing and support businesses, it is not an uncommon threshold to \nsurpass. Many of these business-owners and entrepreneurs are depending \non their businesses to serve as their nest egg for retirement. The \nWellstone proposal would prevent an unknown number of families in these \ncircumstances from selling their business to whom they pleased.\n  Even worse, the Wellstone proposal only applies to certain \nagribusinesses--it specifically exempts agriculture cooperatives. Many \nco-ops are large agribusinesses in their own right that have also \nacquired smaller companies in recent years. Yet, under the Wellstone\n\n[[Page S14508]]\n\namendment, they would be in direct competition with other agriculture \nbusinesses and free from the requirements of this moratorium.\n  Mr. President, with this proposal, you would be led to believe that \nthe Justice Department has failed to uphold our federal antitrust laws. \nHowever, that has not been the case. In the case that set off much of \nthe concern in the first place, the Cargill-Continental Grain \nacquisition, the Department of Justice allowed the deal to go through \nonly after the companies divested four port elevators, four river \nelevators, a rail terminal, and made a number of other concessions to \nenhance competition. The Justice Department intervened and required \nsimilar divestiture before approving the Monsanto Corporation's \nacquisition of DeKalb Genetics Corporation, ensuring continued \ncompetitiveness in the genetically-modified seed industry. Another \nannouncement came just last week with respect to the merger of New \nHolland and Case Corporations, major farm equipment suppliers. I know \nthe definition of supplier in this amendment exempted farm equipment, \nbut many farmers were concerned about the potential implications of \nthis merger, nonetheless. In this case, the Justice Department again \nrequired divestitures on the part of both companies. So, so I think the \nevidence is clear that the administration is looking at these merger \nproposals, and looking fairly carefully at what impacts they may have \nin the market, and enforcing federal antitrust law. Coming on the heals \nof last Friday's well-publicized victory for the Antitrust Division, I \nfind it astounding that there are those that would imply this is an \nagency that is sleeping on the job.\n  In closing, I believe the matter at hand is a simple one. Mr. \nPresident, the Wellstone amendment is the wrong answer to the wrong \nquestion. This isn't the key to farm recovery--that lies with expanding \ntrade opportunities, government regulatory relief, and fulfilling our \npromises under Freedom to Farm. And this is not even the way to solve \nany flaws that may exist with our current antitrust laws. Those \nsolutions must be developed with the scrutiny and public hearings of \nthe Judiciary and Agriculture Committees. Do we want to set a precedent \ntoday by placing this kind of moratorium on business activity for one \nparticular industry and treat them differently than all other \nbusinesses? Do we want to take a sweeping and unprecedented step of \npushing a merger moratorium on an unknown number of businesses that \nplay key roles in our food chain? I hope my colleagues will agree with \nme that the correct answer to both questions is no and that the prudent \nstep to take here is to accept Chairman Hatch's offer to have \ncomprehensive hearings on the matter early next year and take \nsubsequent appropriate action in a way that is fair to our farmers, our \nbusinesspeople, and our consumers, alike. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in opposition to the Wellstone amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the face of American agriculture is being \nchanged dramatically by the quickening pace of mergers, buyouts, \ntakeovers and vertical integration. Over the years, farm families have \nsurvived bad weather and ups and downs in the markets. They have \nadapted to new technologies, new ways of buying production inputs and \nnew ways of marketing what they produce.\n  But today farm families are being hit by a tidal wave of economic \nconcentration and consolidation that is threatening their survival in a \nway that is unlike anything in the past. The pace of consolidation is \nbeing driven even faster by the disastrously low commodity prices of \nthe past couple of years. These are deeply troubling times for anyone \nconcerned about the future of the family farm--and we are quickly \nrunning out of time to turn things around.\n  Senator Wellstone's amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, is vitally \nnecessary because I believe that we need a time-out from the headlong \nrush towards ever greater economic concentration and consolidation in \nagriculture. All this amendment does is put a hold on mergers and \nacquisitions involving large agribusiness firms for a period of 18 \nmonths or until legislation is in effect addressing market \nconcentration in the agricultural sector, whichever comes first. So it \ncan't be longer than 18 months.\n  All this amendment is saying is that we have to take a pause to get a \nhandle on the mergers and acquisitions in agriculture that I believe \nhave gotten out of hand and out of control. Some will say the amendment \ngoes too far, as my friend from Oregon just said. But I think the \nmerger mania in agriculture has gone way too far already. We must act \nbefore the family farm is driven to total extinction.\n  I tell my colleagues, there is no more critical issue to the farm \nfamilies of America than the rapid and sweeping changes taking place in \nthe economic structure of agriculture. It is an issue that I believe \novershadows even the record low commodity prices that are devastating \nrural America. Farm families and their communities have their backs \nagainst the wall, and they are fighting for survival. They are being \noverrun by economic forces far more powerful than they are. The least \nwe can do is to provide a time-out before it is too late.\n  Far too little attention has been paid to the tremendous consequences \nof transforming American agriculture from a system of independent \nfamily farms to one based on the corporate industrial model. Ever \ngreater economic concentration in the food and agricultural sector \naffects not only farm families and rural communities. Everyone eats. \nConsumers ought to ask whether they will enjoy the same high-quality \nfood at reasonable cost if our food supply is in the hands of a few \ncorporate giants instead of many thousands of family farms.\n  Make no mistake about it, the sweeping consolidation in the food and \nagricultural sector is not about productive efficiency. When it comes \nto efficiency, nobody beats the independent family farm. What is taking \nplace is about the corporate bottom line: stock deals, positioning in \nthe market, and capitalizing on economic power. Is it in the best \ninterests of this country to have a food and agricultural system \ndominated by the principles and standard operating procedures of Wall \nStreet? Does it make any sense to continue down a path of ever \nincreasing economic power and consolidation among agribusiness firms \nwhile family farmers are driven off the land?\n  The underlying principle of our Nation's antitrust laws is that we \nare all better off with a system of full, free, and fair competition in \nthe markets. The rapidly growing economic concentration in the food and \nagricultural sector stands this principle on its head. We have to ask \nwhy the antitrust laws on the books are not working to stem the tide of \neconomic concentration in agriculture.\n  Now, the speaker before me--I listened carefully--said over and over \nagain that we shouldn't be interfering in the marketplace. Well, there \nare times when we must interfere in the marketplace because unbridled \nexploitation of the marketplace leads to concentration, undue economic \npower, and monopoly practices. If you don't believe me, look what has \nhappened with Microsoft. Why did we have the Clayton and Sherman \nAntitrust Acts in the first place? Because unbridled economic power led \nto more and more concentration, more and more monopolies, and less and \nless competition.\n  I believe in the marketplace, but the marketplace must be tempered. \nThe marketplace must be tempered by adequate rules and regulations and \nlaws that keep one party from becoming so big it can squash out all \neffective competition. So to say we shouldn't interfere in the \nmarketplace is to fly in the face of what our stated policy has been \nfor the last century in America.\n\n  We do interfere in the market. We interfere in the market to try to \nkeep it a free and open and fair and competitive market. Otherwise, let \nthe big get bigger, let them buy out everybody else, and let them \nsquash competition. Why bring a case against Microsoft? Because I think \nit is being shown that Microsoft is engaging in anticompetitive \nbehavior to squash out competition so that they can charge the \nconsumers what they want to charge for what they offer, not what \ncompetition in an open market would bring to the consumers of software, \nbut whatever\n\n[[Page S14509]]\n\nMicrosoft wants to charge for what they choose to sell because they can \neffectively squeeze out everyone else.\n  I don't buy the argument that we have to keep our hands off of the \nmarket. We tried that in the past, and it brought us to the brink of \nruination. So you have to have interventions periodically. I think \nwhere we are in agriculture now begs us for that kind of intervention.\n\n  Now, there is one other important aspect of this amendment. It sets \nup an Agriculture Concentration and Market Power Review Commission to \ntake a close look at economic concentration in agriculture and to make \nrecommendations on changes in antitrust laws and other Federal laws and \nregulations in order to ensure that there is a fair and competitive \nmarketplace for family farmers and rural communities.\n  Again, in that connection, I want to say that the present Justice \nDepartment has been the most active in the area of antitrust \nenforcement in agriculture of any Justice Department in my experience \nin Washington. So I commend the Attorney General and especially commend \nassistant Attorney General Joel Klein for bringing new life to \nantitrust enforcement in agriculture and elsewhere. Incidentally, I \ncongratulate Mr. Klein for his wisdom and judgment in taking on the \nMicrosoft case, because I believe if this case had not been pursued, \nMicrosoft would have gotten even bigger and bigger, and more and more \nof any competition would have been snuffed out. I think this case is \ngoing to help consumers.\n  But the Justice Department can only do so much under the present \nstate of our antitrust laws. We must keep in mind that the antitrust \nlaws on the books were written around the close of the 19th century, \nand we are now at the beginning of the 21st century. The economic \nstructure of agriculture and agricultural businesses has changed \ndramatically in the intervening years. In addition, there have been \nmany court decisions interpreting and applying the general language of \nthe Sherman and Clayton Acts. Those decisions, quite frankly, have not \nall been favorable to the strong antitrust enforcement that I believe \nwe need in the area of our food and agriculture system.\n  So, at the end of this century, almost 100 years after the Sherman \nand Clayton Acts and after court decisions that I believe have \ninterpreted these laws in ways that are inimical to the best interests \nof family farms, this amendment will put a brake on the category of \nlarge agribusiness mergers and acquisitions for a period of time, 18 \nmonths, so we can have a careful review of economic concentration in \nagriculture and of what need we have for changes in the law to ensure a \nfair and competitive marketplace in agriculture.\n  There is a lot of rhetoric flying around about sustaining the family \nfarm in this body. This amendment allows us to address the greatest \nthreat to the survival of family farms now existing. This amendment \nprovides for a pause, a breathing spell, so family farms are not driven \nto extinction before we can even get a handle on what has happened.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Presdient, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor for just a \nmoment to express my support for the Wellstone amendment, as well. I \ncommend the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, as well as the \nSenator from Iowa, for their work and for the effort that this \namendment represents.\n  Basically, this amendment has a very simple purpose. It is simply to \ntake a deep breath, take a close look, and to give careful thought to \nwhat is happening in agriculture today. We all espouse the free \nenterprise system. We all say that we are enthusiastic advocates of \nreal competition, which is really the essence of the free enterprise \nsystem--competition. We all express our grave concern when we find \ncircumstances within the economy that are not competitive. Yet, as we \nlook at agriculture today, as we look at the tremendous economic power \nnow represented in fewer and fewer companies, with more and more \nmergers underway almost weekly, one has to ask, how much is enough? \nWhen do we undermine the very tenets of free enterprise by continuing \nto look the other way when these mergers are announced? We see it \nespecially in livestock. The latest announcement that Smithfield \nCorporation will be acquiring Murphy Farms illustrates the point. There \nare fewer buyers. There are fewer processors. There are fewer options. \nThere are fewer and fewer competitors.\n\n  Mr. President, when that happens, we reach a point where there is no \ncompetition. I am not one who is prepared today to say that there is \ncollusion in the market, that there is something illegal going on in \nthe market; but I am prepared to say today that what is happening in \nthe market is not healthy for agriculture. What is happening in the \nmarket goes the wrong way from competition. What is happening in the \nmarket today precludes real opportunities for producers to be able to \nensure a fair price, a real opportunity in the marketplace, a real \nsense of competition.\n  I was just told again last week that in many places in South Dakota, \na buyer will tell you that he will be in a location for one day for as \nlittle as one-half hour, and if you want to be able to sell your cattle \nto that buyer, you have to be there in that half hour's time, on that \nappointed day, or you don't sell cattle that week. I don't know how \nthat is competition. I don't know how we can say today this is the free \nenterprise system that we all defend and espouse. What is free \nenterprise when you have one buyer and all these producers lined up to \nsell, almost supplicating themselves to that buyer? That isn't free \nenterprise. That isn't what we say agriculture is supposed to be. Most \nimportant, that isn't ever going to allow us the confidence that we \nneed as we look to the future and encourage young people and encourage \nrural people to stay where they are. They need more confidence and more \nassurances than what we are giving them today.\n  So this amendment is really pretty simple. It just says, let's take a \ndeep breath, let's not do anymore until we have had a chance to analyze \nwhether or not our fears are being realized, whether or not we really \nhave any legitimate basis for concern, whether or not the situation is \ngoing from bad to worse. That is all we are saying. Once it happens, it \ncan never be undone. I doubt very much that we will ever go back and \nsay, OK, we are going to break up these companies, because that is the \nonly way it is going to assure that we have the kind of competitive \nenvironment that we need. I don't think that is in the offing in the \nshort term. So while we still have a chance to put everything on hold, \nto analyze whether or not this is good, why not simply say, let's take \na deep breath.\n  I personally don't believe that we ought to be content with just \nthis. I really worry about whether or not vertical integration in \nagriculture ultimately is going to destroy the young family farmer, or \nthe livestock producer. Once you have the processor in charge of every \nstep from to table, then you really don't have competition. More and \nmore, that seems to be the approach the large processors are taking--\nget involved in production, get involved in transportation, get \ninvolved in wholesaling, get involved in retailing, get involved in \nevery single aspect from top to bottom. I am concerned about vertical \nintegration.\n  It seems to me that when we made the decision to break up the old \ntelephone company back in the early 1980's we created a competitive \nexplosion the likes of which we never imagined, and from which we are \nstill benefiting today. We see things that are happening today that \nmake other countries' heads spin. We broke up a large company, and we \nmade progress the likes of which we could have never have anticipated. \nI would love to see the kind of competition, the kind of excitement, \nthe kind of enthusiasm in agriculture as we now see in \ntelecommunications.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will send the right message. I am \nhopeful that we can simply say, Look. At the very least, let's stop \nbefore we allow this to go any further for just a\n\n[[Page S14510]]\n\nfew months--18 months. Let's make some good decisions, and calculate \nwhether or not this is good for the country and good for the \nagriculture industry.\n  I think it is a good amendment. I support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2648\n\n  (Purpose: To protect the citizens of the State of Vermont from the \n     impacts of the bankruptcy of electric utilities in the State)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside, and I call up amendment No. 2648, and ask that \nthe amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa (Mr. Grassley), for Mr. Jeffords, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2648.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n    TITLE ____--PROTECTION FROM THE IMPACT OF BANKRUPTCY OF CERTAIN \n                           ELECTRIC UTILITIES\n\n     SECTION ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Emergency Imported \n     Electric Power Price Reduction Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the protection of the public health and welfare, the \n     preservation of national security, and the regulation of \n     interstate and foreign commerce require that electric power \n     imported into the United States be priced fairly and \n     competitively;\n       (2) the importation of electric power into the United \n     States is a matter vested with the public interest that--\n       (A) involves an essential and extensively regulated \n     infrastructure industry; and\n       (B) affects consumers, the cost of goods manufactured and \n     services rendered, and the economic well-being and livelihood \n     of individuals and society;\n       (3) it is essential that imported electric power be \n     priced--\n       (A) in a manner that is competitive with domestic electric \n     power and thereby contribute to robust and sound national and \n     regional economies; and\n       (B) not at a rate that is so high as to result in the \n     imminent bankruptcy of electric utilities in a State; and\n       (4) the purchase of imported electric power by the Vermont \n     Joint Owners under the Firm Power and Energy Contract with \n     Hydro-Quebec dated December 4, 1987--\n       (A) is not consistent with the findings stated in \n     paragraphs (1), (2), and (3); and\n       (B) threatens the economic well-being of the States and \n     regions in which the imported electric power is provided \n     contrary to the public policy of the United States as set \n     forth in the findings stated in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to facilitate the public policy of the United States as \n     set forth in the findings stated in paragraphs (1), (2), and \n     (3) of subsection (a);\n       (2) to remove a serious threat to the economic well-being \n     of the States and regions in which imported electric power is \n     provided under the contract referred to in section \n     ____02(a)(4); and\n       (3) to facilitate revisions to the price elements of the \n     contract referred to in section ____02(a)(4) by declaring and \n     making unlawful, effective 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the contract as it exists on the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. ____03. UNLAWFUL CONTRACT AND AMENDED CONTRACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective on the date that is 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the contract \n     referred to in section ____02(a)(4), as the contract exists \n     on the date of enactment of this Act, shall be void.\n       (b) Amendment of Contract.--This title does not preclude \n     the parties to the contract referred to in section \n     ____02(a)(4) from amending the contract or entering into a \n     new contract after the date of enactment of this Act in a \n     manner that is consistent with the findings and purposes of \n     this title.\n\n     SEC. ____04. EXCLUSIVE ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Only the Attorney General of a State in \n     which electric power is provided under the contract referred \n     to in section ____02(a)(4), as the contract may be amended \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, may bring a civil \n     action in United States district court for an order that--\n       (1) declares the amended contract not consistent with the \n     findings and purposes of this title and is therefore void;\n       (2) enjoins performance of the amended contract; and\n       (3) relieves the electric utilities that are party to the \n     amended contract of any liability under the contract.\n       (b) Timing.--A civil action under subsection (a) shall be \n     brought not later than 1 year after the date of the amended \n     contract or new contract.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2648) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in reference to the bankruptcy bill, I am \npleased that the Senate has offered the managers' amendment. It greatly \nimproves the underlying bill and will improve the suggestion from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I am pleased we passed the Kohl-Sessions-Grassley-Harkin amendment on \nhomestead exemption.\n  I wish the drug amendment, which was adopted by a 50-49 vote earlier \nthis afternoon, had not been agreed to. I think it was the wrong \ndirection to go. But the Senate voted.\n  I regret that the Senate rejected the Dodd amendment. But I note that \nwith the efforts of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Utah, \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricielli, and myself, we narrowed \nthe number of amendments from over 300 to approximately 30. We are \nworking through them.\n  I should note just for the schedule that we have a number of \nDemocrats who have offered short time agreements on their amendments to \nexpedite getting their votes.\n  I thank Senators Feinstein, Schumer, and Dodd for their cooperation \nin getting very short time agreements on their amendments. I compliment \nthe Senator from Iowa. He and his staff worked with me and my staff, as \nwell as Senator Hatch and Senator Torricelli. We have cleared out an \nawful lot of what looked to be a totally unmanageable bill with the \nnumber of items we had before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, protecting America's children, our most \nvulnerable future leaders, is one of the highest obligations of \ngovernment. Foremost among the reasons for waging a war on illegal \ndrugs is the threat drugs pose and the damage they inflict on the \nchildren of America.\n  At the core, it has always been understood that drug policy is \nprimarily a federal responsibility. The vast majority of illegal drugs \nconsumed in the United States are produced outside of our borders, \nsmuggled into the country, transported across state lines, and \ndistributed via a complex multi-faceted criminal network. If we hope to \ncombat the spread of this cancer effectively, the federal government \nsimply must take the lead role.\n  The able Senator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, expressed that view \nwell when he said:\n\n       [W]hile our schools are the responsibility of states and \n     local communities, the federal government has a \n     responsibility to lead. . . . We must act now to ensure that \n     every child has the opportunity to learn in a safe and drug-\n     free school. . . . The message we send our children on drugs \n     is a real problem. When the message is anything short of zero \n     tolerance for drugs, we encourage drug usage by kids.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree absolutely. This recognition led me, along \nwith several other Senators, to introduce a bill in the past two \nCongresses to extend the provisions of the Gun-Free Schools Act to \nillegal drugs. A modified version of that bill was also introduced as \nan amendment to S. 254 earlier this year; that version was unanimously \nagreed to by the Senate.\n  Today, I am reintroducing that amendment as part of the Hatch-\nAshcroft-Abraham drug amendment, of which I am a proud cosponsor.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity once again to allow Senators to go \non record in support of the eradication of illegal drugs from our \nclassrooms. Simply put, my amendment conditions receipt of federal \neducation funds on state adoption of a policy of ``zero tolerance'' for \nstudent drug dealers. By zero tolerance, my amendment would require \nthat drug traffickers be expelled from school for not less than one \nyear.\n  Anyone who thinks this policy unduly harsh should consult the 1998 \nCASA National Survey of Teens, Teachers and Principals. Prepared by the \nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University \nunder the direction of President Carter's former HEW Secretary, Joseph\n\n[[Page S14511]]\n\nCalifano, the report states under the heading ``Drug Dealing in Our \nSchools'':\n\n       For too many kids, school has become not primarily a place \n     for study and learning, but a haven for booze and drugs. . . \n     . Parents should shutter when they learn that 22% of 12- to \n     14-year-olds and 51% of 15- to 17-year-olds know a fellow \n     student at their school who sells drugs. . . . Indeed, not \n     only do many of them know student drug dealers; often the \n     drug deals take place at school itself. Principals and \n     teachers may claim their schools are drug-free, but a \n     significant percentage of the students have seen drugs sold \n     on school grounds with their own eyes. . . . In fact, more \n     teenagers report seeing drugs sold at school (27%) than in \n     their own neighborhoods (21%).\n\n  The report goes on to detail that students consider drugs to be the \nnumber one problem they face, that illegal drugs are readily available \nto students of all ages, and that illegal drugs are now cheaper and \nmore potent than ever before. According to CASA, ``one in four \nteenagers can get acid, cocaine or heroin within 24 hours, and given \nenough time, almost half (46%) would be able to purchase such drugs.'' \nClearly, eliminating illegal drugs from America's classrooms is a \nrequired first step to restore order.\n  Impossible to calculate--the ill effects, disruptions, and violence \nassociated with the drug trade are not limited to those who are active \nparticipants. The lives and futures of children who want to learn are \noften sacrificed by those disruptive students who seek to victimize \ntheir classmates.\n  A clear link between school violence and drugs was found by the PRIDE \nsurvey, conducted by the National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug \nEducation, when it reported that:\n\n       Gun-toting students were 23 times more likely to use \n     cocaine; gang members were 12 times more likely to use \n     cocaine; and students who threatened others were 6 times more \n     likely to use cocaine than others.\n\n  The connection between drugs and school violence is apparent.\n  Mr. President, the devastation wrought by illegal drugs crosses all \ngeographic, political and economic boundaries. It is not confined to a \nregion of the country or a class of individuals. As one example, \naccording to the North Carolina State University's Center for the \nPrevention of School Violence (a remarkable organization that tracks \nthe incidence of school crime in North Carolina and suggests \npreventative measures), ``possession of a controlled substance'' has \nbeen either the first or second most reported category of school crime \nin my home state for the past four years. Regrettably, I suspect that \nmany other states share that dubious distinction as well.\n\n  In recognition of the federal obligation to foster safe schools, the \nCongress passed and the President signed the Gun-Free Schools Act in \n1994. Many commentators have, at least in part, credited that act with \nreducing the number of guns brought to our schools.\n  It is time to provide a logical and common sense extension of that \nact by focusing not merely on the gun but on why students take guns to \nschool in the first place. We must acknowledge that many children take \nguns to school either because they are involved in illegal activity or \nbecause they seek to protect themselves from those who are. A \ncomprehensive effort to rid our schools of weapons must eliminate the \nreasons why students arm themselves not merely prohibit the possession \nof weapons.\n  This realization is not lost on those who are on the ``front lines'' \nof our war on drugs. When surveyed, students, teachers, and parents \nexpress overwhelming support for the adoption of a zero tolerance \npolicy for drugs at schools. In fact, the closer they are to the \nproblem, the more enthusiastic they are in support of zero tolerance.\n  For example, the CASA study that I mentioned earlier found that 80% \nof principals, 79% of teachers, 73% of teenagers and 69% of parents \nsupport zero tolerance. Additionally, 85% of principals, 79% of \nteachers, and 82% of students believe this policy effective at keeping \ndrugs out of schools and believe that adoption of the policy would \nactually reduce drugs on their campus. In conclusion, the CASA report \nstated:\n\n       If these students believe them [zero tolerance policies] so \n     effective, these policies must make an impact on their \n     decisions to not bring drugs on campus. Given this, it seems \n     that schools . . . should implement and strictly enforce zero \n     tolerance policies.\n\n  Mr. President, this policy is firm but fair. The drug trade and its \nviolence have no place in America's schoolhouses. Schools should be a \nsafe haven for our children, fostering an environment that is conducive \nto learning and supportive of the vast majority of students who are \neager to learn. At the very least, our children and teachers deserve a \nschool free of fear and violence.\n  President Clinton, in his 1997 State of the Union address, stated \n``[W]e must continue to promote order and discipline, supporting \ncommunities that remove disruptive students from the classroom, and \nhave zero tolerance for guns and drugs in schools.'' Echoing that view, \nTexas Governor George W. Bush, in a major education speech last week, \ncalled for zero tolerance policies for disruptive students, stronger \nenforcement of federal laws on bringing guns into schools and greater \naccountability from schools that receive federal money for drug and \nsafety programs.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that the need to set high standards to \nprotect our children from the scourge of illegal drugs should be a \nsubject of broad bipartisan consensus. I hope that the Congress will \nheed President Clinton and Governor Bush's calls and that the Senate \nwill once again send a strong signal to all that we intend to give our \nchildren the support they need to grow up safe and drug-free.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I regret that I was unable to be \nhere for the votes yesterday on the minimum wage.\n  In the past, I have opposed increases in the minimum wage because of \nmy concern about the impact on small businesses, as well as the \ncombined effects of the 1996 minimum wage increase on jobs and the \neconomy. Many small enterprises operate on a very thin margin, and the \nimposition of additional costs could result in the closure of \nbusinesses and the loss of jobs. Such an outcome would serve only to \nhurt the very people we are trying to assist.\n  I understand how difficult it is to make ends meet in today's \neconomy. Many families are struggling and many small business people \nwho create the vast majority of new jobs are clinging to solvency. I \nbelieve Congress must work to enact measures to strengthen the small \nbusiness sector, bolster job creation, and enhance job security, \nincluding further responsible tax and regulatory relief.\n  I oppose the Kennedy amendment because it combines a minimum wage \nincrease with an additional tax burden on the very businesses that will \nface higher personnel costs. I support the Domenici amendment to \nincrementally increase the minimum wage because it also provides real \ntax and regulatory relief for small business owners who may be \nadversely affected by the additional costs they will incur.\n  The Domenici amendment allows minimum-wage workers to earn a better \nliving. At the same time, it provides $18.4 billion in tax relief over \nfive years to small business people across America to help them offset \nthe increased employee costs of this minimum wage increase. Small \nbusinesses will now be allowed to increase their expensing to $30,000, \nand benefit from a permanent extension of the Work Opportunity Tax \nCredit and a repeal of the temporary Federal Unemployment Tax Act \nsurtax. Furthermore, this amendment allows 100-percent deduction for \nself-employed health insurance, phases in health-insurance and long-\nterm care above-the-line deductions, and makes pension reform proposals \nto increase employees' financial security. This tax relief is entirely \npaid for by closing corporate tax loopholes in the first year and then \nusing a small portion of the projected non-Social Security surplus in \nthe ensuing years, without dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  One aspect of the Domenici amendment that troubles me is the \nincreased deductibility of business meals and entertainment costs. I \nhave always opposed allowing a tax deduction for the so-called ``three-\nmartini power lunch'' for corporate executives, although this amendment \nlimits the benefits of this tax deduction to small businesses and self-\nemployed individuals. I question whether this tax deduction is the \nhighest priority of small businesses, or whether there are other more \nbroadly\n\n[[Page S14512]]\n\nbeneficial tax breaks that could have been included in this bill to \nassist those businesses most likely to be affected by the minimum wage \nincrease.\n  Mr. President, because the Domenici amendment combines a $1.00 \nincrease in the minimum wage with tax and regulatory relief to offset \nthe negative impact of increased personnel costs on small businesses \nand the economy as a whole, I would have voted for the \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14512-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, as daylight hours shorten and brightly \ncolored leaves fall from the tree branches, we gradually descend into \nthe winter season. The master hand of nature, after painting the hills \nglorious colors, leaves us with a chilly palette of greyer skies, \nleafless trees, and a long wait before the spring blossoms emerge from \ntheir underground bulbs. Although we may feel the bounce in our step \nthat a crystal clear, crisp-aired fall day can bring, with the sun \nshining brightly as it makes its low arc across the sky, we are \nreminded during this time of the year of the cycles of the natural \nworld. We are reminded that all too soon, we will be in the quarter of \nthe year naturally suited for hibernation--a season, despite festive \ngatherings, associated with the death needed for renewal. During this \nseason we celebrate Veterans Day to honor veterans who, with their \ndeath and sacrifice, have renewed and sustained the freedom and promise \nof our great republic.\n  Each year at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh \nmonth we celebrate the end of the fighting in Europe in 1918 that ended \nthe Great War. When I was a boy, we called this day Armistice Day in \nhonor of the Armistice between the Allies and the Central Powers that \nended the horrible trench warfare that had torn Europe apart. In 1926, \nCongress proclaimed that Armistice Day would be celebrated yearly with \nan annual observance of ``thanksgiving and prayer and exercises \ndesigned to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding \nbetween nations.''\n  After World War II, on June 1, 1954, Congress approved the Veterans \nDay Act that changed the name of Armistice Day to Veterans Day. I am \nthe only Member of Congress who was serving in Congress at that time \nwho is still serving today. Officially, on Veterans Day, we celebrate \nand recognize the sacrifices of our nation's soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen to protect our freedoms during all of the wars and conflicts \ninvolving the United States. That same year, President Eisenhower \ndeclared that on Veterans Day, Americans should ``solemnly remember the \nsacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly, on the seas, in the \nair, and on foreign shores, to preserve our heritage of freedom, and \nlet us reconsecrate ourselves to the task of promoting an enduring \npeace so their efforts shall not have been in vain.''\n  From the beginning of our nation, America's sons and daughters have \nbeen ready to answer a call to duty. In particular, West Virginians \nhave a proud enviable record of service to this country in the perilous \ntimes of war and conflict. Of the twenty-five million living veterans, \none-hundred-ninety-thousand reside in the great State of West Virginia. \nMore than ten-percent of the people of West Virginia are veterans who \nhave served our nation proudly--that is more than ten of every one-\nhundred West Virginians. This tradition of dedication to serving is \nsomething I am proud of as a West Virginian. Through the turmoil and \nchange of the twentieth century, one thing has remained constant--the \ndedication and commitment of our veterans to the survival and strength \nof this nation.\n  Largely through the might of our Armed Forces, the United States \nenjoys an unprecedented position of international leadership. Yet, the \npromise of lifelong health care that this country made to our men and \nwomen in uniform has been threatened, not by the aggression of a \nforeign power, but by inadequate funding. Caring for America's veterans \nis an ongoing cost of war. As America's veterans grow older, they \nrequire increased dependence on health care services. But, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs cannot be expected to provide the \nnecessary care which veterans will need in Fiscal Year 2000, at the \nFiscal Year 1999 level for veterans health care services. Veterans \nshould not be expected to wait in longer lines, and travel farther for \nservices. They must be provided quality service. If we fail in this \nobligation, how can we justify sending more and more young service \nmembers into harm's way? How can we expect our children and \ngrandchildren to volunteer for military service in the future, if we \nare not prepared to keep promises to veterans today?\n  This year the budget came dangerously close to failing to provide for \nhealth care that veterans need and deserve. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs warned many veterans that they might not be eligible for \nveterans medical care services in Fiscal Year 2000. The strong need for \nquality medical care for veterans, and a sense of duty to these men and \nwomen who valiantly served, caused me to work very hard to meet the \nfunding level for veterans' medical care recommended by the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs--some $1.7 billion above the \nAdministration's budget request. I would like to thank my colleagues \nwho supported my efforts to raise the funding level for veterans \nmedical care to $19 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. This level of funding \nwill enable the VA to continue to provide quality health care to \nveterans, and will prevent the kinds of cuts in services that many \nveterans feared would place their eligibility for care in question.\n  As a nation, we are good about honoring our war dead, with memorial \ndays such as Veterans Day, and with memorials of stone that dot our \ncapital and other towns and cities across the country. We need to be as \ngood to our living veterans. Today, many of our veterans are still \naffected by the time they spent in service. We can best honor them by \ncontinuing to provide a high quality of medical care. We can also honor \nour veterans by continuing to search for answers to questions of \nservice-related injury, and by providing for those who have experienced \nsuch injuries. We must also work to prevent such injuries from \nrecurring. For instance, we must remain committed to pin-pointing the \ncause of the illness of Gulf War Syndrome. Recent reports issued by the \nDepartment of Defense indicate that certain substances our military men \nand women were directed to take during their service in the Gulf War \ncannot be ruled out as causes for this syndrome. We must continue to \nfocus our attention on narrowing in on the cause of the symptoms \nexperienced by more than one-hundred thousand Gulf War Veterans.\n  So, this year on Veterans Day, let us reflect on the men and women \nwho have valiantly served our Nation, both living and dead. Upon \nreflection, we should realize the need to recommit ourselves to \nhonoring veterans, not only with unfurled flags and patriotic up-tempo \nmarches but also by serving them as they have served our nation. As the \nleaves fall from the trees, and our veterans age and pass on, we must \nremember that what has always kept the tree of liberty safe and strong \nthrough the frost and chill of many brutal winters is the commitment of \nour veterans to nourish the roots of freedom.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the selfless men \nand women who have sacrificed so much in order to secure and protect \nthe freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today. Volunteering one's \nbody and mind without thought of consequence in order to safeguard the \nideologies our country holds dear, is the utmost act of patriotism. \nToday we recognize the importance of the hardships endured by our \nNation's veterans to preserve peace and freedom.\n  As a Senator from New Mexico, I take great pride in the fact that New \nMexico has among the top ten highest per capita military retiree \npopulations in the Nation and honor the prominent contributions they \nhave made towards the preservation of our great Nation.\n\n[[Page S14513]]\n\n  During World War II, members of the 200th and 515th Coast Artillery, \nbetter known as the New Mexico Brigade, repelled Japanese attacks for 4 \nmonths before being overwhelmed by disease and starvation. Following \nthe ensuing capture, the survivors of the battle were subjected to an \n85-mile ``Death March.'' These men were then held for more than 40 \nmonths in Japanese prisoner of war camps. Of the 1,800 men in the New \nMexico Brigade, less than 900 returned home and a third of those who \ndid died within a year of returning to the U.S. The bravery exhibited \nby the New Mexico Brigade is characteristic of the men and women that \ncomprise our Armed Forces.\n  As a nation, we have an obligation to provide for those who have \nrisked everything to the benefit of all. I am pleased that this session \nof Congress has produced legislation which will increase funding for \nveterans health care by $1.7 billion to a total of $19.6 billion for \nfiscal year 2000. However, we need to remain vigilant in our commitment \nto provide for those who are charged with the considerable task of \ndefending this country from potential adversaries.\n  Today I would like to pay tribute to our veterans and I am sure that \nmy colleagues will join me in honoring these valorous men and women for \ntheir dedicated service to our great Nation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one day a year, on Veteran's Day, America \npauses to recognize the sacrifices and the contributions of our \nveterans. We express our gratitude to all those who have served our \nnation so well. For all of the veterans being honored today, I salute \nyou for your service and your dedication to our country.\n  All veterans deserve our gratitude for their service. But it is \nespecially fitting that we take special notice of the nation's World \nWar II and Korean War veterans.\n  America is losing 1,000 of its World War II and Korean War veterans \nevery day. As they pass, so does our opportunity to pay tribute to them \ndirectly.\n  Tom Brokaw has called the World War II generation the ``Greatest \nGeneration.'' He captured the essence of this generation in his recent \nbook by that name. As he stated:\n\n       The World War II generation came of age during the Great \n     Depression and the Second World War and went on to build \n     modern America--men and women whose everyday lives of duty, \n     honor, achievement, and courage gave us the world we have \n     today.\n\n  The World War II generation and the size of its veteran population \nare unique in American history. Sixteen million Americans served in \nWorld War II from 1941 to 1945.\n  That war united all Americans--men and women; blacks and whites; rich \nand poor; old and young. My oldest brother Joe gave his life, and Jack \nserved with great courage on PT-109 in the Pacific.\n  As much as we owe the World War II generation, we are still waiting \nfor the construction of a national memorial in Washington to their \nservice. At last, a site on the Mall has been selected and a design has \nbeen chosen for the National World War II Memorial. We owe it to these \nextraordinary veterans to complete it without delay, so that as many of \nour World War II veterans as possible can see the nation's enduring \nmonument to their service.\n  We also honor these veterans by ensuring they receive the hard-earned \nbenefits they so eminently deserve. I remain concerned about the \nhealthcare budget of the Veterans' Administration. Health costs \ncontinue to rise and the budget has not kept pace. We have an ongoing \nresponsibility to provide every veteran with adequate heath care. This \nyear's VA budget includes a 1.7 billion dollar increase, and we must \ncontinue to do all we can so that veterans receive their fair share in \neach year's budget.\n  In addition, as the number of older veterans continues to grow, the \nVeterans Administration must find a way to provide long-term care. The \nVA published an advisory report on this issue last year, but their \nrecommendations were far from adequate. We need to pursue this issue \nnext year, and develop more specific initiatives.\n  Another challenge we face is to deal with the increasing concern that \ntoday's generation is estranged from the military. Only 6 percent of \npeople under the age of 65 have ever served in the armed forces. \nCompare that with the fact that half of men over 50 have had at least \ntwo years of military service. In the years ahead, when we no longer \nhave the Greatest Generation--The World War II Generation--as our \nmodel, we will have to do much more to guarantee that our society keeps \nour armed forces strong and able to meet any threat to our country.\n\n  David Broder, the senior Washington Post journalist and a veteran \nhimself, recently expressed his concern about the growing civilian-\nmilitary gap. He stated:\n\n       The fact that no one younger than their mid-forties has \n     even faced the possibility of being called-up for military \n     service is one of the most significant generational divides \n     in this country.\n\n  Clearly, this is cause for concern. The nation must work harder to \npreserve and strengthen the duties of citizenship that our veterans \nsymbolize for all of us.\n  The military has traditionally been an effective way for America's \nyouth to serve the nation. It is troubling that today almost two thirds \nof the nation's youth say they would not join the armed forces. Twenty \nyears ago, only 40 percent said that. Since the Persian Gulf War, the \ninterest among 16 to 21 year olds in enlisting has dropped from 34 \npercent to 26 percent. Last year the Army asked young adults:\n\n       If you want to do something beneficial for your country, \n     are you more likely to do it in the military or in a civilian \n     job?\n\n  Two to one who responded said:\n\n       In a civilian job.\n\n  Prosperity and complacency may explain such answers, but they do not \njustify them. Because of our nation's veterans, America is the greatest \nin the world, free from any major challenge from any other nation. The \nskillful work and dedication of our veterans have enabled our children \nand grandchildren to enjoy unparalleled national security and economic \nprosperity.\n  It is imperative in our democracy that citizens remain proud of the \nmilitary and continue to respect and appreciate the sacrifices of those \nwho serve.\n  As President Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address:\n\n       Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, \n     that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any \n     hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the \n     survival and the success of liberty.\n\n  Million of Americans were inspired by these words, and our obligation \nis to continue that inspiration into the next century, so that a new \ngeneration will continue to ask not what their country can do for them, \nbut what they can do for their country.\n  The reduction in the population of veterans is being felt in Congress \nas well. The proportion of members of the House and Senate who have \nserved in the military has dropped from more than 75 percent in 1971 to \nless than 34 percent today.\n  Without the World War II and Korean generations, we will have to pay \nspecial attention to ensure that our society does not forget about our \nVietnam, Gulf and Cold War veterans, or view their contributions with \nany less significance.\n  The veterans of these more recent wars did not come home to the \nfanfare that accompanied the Allied victory in World War II. But their \nsacrifices and contributions to our nation's defense and to the \nprotection of our democracy are immeasurable. As a nation, it is \nimperative that we continue to recognize the service of these veterans \nand pay tribute to their sacrifices.\n  To help ensure that our nation remembers all of its veterans, I \nsupported a Resolution this year that expresses the Sense of the \nCongress that the third Monday in April be designated as ``In Memory \nDay.'' That Day will recognize the Vietnam Veterans who have died as a \nresult of illnesses and conditions associated with service in the \nVietnam War.\n  We must honor the missing too. Today, over 80,000 American servicemen \nremain unaccounted for from all our nation's wars, including \napproximately 10,000 from the Vietnam and Korean Wars.\n  We must never forget our missing veterans. And we must never give up \nthe effort to bring them home.\n  On behalf of the nation's disabled veterans, I strongly support the \nDisabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a national \nmemorial to honor all disabled veterans. Recently, Miss America 1999, \nHeather\n\n[[Page S14514]]\n\nFrench of Kentucky, testified before the Senate on behalf of this \nmemorial. During her Miss America pageant, she chose veterans as her \ncause, and she is emphasizing veterans issues throughout her reign. It \nis commitments and gestures of goodwill like hers that will keep \nAmerica proud of its armed forces and the sacrifices of its veterans.\n  The cornerstone of our military preeminence rests on many factors, \nbut the most critical is its people. Without men and women willing to \nvolunteer for military duty, we will not be able to respond to crises \naround the globe that threaten our vital interests. We need cutting-\nedge weapon systems. But we also need dedicated service members to \noperate these systems.\n  As we do more to take care of the veterans of today, we must never \nlose sight of our obligation to take care of the veterans of tomorrow. \nThis year Congress passed the broadest and most sweeping improvements \nin military pay and benefits in over twenty years. The new law calls \nfor a well-deserved 4.8% pay raise for military personnel--the single \nlargest pay raise for servicemen and women since 1982. It also expands \nauthority to offer additional pay and other incentives to critical \nmilitary specialties, and it improves retirement benefits for those who \nare serving now.\n  The military now faces one of the most difficult recruiting and \nretention challenges in many years. A major reason for the current \nproblem is the strong U.S. economy. But the demands of far-flung \nmilitary operations in recent years have also taken their toll on our \ntroops. Today's military is a smaller force, and yet it is also a more \nactive force, and we have been slow to recognize the problems that are \nbuilding.\n  In the past year alone, our servicemen and women conducted combat \noperations in Kosovo and Iraq. They are serving as peacekeepers in \nBosnia, and as humanitarian support personnel in Central America. All \nof these demands are in addition to the day-to-day operations and \nexercises at home and overseas in which the military participates \nthroughout the year.\n  Massachusetts is a major part of all these operations. This past \nyear, Guard and Reserve units from Massachusetts were deployed in \nsupport of Operation Northern Watch in Iraq, Hurricane Mitch relief in \nCentral America, and in Kosovo.\n  I especially commend all those who served during Operation Allied \nForce in Kosovo. This was the first war that America fought and won \nwithout a single casualty. Yet its victors came home to no parade \nmarking V-K day, and no celebration of heroes. Yet their bravery and \nskill saved thousands of innocent lives, and they deserve our highest \npraise.\n  The success of their operations was an impressive tribute to the \ncapability and dedication of our service men and women. Veterans, in \nparticular, should be proud, because it is their legacy and example \nthat have helped create the world's finest armed forces.\n  I am very disappointed that a provision to improve and expand GI Bill \nbenefits was not included in this year's Defense bill. The GI Bill has \nbeen a very successful and important program for the military and the \nnation. Over 2.3 million World War II veterans took advantage of the GI \nBill upon returning from the war. It has been called the greatest \ninvestment in higher education that any society has ever made, and a \nbrilliant and enduring commitment to the future.\n  In order for the GI Bill to continue its valuable work, it must \nevolve as our military forces evolve. Access to higher education is an \nincreasingly important benefit for servicemen and women in today's all-\nvolunteer, professional military.\n  Improvements are needed in the GI Bill to enhance the program's value \nand benefit to our troops, and to improve the bill's effectiveness as a \nrecruiting tool--and these improvements need to be enacted into law as \nsoon as possible.\n  Today's armed forces contain well-educated professionals who have \nchosen to serve their country in the military. We must treat them as \nthe skilled professionals they are--or we will lose them.\n  Finally, when we think about our veterans, it is easy to recall the \nEisenhowers, the Pattons, the MacArthurs, and the Powells. But we must \nnever forget the countless silent heroes--the fathers, brothers, \nsisters, sons, and daughters who served when their country called.\n  Stephen Ambrose, in his book ``Citizen Soldier,'' talks about the \n``can-do'' attitude of these quiet heroes that sets the American \nmilitary apart. He describes the Normandy landing, where the American \nSherman tanks were outgunned, and tells how skilled the Americans were \nin salvaging damaged tanks, patching them up, and sending them back \ninto action.\n  Ambrose writes:\n\n       Indeed no army in the world had such a capability. Within \n     two days of being put out of action by German shells, about \n     half the damaged Shermans had been put back on the line. Kids \n     who had been working at gas stations and body shops two years \n     earlier had brought their mechanical skills to Normandy. \n     Nearly all the work was done as if the crews were back in the \n     States, rebuilding damaged cars and trucks.\n\n  These were not professional soldiers, but average Americans. They \nleft their families and friends behind to fight because their nation \ncalled. It is the dedication and ingenuity of these silent heroes that \nhas made America great, and that made their Greatest Generation.\n  All of us in the Kennedy family have enormous respect for our \nveterans and their service to the nation. Today, on the eve of \nVeteran's Day, I recall once again the words of President Kennedy. He \nvisited the U.S. Naval Academy in August 1963, and spoke at a ceremony \nhonoring the new class of midshipmen. This is what he said about his \nservice in the Navy:\n\n       I can imagine a no more rewarding career. And any man who \n     may be asked what he did to make his life worth while, I \n     think can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction: \n     ``I served in the United States Navy.''\n\n  My brother was a Navy man, but I'm sure that veterans of all the \nother services feel the same way. I know I am both grateful and proud \nof my fellow veterans, and I honor, respect, and thank them for their \nservice.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on November 11, 1918, an armistice was \nsigned to end the ``War to end all wars.'' The country rejoiced. Then, \nas the jubilation subsided, the reality of what had occurred slowly \nentered the consciousness of the nation and shouts of joy turned to \ntears of grief and thanksgiving. For many who had gone to fight would \nnever return to their homes. And those who did come home would forever \nbe scarred by the sights, sounds, and atrocities of war.\n  How could we, as a nation, show our gratitude to those who had given \nso much? The answer, insufficient though it was, was to set aside a day \nto honor all those who had served--heroes and patriots--and to give \nthanks for their sacrifices for freedom.\n  Tomorrow is the day we have set aside. Tomorrow is the day we should \ntake special care to remember our veterans.\n  Throughout our nation's history there have been men and women willing \nto wear the uniform of the United States of America --willing to give \ntheir lives for freedom. Some people have asked ``why?'' The answer is, \nin the words of President Reagan, spoken at the 40th anniversary of D-\nDay: ``It is because you all knew that some things are worth dying for. \nOne's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, \nbecause it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised \nby man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight \ntyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you.''\n  Our nation depends on our armed forces. We depend on highly motivated \nand highly skilled men and women who are willing to go into harm's way \nat any time to defend American interests. And, when our troops leave \nthe service, we should not forget them.\n  Although the nation may only officially recognize the sacrifices of \nveterans every November on Veterans Day or every May on Memorial Day, I \nknow, personally, that in the hearts of the individual Americans, our \nveterans are remembered everyday. They are the husbands and wives, \nfathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters of us \nall. Almost one-third of the nation's population--approximately 70 \nmillion persons--are veterans, dependents of veterans, or survivors of \ndeceased veterans. I and my family honor and remember my brother Jess \nwho died in World War II and\n\n[[Page S14515]]\n\nmy brother-in-law Neil Brown, who died in Vietnam.\n  In the decades before the all-volunteer army and sophisticated high-\ntech weaponry, our military was made up of ordinary people. School \nteachers, ministers, machinists, truck drivers, bankers, and nurses, \nenlisted not just in the military, but in a noble enterprise. The story \nof America is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things \nand demonstrating uncommon endurance and valor.\n  Today, our armed forces are comprised of dedicated soldiers and \nsailors who have chosen to make the military a career or to contribute \ntheir skills for a time in an all-volunteer, professional fighting \nforce. But, the fact that our nation's Army and Navy have become more \nreliant on technology does not negate the risks of warfare. Nor does it \ncompensate for family separations, holidays spent thousands of miles \nfrom home, or meals eaten out of carton.\n  For Veterans' Day in 1954, President Eisenhower called upon us to \n``solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so \nvaliantly, on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve \nour heritage of freedom, and let us reconsecrate ourselves to the task \nof promoting an enduring peace so that their efforts shall not have \nbeen in vain.''\n  On this Veterans Day, I echo the words of President Eisenhower. I \nsalute all our veterans. I know that as long as there are Americans \nwilling to stand up and fight for our values, we will remain a free and \njust nation.\n  A while ago, I was moved to write a song about those who have \nsacrificed so much for our country. It is entitled, ``Morning Breaks at \nArlington.'' It is an expression of the emotion and pride I feel \nwhenever I think about the courage and dedication of our service men \nand women. Let me conclude with the lyrics:\n\n     Morning breaks on Arlington,\n     Warmed by rays of golden sun,\n     And all who pause in homage there\n     Feel a soft hush in the air.\n     Those who love their liberty\n     Bow the head and bend the knee,\n     And from their hearts they breathe a silent prayer.\n     ``Thank God for those who rest in honor there.''\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I salute the veterans of this nation. \nOn this Veterans Day, I want to pay tribute to the brave American \nsoldiers who fought long and hard battles so that we may all have our \nfreedom today. Veterans Day is about honoring and remembering these men \nand women who served our Nation, and it is for their families.\n  I am very fortunate to represent a state where military service is \nheld in such high esteem. And well it should be. I can't tell you how \nproud I am of all West Virginia veterans. Whether they served in \nwartime or peace, all made great sacrifices. Indeed, West Virginia has \none of the highest percentages of veterans of any state.\n  As I have often said, it was knowing and understanding West \nVirginians' deep patriotism and loyalty to their state and their \ncountry that first led me to seek a seat on the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, where I am now the Ranking Member. I am proud to \nserve veterans there.\n  The very fabric of our nation is wound through our veterans. Iwo Jima \nand Hamburger Hill, defeating Nazism and turning back Communism, \npunishing the brutality of Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Milosevic. Our \nnation is truly a beacon to the world for freedom and for opportunity \nbecause our men and women in uniform held that beacon aloft. And many \nof those men and women in uniforms were West Virginians.\n  It is not enough to take a day to commemorate these veterans, \nhowever. We owe them more than that. It is our responsibility to refuse \nto turn our backs on veterans who need health care, education benefits, \nand compensation for injuries incurred in service. It would be truly \ndisgraceful for these veterans, who have served our country so well and \nso valiantly, to feel that they have been forgotten except for this one \nday per year. That is why I take my work with and for veterans so very \nseriously.\n  I have fought very hard this year for veterans not only in West \nVirginia, but across the Nation. A critical need for veterans is long-\nterm care. Our veteran population is aging rapidly and it is our \nresponsibility to care for them. We owe them good long-term care now. I \nam dedicated to this need, and have been working hard to achieve this \nprovision for all veterans.\n  And there are other battles to be fought as well. Although veterans \nwho enroll with VA for their health care receive a very generous \nstandard benefits package, there is no provision for comprehensive \nemergency care. This is a serious gap in coverage for veterans, which \nis unacceptable. Large and unexpected emergency medical care bills can \npresent a significant financial burden to veterans.\n  Abraham Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg of dedication to ``unfinished \nwork . . . thus far so nobly advanced.'' Indeed, it is true that we \nhave work to complete. In order to truly commemorate our veterans, I \nhope my Senate colleagues will join me in my continuing battles for \nveterans.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, great words of tribute and reverent \nappreciation are put on paper every year in anticipation of the arrival \nof November 11th. With a solemn heart I struggle to meet the challenge \nof delivering those words in a way that is both humble and befitting of \nAmerica's heros. I offer these words in honor and in memory of every \nAmerican who has answered the call to arms; for every American who has \nfreely stepped forward under our Star Spangled Banner; and for every \nAmerican who died in the name of freedom. These men and women are among \nAmerica's greatest heros.\n  Our great nation has flourished and enjoys unprecedented prosperity \nto this day because of our veterans' willingness to give themselves in \nservice to the nation. For many this willingness meant sacrificing \ntheir lives so others might live free.\n  There are those among us who question whether or not our younger \ngenerations will prove, when the nation beckons, to be just as \ncommitted to the preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness as those we honor every November 11 proved to be.\n  I wonder how many Americans had those same doubts before the outbreak \nof WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, or Desert Storm? I wonder how many who \ndid go had dreamed that they would ever be called into the horror that \nis found on the battlefield?\n  Surely there were doubters. Surely there was apprehension and fear. \nBut, they answered freedom's call. Our national story and the story of \nthe American people is one of amazing courage in difficult times, and a \nproud tradition of triumph in the face of our enemies here and abroad. \nAmerica has always been ready to act. The footprints left and the blood \nspilled by our soldiers, airmen, marines, sailors, and coast guardsmen \naround the world remain as a testament to the indomitable American \nspirit, our collective faith in the power of freedom, and to the \npromise of a great future.\n  Over and over again, history has proven those who doubted America's \nresolve to be dead wrong. I am confident that our nation's future \nremains bright if we continue to exhibit the same steadfastness as our \nforefather's--never forsaking the gift of freedom that so many have \ngiven us.\n  Inspiration can be found in many ways. Just the other day I was \nlooking over Medal of Honor citations of some of Alabama's greatest \nheros. Taken together they represent a relatively small group of \nAlabamians but provide one of the greatest inspirations of hope for \nAmerica I can find.\n  Reading those citations made me think about how many people might \nhave doubted their commitment back then? How many people came in \ncontact with those heros never realizing they would one day prove \nthemselves worthy to wear the Medal of Honor? I choose to be excited by \nthose thoughts because America might well be called upon again to \ndefend the world against tyranny and evil, and I have no doubt that our \nmen and women in uniform would again stand with the same steadfast \nresolve exhibited by those we honor today. I take great solace in \nknowing that the patriotism and heroism of Americans has been a \nconstant for hundreds of years and will continue to be in the future.\n  America's veterans have made ours a great country. Hardly a person in \nAmerica is not associated in some way\n\n[[Page S14516]]\n\nwith a veteran. I hope you will thank them today for having answered \nthe call to serve, and for setting the footprints for our future. They \nhave indeed shown us the way into the 21st century.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, one of my constituents, Mrs. Virginia \nDoris of Warwick, Rhode Island, recently sent my late father a poem she \nhad written as a tribute to the veterans of World War II. I understand \nthat he agreed to insert her poem in the Congressional Record in time \nfor Veterans Day. I was honored when Mrs. Doris asked me to carry out \nthat task in his place.\n  Before I do so, I would like to take a brief moment to alert my \ncolleagues to Mrs. Doris's own contribution to the war effort.\n  During World War II, 23,000 Oerlikon-Gazda 20mm anti-aircraft guns \nwere manufactured in my home state of Rhode Island. Originally produced \nin Switzerland, these guns were critical to the Allied campaign--nearly \nevery ship in the fleet carried them by the end of the war.\n  And Virginia Doris was right in the thick of this arms production \neffort, working long hours in the drafting room of the Oerlikon-Gazda \ncommand center, located in downtown Providence. In a 1990 interview \nwith the Providence-Journal, Mrs. Doris described her years at the \ncenter ``as this marvelous period in my life.'' Equipped with what she \nrefers to as her ``turbo persona,'' Mrs. Doris was a valued and trusted \nmember of the Oerlikon-Gazda team.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mrs. Doris's poem, ``Ode to Comrades-In-\nArms: World War II,'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        ODE TO COMRADES-IN-ARMS\n\n\n                              world war ii\n\n     O, Heavenly Father, gaze upon the tombs\n     Of Patriots, foster their eternal plumes\n     Nourished in they omnipoint song of hallow,\n     Shed gentle tears to moist their marrow.\n\n     Enfolded in thine unchanging flame\n     Behold the farflung earthly frame,\n     Its pulsing marbles sculptured strong,\n     With ebbing currents and silvery thong,\n     Each graven with the threaded embrace\n     Is beaming out of seven-hued grace!\n\n     The mystic temple wakes the slumbering forms,\n     Takes the sacred dust they mercy warms,\n     And sounds the bugle near and clear white stone,\n     Close by these mounds which hold thy own.\n\n     We implore, O' Savior, here let sleeping lie,\n     `Till Heaven's luminous shadows prepare to die,\n     And join the manhood's folded-flock at night,\n     Psalms for bravery shall not pass in flight,\n     As raging battles, and girded loins, last time\n     To bond, lips to stir, a soldier's final clime!\n\n     O, Heavenly Father, mark their burden of decay,\n     The lives so young, war's lingering ebon fray,\n     Delivers them a shrouded throne, and solemn biers,\n     Can we not dream that those we loved are here?\n\n     Beckon them all in memory, as the vine\n     Whose tangled stems have long untwined\n     The crystal pillars, and clasp around\n     The sunken urns, the forlorn sounds;\n     With mournful message to our brothers, resign,\n     Tried and true, and close the broken line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14516-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OLE MISS HOSTING FIRING LINE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Senator Cochran and I are pleased to \nannounce that the University of Mississippi, which we fondly refer to \nas Ole Miss, will be hosting the final broadcast of the Emmy-winning \nPBS program ``Firing Line.'' Senator Cochran and I want to join the \nUniversity of Mississippi in congratulating all those affiliated with \n``Firing Line,'' including its host, Mr. William F. Buckley, Jr., and \nits producer, Mr. Warren Steibel, for their outstanding accomplishments \nduring 34 years of telecasts. Since 1966, Mr. Buckley and Mr. Steibel \nhave given the American public an opportunity to make informed \ndecisions on the important topics of the day by bringing all angles of \nan issue to the surface through their lively debates. No public affairs \nprogram in history has run longer with the same host.\n  Firing Line has brought a wide range of topics to the forefront since \njoining the PBS family on May 26, 1971, including ``Separation of \nChurch and State,'' ``Is Socialism Dead,'' ``Health Risks in a Nuclear \nEnvironment,'' and its final topic, ``The Government Should Not Impose \na Tax on Electronic Commerce.'' These and other topics have been \ndebated by Presidents George Bush, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, Gerald \nFord, and Richard Nixon; and prominent figures such as Margaret \nThatcher, Muhammad Ali, Henry Kissinger, and Bob Dole.\n  Mr. President, the past decade has brought many references to the end \nof the millennium. It is a tribute to programs of its kind that \n``Firing Line'' leaves the airways at this historic time. The guests, \ntopics, and fervor with which the issues have been approached \nthroughout the years on the program define the culture of the day. All \nattitudes and opinions have been expressed and analyzed, reflecting our \nsociety's nature to embrace conflict and discourse in the name of \nanswers and truth. William F. Buckley and Warren Steibel created an \neducational art form that did as much teaching as any other television \nprogram in memory.\n  This final telecast also marks the fourth time that the University of \nMississippi has hosted the ``Firing Line'' program.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today to \nrecognize the members of the Tatanka Hotshot Crew of the Black Hills \nNational Forest in South Dakota. This fall marks the end of the first \nfire season that this crew has been operational, and I am delighted to \nsay that it has proven to be an outstanding success.\n  Each year serious wildfires threaten national forests across the \nUnited States, burning thousands of acres of woodlands and endangering \nprivate property. Our first line of defense against these fires is the \nUnited States Forest Service, whose firefighters risk their lives in \narduous, often isolated conditions to bring wildfires under control.\n  The best of these teams are known as Hotshot crews--elite \nfirefighters who are sent to the worst fires, to do the most difficult, \ndangerous work necessary to protect our forests and the homes of nearby \nresidents. All around the country, these teams have been recognized for \ntheir skill and bravery.\n  Last year, we created the first of these elite teams ever to be based \nin the Black Hills National Forest. It is called the Tatanka Hotshots, \nafter the Lakota word for the bison that used to roam the Great Plains \nby the tens of thousands. The nearly two dozen members of this team, \nvirtually all of whom are Native American, come from diverse \nbackgrounds. Some came from South Dakota towns like Custer and \nAberdeen. Some joined the Tatanka crew from other hotshot teams or \nelite smokejumping units. Others are veterans of the Gulf War. Still \nothers are young individuals working their way through college. I am \nproud to say that after a year of intense training and working \ntogether, the Tatanka team quickly has become one of the most highly-\nregarded firefighting teams in the nation.\n  In addition to work in the Black Hills, the Tatanka crew spent 71 \ndays away on wildland fire assignments, accumulating 1,550 hours of \nwork in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and California. It conducted seven \nlarge firing/burnout operations, built miles of fireline, constructed \nhelispots and medivac sites, and conducted large tree falling \noperations in steep, hazardous terrain. Other noteworthy \naccomplishments included backpacking 6,500 pounds of sandbags up Mount \nRushmore to prepare for the July 4th fireworks display, tending the \ncommemorative crosses at the 1994 South Canyon fire fatality sites in \nColorado, and working in conjunction with the Tahoe Hotshots to rescue \na pack horse which had fallen off a mountain trail in California.\n\n[[Page S14517]]\n\n  Over the course of the summer, the Tatanka crew earned its reputation \nas a team that could be depended upon to get its job done quickly and \neffectively. Based upon its outstanding performance ratings and the \nrespect it earned from other highly regarded Hotshot crews, Forest \nService officials expect the team to attain National Type 1 status--the \nhighest rating a firefighting team can receive--before the 2000 fire \nseason, a full year ahead of schedule.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud of the accomplishments of this crew. \nForest fires are dangerous and unpredictable, and fighting them is one \nof the most difficult, physically-exhausting jobs of which I know. \nFirefighters spend days deep in forests and far from possible help, \ndigging fire lines and cutting trees to keep fires from spreading. In \njust one year, the Tatanka team has met these challenges head-on, and \nshown that it is equal to the toughest challenges our nation has to \noffer. I want to offer my congratulations to all of those who served on \nthe team. I am sure that they will have an outstanding future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14517-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14517-S14519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   OPPOSITION OF EFFORTS TO BLOCK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S RECENT \n                           ENFORCEMENT ACTION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about an \nissue which has surfaced recently in the national press, and now arises \nwith regard to the remaining appropriations bills before us. On \nNovember 3rd, the Justice Department filed seven lawsuits on behalf of \nEPA against electric utility companies in the Midwest and South. The \nlawsuit charged that 17 power plants illegally polluted the air by \nfailing to install pollution control equipment when they were making \nmajor modifications to their plants. This action is one of the largest \nenforcement investigations in EPA's history, and seeks to control \npollution which contributes to degraded air quality throughout the \nNortheast. I have recently learned that some of the defendants may be \nseeking relief from this enforcement action by adding a rider to one of \nthe remaining appropriations bills. I am speaking with my colleagues \nhere today in strong opposition to this effort. To seek relief for \npending violations of federal law through a rider without any \ncongressional hearing, debate, or voting record, is utterly \ninappropriate. It undermines the democratic process which is \nconstitutionally guaranteed to American citizens, and to the states \nwhich have similar cases pending.\n  The alleged violations are extremely serious. Congress has long \nrecognized the need to control transported air pollution. Provisions to \nstudy and address the issue have been included by major amendments to \nthe Clean Air Act. Yet the problem still remains and the statistics are \nstaggering. They demonstrate just how much older, Midwestern \npowerplants contribute to air pollution in the Northeast. For example, \none utility in Michigan emits almost 6 times more nitrogen oxides than \nall the utilities in the entire state of Connecticut. Ohio power plants \nproduce nearly 9,000 tons a day of sulfur dioxide, which directly \ncontributes to acid rain. One single plant in Ohio produces as much \nnitrogen oxide as all of the plants in the state of New York. \nApproximately 67 million people east of the Mississippi River live in \narea with unhealthy levels of smog. EPA estimates that every year that \nimplementation of regional pollution controls are delayed, there are \nbetween 200-800 premature deaths, thousands of additional incidences of \nmoderate to severe respiratory symptoms in children, and hundreds of \nthousands of children suffering from breathing difficulties. Now these \npolluting power plants want special relief during the court's review.\n  The alleged violations result from a portion of the Clean Air Act \nthat many refer to as the ``grandfathering'' provisions. When the Clean \nAir Act was amended in 1970 and 1977, there were two categories of \nrequirements: those for existing power plants, and those for new \nsources. At the time, most people envisioned that the older coal \nburning plants would soon be retired, making the additional controls \nfor old plants unnecessary. Instead, the life span of older coal fired \nplants has been extended by modifications to their facilities. Many of \nthe older coal fired plants have stayed around for three decades; and \ncoal power plants are now the largest industrial source of smog \npollution. Of the approximately 1,000 power plants operating today, 500 \nwere built before modern pollution control requirements went into \neffect.\n  Although the Clean Air Act did exempt older plants from the new \nstandards, it required that the plants meet a test of ``prevention of \nsignificant deterioration'' to protect the public when a plant \nundertook a major modification. Although the definition of ``major \nmodification'' has been debated, Section 111 of the Clean Air Act \nclearly states that a modification means ``any physical change . . . \nwhich increases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source \nor which results in the emission of any air pollutant not previously \nemitted.'' What is at stake in the recent enforcement action is the \nquestion of whether the power plants undertook major modifications \nwithout installing state of the art pollution controls, in violation of \nthis Clean Air Act requirement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Certainly.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand from some of the publicity around a similar \nsuit filed by the New York Attorney General that some of the \nmodifications being made to power plants were significant. For example, \none company allegedly replaced a reheater header and outlet, a \npulverized coal conduit system, the economizer, and casing insulation. \nWhile it is impossible to judge any of these types of modifications \nwithout additional information, it certainly seems like utilities \ncreated a loophole in the law to essentially rebuild the system without \nconsidering it as a major modification. Would a legislative rider on \nthis issue essentially pre-judge the court's findings as to whether the \nmodifications undertaken at the plant are indeed ``major''?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. With this rider, Congress would be substituting \nits opinion for the factual and legal analysis by the court. There will \nbe no opportunity for expert opinions to be heard. In fact, I \nunderstand there may even be discussions about trying to add rider \nlanguage which would allow modifications which would result in \nsignificant increases in emissions, by basing them on a unit's \npotential to emit pollution. This change is a significant departure \nfrom the current law, which requires that pollution controls be \nincluded when plants are making modifications that cause emissions to \nincrease. For example, a plant's potential to emit pollution may be at \n10 tons, while it actually emits 7. The test has been that if \nmodifications are made that raise emissions above the 7 tons, pollution \ncontrols are required to be instituted. Since the potential emissions \nare often much greater than actual emissions, actual emissions have \nbeen the threshold to trigger public health protections. A rider that \nwould seek to allow modifications to go forward would give utilities a \nlicense to continue to pollute our air while the enforcement action is \npending. In its worst form, it would also ``pre-judge'' the court's \ndetermination on these matters. These are major reasons why I oppose \nusing a rider to address this issue. It makes no sense for Congress to \nmake a statement on this complex issue with no opportunity for public \ndeliberation. I yield back to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand that some suggest that it would be impossible \nto achieve new pollution standards because of technological \nlimitations. I would like to address that point. States in Northeast \nhave already taken steps to reduce pollution to comply with Clean Air \nAct requirements, including instituting major controls on these older \npower plants ed plants. Northeast Utilities has spent $40 million in \nthe last 8 years to reduce fossil plant emissions. In a July 31, 1998 \nletter to Administrator Browner, Northeast Utilities wrote that ``in \nour experience the Merrimack Station selective catalytic reduction \ntechnology is effective in removing NOX, can be installed fairly \nquickly, and the installation has minimal impact on the availability of \nthe generating unit.'' Other companies, including Pacific Gas & \nElectric and Southern Company have made similar\n\n[[Page S14518]]\n\ninvestments at plants in Massachusetts. While these are only a few \nexamples, the experience of these companies is echoed by others. Real \nworld experience bears out the fact that solutions are available and \nare cost effective. It is also interesting to note that the Tennessee \nValley Authority, which is the subject of the enforcement action, \nrecently announced plans to implement state of the art ozone controls. \nThe solutions are out there, and as utilities in New England have \ndemonstrated, when there is a will there is a way.\n  I would like to address what is, in my opinion, the fundamental \nproblem with this rider. These power companies and our Department of \nJustice have a legal dispute, and that dispute should be settled \nthrough the legal process. I understand that some of the defendant \ncompanies, and some in the Senate, may feel that the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Department of Justice are being overzealous \nin pursuing this enforcement action or that there are politics at play \nhere. I respectfully and strongly disagree, and I urge my colleagues to \ndisregard such rhetoric. It has been estimated that as many as 1,000 \npeople each year die in Massachusetts from air pollution from power \nplants, automobiles and other sources. And, in particular, emissions \nfrom coal-fired plants, the dirtiest of which are outside my state, \ncause high levels of ozone, which increases the incidence of \nrespiratory disease and premature aging of the lungs. Acid deposition \nfrom sulfur can severely degrade lakes and forests. Mercury, which is \nhighly poisonous, accumulates in fish locally. In other words, there is \na very real cost to this pollution. Indeed, for some, the price they \npay is their very health and well being. I can accept that some of my \ncolleagues may feel that the Department of Justice or the Environmental \nProtection Agency is pursuing a flawed legal argument, but I cannot \naccept that the people who are alleging harm, who are paying the price \nfor this pollution, should be denied their day in court. The Department \nof Justice should not serve at the pleasure of Congress and defendants \nwith the power influence Congress, it should serve the law and the \npeople. I yield to my colleague Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Thank you. Certainly, many of our constituents have \nconcerns about how cost and service delivery would be implicated under \nany enforcement action. If the court were to impose fines and \ninjunctive requirements which would force power companies to go out of \nbusiness, I think we would all join in opposing that outcome. Yet time \nand again, we hear claims that such dire outcomes will occur when we \nask companies to comply with the law. But the evidence shows that \nenvironmental goals are being met without sacrificing economic growth. \nIn this circumstance, I believe the Department of Justice and EPA have \nbeen clear that their objective, if the violations are found to have \noccurred, is to require that the utilities make appropriate investments \nin pollution control. In fact, EPA has a demonstrated record on the \nkind of remedy it has sought in a similar case that involved another \nsegment of industry.\n  EPA recently undertook a similar enforcement action against the paper \nand pulp industry for similar major New Source Review violations. After \nlooking into the paper and pulp sector as part of its Wood Products \nInitiative, the EPA found New Source Review violations at roughly 70-80 \npercent of the facilities it investigated. Through its enforcement \naction, EPA was able to work with industry to generate emission \nreductions as high as 500 tons of volatile organic compounds. However, \nthese enforcement actions did not require that controls be put in all \nat once. Rather, a schedule was created to phase in controls so that \nthe pollution controls were instituted in a way that protected the \npublic without crippling the industry. It is disingenuous to argue that \nwe need a preemptive rider to protect against what the outcome of the \npending enforcement action might be. There is a history of enforcement \ndecisions which demonstrate that the courts secure remedies that \nprotect the public's interest, and that EPA has had a willingness to \nwork with industry to that end.\n  Fundamentally what we are addressing here is a matter of fairness. \nRight now utilities in Southern and Midwestern states emit over 4.5 \ntimes more nitrogen oxides than utilities in the Northeast. A study by \nthe Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management found that \nnortheastern states will have to pay between $1.4 and $3.9 billion for \nadditional local controls to reduce ozone pollution if six upwind \nstates fail to implement needed controls. I notice that my colleague \nfrom Vermont is here. I yield the floor for him to offer some remarks \nabout how the equity issue is particularly important within a \nderegulated marketplace.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Connecticut for \nhis acute remarks. He is quite right: at root, this is a question of \nequity, and it is a question of fundamental importance in a deregulated \npower market.\n  The Nation's dirtiest power plants have abused loopholes in federal \nlaw to dirty our air, pollute our lungs, and kill our most vulnerable \ncitizens. With one set of loopholes about to close, these power plants \nnow seek to create new ones.\n  These power plants have exploited the law for nearly 30 years. Now, \nEPA is exposing their effort for what it is: a blatant violation of the \npublic trust. In response, these dirty polluters are pushing \nappropriations riders that would justify and permanently extend their \nunlimited ability to pollute.\n  Haven't these power plants done enough damage already? Isn't it \nenough that they have been allowed to pollute 10 times more than our \nplants in the Northeast for years and years? Couldn't they now apply \nthe same pollution control equipment that our plants in the \nNortheast employ?\n\n  The problem is growing even worse with the deregulation of \nelectricity markets. In the five years since deregulation of the \nwholesale electricity market, increased generation at coal fired power \nplants has added the equivalent of 37 million cars worth of smog to our \nair. These power plants are now seeking to permanently extend their \nunfair advantage.\n  We need a level playing field. The nation's dirtiest power plants \nshould not be able to exploit loopholes in federal law at the expense \nof the rest of the nation. We need to pass laws to clean up our air, \nnot make it dirtier. I strongly oppose any attempt to make it easier \nfor the nation's dirtiest power plants to continue their excessive \npollution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for \nvoicing their justified concerns on this important issue. I understand \nthat there is the potential for language to be added to one of the \nremaining appropriations bills that would interfere with the efforts of \na number of states to seek relief from dangerous air pollution they \nreceive from a number of large coal-burning facilities which may have \nviolated the Clean Air Act.\n  As Senator Lieberman has explained, a number of coal-burning \nfacilities were ``grandfathered,'' exempting them from pollution \ncontrol requirements. Congress believed that utilities would soon \nretire these older plants. The grandfathered facilities were given \npermission to proceed with routine maintenance, but any major \nmodifications would be subject to review. It now appears that a number \nof these facilities did circumvent the law by increasing generating \ncapacity without installing the appropriate pollution control \ntechnologies.\n  Now, it appears these same facilities--after receiving notification \nthat New York and potentially other states intend to sue for these \nviolations of the Clean Air Act--may, once again, circumvent the law by \nencouraging the adoption of a rider which would interfere with these \nlawsuits. Any effort by implicated utilities to thwart efforts of \nStates to obtain injunctive relief, which States could use to mitigate \ndamage which has already occurred, is inappropriate.\n  Throughout my career, I have been a strong proponent of allowing the \nCourts to do their work without interference of politics--indeed, that \nwas the intent of the Framers of the Constitution. Madison and Hamilton \neloquently explained the importance of a balance of powers in The \nFederalist Papers. The Framers of the Constitution presumed conflict. \nThe Constitution assumes self-interest. It carefully balances the power \nby which one interest will offset another interest, and the\n\n[[Page S14519]]\n\noutcome will be, in that wonderful phrase of Madison, `the defect of \nbetter motives.'\n  The States must be allowed to protect their rights. I should think \nthat any Member of this body ought to defer to the courts before which \nthis issue is now being placed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in voicing my \nstrong objection to a rider that I understand may be attached to one of \nthe remaining appropriations bills. The rider would block all or part \nof an ongoing federal environmental enforcement action. If what I hear \nis true, I am troubled on several levels. First, I think that it would \nset a very dangerous precedent for Congress to attempt to squash \nFederal enforcement actions of any kind. The procedures for testing and \nappealing the appropriateness and reach of enforcement actions through \nthe court system and under the Administrative Procedures Act are well \nestablished. These procedures do not include a back door, last minute \n``Hail Mary pass'' by Congress using a rider to an appropriations bill \nas the vehicle. In this instance, someone does not like an \nenvironmental enforcement action. If we do it here, will we attach \nsomething to appropriations bill to stop antitrust enforcement actions? \nHow about price fixing cases? Where would this type of meddling cease?\n  What we may be seeing with the filing by EPA and DOJ is an \nenforcement action that has hit the bull's eye dead-on. And now \nutilities who may have crossed the line are pulling out all the stops \nto thwart the action.\n  Let's not kid ourselves about what is at stake. Many of us have \ndrafted and introduced legislative proposals to address power plant \npollution. We have turned up the heat, and the industry has taken \nnotice. Further, the debate over electric utility restructuring is \nstarting up again in the House of Representatives and the Senate. While \nthere are substantial economic benefits possible under restructuring, \nCongress should also address environmental consequences of \nderegulation. In order to alert the Senate leadership of this important \nissue that has so far been ignored in the restructuring debate, I have \nasked my colleagues to join me in sending a letter to the Senate \nleadership requesting that the Senate include a provision to eliminate \nthe grandfather loophole for older power plants. My colleagues from \nConnecticut and New York certainly knows the history of the Clean Air \nAct more than any of us. Senator Lieberman, how do you see this \nenforcement action affecting the Clean Air Act loophole?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Vermont. As you have argued \nin the past, the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments assumed that one of the \nmajor sources of these pollutants--older power plants--would be retired \nand replaced with cleaner burning plants. Unfortunately, this has not \nhappened. The average power plant in the United States uses technology \ndevised in the 1950's or before. The EPA-DOJ enforcement action is now \nalleging that many of these generating units have been modified and are \nno longer entitled to their grandfathered status.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And, I think we are making a fair statement in saying that \nthese grandfathered power plants will enjoy an important competitive \nadvantage under restructuring because they do not have to meet the same \nair quality standards as newer plants. Many of these grandfathered \nplants are currently not running at a high capacity because demand for \ntheir power production is limited to the size of their local \ndistribution area. Under restructuring, the entire nation becomes the \nmarket for power and production at these grandfathered plants and their \nemissions will increase. Deregulation of all utilities will drive a \nnational race to capture market share and profit through producing the \ncheapest power.\n  Some or all of the rider may apply to plants operated by the \nTennessee Valley Authority (TVA). What do we know about TVA's fossil \nfired power plants in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama? Fifty-eight of \n59 units are grandfathered, with the average startup year being 1957, \n13 years before the Clean Air Act was passed. The average electricity \nprices for the TVA states are 6.03 cents in Tennessee, 5.58 cents in \nKentucky, and 6.74 cents in Alabama. The average price nationally in \n1997 was 8.43 cents. TVA sells some of the cheapest electricity, in \npart, because it is operating these old, subsidized grandfathered \nplants. In a deregulated national market, will TVA be competitive? The \nanswer is yes.\n  TVA-wide in 1997 the 59 units emitted 98.5 million tons of CO2, \nnearly 5% of the U.S. total for power plants. If the TVA plants were \nall in one state that state would rank sixth in CO2 emissions. In 1997, \nthe TVA plants emitted 808,500 tons of acid rain producing SO2. If the \nTVA plants were all in one state that state would rank fifth in SO2 \nemissions. Unfortunately we do not have comparable data for ozone \nproducing nitrogen oxide emissions or for emissions of toxic mercury, \nbut I think my point on emissions is made. We should not be looking for \na way to unfairly exempt TVA or other grandfathered plants from \nenvironmental regulations, rather we need to be looking for the best \nways to bring these old plants up to date with current technology.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their conviction on \nobjecting to this rider. Congress needs to close the grandfather \nloophole, not attempt backdoor ways to thwart the will of the prior \nCongresses that enacted the Clean Air Act of 1970, and the amendments \nto it in 1977 and 1990.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in \nexpressing concern about the language that would interfere with \nenforcement actions against several power companies. Here we have an \nexcellent example of why we should not be addressing complex, \ncontroversial matters in last-minute amendments to spending bills. The \nproponents of the language assert that they have no interest in \ninterfering with the EPA-DOJ enforcement actions. In fact, the language \nthey have been circulating would wreak havoc on the enforcement \nactions. The proponents assert that they are interested merely in \nallowing routine maintenance to occur, but in fact their language makes \nno mention of routine maintenance. The proponents assert that their \nlanguage would have no impact on the environment, but in fact their \nlanguage would allow increases in actual emissions. They also raise the \nspecter of drastic effects to the power industry, which we have not \nseen in other industries that faced similar enforcement actions.\n  At the very least, we should all agree that this issue is \nsufficiently complicated and controversial, and its impacts on public \nhealth profound enough, that it deserves to be worked out in the \nauthorizing process. It is for problems like this that we have \nauthorizing committees, such as the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on which I sit, and before which I am sure the proponents \nwould find a sympathetic audience. It is in the daylight of the \nauthorizing process, where we can hear from expert witnesses, where we \ncan have public markups, and where we take the time to untangle and \nproperly resolve these types of issues, that we should address this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14519-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14519-S14520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TEN-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as we work through the final days of the \nlegislation session, we are apt to become mired in the details of our \nwork. We can lose sight of the special opportunity we have, as \nlegislators, to represent our fellow citizens and to conduct the \nbusiness of a democratic society in the Nation's Capital.\n  In this spirit, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to a very \nspecial anniversary one that I hope can inspire us to bring our efforts \nrenewed appreciation for our blessings--and our duties--as legislators \nin the greatest democracy in human history.\n  Ten years ago yesterday, the starkest symbol of human bondage in this \ncentury--the Berlin Wall--shook, cracked, and then collapsed. To be \nsure, it took time for all of it to by physically dismantled. Sections \nof it still stand, left as symbols all at once of man's capacity for \nevil and his insatiable drive to be free. But in one magnificent moment \n10 years ago, without a shot being fired, people who had only known \ncold war captivity crossed the line and became free.\n  They were helped across by many hands: by the American people who\n\n[[Page S14520]]\n\nserved by the millions in uniform and who put up trillions--trillions--\nof dollars to fight the cold war; by the citizens of NATO and other \nallied nations who made similar sacrifices of blood and treasure; by \nmany of their fellow countrymen who over many years kept small fires of \nfreedom burning in their hearts for the day when the wall would come \ndown; and, at critical moments, by great leaders.\n  Joseph Shattan, a former White House speech writer and, now, a \nBradley Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, has chronicled this \nleadership in his book ``Architects of Victory: Six Heroes of Cold \nWar,'' published by Heritage, and excerpted recently in essay form in \nthe Washington Times. He describes how six remarkable individuals--\nWinston Churchill, Harry Truman, Knorad Adenauer, Alexander \nSolzhenitsyn, Pope John Paul II, and Ronald Reagan--seized their own \nmoment in the cause of freedom.\n  Mr. President, as Americans, we should on this day take special note \nof the two American Presidents--one Democrat, one Republican, who \nplayed such vital roles in bringing about the fall of the Berlin Wall \nten years ago. Here is Shattan on Harry Truman:\n\n       Underlying Truman's policies was the conviction that Soviet \n     totalitarianism was no different than Nazi totalitarianism. \n     In his view, both the Nazis and the communists violated human \n     rights at home and sought to expand their empires abroad. To \n     secure a world where democratic values might flourish, Truman \n     believed the United States had to contain Soviet \n     expansionism--through economic and military aid if possible, \n     through force of arms if necessary. Over the long run, a \n     successful policy of containment would cause Soviet leaders \n     to lose their faith in the inevitability of a global \n     communist triumph. Only then could negotiations with Moscow \n     contribute to a safer, more peaceful world.\n       Because the Truman administration's policy of containment \n     set the course for U.S. foreign policy over the next 35 \n     years, it seems in retrospect to have been a natural, even \n     inevitable, response to Soviet aggressiveness. But it was \n     nothing of the sort. Truman's predecessor, Franklin \n     Roosevelt, had taken a markedly different approach toward \n     Moscow--one aimed at cementing an enduring U.S.-Soviet \n     friendship--and when Truman became president, he was \n     determined to follow in FDR's footsteps, even if it meant \n     ignoring his own instincts. But Truman gradually worked \n     his way out from under FDR's long shadow and placed his \n     own indelible stamp on U.S. foreign policy.\n       Truman's decisive break with FDR's foreign policy came in a \n     historic speech delivered before a joint session of Congress \n     on March 12, 1947. ``I believe it must be the policy of the \n     United States,'' he declared, ``to support free peoples who \n     are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by \n     outside pressures.'' Alonzo Hamby, one of Truman's \n     biographers, rightly called this speech ``the decisive step \n     in what would soon be called the Cold War.''\n\n  Harry Truman's steadfast commitment to ``free peoples'' assured that \nthe Iron Curtain would encroach no further on freedom. But it took \nanother President to push the Wall over. Here again is Shattan on \nRonald Reagan:\n\n       But while liberals frequently disparaged Mr. Reagan's \n     intellect, the fact was that he subscribed wholeheartedly to \n     one major truth that many of his intellectually sophisticated \n     critics either never knew or had forgotten: Societies that \n     encourage freedom and creativity tend to flourish, while \n     societies that suppress liberty tend to stagnate. This was \n     the central truth around which Ronald Reagan fashioned his \n     political career. This was the crucial insight that he \n     articulated with passion and eloquence and pursued with iron \n     resolve. And this was the basis of his Soviet strategy.\n       Underlying Mr. Reagan's approach to the Soviet Union was \n     his profound (his critics would say ``childlike'' or \n     ``simplistic'') faith in freedom. Mr. Reagan simply knew that \n     there was no way a closed society like the Soviet Union could \n     prevail against an open society like the United States once \n     the open society made up its mind to win. And Mr. Reagan, \n     years before he became president, decided that the United \n     States would win the Cold War . . . The military buildup, the \n     support of anti-communist movements worldwide (better known \n     as the ``Reagan Doctrine''), the Strategic Defense \n     Initiative, the covert assistance to the Polish trade union \n     Solidarity, the economic sanctions against Moscow--all were \n     meant to force an already shaky Soviet system to embark on a \n     course of radical reform. These reforms (perestroika, \n     glasnost) soon acquired a momentum of their own, and \n     eventually brought down the Soviet Union.\n       Mr. Reagan's approach to foreign policy was unprecedented. \n     The traditional U.S. strategy was to seek to contain Soviet \n     power and hope that, at some unspecified point in the future, \n     containment would convince the communist ruling class to \n     abandon its expansionist course. By contrast, Mr. Reagan \n     sought not merely to contain the Soviets but to overwhelm \n     them with demonstrations of U.S. power and resolve that left \n     them with no alternative but to accept the choice he offered \n     them: Change or face defeat.\n       His success proved that great leadership does not depend on \n     intellectual or historical sophistication. What is needed, \n     above all, is the right set of convictions and the courage to \n     stand by them. Mr. Reagan's beliefs about freedom and tyranny \n     were uniquely rooted in the American experience, and his \n     courage reflected the quiet self-confidence of the American \n     heartland. His was truly a U.S. presidency that changed the \n     world.\n\n  Much has changed in 10 years. Yes, we still have walls to tear down--\non the Demilitarized Zone in Korea, around the island of Cuba, and \neverywhere that people around the globe still struggle for peace and \nfreedom. But the Cold War is over. Freedom won. As we watch the many \ncelebrations underway today--in Berlin, all over Europe, and elsewhere \nin the world--let us honor Cold War heroes, and rededicate ourselves to \nthe cause of freedom they championed. And, my colleagues, as we conduct \nthe people's business, let us seek to renew an abiding reverence for \nthe freedom that brings us here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14520-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS CRIMINALS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent escape of convicted child \nmurderer Kyle Bell from a private prison transport bus should serve as \na wake-up call, to the Congress and to the country. Kyle Bell slipped \noff a TransCorp America bus on October 13, while the bus was stopped in \nNew Mexico for gas. Apparently, he picked the locks on his handcuffs \nand leg irons, pushed his way out of a rooftop vent, hid out of sight \nof the guards who traveled with the bus, and then slipped to the ground \nas it pulled away. He was wearing his own street clothes and shoes. The \nTransCorp guards did not notice that Bell was missing until nine hours \nlater, and then delayed in notifying New Mexico authorities. Bell is \nstill at large.\n  Kyle Bell's escape is not an isolated case. In recent years, there \nhave been several escapes by violent criminals when vans broke down or \nguards fell asleep on duty. There have also been an alarming number of \ntraffic accidents in which prisoners were seriously injured or killed \nbecause drivers were tired, inattentive, or poorly trained.\n  Privatization of prisons and prisoner transportation services may be \ncost efficient, but public safety must come first. The Interstate \nTransportation of Dangerous Criminals Act requires the Attorney General \nto set minimum standards for private prison transport companies, \nincluding standards on employee training and restrictions on the number \nof hours that employees can be on duty during a given time period. A \nviolation is punishable by a $10,000 fine, plus restitution for the \ncost of recapturing any violent prisoner who escapes as the result of \nsuch violation. This should create a healthy incentive for companies to \nabide by the regulations and operate responsibly.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this legislation and \nurge its speedy passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14520-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14520-S14521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE REPORT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a report on the National Missile Defense \nprogram has been completed and will be released shortly by a panel of \nexperts which is chaired by retired Air Force General Larry Welch. The \ndirector of the Defense Department's Ballistic Missile Defense \nOrganization requested this report which examines the National Missile \nDefense program and makes several recommendations for improvement.\n  Many will remember that General Welch and his panel issued a previous \nreport last year which examined aspects of both the National Missile \nDefense program and several Theater Missile Defense programs.\n  Generally speaking, the newest Welch Report is a helpful critique of \nthe National Missile Defense Program. Given the importance of this \nprogram, additional knowledge of its inherent risks will help BMDO to \nstructure and run the best program possible.\n  In particular, I support the report's emphasis on giving the BMDO \nprogram manager, as well as the Lead Systems Integrator, increased \nauthority in running this program.\n\n[[Page S14521]]\n\n  The report's emphasis on additional ground testing and purchasing \nadditional hardware--such as a second launcher for the Kwajalein test \nsite--makes good sense.\n  Any program subjected to scrutiny on the level of the Welch Panel's \nwill face some criticism about particular aspects of how the program is \nbeing conducted. But one key phrase in the report is worth keeping in \nmind, and I quote: ``Given the set of challenges and the phased \ndecision process, the JPO [BMDO's NMD Joint Program Office] and LSI \n[Boeing, the Lead System Integrator] have formulated a sensible, \nphased, incremental approach to the development and deployment \ndecision--while managing the risk.''\n  Every DoD program has some degree of risk; the risk in each program, \nNMD included, can be mitigated by additional time and money. However, \nthe NMD program is not being developed in a vacuum, a point clearly \nmade by North Korea's flight test of the three-stage Taepo Dong I ICBM \nin August of 1998. We don't have the luxury of time. Because of the \nproliferation threat, our choice is simple: We can accept additional \nprogram risk, or we can leave the United States vulnerable to rogue \nthreats of coercion by placing a premium on wringing risk from the NMD \nprogram.\n  The emphasis must be on protecting America and American interests. \nThe continued vulnerability of the United States is unacceptable, which \nis why many of the Welch Report's recommendations should be implemented \nas quickly as possible.\n  Because of the threat we have no choice but to accept a high-risk \nprogram. We ought to accept as much risk as we can stand, because the \nconsequences of not being prepared for the threat are so high. ``High'' \nrisk is not synonymous with ``failure,'' as demonstrated by the recent \nsuccessful intercept conducted by this program. Decision points in the \nNational Missile Defense program should not be adjusted because of a \nhigh level of risk in the program, but only if the level of risk \nbecomes unacceptably high. To date no senior Defense Department \nofficial has told me that the level of risk in the NMD program is \nunacceptable.\n  Much of this report focuses on a lack of hardware to test and \ninsufficient simulation facilities. That is the reason Congress added \n$1 billion for missile defense last year.\n  The Welch Report also calls for flight tests against more varied \ntargets. After the recent successful NMD flight test, there was an \nunfortunate rush to judgment by some who wanted to indict this program \nas a fraud for not attempting the most complex intercept test \nimmediately. These critics were obviously unaware of the fact that it \nwas the Welch Panel, during its investigation, which recommended to \nBMDO that the recent flight test be simplified. I support the Welch \nReport's suggestion for realistic testing, and hope that everyone will \nkeep in mind the importance of testing the basics first, and then \nproceeding to more complex tests.\n  There are, of course, some problems with testing against more \nrealistic targets that have nothing at all to do with the NMD program. \nAccording to the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, BMDO believes \nit is--and I quote from a note BMDO sent to my staff--``constrained by \nSTART treaty limitations''--from testing against more realistic \ntargets.\n  This surely must be a misunderstanding within the Defense Department \nthat will be resolved quickly.\n  I want to commend the members of the panel who produced the Welch \nReport. I hope that some of their concerns have been ameliorated by the \nrecent NMD intercept, which occurred too late to be included in their \nreport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14521-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PATENT REFORM AND INVENTOR PROTECTION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for S. \n1798, the American Inventors Protection Act. Yesterday I became a co-\nsponsor of the patents reform legislation, which was recently reported \nout of the Senate Judiciary Committee. It is my understanding that the \nprovisions contained in that legislation are being folded into a larger \nbill, which also addresses satellite television and other matters. \nAlthough I urge passage of this larger bill, in my comments today I \nwill speak only to the provisions dealing with patent reform and \ninventor protection, provisions which I strongly believe will provide \nvital new protections both to businesses and to individual inventors. \nIn particular, I am pleased to see an entire title dedicated to \nregulating invention promoters, many of whom are little more than con \nartists. In 1995 I introduced the ``Inventor Protection Act'' of 1995, \nwhich was the first bill to target the unsrupulous firms that take \nadvantage of inventors' ideas and dreams. Several of my bill's \nprovisions now appear in the House and Senate legislation, and I am \nglad to see that the work we did in the 104th Congress, combined with \nthe efforts of others since, should finally result in the passage of \nlong needed protections against invention promotion scams.\n  The American Inventors Protection Act is a well-rounded bill. It \nreduces patent fees and authorizes the Comissioner of the Paetnt and \nTrademark Office (PTO) to report to Congress on alternative fee \nstructures. The goal here, as with other titles of the legislation, is \nto make our patent system as accessible as possible to all. Another \nreform would save money for parties to a patent dispute. It allows \nthird parties the option of expanded inter pates reexamination \nprocedures; these new procedures before the PTO will decrease the \namount of litigation in federal district court.\n  The ``First Inventor Defense'' is a vital new provision for \nbusinesses and other inventors caught unaware by recent court decisions \nallowing business methods to be patented. It is simply unfair that an \ninnovator of a particular business method should suddenly have to pay \nroyalties for its own invention, just because of an unforeseeable \nchange in patent law. It is my understanding that any kind of method, \nregardless of its technological character, would be included within the \nscope of this definition, provided it is used in some manner by a \ncompany or other entity in the conduct of its business.\n  Two other provisions provide greater predictability and fairness for \ninventors. One title guarantees a minimum patent term of 17 years by \nextending patent term in cases of unusual delay. Another allows for \ndomestic publication of patent applications subject to foreign \npublication. I support the changes made to this provision since the \nlast Congress, changes which should satisfy the concerns of independent \ninventors that their ideas might be copied before their patents are \ngranted.\n  Finally, I applaud the new regulations and remedies which will \nprovide inventors with enhanced protections against invention promotion \nscams. Each year thousands of inventors lose tens of millions of \ndollars to deceptive invention marketing companies. In 1994, as then-\nChairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Governmental Affairs, I \nheld a hearing on the problems presented by the invention marketing \nindustry. Witness after witness testified how dozens of companies, \nunder broad claims of helping inventors, had actually set up schemes in \nwhich inventors spend thousands for services to market their \ninvention--a service that companies regularly fail to provide.\n  The legislation I introduced in 1995 used a multi-faceted approach to \nseparate the legitimate companies from the fraudulent and guarantee \nreal protection for America's inventors. I am gratified that a number \nof the provisions from my bill have been used in a title of this year's \npatent reform legislation specially devoted to invention marketing \ncompanies. Both bills provide inventors with enhanced protections \nagainst invention promotion scams by creating a private right of action \nfor inventors harmed by deceptive fraudulent practices, by requiring \ninvention promoters to disclose certain information in writing prior to \nentering into a contract for invention promotion services, and by \ncreating a publicly available log of complaints received by the PTO \ninvolving invention promotes.\n  The provisions contained in the American Inventors Protection Act \nrepresent our best hope for passage of meaningful patent reform. I urge \nmy colleagues to support their passage to ensure that inventors as well \nas their ideas are adequately protected.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14522-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14522]]\n        THE CONVEYANCE OF CERTAIN LANDS TO PARK COUNTY, WYOMING\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation that I and \nmy colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, introduced on Tuesday, November 9, \n1999, that would authorize the sale of certain federal lands near Cody, \nWyoming to Park County Wyoming for future use as an industrial park.\n  By purchasing this property, and zoning it as an industrial park, \nPark County will be able to provide, protect, and recognize an area \nthat is well suited for industrial development, in a manner consistent \nwith uses on surrounding properties, and do so in a way that does not \nburden other areas in the community whose uses are more residential or \ncommercial in nature.\n  The property in question consists of approximately 190 acres of \nfederal land just north of the Cody City limits. Part of this land is \ncurrently leased to a number of light industrial corporations including \na gypsum wall board manufacturing facility, a meat processing facility, \na trucking company, an oil company, a concrete company, and a lumber \ncompany. The property is also currently used as a utility corridor and \nis encumbered by a natural gas pipeline, several electricity and oil \nand gas pipeline rights of way, and a railroad easement held by the \nChicago Burlington Quincy Railroad.\n  This proposal offers a needed shot in the arm for an economy that has \nnot been able to attract a diversity of new jobs based on of a shortage \nof available industrial property. This shortage was created by a strong \nfederal presence--82 percent of the land in Park County is owned by the \nFederal Government, with 52 percent of that land designated and managed \nas Wilderness. This high concentration of federal land drives up the \nprice on available private land making industrial development very \ndifficult.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, I hope my colleagues can join with me in \nsupport of this legislation and together we can provide the Cody area \nwith a wonderful community building opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14522-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nthe amendment offered by Senator Domenici, Senator Abraham, and myself \nto raise the minimum wage. I cosponsored this proposal because I \nbelieve it represents a fair, sensible compromise.\n  In raising the minimum wage, it is imperative that we do not hurt the \nvery people we are trying to help. Increasing the minimum wage always \ncarries the risks of hindering job growth, cutting off opportunities \nfor entry level workers, or displacing current workers. These risks are \na real concern to me. In my view, any increase in the minimum wage must \nbe accompanied by measures that will negate possible unintended \nnegative effects on workers and businesses.\n  I believe the Domenici amendment offers a reasonable way to help \nworkers and businesses by coupling the wage increase with tax relief \nthat will help small businesses offset the additional costs. I would \nlike to highlight a few of the ways this amendment creates a win-win \nsituation for workers and small businesses. First, our amendment \nprovides a one dollar increase in the minimum wage, which will be \nphased in incrementally over the next three years. Currently, the \nfederal minimum wage is $5.15 per hour. Our amendment raises the \nminimum wage to $5.50 per hour in 2000, to $5.85 per hour in 2001, and \nto $6.15 per hour in 2002. It also includes reforms to expand pension \ncoverage, particularly for employees of small businesses. These \nprovisions enhance fairness for women, increase portability for plan \nparticipants, strengthen pension security and enforcement, and \nstreamline regulatory requirements. Likewise, our proposal permanently \nextends the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which gives employers an \nincentive to hire people receiving public assistance. This program \nhelps people who have fallen on hard times to move back into the \nworkplace. A section of our proposal that I am particularly proud of \nallows self-employed individuals to deduct 100 percent of their health \ninsurance costs as early as next year. Under current law, hard working \nmen and women must wait until 2003 before they can fully deduct their \nhealth insurance costs. This measure puts small business owners, \nfarmers, and other hard working men and women struggling to get their \nbusinesses off the ground on a level playing field with large \ncorporations, who already enjoy full deductions for healthcare. I have \nfought for this parity throughout my tenure in Congress, and I thank \nSenator Domenici for including it in this amendment.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is a compromise package. It is a good \nfaith attempt to help low-income workers without penalizing their \nemployers or causing unintended job displacement. We believe the tax \nrelief and pension reforms in this bill will help small businesses and \nmitigate possible adverse effects of raising the minimum wage.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Domenici for his hard work on this \namendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14522-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14522-S14523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support and \ncosponsorship to S. 1452, the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. \nRural America, and my state of South Dakota in particular, is in the \nmidst of an affordable housing crunch. In South Dakota, approximately \nfour of ten new single family homes are manufactured homes, and with an \naverage cost of around $42,000, manufactured homes enable many \nindividuals, young families, and retired South Dakotans to enjoy the \nbenefits of homeownership. Nearly one-quarter of the new homes \nnationwide are manufactured homes, and an estimated 8% of the American \npopulation lives in manufactured homes.\n  Despite the increasing number of manufactured homes, the Federal \nManufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act has not been \nupdated since its creation in 1974. Over the past twenty five years, \nmanufactured homes have evolved from being predominately mobile \ntrailers to permanent structures that contain the same amenities found \nin site-built homes. The inability of regulations to keep pace with \nchanging technology and the nature of manufactured housing frustrates \nmanufactured housing builders and consumers alike.\n  S. 1452 establishes a consensus committee that would submit \nrecommendations to the Secretary of HUD for revising the manufactured \nhousing construction and safety standards. In addition, the bill \nauthorizes the Secretary of HUD to use industry label fees to \nadminister the consensus committee and update the regulations. I \napplaud this unique provision that costs taxpayers nothing.\n  There is no question that construction codes for manufactured homes \nare woefully outdated and in need of revision. For example, the \nmanufactured housing industry is running six years behind the most \ncurrent electrical codes. Changes in the height of ceilings in \nmanufactured homes since 1974 have also outpaced codes regulating the \nlocation of smoke detectors in the home. As a result, some smoke \ndetectors in manufactured homes are several feet from the top of \nvaulted ceilings. Another trend in the industry is for more \nmanufactured homes to be placed on private lots with basements. \nUnfortunately, out-of-date HUD regulations require water heaters to be \nplaced on the main floor of a manufactured home, thereby prohibiting \nthe more logical placement of water heaters in the basement and near a \nfloor drain.\n  By updating construction safety regulations, this bill will benefit \nmany South Dakotans and others who own manufactured homes. The AARP has \nraised valid concerns with portions of this legislation that I am \nhopeful can be addressed. I am confident that the concerns AARP has \nwith the composition of the consensus committee can be worked out to \nensure proper representation from consumers, industry experts, \nmanufacturers, public officials, and other interested parties. I also \ncommend AARP for raising the issue of warranties, and as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, I look forward to working with my colleagues, the \nmanufactured housing industry, and AARP to ensure consumer access to \nwarranties.\n\n[[Page S14523]]\n\n  Another important issue that needs to be addressed in this discussion \nconcerns installation standards that 33 states, including South Dakota, \ncurrently have. Differences in geography, soil composition, and climate \nmake a uniform set of installation standards difficult to implement. \nHowever, I would like to see consumers in those states that currently \ndo not have installation standards for manufactured homes receive the \nsame level of assurance South Dakotans have that their homes will be \ninstalled correctly.\n  I would like to thank Senator Shelby for introducing S. 1452 as well \nas Senators Allard and Kerry for holding hearings on the legislation in \nOctober. I am hopeful that with the help of the interested parties, we \ncan make this important bill even better. I look forward to a continued \ndialogue on this issue and for the Senate to take up this issue early \nin the new year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14523-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DAISY GASTON BATES OF ARKANSAS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican and an honored daughter of Arkansas. Daisy Gaston Bates was an \nauthor, a newspaper publisher, a public servant, a community leader. \nAnd some would say most importantly, a civil rights activist. Mrs. \nBates passed away last Thursday and we in the great state of Arkansas \nare celebrating the life of one of our greatest citizens.\n  Mrs. Bates believed in justice and equality for all of us. No doubt \nit was that love of freedom and equality that compelled her crusade in \n1957 for the rights of nine African-American children to attend Little \nRock's all-white Central High School. Daisy Bates played a central \nrole, as Arkansas president of the National Association of Colored \nPeople, in the litigation that lead up to that confrontation on the \nschool steps. This was a defining moment in the history of the civil \nrights movement.\n  According to her own accounts and those of the Little Rock Nine, the \nstudents would gather each night at the Bates' home to receive guidance \nand strength. It was through the encouragement of Daisy Bates and her \nhusband that these young men and women were able to face the vicious \nand hateful taunts of those so passionately opposed to their attendance \nat Central High.\n  Mrs. Bates and her husband, L.C., also published a newspaper, the \nArkansas State Press, which courageously published accounts of police \nbrutality against African-Americans in the 1940's and took a stance for \ncivil rights. Eventually, Central High was integrated and Daisy and her \nhusband were forced to close their newspaper because of their civil \nrights stance. Advertisers withdrew their business and the paper \nsuffered financial hardships from which it could not recover. She and \nL.C. were threatened with bombs and guns. They were hanged in effigy by \nsegregationists.\n  But Daisy Bates persevered. She did all this, withstood these \nchallenges, because she loved children and she loved her country. She \nhad an internal fire, instilled in her during a childhood spent in \nHuttig, Arkansas. And this strong character shone through as she \nwillingly took a leadership role to battle the legal and political \ninequities of segregation in our state and the nation.\n  Mrs. Bates continued to work tirelessly in anti-poverty programs, \ncommunity development and neighborhood improvement. She published a \nbook, for which another remarkable woman, Eleanor Roosevelt, wrote the \nintroduction. Daisy also spent time working for the Democratic National \nCommittee and for President Johnson's administration.\n  Many people honored Daisy Bates during her lifetime. In 1997, Mrs. \nBates received for her courage and character, the Margaret Chase Smith \nAward, named after the second woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate. \nDaisy Bates carried the Olympic torch from a wheelchair during the 1996 \nAtlanta games. Many more, I am sure, will honor her after her death. I \nam proud to honor her today in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mrs. Bates will lie in state on Monday at the State Capitol Rotunda \nin Little Rock. Ironically, this is only blocks away from the school \nwhere that famous confrontation occurred in 1957. And in another twist \nof fate, the Little Rock Nine are scheduled to receive Congressional \nGold Medals in a White House ceremony with President Bill Clinton this \nTuesday, the very same day Daisy Bates will be laid to rest.\n  This great woman leaves a legacy to our children, our state and our \nnation; a love of justice, freedom and the right to be educated.

Mr. President, on November 2, 1999, I filed Report 206 \nto accompany S. 977, that had been ordered favorably reported on \nOctober 20, 1999. At the time the report was filed, the estimates by \nCongressional Budget Office were not available. The estimate is now \navailable and concludes that enactment of S. 977 would ``result in no \nsignificant costs to the federal government.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 2, 1999.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 977, the Miwaleta \n     Park Expansion Act.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Mark \n     Grabowicz (for federal costs), who can be reached at 226-\n     2860, and Marjorie Miller (for the impact on state and local \n     governments), who can be reached at 225-3220.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Dan L. Crippen.\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 977--Miwaleta Park Expansion Act\n       S. 977 would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \n     convey, without compensation, Miwaleta Park and certain \n     adjacent land to Douglas County, Oregon. The bill stipulates \n     that the county must use this land for recreational purposes. \n     Currently, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) allows the \n     county to use the land for a park at no cost to the county. \n     Because BLM does not plan to sell the land or otherwise \n     generate receipts from it, CBO estimates that implementing S. \n     977 would result in no significant costs to the federal \n     government. The bill would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts, so pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       S. 977 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. \n     Douglas County might incur some costs as a result of the \n     bill's enactment, but any such costs would be voluntary. The \n     county also would benefit, however, because it would receive \n     land at a negligible cost. The bill would have no significant \n     impact on the budgets of other state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       On October 29, 1999, CBO transmitted a cost estimate for \n     H.R. 1725, the Miwaleta Park Expansion Act, as ordered \n     reported by the House Committee on Resources on October 20, \n     1999. The two bills are very similar and the cost estimates \n     are identical.\n       The CBO staff contacts are Mark Grabowicz (for federal \n     costs), who can be reached at 226-2860, and Marjorie Miller \n     (for the impact on state and local governments), who can be \n     reached at 225-3220. This estimate was approved by Peter H. \n     Fontaine, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14523-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14523-S14524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNITED STATES JOINT FORCES COMMAND\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Secretary \nof Defense, Bill Cohen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nGeneral Hugh Shelton, the Commander in Chief Joint Forces Command \nAdmiral Hal Gehman, and the Army Chief of Staff, General Eric Shinseki \nfor their commitment to transforming our current military force to one \nwhich will assure our military superiority well into the twenty first \ncentury.\n  Secretary Cohen and General Shelton have taken strong and direct \naction to establish transformation as the guiding policy for the \nDepartment of Defense.\n\n[[Page S14524]]\n\nTheir leadership responds to what are now broadly accepted conclusions \nabout the security environment we will face and the challenges and \nopportunities resulting from the Revolution in Military Affairs. Many, \nboth inside and outside the Pentagon, have concluded that these changes \nare of such magnitude that they require that our military in the twenty \nfirst century be fundamentally different than today's military. This \nview was compellingly articulated by the National Defense Panel, which \nwas created by this body. And it was given the force of policy by \nSecretary Cohen in the Quadrennial Defense Review.\n  But how are we to know what this very different military should look \nlike? Secretary Cohen and General Shelton, encouraged and supported by \nlegislation we passed last year, established a process to answer that \nquestion. On the first of October, 1998, they charged the Commander in \nChief of the United States Atlantic Command, Admiral Harold Gehman, to \nput in place a joint experimentation process to objectively determine \nwhich new technologies, organizations, and concepts of operation will \nmost likely to future military superiority. Since that time Admiral \nTheman has done a superb job of establishing a process and beginning \nexperiments toward that end. In June, 1999, Admiral Gehman began \nexperiments to address how the U.S. military should be equipped and \norganized to effectively find and strike critical mobile enemy targets, \nsuch as ballistic missiles. Other experiments to address near, mid, and \nfar term strategic and operational problems will follow. On the first \nof October of this year the Secretary and the Chairman increased the \npriority of the policy of transformation by redesignating the United \nStates Atlantic Command as the United States Joint Forces Command. This \nchange is more than simply a change in name. It underlines the \nincreasing importance of increased jointness in meeting the security \nchallenges of the twenty first century, increases the priority assigned \nto experimentation, and reflects the expanded role that the United \nStates Joint Forces Command assumes in order to achieve that goal. I \napplaud Secretary Cohen and General Shelton for their commitment to \ntransformation of the U.S. military and their courage to make the tough \nchanges needed to get it done.\n  I am also pleased to see that their leadership is having a positive \neffect on our military Services' plans to transform themselves to meet \nthe coming challenges. The U.S. Air Force has begun to reorganize its \nunits into Air Expeditionary Forces to be more responsive to the need \nfor air power by the warfighting commanders. And I note with great \nadmiration that on October 12, 1999 General Eric Shinseki, Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Army, announced his intention to begin to transform \nthe U.S. Army from a heavy force designed largely for the Cold War to \none that will be more effective against the threats that most now see \nas most likely and most dangerous. The goal is to make the U.S. Army \nmore strategically relevant by making it lighter, more deployable, more \nlethal, and more sustainable. General Shinseki plans to find \ntechnological solutions to these problems, and intends to create this \nyear an experimentation process at Fort Lewis Washington in order to \nbegin to construct this new force. He has said that he wants to \neliminate the distinction between different types of Army units, and \nperhaps in time go to an all-wheeled fleet of combat vehicles, \neliminating the tank as we have known it for almost a century. These \nare historic and very positive steps. But there is much progress that \nmust still be made. For example, the Army and the Air Force must now \nimplement their plans in concert with the other services, and with the \nJoint Forces Command.\n  Fundamental change is very difficult to effect, especially in \norganizations, like the Department of Defense, that are large and \nsuccessful. Frankly, I am a little surprised that we have been able to \nachieve these changes in so short time. But organizations that don't \nchange ultimately fail, and that is not an outcome we can accept. So we \nshould not only applaud these moves, but support them, and encourage \nfaster and more direct action. An excellent report by the Defense \nScience Board in August, 1999 suggests some things we can do to provide \nthis support. The most important are encouraging the development of a \nDOD-wide strategy for transformation activities, and insisting on the \nestablishment of processes to turn the results of experiments into real \ncapabilities for our forces. And we must ensure that this effort is not \nhobbled by lack of resources. Perhaps most importantly, we must insist \nthat no Service plan nor program be agreed to or resourced unless we \nare assured that it has passed through a rigorous joint assessment and \nis consistent with the joint warfighting needs of our military \ncommanders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in complementing our senior leaders \nand to support their efforts to move to the next level of jointness as \nthey grapple with the difficult task of building the most effective \nAmerican military possible for the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14524-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14524-S14525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL TO CUBA ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, any American who wants to travel to Iran, \nto North Korea, to Syria, to Serbia, to Vietnam, to just about \nanywhere, can do so, as long as that country gives them a visa. As far \nas the United States Government is concerned, they can travel there at \ntheir own risk.\n  Cuba, on the other hand, a country 90 miles away that poses about as \nmuch threat to the United States as a flea does to a buffalo, is off \nlimits unless you are a journalist, government official, or member of \nsome other special group. If not, you can only get there by breaking \nthe law, which an estimated 10-15,000 Americans did last year.\n  Of all the ridiculous, anachronistic, and self-defeating policies, \nthis has got to be near the top of the list.\n  For forty years, administration after administration, and Congress \nafter Congress, has stuck by this failed policy. Yet Fidel Castro is as \nfirmly in control today as he was in 1959, and the Cuban people are no \nbetter for it.\n  This legislation attempts to put some sense into our policy toward \nCuba. It would also protect one of the most fundamental rights that \nmost Americans take for granted, the right to travel freely. I commend \nthe senior Senator From Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who has been such a \nstrong and persistent advocate on this issue. I am proud to join him in \ncosponsoring this legislation, which is virtually identical to an \namendment he and I sponsored earlier this year. That amendment came \nwithin 7 votes of passage.\n  Mr. President, in March of this year I traveled to Cuba with Senator \nJack Reed. We were able to go there because we are Members of Congress.\n  I came face to face with the absurdity of the current policy because \nI wanted my wife Marcelle to accompany me as she does on most foreign \ntrips. A few days before we were to leave, I got a call from the State \nDepartment saying that they were not sure they could approve her travel \nto Cuba.\n\n  I cannot speak for other Senators, but I suspect that like me, they \nwould also not react too kindly to a policy that gives the State \nDepartment the authority to prevent their wife, or their children, from \ntraveling with them to a country with which we are not at war and \nwhich, according to the Defense Department and the vast majority of the \nAmerican public, poses no threat to our security.\n  I wonder how many Senators realize that if they wanted to take a \nfamily member with them to Cuba, they would probably be prevented from \ndoing so by United States law.\n  Actually, because the authors of the law knew that a blanket \nprohibition on travel by American citizens would be unconstitutional, \nthey came up with a clever way of avoiding that problem but \naccomplishing the same result. Americans can travel to Cuba, they just \ncannot spend any money there.\n  Almost a decade has passed since the collapse of the former Soviet \nUnion. Eight years have passed since the Russians cut their $3 billion \nsubsidy to Cuba. We now give hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to \nRussia.\n  Americans can travel to North Korea. There are no restrictions on the \nright of Americans to travel there, or to spend money there. Which \ncountry poses a greater threat to the United States? Obviously North \nKorea.\n  Americans can travel to Iran, and they can spend money there. The \nsame\n\n[[Page S14525]]\n\ngoes for Sudan. These are countries that pose far greater threats to \nAmerican interests than Cuba.\n  Our policy is hypocritical, inconsistent, and contrary to our values \nas a nation that believes in the free flow of people and ideas. It is \nimpossible for anyone to make a rational argument that America \nshould be able to travel freely to North Korea, or Iran, but not to \nCuba. It can't be done.\n\n  We have been stuck with this absurd policy for years, even though \nvirtually everyone knows, and says privately, that it makes absolutely \nno sense and is beneath the dignity of a great country.\n  It not only helps strengthen Fidel Castro's grip on Cuba, it hands a \nhug advantage to our European competitors who are building \nrelationships and establishing a base for future investment in a post-\nCastro Cuba. When that will happen is anybody's guess. President Castro \nis no democrat, and he is not going to become one. But it is time we \npursued a policy that is in our national interest.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation does not, I repeat does not, lift \nthe U.S. embargo. It is narrowly worded so it does not do that. It only \npermits travelers to carry their personal belongings. We are not \nopening a floodgate for United States imports to Cuba.\n  The amendment limits what Americans can bring home from Cuba to the \ncurrent level for government officials and other exempt categories, \nwhich is $100.\n  It reaffirms the President's authority to prohibit travel in times of \nwar, armed hostilities, or if there is imminent danger to the health or \nsafety of Americans.\n  Those who want to prevent Americans from traveling to Cuba, who \noppose this legislation, will argue that spending United States dollars \nthere helps prop up the Castro Government. To some extent that is true. \nThe government does run the economy. It also runs the schools and \nhospitals, maintains roads, and, like the United States Government, is \nresponsible for the whole range of social services that benefit \nordinary Cubans. Any money that goes into the Cuban economy supports \nthose programs.\n  But there is also an informal economy in Cuba, because no one but the \nelite can survive on their meager government salary. So the income from \ntourism also fuels that informal sector, and it goes in to the pockets \nof ordinary Cubans.\n\n  It is also worth pointing out that while the average Cuban cannot \nsurvive on his or her government salary, you do not see the kind of \nabject poverty in Cuba that is so common elsewhere in Latin America. In \nBrazil, or Panama, or Mexico, or Peru, there are children searching \nthrough garbage in the streets for scraps of food, next to gleaming \nhigh rise hotels with Mercedes limousines lined up outside.\n  In Cuba, almost everyone is poor. But they have access to the basics. \nThe literacy rate is 95 percent. The life expectancy is about the same \nas in our country, even though the health system is very basic and \nfocused on preventive care.\n  The point is that while there are obviously parts of the Cuban \neconomy that we would prefer not to support--as there is in North \nKorea, China, or Sudan, or in any country whose government we disagree \nwith, much of the Cuban Government's budget benefits ordinary Cubans. \nSo when opponents of this legislation argue that we cannot allow \nAmericans to travel to Cuba because the money they spend there would \nprop up Castro, remember what they are not saying: those same dollars \nalso help the Cuban people.\n  It is also worth saying that as much as we want to see a democratic \nCuba, President Castro's grip on power is not going to be weakened by \nkeeping Americans from traveling to Cuba. History has proven that. He \nhas been there for forty years, and as far as anyone can tell he is not \ngoing anywhere.\n   Mr. President, it is about time we injected some maturity into our \nrelations with Cuba. Let's have a little more faith in the power of our \nideas. Let's have the courage to admit that the cold war is over. Let's \nget the State Department out of the business of telling our wives, our \nchildren, and our constituents where they can travel and spend their \nown money--in a country that the Pentagon say poses no security threat \nto us.\n  This legislation will not end the embargo, but it will do far more to \nwin the hearts and minds of the Cuban people than the outdated approach \nof those who continue to defend the status quo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14525-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senator \nLautenberg for developing this important piece of legislation that \nrecognizes the importance of rail in our overall transportation system \nas we approach the 21st Century.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the High Speed Rail \nInvestment Act, which will provide Amtrak with much needed resources to \npay for high speed rail corridors across the country. This legislation \nis crucial for the country, and for my home state of Massachusetts, and \nI am hopeful we can move it quickly through Congress.\n  This bill will give Amtrak the authority to sell $10 billion in bonds \nover the next ten years to finance high speed rail. Instead of interest \npayments, the federal government would provide tax credits to \nbondholders. Amtrak would repay the principle on the bonds after 10 \nyears, however, the payments would come primarily from required state \nmatching funds. I know many states will gladly participate in this \nmatching program, as their governors and state legislatures are eager \nto promote high speed rail. Amtrak would be authorized to invest this \nmoney solely for upgrading existing lines to high speed rail, \nconstructing new high speed rail lines, purchasing high speed rail \nequipment, eliminating or improving grade crossings, and for capital \nupgrades to existing high speed rail corridors.\n  Let there be no mistake, this country needs to develop a \ncomprehensive national transportation policy for the 21st Century. So \nfar, Congress has failed to address this vital issue. What we have is \nan ad hoc, disjointed policy that focuses on roads and air to the \ndetriment of rail. We need to look at all of these modes of \ntransportation to alleviate congestion and delays on the ground and in \nthe sky and to move people across this country efficiently. Failing to \ndo this will hamper economic growth and harm the environment.\n  Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in Europe \nand Japan, and also in the Northeast corridor here in the U.S., \npassenger rail is severely underfunded. We need to include rail into \nthe transportation mix. We need more transportation choices and this \nbill helps to provide them.\n  In the Northeast corridor, Amtrak is well on its way to implementing \nhigh speed rail service. The high speed Acela service should start \nrunning from in January. This will be extremely helpful in my home \nstate of Massachusetts, where airport and highway congestion often \nreach frustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, \nthe fewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways.\n  But new service in the Northeast corridor is only the beginning. We \nneed to establish rail as a primary mode of transportation along with \nair and highways. This bill well help us achieve that goal across the \ncountry and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of such an important \npiece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14525-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14525-S14526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE TERROR OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the call to end gun violence has become all \ntoo commonplace during this session of Congress. It seems as if each \nday, another one of us comes to the floor to express our outrage. Last \nweek, it was about workplace violence in Honolulu and Seattle--a total \nof nine dead. In September it was a church shooting in Texas--a total \nof seven dead. In August, gun shots were fired in a Jewish Community \nCenter in Los Angeles--five injured, and moments later, a federal \nworker was gunned down on the street. In July, another workplace \nshooting--again nine people killed, this time in Atlanta. The list goes \non and on, including one shooting none of us can forget--15 dead in \nLittleton.\n  Each month, we watch these tragedies unfold--we witness Americans \nrunning and screaming for their lives, toddlers being led hand-in-hand \nout of danger, even bloody teenagers dangling\n\n[[Page S14526]]\n\nfrom windows. And as the helicopters and SWAT-teams come to more and \nmore of our neighborhoods, we observe scenes that seem more suitable \nfor a horror movie than the front page of our local papers.\n  And, still, each month, we react in the same way. We express outrage, \nwe condemn killers, we call for sensible gun safety legislation, but we \ndo not act. Congress has done nothing this year to control these mass-\nshootings or in any way, ease the agony that parents and families feel \neach day when they send their loved ones to school, church, or work.\n  Mr. President, as Congress prepares to adjourn for the year, I send \nout this reminder: Americans have lost the sense of safety that they \nonce felt in their schools and neighborhoods. They are frightened that \nthe next breaking news story will be filmed on main street, rather than \nas a ``nightmare on elm street''. It is up to Congress to end gun \nviolence and the all too familiar terror in the lives of ordinary \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14526-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROLLCALL NO. 361\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Under section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1622(d)), the national emergency terminates on the anniversary date of \nits declaration unless, within the 90-day period prior to each \nanniversary date, I publish in the Federal Register and transmit to the \nCongress a notice stating that such emergency is to continue in effect. \nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \ndelivery continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. I \nam, therefore, advising the Congress that the national emergency \ndeclared on November 14, 1994, and extended on November 14, 1995, \nNovember 12, 1996, November 13, 1997, and November 12, 1998, must \ncontinue in effect beyond November 14, 1999. Accordingly, I have \nextended the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938, as \namended.\n  The following report is made pursuant to section 204(a) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and \nsection 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), \nregarding activities taken and money spent pursuant to the emergency \ndeclaration. Additional information on nuclear, missile, and/or \nchemical and biological weapons (CBW) nonproliferation efforts is \ncontained in the most recent annual Report on the Proliferation of \nMissiles and Essential Components of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical \nWeapons, provided to the Congress pursuant to section 1097 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 \n(Public Law 102-190), also known as the ``Nonproliferation Report,'' \nand the most recent annual report provided to the Congress pursuant to \nsection 308 of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare \nElimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-182), also known as the ``CBW \nReport.''\n  On July 28, 1998, in Executive Order 13094, I amended section 4 of \nExecutive Order 12938 so that the United States Government could more \neffectively respond to the worldwide threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction proliferation activities. The amendment of section 4 \nstrengthens Executive Order 12938 in several significant ways. The \namendment broadens the type of proliferation activity that can subject \nentities to potential penalties under the Executive order. The original \nExecutive order provided for penalties for contributions to the efforts \nof any foreign country, project or entity to use, acquire, design, \nproduce, or stockpile chemical or biological weapons; the amended \nExecutive order also covers contributions to foreign programs for \nnuclear weapons and for missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass \ndestruction. Moreover, the amendment expands the original Executive \norder to include attempts to continue to foreign proliferation \nactivities, as well as actual contributions, and broadens the range of \npotential penalties to expressly include the prohibition of U.S. \nGovernment assistance to foreign persons, and the prohibition of \nimports into the United States and U.S. Government procurement. In sum, \nthe amendment gives the United States Government greater flexibility \nand discretion in deciding how and to what extent to impose measures \nagainst foreign persons that assist proliferation programs.\n\n\n                            Nuclear Weapons\n\n  In May 1998, India and Pakistan each conducted a series of nuclear \ntests. World reaction included nearly universal condemnation across a \nbroad range of international fora and multilateral support for a broad \nrange of sanctions, including new restrictions on lending by \ninternational financial institutions unrelated to basic human needs and \non aid from the G-8 and other countries.\n  Since the mandatory imposition of U.S. statutory sanctions, we have \nworked unilaterally, with other P-5 and G-8 members, and through the \nUnited Nations, to dissuade India and Pakistan from taking further \nsteps toward developing nuclear weapons. We have urged them to join \nmultilateral arms control efforts and to conform to the standards of \nnonproliferation regimes, to prevent a regional arms race and build \nconfidence by practicing restraint, and to resume efforts to resolve \ntheir differences through dialogue. The P-5, G-8, and U.N. Security \nCouncil have called on India and Pakistan to take a broad range of \nconcrete actions. The United States has focused most intensely on \nseveral objectives that can be met over the short and medium term: an \nend to nuclear testing and prompt, unconditional ratification of the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT); engagement in productive \nnegotiations on a fissile material\n\n[[Page S14527]]\n\ncut-off treaty (FMCT) and, pending their conclusion, a moratorium on \nproduction of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear \nexplosive devices; restraint in development and deployment of nuclear-\ncapable missiles and aircraft; and adoption of controls meeting \ninternational standards on exports of sensitive materials and \ntechnology.\n  Against this backdrop of international pressure on India and \nPakistan, high-level U.S. dialogues with Indian and Pakistani officials \nhave yielded little progress. In September 1998, Indian and Pakistani \nleaders had expressed a willingness to sign the CTBT. Both governments, \nhaving already declared testing moratoria, had indicated they were \nprepared to sign the CTBT by September 1999 under certain conditions. \nThese declarations were made prior to the collapse of Prime Minister \nVajpayee's Indian government in April 1999, a development that has \ndelayed consideration of CTBT signature in India. The Indian election, \nthe Kargil conflict, and the October political coup in Pakistan have \nfurther complicated the issue, although neither country has renounced \nits commitment. Pakistan has said that it will not sign the Treaty \nuntil India does. Additionally, Pakistan's Foreign Minister stated \npublicly on September 12, 1999, that Pakistan would not consider \nsigning the CTBT until sanctions are removed.\n  India and Pakistan both withdrew their opposition to negotiations on \nan FMCT in Geneva at the end of the 1998 Conference on Disarmament \nsession. However, these negotiations were unable to resume in 1999 and \nwe have no indications that India or Pakistan played helpful ``behind \nthe scenes'' roles. They also pledged to institute strict controls that \nmeet internationally accepted standards on sensitive exports, and have \nbegun expert discussions with the United States and others on this \nsubject. In addition, India and Pakistan resumed their bilateral \ndialogue on outstanding disputes, including Kashmir, at the Foreign \nSecretary level. The Kargil conflict this summer complicated efforts to \ncontinue this bilateral dialogue, although both sides have expressed \ninterest in resuming the discussions at some future point. We will \ncontinue discussions with both governments at the senior and expert \nlevels, and our diplomatic efforts in concert with the P-5, G-8, and in \ninternational fora. Efforts may be further complicated by India's \nrelease in August 1999 of a draft of its nuclear doctrine, which, \nalthough its timing may have been politically motivated, suggests that \nIndia intends to make nuclear weapons an integral part of the national \ndefense.\n  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) \ncontinues to maintain a freeze on its nuclear facilities consistent \nwith the 1994 U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework, which calls for the immediate \nfreezing and eventual dismantling of the DPRK's graphite-moderated \nreactors and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon and Taechon. The United \nStates has raised its concerns with the DPRK about a suspect \nunderground site under construction, possibly intended to support \nnuclear activities contrary to the Agreed Framework. In March 1999, the \nUnited States reached agreement with the DPRK for visits by a team of \nU.S. experts to the facility. In May 1999, a Department of State team \nvisited the underground facility at Kumchang-ni. The team was permitted \nto conduct all activities previously agreed to help remove suspicions \nabout the site. Based on the data gathered by the U.S. delegation and \nthe subsequent technical review, the United States has concluded that, \nat present, the underground site does not violate the 1994 U.S.-DPRK \nAgreed Framework.\n  The Agreed Framework requires the DPRK to come into full compliance \nwith its NPT and IAEA obligations as a part of a process that also \nincludes the supply of two light water reactors to North Korea. United \nStates experts remain on-site in North Korea working to complete clean-\nup operations after largely finishing the canning of spent fuel from \nthe North's 5-megawatt nuclear reactor.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is the cornerstone on the \nglobal nuclear nonproliferation regime. In May 1999, NPT Parties met in \nNew York to complete preparations for the 2000 NPT Review Conference. \nThe United States is working with others to ensure that the 2000 NPT \nReview Conference is a success that reaffirms the NPT as a strong and \nviable part of the global security system.\n  The United States signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty on \nSeptember 24, 1996. So far, 154 countries have signed and 51 have \nratified the CTBT. During 1999, CTBT signatories conducted numerous \nmeetings of the Preparatory Commission (PrepCom) in Vienna, seeking to \npromote rapid completion of the International Monitoring System (IMS) \nestablished by the Treaty. In October 1999, a conference was held \npursuant to Article XIV of the CTBT, to discuss ways to accelerate the \nentry into force of the Treaty. The United States attended that \nconference as an observer.\n  On September 22, 1997, I transmitted the CTBT to the Senate, \nrequesting prompt advice and consent to ratification. I deeply regret \nthe Senate's decision on October 13, 1999, to refuse its consent to \nratify the CTBT. The CTBT will serve several U.S. national security \ninterests by prohibiting all nuclear explosions. It will constrain the \ndevelopment and qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons; end the \ndevelopment of advanced new types of weapons; contribute to the \nprevention of nuclear proliferation and the process of nuclear \ndisarmament; and strengthen international peace and security. The CTBT \nmarks a historic milestone in our drive to reduce the nuclear threat \nand to build a safer world. For these reasons, we hope that at an \nappropriate time, the Senate will reconsider this treaty in a manner \nthat will ensure a fair and thorough hearing process and will allow for \nmore thoughtful debate.\n\n  With 35 member states, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) is a widely \naccepted, mature, and effective export-control arrangement. At its May \n1999 Plenary and related meetings in Florence, Italy, the NSG \nconsidered new members (although none were accepted at that meeting), \nreviewed efforts to enhance transparency, and pursued efforts to \nstreamline procedures and update control lists. The NSG created an \nImplementation Working Group, chaired by the UK, to consider changes to \nthe guidelines, membership issues, the relationship with the NPT \nExporters (Zangger) Committee, and controls on brokering. The \nTransparency Working Group was tasked with preparing a report on NSG \nactivities for presentation at the 2000 NPT Review Conference by the \nItalian chair. The French will host the Plenary and assume the NSG \nChair in 2000 and the United States will host and chair in 2001.\n  The NSG is currently considering membership requests from Turkey and \nBelarus. Turkey's membership is pending only agreement by Russia to \njoin the intercessional consensus of all other NSG members. The United \nStates believes it would be appropriate to confirm intercessional \nconsensus in support of Turkey's membership before considering other \ncandidates. Belarus has been in consultation with the NSG Chair and \nother members including Russia and the United States regarding its \ninterest in membership and the status of its implementation of export \ncontrols to meet NSG Guideline standards. The United States will not \nblock intercessional consensus of NSG members in support of NSG \nmembership for Belarus, provided that consensus for Turkey's membership \nprecedes it. Cyprus and Kazakhstan have also expressed interest in \nmembership and are in consultation with the NSG Chair and other members \nregarding the status of their export control systems. China is the only \nmajor nuclear supplier that is not a member of the NSG, primarily \nbecause it has not accepted the NSG policy of requiring full-scope \nsafeguards as a condition for supply of nuclear trigger list items to \nnonnuclear weapon states. However, China has taken major steps toward \nharmonization of its export control system with the NSG Guidelines by \nthe implementation of controls over nuclear-related dual-use equipment \nand technology.\n  During the last 6 months, we reviewed intelligence and other reports \nof trade in nuclear-related material and technology that might be \nrelevant to nuclear-related sanctions provisions in the Iran-Iraq Arms \nNon-Proliferation Act of 1992, as amended; the Export-Import Bank Act \nof 1945,\n\n[[Page S14528]]\n\nas amended; and the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. No \nstatutory sanctions determinations were reached during this reporting \nperiod. The administrative measures imposed against ten Russian \nentities for their nuclear- and/or missile-related cooperation with \nIran remain in effect.\n\n\n                    chemical and biological weapons\n\n  The export control regulations issued under the Enhanced \nProliferation Control Initiative (EPCI) remain fully in force and \ncontinue to be applied by the Department of Commerce, in consultation \nwith other agencies, in order to control the export of items with \npotential use in chemical or biological weapons or unmanned delivery \nsystems for weapons of mass destruction.\n  Chemical weapons (CW) continue to pose a very serious threat to our \nsecurity and that of our allies. On April 29, 1997, the Convention on \nthe Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (the Chemical Weapons \nConvention or CWC) entered into force with 87 of the CWC's 165 States \nSignatories as original States Parties. The United States was among \ntheir number, having ratified the CWC on April 25, 1997. Russia \nratified the CWC on November 5, 1997, and became a State Party on \nDecember 8, 1997. To date, 126 countries (including China, Iran, India, \nPakistan, and Ukraine) have become States Parties.\n  The implementing body for the CWC--the Organization for the \nProhibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)--was established at entry-into-\nforce (EIF) of the Convention on April 29, 1997. The OPCW, located in \nThe Hague, has primary responsibility (along with States Parties) for \nimplementing the CWC. It consists of the Conference of the States \nParties, the Executive Council (EC), and the Technical Secretariat \n(TS). The TS carries out the verification provisions of the CWC, and \npresently has a staff of approximately 500, including about 200 \ninspectors trained and equipped to inspect military and industrial \nfacilities throughout the world. To date, the OPCW has conducted over \n500 routine inspections in some 29 countries. No challenge inspections \nhave yet taken place. To date, nearly 170 inspections have been \nconducted at military facilities in the United States. The OPCW \nmaintains a permanent inspector presence at operational U.S. CW \ndestruction facilities in Utah and Johnston Island.\n  The United States is determined to seek full implementation of the \nconcrete measures in the CWC designed to raise the costs and risks for \nany state or terrorist attempting to engage in chemical weapons-related \nactivities. The CWC's declaration requirements improve our knowledge of \npossible chemical weapons activities. Its inspection provisions provide \nfor access to declared and undeclared facilities and locations, thus \nmaking clandestine chemical weapons production and stockpiling more \ndifficult, more risky, and more expensive.\n\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 was \nenacted into U.S. law in October 1998, as part of the Omnibus \nConsolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act for Fiscal \nYear 1999 (Public Law 105-277). My Administration published an \nExecutive order on June 25, 1999, to facilitate implementation of the \nAct and is working to publish regulations regarding industrial \ndeclarations and inspections of industrial facilities. Submission of \nthese declarations to the OPCW, and subsequent inspections, will enable \nthe United States to be fully complaint with the CWC. United States \nnoncompliance to date has, among other things, undermined U.S. \nleadership in the organization as well as our ability to encourage \nother States Parties to make complete, accurate, and timely \ndeclarations.\n  Countries that refuse to join the CWC will be politically isolated \nand prohibited by the CWC from trading with States Parties in certain \nkey chemicals. The relevant treaty provisions are specifically designed \nto penalize countries that refuse to join the rest of the world in \neliminating the threat of chemical weapons.\n  The United States also continues to play a leading role in the \ninternational effort to reduce the threat from biological weapons (BW). \nWe participate actively in the Ad Hoc Group (AHG) of States Parties \nstriving to complete a legally binding protocol to strengthen and \nenhance compliance with the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the \nDevelopment, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) \nand Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (the Biological Weapons \nConvention or BWC). This Ad Hoc Group was mandated by the September \n1994 BWC Special Conference. The Fourth BWC Review Conference, held in \nNovember/December 1996, urged the AHG to complete the protocol as soon \nas possible but not later than the next Review Conference to be held in \n2001. Work is progressing on a draft rolling text through insertion of \nnational views and clarification of existing text. Five AHG negotiating \nsessions were scheduled for 1999. The United States is working toward \ncompletion of the substance of a strong Protocol next year.\n  On January 27, 1998, during the State of the Union address, I \nannounced that the United States would take a leading role in the \neffort to erect stronger international barriers against the \nproliferation and use of BW by strengthening the BWC with a new \ninternational system to detect and deter cheating. The United States is \nworking closely with U.S. industry representatives to obtain technical \ninput relevant to the development of U.S. negotiating positions and \nthen to reach international agreement on data declarations and on-site \ninvestigations.\n  The United States continues to be a leading participant in the 30-\nmember Australia Group (AG) chemical and biological weapons \nnonproliferation regime. The United States attended the most recent \nannual AG Plenary Session from October 4-8, 1999, during which the \nGroup reaffirmed the members' continued collective belief in the \nGroup's viability, importance, and compatibility with the CWC and BWC. \nMembers continue to agree that full adherence to the CWC and BWC by all \ngovernments will be the only way to achieve a permanent global ban on \nchemical and biological weapons, and that all states adhering to these \nConventions must take steps to ensure that their national activities \nsupport these goals. At the 1999 Plenary, the Group continued to focus \non strengthening AG export controls and sharing information to address \nthe threat of CBW terrorism. The AG also reaffirmed its commitment to \ncontinue its active outreach program of briefings for non-AG countries, \nand to promote regional consultations on export controls and non-\nproliferation to further awareness and understanding of national \npolicies in these areas. The AG discussed ways to be more proactive in \nstemming attacks on the AG in the CWC and BWC contexts.\n  During the last 6 months, we continued to examine closely \nintelligence and other reports of trade in CBW-related material and \ntechnology that might be relevant to sanctions provisions under the \nChemical and Biological Weapons Controls and Warfare Elimination Act of \n1991. No new sanctions determinations were reached during this \nreporting period. The United States also continues to cooperate with \nits AG partners and other countries in stopping shipments of \nproliferation concern.\n\n\n          Missiles for Delivery of Weapons of mass Destruction\n\n  The United States continues carefully to control exports that could \ncontribute to unmanned delivery systems for weapons of mass \ndestruction, and closely to monitor activities of potential missile \nproliferation concern. We also continued to implement U.S. missile \nsanctions laws. In March 1999, we imposed missile sanctions against \nthree Middle Eastern entities for transfers involving Category II \nMissile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Annex items. Category I \nmissile sanctions imposed in April 1998 against North Korean and \nPakistani entities for the transfer from North Korea to Pakistan of \nequipment and technology related to the Ghauri missile remain in \neffect.\n  During this reporting period, MTCR Partners continued to share \ninformation about proliferation problems with each other and with other \npotential supplier, consumer, and transshipment states. Partners also \nemphasized the need for implementing effective export control systems. \nThis cooperation has resulted in the interdiction of missile-related \nmaterials intended for use in missile programs of concern.\n  In June the United States participated in the MTCR's Reinforced Point \nof Contact Meeting (RPOC). At the\n\n[[Page S14529]]\n\nRPOC, MTCR Partners held in-depth discussions of regional \nmissile proliferation concerns, focusing in particular on Iran, North \nKorea, and South Asia. They also discussed steps Partners can take to \nfurther increase outreach to nonmembers. The Partners agreed to \ncontinue their discussion of this important topic at the October 1999 \nNoordwijk MTCR Plenary.\n\n  Also in June, the United States participated in a German-hosted MTCR \nworkshop at which Partners and non-Partners discussed ways to address \nthe proliferation potential inherent in intangible technology \ntransfers. The seminar helped participants to develop a greater \nunderstanding of the intangible technology issue (i.e., how \nproliferators misuse the internet, scientific conferences, plant \nvisits, student exchange programs, and higher education to acquire \nsensitive technology), and to begin to identify steps governments can \ntake to address this problem.\n  In July 1999, the Partners completed a reformatting of the MTCR \nAnnex. The newly reformatted Annex is intended to improve clarity and \nuniformity of implementation of MTCR controls while maintaining the \ncoverage of the previous version of the MTCR Annex.\n  The MTCR held its Fourteenth Plenary Meeting in Noordwijk, The \nNetherlands, on October 11-15. At the Plenary, the Partners shared \ninformation about activities of missile proliferation concern \nworldwide. They focussed in particular on the threat to international \nsecurity and stability posed by missile proliferation in key regions \nand considered what practical steps they could take, individually and \ncollectively, to address ongoing missile-related activities of concern. \nDuring their discussions, Partners gave special attention to DPRK \nmissile activities and also discussed the threat posed by missile-\nrelated activities in South and North East Asia and the Middle East.\n  During this reporting period, the United States continued to work \nunilaterally and in coordination with its MTCR Partners to combat \nmissile proliferation and to encourage nonmembers to export responsibly \nand to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. To encourage international focus \non missile proliferation issues, the USG also placed the issue on the \nagenda for the G8 Cologne Summit, resulting in an undertaking to \nexamine further individual and collective means of addressing this \nproblem and reaffirming commitment to the objectives of the MTCR. Since \nmy last report, we continued our missile nonproliferation dialogues \nwith China (interrupted after the accidental bombing of China's \nBelgrade Embassy), India, the Republic of Korea (ROK), North Korea \n(DPRK), and Pakistan. In the course of normal diplomatic relations we \nalso have pursued such discussions with other countries in Central \nEurope, South Asia, and the Middle East.\n  In March 1999, the United States and the DPRK held a fourth round of \nmissile talks to underscore our strong opposition to North Korea's \ndestabilizing missile development and export activities and press for \ntight constraints on DPRK missile development, testing, and exports. We \nalso affirmed that the United States viewed further launches of long-\nrange missiles and transfers of long-range missiles or technology for \nsuch missiles as direct threats to U.S. allies and ultimately to the \nUnited States itself. We subsequently have reiterated that message at \nevery available opportunity. In particular, we have reminded the DPRK \nof the consequences of another rocket launch and encouraged it not to \ntake such action. We also have urged the DPRK to take steps towards \nbuilding a constructive bilateral relationship with the United States.\n  These efforts have resulted in an important first step. Since \nSeptember 1999, it has been our understanding that the DPRK will \nrefrain from testing long-range missiles of any kind during our \ndiscussions to improve relations. In recognition of this DPRK step, the \nUnited States has announced the easing of certain sanctions related to \nthe import and export of many consumer goods.\n  In response to reports of continuing Iranian efforts to acquire \nsensitive items from Russian entities for use in Iran's missile and \nnuclear development programs, the United States continued its high-\nlevel dialogue with Russia aimed at finding ways the United States and \nRussia can work together to cut off the flow of sensitive goods to \nIran's ballistic missile development program. During this reporting \nperiod, Russia's government created institutional foundations to \nimplement a newly enacted nonproliferation policy and passed laws to \npunish wrongdoers. It also passed new export control legislation to \ntighten government control over sensitive technologies and began \nworking with the United States to strengthen export control practices \nat Russian aerospace firms. However, despite the Russian government's \nnonproliferation and export control efforts, some Russian entities \ncontinued to cooperate with Iran's ballistic missile program and to \nengage in nuclear cooperation with Iran beyond the Bushehr reactor \nproject. The administrative measures imposed on ten Russian entities \nfor their missile- and nuclear-related cooperation with Iran remain in \neffect.\n\n\n               Value of Nonproliferation Export Controls\n\n  United States national export controls--both those implemented \npursuant to multilateral nonproliferation regimes and those implemented \nunilaterally--play an important part in impeding the proliferation of \nWMD and missiles. (As used here, ``export controls'' refer to \nrequirements for case-by-case review of certain exports, or limitations \non exports of particular items of proliferation concern to certain \ndestinations, rather than broad embargoes or economic sanctions that \nalso affect trade.) As noted in this report, however, export controls \nare only one of a number of tools the United States uses to achieve its \nnonproliferation objectives. Global nonproliferation norms, informal \nmultilateral nonproliferation regimes, interdicting shipments of \nproliferation concern, sanctions, export control assistance, \nredirection and elimination efforts, and robust U.S. military, \nintelligence, and diplomatic capabilities all work in conjunction with \nexport controls as part of our overall nonproliferation strategy.\n\n  Export controls are a critical part of nonproliferation because every \nproliferant WMD/missile program seeks equipment and technology from \nother countries. Proliferators look overseas because needed items are \nunavailable elsewhere, because indigenously produced items are of \ninsufficient quality or quantity, and/or because imported items can be \nobtained more quickly and cheaply than producing them at home. It is \nimportant to note that proliferators seek for their programs both items \non multilateral lists (like gyroscopes controlled on the MTCR Annex and \nnerve gas ingredients on the Australia Group list) and unlisted items \n(like lower-level machine tools and very basic chemicals). In addition, \nmany of the items of interest to proliferators are inherently dual-use. \nFor example, key ingredients and technologies used in the production of \nfertilizers and pesticides also can be used to make chemical weapons; \nvaccine production technology (albeit not the vaccines themselves) can \nassist in the production of biological weapons.\n  The most obvious value of export controls is in impeding or even \ndenying proliferators access to key pieces of equipment or technology \nfor use in their WMD/missile programs. In large part, U.S. national \nexport controls--and similar controls of our partners in the Australia \nGroup, Missile Technology Control Regime, and Nuclear Suppliers Group--\nhave denied proliferators access to the largest sources of the best \nequipment and technology. Proliferators have mostly been forced to seek \nless capable items from nonregime suppliers. Moreover, in many \ninstances, U.S. and regime controls and associated efforts have forced \nproliferators to engage in complex clandestine procurements even from \nnonmember suppliers, taking time and money away from proliferant \nprograms.\n  United States national export controls and those of our regime \npartners also have played an important leadership role, increasing over \ntime the critical mass of countries applying nonproliferation export \ncontrols. For example, none of the following progress would have been \npossible without the leadership shown by U.S. willingness to be the \nfirst to apply controls: the seven-member MTCR of 1987 has grown\n\n[[Page S14530]]\n\nto 32 member countries; several nonmember countries have been persuaded \nto apply export controls consistent with one or more of the regimes \nunilaterally; and most of the members of the nonproliferation regimes \nhave applied national ``catch-all'' controls similar to those under the \nU.S. Enhanced Proliferation Control Initiative. (Export controls \nnormally are tied to a specific list of items, such as the MTCR Annex. \n``Catch-all'' controls provide a legal basis to control exports of \nitems not on a list, when those items are destined for WMD/missile \nprograms.)\n  United States export controls, especially ``catch-all'' controls, \nalso make important political and moral contributions to the \nnonproliferation effort. They uphold the broad legal obligations the \nUnited States has undertaken in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty \n(Article I), Biological Weapons Convention (Article III), and Chemical \nWeapons Convention (Article I) not to assist anyone in proscribed WMD \nactivities. They endeavor to assure there are no U.S. ``fingerprints'' \non WMD and missiles that threaten U.S. citizens and territory and our \nfriends and interests overseas. They place the United States squarely \nand unambiguously against WMD/missile proliferation, even against the \nprospect of inadvertent proliferation from the United States itself.\n  Finally, export controls play an important role in enabling and \nenhancing legitimate trade. They provide a means to permit dual-use \nexport to proceed under circumstances where, without export control \nscrutiny, the only prudent course would be to prohibit them. They help \nbuild confidence between countries applying similar controls that, in \nturn, results in increased trade. Each of the WMD nonproliferation \nregimes, for example, has a ``no undercut'' policy committing each \nmember not to make an export that another has denied for \nnonproliferation reasons and notified to the rest--unless it first \nconsults with the original denying country. Not only does this policy \nmake it more difficult for proliferators to get items from regime \nmembers, it establishes a ``level playing field'' for exporters.\n\n\n                            threat reduction\n\n  The potential for proliferation of WMD and delivery system expertise \nhas increased in part as a consequence of the economic crisis in Russia \nand other Newly Independent States, causing concern. My Administration \ngives high priority to controlling the human dimension of proliferation \nthrough programs that support the transition of former Soviet weapons \nscientists to civilian research and technology development activities. \nI have proposed an additional $4.5 billion for programs embodied in the \nExpanded Threat Reduction Initiative that would support activities in \nfour areas: nuclear security; nonnuclear WMD; science and technology \nnonproliferation; and military relocation, stabilization and other \nsecurity cooperation programs. Congressional support for this \ninitiative would enable the engagement of a broad range of programs \nunder the Departments of State, Energy, and Defense.\n\n\n                                expenses\n\n  Pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1641(c)), I report that there were no specific expenses directly \nattributable to the exercise of authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of the national emergency in Executive Order 12938, as \namended, during the period from May 15, 1999, through November 10, \n1999.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to redesignate the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency as the ``Federal Fire and Emergency Management Agency,'' and to \namend the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act to 1974 to authorize \nthe Director of the Federal Fire and Emergency Management Agency to \nmake grants to local fire departments for the purpose of protecting the \npublic and firefighting personnel against fire and fire-related \nhazards; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n    The Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould better equip our nation's firefighters to fight the ever-\nincreasing threat of property destruction and potential loss of life.\n  The ``Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act of \n1999'' would authorize the newly-named Federal Fire and Emergency \nManagement Agency to make available matching grants on a competitive \nbasis to fire departments for the purpose of protecting the public and \nfirefighting personnel against fire and fire-related hazards. This bill \nis a companion to H.R. 1168, which was introduced by my colleague in \nthe House of Representatives, Congressman Pascrell.\n  Mr. President, each year approximately 100 of our nation's \nfirefighters pay the ultimate sacrifice to preserve the safety of our \ncommunities. Increased demands on firefighting personnel have made it \ndifficult for local governments to prepare for necessary fire safety \nprecautions. The fire loss in the United States is serious, and the \nfire death rate is one of the highest per capita in the industrialized \nworld. Fire kills more than 4,000 people and injures more than 25,000 \npeople each year. Today, 11 people will die due to fire. Two of these \npeople are likely to be children under the age of 5. Another 68 people \nwill be injured due to fire. Financially, the impact of America's \nestimated 2.2 million fires annually is over $9 billion in direct \nproperty losses. Those numbers are staggering, and many of these losses \ncould have been prevented.\n  The bill I introduce today would make grants available to train \nfirefighter personnel in firefighting, emergency response, arson \nprevention and detection, and the handling of hazardous substances or \npollutants or contaminants associated with the illegal manufacture of \namphetamine or methamphetamine.\n  This bill also creates partnerships by allowing for the effective use \nof the capabilities of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, the Department of Commerce, and the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission for research and development aimed at advancing the health \nand safety of firefighters; information technologies for fire \nmanagement; technologies for fire prevention and protection; \nfirefighting technologies; and burn care and rehabilitation.\n  In addition, this legislation would ensure that grants would be made \nto a wide variety of fire departments, including applicants from paid, \nvolunteer, and combination fire departments, large and small, which are \nsituated in urban, suburban and rural communities.\n  Mr. President, despite the risks, 1.2 million men and women \nfirefighters willingly put their lives on the line responding to over \n17 million calls, annually. Our greatest challenge is to put limited \nresources to work where they will make the most difference in saving \nlives and reducing losses.\n  I am pleased that the bill I introduce today has been endorsed by the \nColorado State Fire Chief's Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. I \nask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Firefighter Investment and \n     Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) increased demands on firefighting personnel have made \n     it difficult for local governments to adequately fund \n     necessary fire safety precautions;\n       (2) the Federal Government has an obligation to protect the \n     health and safety of the firefighting personnel of the United \n     States and to help ensure that the personnel have the \n     financial resources to protect the public;\n       (3) the United States has serious fire losses, including a \n     fire death rate that is one of the highest per capita in the \n     industrialized world;\n       (4) in the United States, fire kills more than 4,000 people \n     and injures more than 25,000 people each year;\n       (5) in any single day in the United States, on the \n     average--\n       (A) 11 people will die because of fire;\n       (B) 2 of those people are likely to be children under the \n     age of 5;\n       (C) 68 people will be injured because of fire; and\n       (D) over $9,000,000,000 in property losses will occur from \n     fire; and\n       (6) those statistics demonstrate a critical need for \n     Federal investment in support of firefighting personnel.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Federal Emergency Management Agency is \n     redesignated as the ``Federal Fire and Emergency Management \n     Agency''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the Federal Fire and Emergency Management \n     Agency.\n       (c) Conforming Amendments to Federal Fire Prevention and \n     Control Act of 1974.--Sections 4(4), 17, and 31(a)(5)(B) of \n     the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 \n     U.S.C. 2203(4), 2216, and 2227(a)(5)(B)) are amended by \n     striking ``Federal Emergency Management Agency'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``Federal Fire and Emergency \n     Management Agency''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Chafee, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Levin, and Mrs. \n        Hutchison):\n  S. 1900. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit to holders of qualified bonds issued by Amtrak, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     high-speed rail investment act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, overcrowding on our highways and in \nour skies is almost at the crisis point. We're spending billions of \ndollars each year in wasted gas and wasted time because there are fewer \nand fewer ways to get somewhere quickly and comfortably.\n  We're not going to solve that problem by simply building new roads or \nairports. People don't want airports in their backyards, and there just \nisn't enough space in many parts of the country for new roads. Besides, \nnew airports and new roads cost billions. And they become obsolete \nalmost as quickly as we build them.\n  Instead of wasting money on ineffective short-term solutions, we \nshould be investing in a transportation plan that promises lasting \nbenefits far into the next century.\n  High-speed rail is the future of transportation in this country. \nTrain travel is comfortable, reliable, and it's getting faster all the \ntime. The rail lines are already there. All we need to do is bring them \nup to 21st-century standards.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today would make a serious investment \nin the future of high-speed rail. And an investment in high-speed rail \nis an investment in less crowded highways and airports, cleaner air, \nand a new level of productivity for millions of Americans whose jobs \nand lifestyles depend on efficient transportation.\n  Mr. President, I'm willing to bet that every Member of this Senate \nhas at least one recent memory of a plane flight that went horribly \nwrong. Missed connections. Hours spent inside an overheated plane stuck \non the tarmac. Lost baggage. I know I've had plenty of experiences like \nthat.\n  And even when everything goes according to plan, air travel is \nuncomfortable at best. You almost have to know yoga just to cram \nyourself into one of those tiny seats.\n  Commuting by car isn't any better. Parts of Interstate 95 regularly \nturn into parking lots during week-day rush hours. And all this \ncongestion can lead to truly life-threatening situations. Traffic \naccidents. Higher pollution levels. Explosions of road rage that \nactually lead people to pull guns on each other on the highway.\n  Land and financial resources are scarce and we need to make better \nuse of what we already have. Our rail lines are there, ready to help \nsolve the overcrowding problems that are making our other \ntransportation options less and less appealing. But for the most part, \nU.S. transportation policy has ignored the potential of high-speed rail \nand our rail system has fallen far below the standards set in nearly \nevery other developed nation on the planet.\n  My legislation seeks to change that by authorizing Amtrak to sell $10 \nbillion in high-speed rail bonds over ten years to develop high-speed \ncorridors across the nation. This leveraging of private sector \ninvestment will allow Amtrak to complete the Northeast Corridor high-\nspeed project and provide the funding needed to bring faster, better \nservice to federally designated high-speed corridors in other regions.\n  These corridors cover states in the Northeast, the Southeast, the \nMidwest, the Gulf Coast, and the Pacific Coast. Our aim is to take what \nwe've learned in the Northeast and provide it to the rest of the \nnation.\n  The Federal Government would subsidize these bonds by providing tax \ncredits to bondholders in lieu of interest payments. And state matching \nfunds would help to secure repayment of the bond principal.\n  Mr. President, the money we don't spend on high-speed rail today we \nwill have to spend tomorrow--on things like highway construction and \npollution controls.\n  Investing in high speed rail is not only good transportation policy, \nit is good land use policy. Constructing an airport or highway outside \nof city limits promotes sprawl, robs cities of valuable revenue, and \nincreases the pressure for even more road construction.\n\n[[Page S14535]]\n\nRail travel, on the other hand, is downtown-to-downtown, not suburb-to-\nsuburb. Rail transportation encourages efficient, ``smart growth'' land \nuse patterns, preserves downtown economies, protects open space, and \nimproves air quality.\n  Furthermore, passenger rail stations serve as focal points for \ncommercial development, promoting downtown redevelopment and generating \nincreased retail business and tax revenue. Making efficient and cost-\neffective use of existing infrastructures is an increasingly important \ngoal and one which this legislation will help achieve.\n  Mr. President, high-speed rail is already proving itself. In 1999, \nAmtrak's Metroliner train between Washington and New York set its third \nconsecutive ridership record with over two million passengers, and \nAmtrak reported the highest total revenues in the corporation's 28-year \nhistory. The reason is simple--people are becoming less and less \nsatisfied with traveling by plane. And more and more frustrated with \ngridlock on our highways.\n  You can see why. The summer of 1999 was the most delay-plagued season \nin history for airlines. And these delays are expensive. In 1998, air \ntraffic control delays cost the airlines and passengers a combined $4.5 \nbillion.\n  Unfortunately, this problem is only going to get worse. The number of \npeople flying is increasing significantly. In 1998 there were 643 \nmillion airplane boardings in the U.S., up 25 percent from just five \nyears ago. The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that boardings \nwill increase to 917 million by 2008. Our current aviation system can't \nhandle this demand. We need a quality passenger rail system to relieve \nsome of this pressure.\n  Passenger rail can make a difference, particularly between cities \nlocated on high-speed corridors. I went back and looked at the list of \nthe 31 airports expected to experience more than 20,000 passenger hours \nof flight delays in 2007. The vast majority of these airports--more \nthan three out of four--are located on a high-speed rail corridor. If \nthe funding envisioned in this legislation were made available to \ndevelop these corridors, we could take much of the burden of short \nflights off our aviation system. That would allow airlines to \nconcentrate their limited slots and resources on longer-distance \nflights.\n  Traffic congestion costs commuters even more--an estimated $74 \nbillion a year in lost productivity and wasted fuel. These commuters, \neven the ones who continue to drive, will be well served by an \ninvestment in high-speed rail corridors. Amtrak takes 18,000 cars a day \noff the roads between Philadelphia and New York. Without Amtrak, these \ncongested roads would be in far worse shape. Commuters in other parts \nof the country should be able to benefit from high-quality, fast rail \nservice that takes cars off the road and helps to improve the \nperformance of our overall transportation system.\n  This bill does not just benefit those who ride trains. Everyone who \ndrives a car on congested highways or suffers from delays while using \nour overburdened aviation system will benefit from the rail investment \ncalled for in this legislation. I can tell you, as a former businessman \nwho helped run a very profitable company, that high-speed rail is a \nsmart investment. And it's an investment that deserves support from \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1901. A bill to establish the Privacy Protection Study Commission \nto evaluate the efficacy of the Freedom of Information Act and the \nElectronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, to determine \nwhether new laws are necessary, and to provide advice and \nrecommendations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the privacy protection study commission act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Privacy \nProtection Study Commission Act of 1999 with my colleague Senator \nTorricelli. This legislation addresses privacy protection by creating \nan expert Commission charged with the duty to explore privacy concerns. \nWe cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. Privacy matters, \nand it will continue to matter more and more in this information age of \nhigh speed data, Internet transactions, and lightning-quick \ntechnological advances.\n  There exists a massive wealth of information in today's world, which \nis increasingly stored electronically. In fact, experts estimate that \nthe average American is ``profiled'' in up to 150 commercial electronic \ndatabases. That means that there is a great deal of data--in some \ncases, very detailed and personal--out there and easily accessible \ncourtesy of the Internet revolution. With the click of a button it is \npossible to examine all sorts of personal information, be it an \naddress, a criminal record, a credit history, a shopping performance, \nor even a medical file.\n  Generally, the uses of this data are benign, even beneficial. \nOccasionally, however, personal information is obtained \nsurreptitiously, and even peddled to third parties for profit or other \nuses. This is especially troubling when, in many cases, people do not \neven know that their own personal information is being ``shopped.''\n  Two schools of thought exist on how we should address these privacy \nconcerns. There are some who insist that we must do something and do it \nquickly. Others urge us to rely entirely on ``self-regulation''--\naccording to them most companies will act reasonably and, if not, \nconsumers will demand privacy protection as a condition for their \ncontinued business.\n  Both approaches have some merit, but also some problems. For example, \neven though horror stories abound about violations of privacy, Congress \nshould not act by anecdote or on the basis of a few bad actors. Indeed, \nenacting ``knee-jerk,'' ``quick-fix'' legislation could very well do \nmore harm than good. By the same token, however, self-regulation alone \nis unlikely to be the silver bullet that solves all privacy concerns. \nBy itself, we have no assurance that it will bring the actors in line \nwith adequate privacy protection standards.\n  Because it is better to do it right--in terms of addressing the \nmyriad of complicated privacy concerns--than to do it fast, perhaps \nwhat is needed is a cooling off period. Such a ``breather'' will ensure \nthat our action is based on a comprehensive understanding of the \nissues, rather than a ``mishmash'' of political pressures and clever \nsoundbites.\n  For those reasons, and recognizing that there are no quick and easy \nanswers, I suggest that we step back to consider the issue of privacy \nmore thoughtfully. Let's admit that neither laws nor self-regulation \nalone may be the solution. Let's also concede that no one is going to \ndivine the right approach overnight. But given the time and resources, \na ``Privacy Protection Study Commission'' composed of experts drawn \nfrom the fields of law, civil rights and liberties, privacy matters, \nbusiness, or information technology, may offer insights on how to \naddress and ensure balanced privacy protection into the next \nmillennium.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do just that. The Commission \nwould be comprised of nine bright minds equally chosen by the Senate, \nthe House, and the Administration. As drafted, the Commission will be \ngranted the latitude to explore and fully examine the current \ncomplexities of privacy protection. After 18 months, the Commission \nwill be required to report back to Congress with its findings and \nproposals. If legislation is necessary, the Commission will be in the \nbest position to recommend a balanced course of action. And if \nlawmaking is not warranted, the Commission's recognition of that fact \nwill help persuade a skeptical Congress and public.\n  This is not a brand new idea. Twenty-five years ago, Congress created \na Privacy Protection Commission to study privacy concerns as they \nrelated to government uses of personal information. That Commission's \nfindings were seminal. A quarter of a century later, because so much \nhas changed, it is time to re-examine this issue on a much broader \nscale. The uses of personal information that concerned the Commission \n25 years ago have exploded today, especially in this era of e-commerce, \nsuper databases, and mega-mergers. People are genuinely worried--\nperhaps they shouldn't be--but their concerns are real.\n  For example, a Wall Street Journal survey revealed that Americans \ntoday are more concerned about invasions of their personal privacy than \nthey are\n\n[[Page S14536]]\n\nabout world war. Another poll cited in the Economist noted that 80 \npercent are worried about what happens to information collected about \nthem. William Afire summed it up best in a recent New York Times essay: \n``We are dealing here with a political sleeper issue. People are \ngetting wise to being secretly examined and manipulated and it rubs \nthem the wrong way.''\n  One final note: given that privacy is not an easy issue and that it \nappears in so many other contexts, I invite all interested parties to \nhelp us improve our legislation to create a Commission. We need to \nforge a middle ground consensus with our approach, and the door is open \nto all who share this goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previously cited \nmaterial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                   [From the Economist--May 1, 1999]\n\n                           The End of Privacy\n\n       Remember, they are always watching you. Use cash when you \n     can. Do not give your phone number, social-security number or \n     address, unless you absolutely have to. Do not fill in \n     questionnaires or respond to telemarketers. Demand that \n     credit and datamarketing firms produce all information they \n     have on you, correct errors and remove you from marketing \n     lists. Check your medical records often. If you suspect a \n     government agency has a file on you, demand to see it. Block \n     caller ID on your phone, and keep your number unlisted. Never \n     use electronic tollbooths on roads. Never leave your mobile \n     phone on--your movements can be traced. Do not use store \n     credit or discount cards. If you must use the Internet, \n     encrypt your e-mail, reject all ``cookies'' and never give \n     your real name when registering at websites. Better still, \n     use somebody else's computer. At work, assume that calls, \n     voice mail, e-mail and computer use are all monitored.\n       This sounds like a paranoid ravings of the Unabomber. In \n     fact, it is advice being offered by the more zealous of \n     today's privacy campaigners. In an increasingly wired world, \n     people are continually creating information about themselves \n     that is recorded and often sold or pooled with information \n     from other sources. The goal of privacy advocates is not \n     extreme. Anyone who took these precautions would merely be \n     seeking a level of privacy available to all 20 years ago. And \n     yet such behaviour now would seem obsessive and paranoid \n     indeed.\n       That is a clue to how fast things have changed. To try to \n     restore the privacy that was universal in the 1970s is to \n     chase a chimera. Computer technology is developing so rapidly \n     that it is hard to predict how it will be applied. But some \n     trends are unmistakable. The volume of data recorded about \n     people will continue to expand dramatically (see pages 21-\n     23). Disputes about privacy will become more bitter. Attempts \n     to restrain the surveillance society through new laws will \n     intensify. Consumers will pay more for services that offer a \n     privacy pledge. And the market for privacy-protection \n     technology will grow.\n     Always observed\n       Yet there is a bold prediction: all these efforts to hold \n     back the rising tide of electronic intrusion into privacy \n     will fail. They may offer a brief respite for those \n     determined, whatever the trouble or cost, to protect \n     themselves. But 20 years hence most people will find that the \n     privacy they take for granted today will be just as elusive \n     as the privacy of the 1970s now seems. Some will shrug and \n     say: ``Who cares? I have nothing to hide.'' But many others \n     will be disturbed by the idea that most of their behaviour \n     leaves a permanent and easily traceable record. People will \n     have to start assuming that they simply have no privacy. This \n     will constitute one of the greatest social changes of modern \n     times.\n       Privacy is doomed for the same reason that it has been \n     eroded so fast over the past two decades. Presented with the \n     prospect of its loss, many might prefer to eschew even the \n     huge benefits that the new information economy promises. But \n     they will not, in practice, be offered that choice. Instead, \n     each benefit--safer streets, cheaper communications, more \n     entertainment, better government services, more convenient \n     shopping, a wider selection of products--will seem worth the \n     surrender of a bit more personal information. Privacy is a \n     residual value, hard to define or protect in the abstract. \n     The cumulative effect of these bargains--each attractive on \n     their own--will be the end of privacy.\n       For a similar reason, attempts to protect privacy through \n     new laws will fail--as they have done in the past. The \n     European Union's data protection directive, the most sweeping \n     recent attempt, gives individuals unprecedented control over \n     information about themselves. This could provide remedies \n     against the most egregious intrusions. But it is doubtful \n     whether the law can be applied in practice, if too many \n     people try to use it. Already the Europeans are hinting that \n     they will not enforce the strict terms of the directive \n     against America, which has less stringent protections.\n       Policing the proliferating number of databases and the \n     thriving trade in information would not only be costly in \n     itself, it would also impose huge burdens on the economy. \n     Moreover, such laws are based on a novel concept: that \n     individuals have a property right in information about \n     themselves. Broadly enforced, such a property right would be \n     antithetical to an open society. It would pose a threat not \n     only to commerce, but also to a free press and to much \n     political activity, to say nothing of everyday conversation.\n       It is more likely that laws will be used not to obstruct \n     the recording and collection of information, but to catch \n     those who use it to do harm. Fortunately, the same technology \n     that is destroying privacy also makes it easier to trap \n     stalkers, detect fraud, prosecute criminals and hold the \n     government to account. The result could be less privacy, \n     certainly--but also more security for the law-abiding.\n       Whatever new legal remedies emerge, opting out of \n     information-gathering is bound to become ever harder and less \n     attractive. If most urban streets are monitored by \n     intelligent video cameras that can identify criminals, who \n     will want to live on a street without one? If most people \n     carry their entire medical history on a plastic card that the \n     emergency services come to rely on, a refusal to carry the \n     card could be life-threatening. To get a foretaste of what is \n     to come, try hiring a car or booking a room at a top hotel \n     without a credit card.\n\n\n                                leaders\n\n       In a way, the future may be like the past, when few except \n     the rich enjoyed much privacy. To earlier generations, \n     escaping the claustrophobic all-knowingness of a village for \n     the relative anonymity of the city was one of the more \n     liberating aspects of modern life. But the era of urban \n     anonymity already looks like a mere historical interlude. \n     There is, however one difference between past and future. In \n     the village, everybody knew everybody else's business. In the \n     future, nobody will know for certain who knows what about \n     them. That will be uncomfortable. But the best advice may be: \n     get used to it.\n\n\n                        the surveillance society\n\n       New information technology offers huge benefits--higher \n     productivity, better crime prevention, improved medical care, \n     dazzling entertainment, more convenience. But it comes at a \n     price: less and less privacy\n       ``The right to be left alone.'' For many this phrase, made \n     famous by Louis Brandeis, an American Supreme Court justice, \n     captures the essence of a notoriously slippery, but crucial \n     concept. Drawing the boundaries of privacy has always been \n     tricky. Most people have long accepted the need to provide \n     some information about themselves in order to vote, work, \n     shop, pursue a business, socialise or even borrow a library \n     book. But exercising control over who knows what about you \n     has also come to be seen as an essential feature of a \n     civilised society.\n       Totalitarian excesses have made ``Big Brother'' one of the \n     20th century's most frightening bogeyman. Some right of \n     privacy, however qualified, has been a major difference \n     between democracies and dictatorships. An explicit right to \n     privacy is now enshrined in scores of national constitutions \n     as well as in international human-rights treaties. Without \n     the ``right to be left alone,'' to shut out on occasion the \n     prying eyes and importunities of both government and society, \n     other political and civil liberties seem fragile. Today most \n     people in rich societies assume that, provided they obey the \n     law, they have a right to enjoy privacy whenever it suits \n     them.\n       They are wrong. Despite a raft of laws, treaties and \n     constitutional provisions, privacy has been eroded for \n     decades. This trend is now likely to accelerate sharply. The \n     cause is the same as that which alarmed Brandeis when he \n     first popularized his phrase in an article in 1890; \n     technological change. In his day it was the spread of \n     photography and cheap printing that posed the most immediate \n     threat to privacy. In our day it is the computer. The \n     quantity of information that is now available to governments \n     and companies about individuals would have horrified \n     Brandeis. But the power to gather and disseminate data \n     electronically is growing so fast that it raises an even more \n     unsettling question: in 20 years' time, will there be any \n     privacy left to protect?\n       Most privacy debates concern media intrusion, which is also \n     what bothered Brandeis. And yet the greatest threat to \n     privacy today comes not from the media, whose antics affect \n     few people, but from the mundane business of recording and \n     collecting an ever-expanding number of everyday transactions. \n     Most people know that information is collected about them, \n     but are not certain how much. Many are puzzled or annoyed by \n     unsolicited junk mail coming through their letter boxes. And \n     yet junk mail is just the visible tip of an information \n     iceberg. The volume of personal data in both commercial and \n     government databases has grown by leaps and bounds in recent \n     years along with advances in computer technology. The United \n     States, perhaps the most computerized society in the world, \n     is leading the way, but other countries are not far behind.\n       Advances in computing are having a twin effect. They are \n     not only making it possible to collect information that once \n     went largely unrecorded, but are also making it relatively \n     easy to store, analyze and retrieve this information in ways \n     which, until quite recently, were impossible.\n       Just consider the amount of information already being \n     collected as a matter of routine--any spending that involves \n     a credit or\n\n[[Page S14537]]\n\n     bank debit card, most financial transactions, telephone \n     calls, all dealings with national or local government. \n     Supermarkets record every item being bought by customers who \n     use discount cards. Mobile-phone companies are busy \n     installing equipment that allows them to track the location \n     of anyone who has a phone switched on. Electronic toll-booths \n     and traffic-monitoring systems can record the movement of \n     individual vehicles. Pioneered in Britain, closed-circuit tv \n     cameras now scan increasingly large swathes of urban \n     landscapes in other countries too. The trade in consumer \n     information has hugely expanded in the past ten years. One \n     single company, Acxiom Corporation in Conway, Arkansas, has a \n     database combining public and consumer information that \n     covers 95% of American households. Is there anyone left on \n     the planet who does not know that their use of the Internet \n     is being recorded by somebody, somewhere?\n       Firms are as interested in their employees as in their \n     customers. A 1997 survey by the American Management \n     Association of 900 large companies found that nearly two-\n     thirds admitted to some form of electronic surveillance of \n     their own workers. Powerful new software makes it easy for \n     bosses to monitor and record not only all telephone \n     conversations, but every keystroke and e-mail message as \n     well.\n       Information is power, so its hardly surprising that \n     governments are as keen as companies to use data-processing \n     technology. They do this for many entirely legitimate \n     reasons--tracking benefit claimants, delivering better health \n     care, fighting crime, pursuing terrorists. But it inevitable \n     means more government surveillance.\n       A controversial law passed in 1994 to aid law enforcement \n     requires telecoms firms operating in America to install \n     equipment that allows the government to intercept and monitor \n     all telephone and data communications, although disputes \n     between the firms and the FBI have delayed its \n     implementation. Intelligence agencies from America, Britain, \n     Canada, Australia and New Zealand jointly monitor all \n     international satellite-telecommunications traffic via a \n     system called ``Echelon'' that can pick specific words or \n     phrases from hundreds of thousands of messages.\n       America, Britain, Canada and Australia are also compiling \n     national DNA databases of convicted criminals. Many other \n     countries are considering following suit. The idea of DNA \n     databases that cover entire populations is still highly \n     controversial, but those databases would be such a powerful \n     tool for fighting crime and disease that pressure for their \n     creation seems inevitable. Iceland's parliament has agreed a \n     plan to sell the DNA database of its population to a medical-\n     research firm, a move bitterly opposed by some on privacy \n     grounds.\n     To each a number\n       The general public may be only vaguely aware of the \n     mushrooming growth of information-gathering, but when they \n     are offered a glimpse, most people do not like what they see. \n     A survey by America's Federal Trade Commission found that 80% \n     of Americans are worried about what happens to information \n     collected about them. Skirmishes between privacy advocates \n     and those collecting information are occurring with \n     increasing frequency.\n       This year both intel and Microsoft have run into a storm of \n     criticism when it was revealed that their products--the chips \n     and software at the heart of most personal computers--\n     transmitted unique identification numbers whenever a \n     personal-computer user logged on to the Internet. Both \n     companies hastily offered software to allow users to turn the \n     identifying numbers off, but their critics maintain that any \n     software fix can be breached. In fact, a growing number of \n     electronic devices and software packages contain identifying \n     numbers to help them interact with each other.\n       In February an outcry greeted news that image Data, a small \n     New Hampshire firm, had received finance and technical \n     assistance from the American Secret Service to build a \n     national database of photographs used on drivers' licenses. \n     As a first step, the company had already bought the \n     photographs of more than 22m drivers from state governments \n     in South Carolina, Florida and Colorado. Image Data insists \n     that the database, which would allow retailers or police \n     across the country instantly to match a name and photograph, \n     is primarily designed to fight cheque and credit-card fraud. \n     But in response to more than 14,000 e-mail complaints, all \n     three state moved quickly to cancel the sale.\n       It is always hard to predict the impact of new technology, \n     but there are several developments already on the horizon \n     which, if the recent past is anything to go by, are bound to \n     be used for monitoring of one sort or another. The \n     paraphernalia of snooping, whether legal or not, is becoming \n     both frighteningly sophisticated and easily affordable. \n     Already, tiny microphones are capable of recording whispered \n     conversations from across the street. Conversations can even \n     be monitored from the normally imperceptible vibrations of \n     window glass. Some technologists think that the tiny \n     battlefield reconnaissance drones being developed by the \n     American armed forces will be easy to commercialize. Small \n     video cameras the size of a large wasp may some day be able \n     to fly into a room, attach themselves to a wall or ceiling \n     and record everything that goes on there.\n       Overt monitoring is likely to grow as well. Intelligent \n     software systems are already able to scan and identify \n     individuals from video images. Combined with the plummeting \n     price and size of cameras, such software should eventually \n     make video surveillance possible almost anywhere, at any \n     time. Street criminals might then be observed and traced with \n     ease.\n       The burgeoning field of ``biometrics'' will make possible \n     cheap and fool-proof systems that can identify people from \n     their voices, eyeballs, thumbprints or any other measurable \n     part of their anatomy. That could mean doing away with \n     today's cumbersome array of security passes, tickets and even \n     credit cards. Alternatively, pocket-sized ``smart' cards \n     might soon be able to store all of a person's medical or \n     credit history, among other things, together with physical \n     data needed to verify his or her identity.\n       In a few years' time utilities might be able to monitor the \n     performance of home appliances, sending repairmen or \n     replacements even before they break down. Local supermarkets \n     could check the contents of customers' refrigerators, \n     compiling a shopping list as they run out of supplies of \n     butter, cheese or milk. Or office workers might check up on \n     the children at home from their desktop computers.\n       But all of these benefits, from better medical care and \n     crime prevention to the more banal delights of the \n     ``intelligent'' home, come with one obvious drawback--an \n     ever-widening trail of electronic data. Because the cost of \n     storing and analysing the data is also plummeting, almost any \n     action will leave a near-permanent record. However \n     ingeniously information-processing technology is used, what \n     seems certain is that threats to traditional notions of \n     privacy will proliferate.\n       This prospect provokes a range of responses, none of them \n     entirely adequate. More laws. Brandeis's article was a plea \n     for a right to sue for damages against intrusions of privacy. \n     It spawned a burst of privacy statutes in America and \n     elsewhere. And yet privacy lawsuits hardly ever succeed, \n     except in France, and even there they are rare. Courts find \n     it almost impossible to pin down a precise enough legal \n     definition of privacy.\n       America's consumer-credit laws, passed in the 1970s, give \n     individuals the right to example their credit records and to \n     demand corrections. The European Union has recently gone a \n     lot further. The EU Data Protection directive, which came \n     into force last October, aims to give people control over \n     their data, requiring ``unambiguous'' consent before a \n     company or agency can process it, and barring the use of the \n     data for any purpose other than that for which it was \n     originally collected. Each EU country, is pledged to appoint \n     a privacy commissioner to act on behalf of citizens whose \n     rights have been violated. The directive also bars the export \n     of data to countries that do not have comparably stringent \n     protections.\n       Most EU countries have yet to pass the domestic laws needs \n     to implement the directive, so it is difficult to say how it \n     will work in practice. But the Americans view it as \n     Draconian, and a trade row has blown up about the EU's \n     threat to stop data exports to the United States. A \n     compromise may be reached that enables American firms to \n     follow voluntary guidelines; but that merely could create \n     a big loophole. If, on the other hand, the EU insist on \n     barring data exports, not only might a trade war be \n     started but also the development of electronic commerce in \n     Europe could come screeching to a complete halt, \n     inflicting a huge cost on the EU's economy.\n       In any case, it is far from clear what effect the new law \n     will have even in Europe. More products or services may have \n     to be offered with the kind of legalistic bumf that is now \n     attached to computer software. But, as with software, most \n     consumers are likely to sign without reading it. The new law \n     may give individuals a valuable tool to fight against some of \n     the worst abuses, rather on the pattern of consumer-credit \n     laws. But, also as with those laws--and indeed, with \n     government freedom of information laws in general--\n     individuals will have to be determined and persistent to \n     exercise their rights. Corporate and government officials can \n     often find ways to delay or evade individual requests for \n     information. Policing the rising tide of data collection and \n     trading is probably beyond the capability of any government \n     without a crackdown so massive that it could stop the new \n     information economy in its tracks.\n       Market solutions. The Americans generally prefer to rely on \n     self-regulation and market pressures. Yet so far, self-\n     regulation has failed abysmally. A Federal Trade Commission \n     survey of 1,400 American Internet sites last year found that \n     only 2% had posted a privacy policy in line with that \n     advocated by the commission, although more have probably done \n     so since, not least in response to increased concern over \n     privacy. Studies of members of America's Direct Marketing \n     Association by independence researchers have found that more \n     than half did not abide even by the association's modest \n     guidelines.\n       If consumers were to become more alarmed about privacy, \n     however, market solutions could offer some protection. The \n     Internet, the frontline of the privacy battle-field, has \n     already spawned anonymous remailers, firms that forward e-\n     mail stripped of any identifying information. One website \n     (www.anonymizer.com) offers anonymous Internet browsing. \n     Electronic digital cash, for use or off the Internet, may \n     eventually provide some anonymity but, like today's physical \n     cash, it will probably be used only for smaller purchases.\n\n[[Page S14538]]\n\n     Enter the infomediary\n       John Hagel and Marc Singer of McKinsey, a management \n     consulting firm, believe that from such services will emerge \n     ``informediaries'', firms that become brokers of information \n     between consumers and other companies, giving consumers \n     privacy protection and also earning them some revenue for the \n     information they are willing to release about themselves. If \n     consumers were willing to pay for such brokerage, \n     infomediaries might succeed on the Internet. Such firms would \n     have the strongest possible stake in maintaining their \n     reputation for privacy protection. But it is hard to imagine \n     them thriving unless consumers are willing to funnel every \n     transaction they make through a single infomediary. Even if \n     this is possible--which is unclear--many consumers may not \n     want to rely so much on a single firm. Most, for example, \n     already have more than one credit card.\n       In the meantime, many companies already declare that they \n     will not sell information they collect about customers. But \n     many others find it possible profitable not to make--to--or \n     keep--this pledge. Consumers who want privacy must be ever \n     vigilant, which is more than most can manage. Even those \n     companies which advertise that they will not sell information \n     do not promise not to buy it. They almost certainly know more \n     about their customers than their customers realize. And in \n     any case, market solutions, including informediaries, are \n     unlikely to be able to deal with growing government databases \n     or increased surveillance in public areas.\n       Technology. The Internet has spawned a fierce war between \n     fans of encryption and governments, especially America's, \n     which argue that they must have access to the keys to \n     software codes used on the web in the interests of the law \n     enforcement. This quarrel has been rumbling on for years. But \n     given the easy availability of increasingly complex codes, \n     governments may just have to accept defeat, which would \n     provide more privacy not just for innocent web users, but for \n     criminals as well. Yet even encryption will only serve to \n     restore to Internet users the level of privacy that most \n     people have assumed they now enjoy in traditional (i.e., \n     paper) mail.\n       Away from the web, the technological race between snoopers \n     and anti-snoopers will also undoubtedly continue. But \n     technology can only ever be a partial answer. Privacy will be \n     reduced not only by government or private snooping, but by \n     the constant recording of all sorts of information that \n     individuals must provide to receive products or benefits--\n     which is as true on as off the Internet.\n       Transparency. Despairing of efforts to protect privacy in \n     the face of the approaching technological deluge, David Brin, \n     an American physicist and science-fiction writer, proposes a \n     radical alternative--its complete abolition. In his book \n     ``The Transparent Society'' (Addision-Wesley, $25) he argues \n     that in future the rich and powerful--and most ominously of \n     all, governments--will derive the greatest benefit from \n     privacy protection, rather than ordinary people. Instead, \n     says Mr. Brin, a clear, simple rule should be adopted: \n     everyone should have access to all information. Every citizen \n     should be able to tap into any database, corporate or \n     governmental, containing personal information. Images from \n     the video-surveillance cameras on city streets should be \n     accessible to everyone, not just the police.\n       The idea sounds disconcerting, he admits. But he argues \n     that privacy is doomed in any case. Transparency would enable \n     people to know who knows what about them, and for the ruled \n     to keep any eye on their rulers. Video cameras would record \n     not only criminals, but also abusive policemen. Corporate \n     chiefs would know that information about themselves is as \n     freely available as it is about their customers or workers. \n     Simple deterrence would then encourage restraint in \n     information gathering--and maybe even more courtesy.\n       Yet Mr. Brin does not explain what would happen to \n     transparency violators or whether there would be any limits. \n     What about national-security data or trade secrets? Police or \n     medical files? Criminals might find these of great interest. \n     What is more, transparency would be just as difficult to \n     enforce legally as privacy protection is now. Indeed, the \n     very idea of making privacy into a crime seems outlandish.\n       There is unlikely to be a single answer to the dilemma \n     posed by the conflict between privacy and the growing power \n     of information technology. But unless society collectively \n     turns away from the benefits that technology can offer--\n     surely the most unlikely outcome of all--privacy debates are \n     likely to become very more intense. In the brave new world of \n     the information age, the right to be left alone is certain to \n     come under siege as never before.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Nosy Parker Lives\n\n                      [William Safire, Washington]\n\n       A state sells its driver's license records to a stalker; he \n     selects his victim--a Hollywood starlet--from the photos and \n     murders her.\n       A telephone company sells a list of calls; an extortionist \n     analyzes the pattern of calls and blackmails the owner of the \n     phone.\n       A hospital transfers patient records to an insurance \n     affiliate, which turns down a policy renewal.\n       A bank sells a financial disclosure statement to a \n     borrower's employer, who fires the employee for profligacy.\n       An Internet browser sells the records of a nettie's \n     searches to a lawyer's private investigator, who uses \n     ``cookie''-generated evidence against the nettie in a \n     lawsuit.\n       Such invasions of privacy are no longer far-out \n     possibilities. The first listed above, the murder of Rebecca \n     Schaeffer, led to the Driver's Privacy Protection Act. That \n     Federal law enables motorists to ``opt out''--to direct that \n     information about them not be sold for commercial purposes.\n       But even that opt out puts the burden of protection on the \n     potential victim, and most people are too busy or lazy to \n     initiate self-protection. Far more effective would be what \n     privacy advocates call opt in--requiring the state or \n     business to request permission of individual customers before \n     selling their names to practioners of ``target marketing.''\n       In practical terms, the difference between opt in and opt \n     out is the difference between a door locked with a bolt and a \n     door left ajar. But in a divided appeals court--under the \n     strained rubric of commercial free speech--the intrusive \n     telecommunications giant US West won. Its private customers \n     and the public are the losers.\n       Corporate mergers and technologies of E-commerce and \n     electronic surveillance are pulverizing the walls of personal \n     privacy. Belatedly, Americans are awakening to their new \n     nakedness as targets of marketers.\n       Your bank account, you health record, your genetic code, \n     your personal and shopping habits and sexual interests are \n     your own business. That information has a value. If anybody \n     wants to pay for an intimate look inside your life, let them \n     make you an offer and you'll think about it. That's opt in. \n     You may decide to trade the desired information about \n     yourself for services like an E-mail box or stock quotes or \n     other inducement. But require them to ask you first.\n       We are dealing here with a political sleeper issue. People \n     are getting wise to being secretly examined and manipulated \n     and it rubs them the wrong way.\n       Politicians sense that a strange dissonance is agitating \n     their constituents. But most are leery of the issue because \n     it cuts across ideologies and party lines--not just encrypted \n     communication versus national security, but personal liberty \n     versus the free market.\n       That's why there has been such Sturm und Drang around the \n     Financial Services Act of 1999. Most pols think it is bogged \n     down only because of a turf war between the Treasury and the \n     Fed over who regulates the new bank-broker-insurance mergers. \n     It goes deeper.\n       The House passed a bill 343 to 86 to make ``pretext \n     calling'' by snoops pretending to be the customer a Federal \n     crime, plus an ``opt out'' that puts the burden on bank \n     customers to tell their banks not to disclose account \n     information to marketers. The bank lobby went along with \n     this.\n       The Senate passed a version without privacy protection \n     because Banking Chairman Phil Gramm said so. But in Senate-\n     House conference, Republican Richard Shelby of Alabama (who \n     already toughened drivers' protection at the behest of \n     Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum and the A.C.L.U.) is pressing \n     for the House version. `` `Opt out' is weak,'' Shelby tells \n     me, ``but it's a start.''\n       The groundswelling resentment is in search of a public \n     champion. The start will gain momentum when some Presidential \n     candidate seizes the sleeper issue of the too-targeted \n     consumer. Laws need not always be the answer: to avert \n     regulation, smart businesses will complete to assure \n     customers' right to decide.\n       The libertarian principle is plain: excepting legitimate \n     needs of law enforcement and public interest, control of \n     information about an individual must rest with the person \n     himself. When the required permission is asked, he or she can \n     sell it or trade it--or tell the bank, the search engine and \n     the Motor Vehicle Bureau to keep their mouths shut.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Privately Held Concerns\n\n                  [Oct. 22, 1999--Wall Street Journal]\n\n       Congress has been paddling 20 years to get a financial-\n     service overhaul bill, and now the canoe threatens to run \n     aground on one of those imaginary concerns that only sounds \n     good in press release--``consumer privacy.'' In the column \n     alongside, Paul Gigot describes the hardball politics behind \n     the financial reform bill's other sticking point--the \n     Community Reinvestment Act. Our subject here is Senator \n     Richard Shelby's strange idea of what, precisely, should \n     constitute ``consumer privacy'' in the new world. ``It's our \n     responsibility to identify what is out of bounds,' '' \n     declared the identity confused Republican as he surfaced this \n     phantom last spring.\n       Privacy concerns are a proper discussion point for the \n     information age, but financial reform would actually end to \n     alleviate some of them. If a single company were allowed to \n     sell insurance, portfolio advice and checking accounts, there \n     would be less incentive to peddle information to third \n     parties. Legislative reform and mergers in the financial \n     industry were all supposed to be aimed at the same goal, \n     using information efficiently within a single company to \n     serve customers. Yet to Mr. Shelby, this is a predatorial \n     act.\n       He's demanding language that would mean a Citigroup banker, \n     say, couldn't tell a Citigroup insurance agent that Mr. Jones \n     is a hot insurance prospect--unless Mr. Jones gives his \n     permission in writing first. Mr. Shelby threatens to withhold \n     his crucial\n\n[[Page S14539]]\n\n     vote unless this deal-breaker is written into the law.\n       To inflict this inconvenience on Mr. Jones is weird enough: \n     He has already volunteered to have a relationship with \n     Citigroup. But even weirder is the urge to cripple a law \n     whose whole purpose is to modernize an industry structure \n     that forces consumers today to chase six different companies \n     around to get a full mix of financial services. In essence, \n     financial products all do the same thing: shift income in \n     time. You want to go to college now based on your future \n     earnings, so you take out a loan. You want to retire in 20 \n     years based on your present earnings, so you get an IRA. And \n     if a single cry goes up from modern man, it's ``Simplify my \n     life.''\n       A vote last Friday seemed, to put Mr. Shelby's peeve to \n     rest. Under the current language, consumers would have an \n     ``opt out'' if they don't want their information shared. But \n     Mr. Shelby won't let go, and joining his chorus are Ralph \n     Nader on the left, Phyllis Schlafly on the right and various \n     gnats buzzing around the interest-group honeypot.\n       He claims to be responding to constituent complaints about \n     telemarketing, not to mention a poll showing that 90% of \n     consumers respond favorably to the word ``privacy.'' Well, \n     duh. Consumers don't want their information made available \n     indiscriminately to strangers. But putting up barriers to \n     free exchange inside a company that a customer already has \n     chosen to do business with is a farfetched application of a \n     sensible idea.\n       Mr. Shelby was a key supporter of language that would push \n     banks to set up their insurance and securities operations as \n     affiliates under a holding company. Now he wants to stop \n     these affiliates from talking to each other. Maybe he's just \n     confused, but it sounds more like a favor to Alabama bankers \n     and insurance agents who want to make life a lot harder for \n     their New York competitors trying to open up local markets.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Growing Compatibility Issue: Computers and User Privacy\n\n            [By John Markoff, New York Times, March 3, 1999]\n\n       San Francisco, March 2--The Intel Corporation recently \n     blinked in a confrontation with privacy advocates protesting \n     the company's plans to ship its newest generation of \n     microprocessors with an embedded serial number that could be \n     used to identify a computer--and by extension its user.\n       But those on each side of the dispute acknowledge that it \n     was only an initial skirmish in a wider struggle. From \n     computers to cellular phones to digital video players, \n     everyday devices and software programs increasingly embed \n     telltale identifying numbers that let them interact.\n       Whether such digital fingerprints constitute an imminent \n     privacy threat or are simply part of the foundation of \n     advanced computer systems and networks is the subject of a \n     growing debate between the computer industry and privacy \n     groups. At its heart is a fundamental disagreement over the \n     role of electronic anonymity in a democratic society.\n       Privacy groups argue fiercely that the merger of computers \n     and the Internet has brought the specter of a new \n     surveillance society in which it will be difficult to find \n     any device that cannot be traced to the user when it is used. \n     But a growing alliance of computer industry executives, \n     engineers, law enforcement officials and scholars contend \n     that absolute anonymity is not only increasingly difficult to \n     obtain technically, but is also a potential threat to \n     democratic order because of the possibility of electronic \n     crime and terrorism.\n       ``You already have zero privacy--get over it,'' Scott \n     McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems, \n     said at a recent news conference held to introduce the \n     company's newest software, known as Jini, intended to \n     interconnect virtually all types of electronic devices from \n     computer to cameras. Privacy advocates contend that software \n     like Jini, which assigns an identification number to each \n     device each time it connects to a network, could be misused \n     as networks envelop almost everyone in society in a dense web \n     of devices that see, hear, and monitor behavior and location.\n       ``Once information becomes available for one purpose there \n     is always pressure from other organizations to use it for \n     their purposes,'' said, Lauren Weinstein, editor of Privacy \n     Forum, an on-line journal.\n       This week, a programmer in Massachusetts found that \n     identifying numbers can easily be found in word processing \n     and spreadsheet files created with Microsoft's popular Word \n     and Excel programs and in the Windows 95 and 98 operating \n     systems.\n       Moreover, unlike the Intel serial number, which the \n     computer user can conceal, the numbers used by the Microsoft \n     programs--found in millions of personal computers--cannot be \n     controlled by the user.\n       The programmer, Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap \n     Software, a developer of computer programming tools in \n     Cambridge, Mass., noticed that the Windows operating system \n     contains a unique registration number stored on each personal \n     computer in a small data base known as the Windows registry.\n       His curiosity aroused, Mr. Smith investigated further and \n     found that the number that uniquely identifies his computer \n     to the network used in most office computing systems, known \n     as the Ethernet, was routinely copied to, each Microsoft Word \n     or Excel document he created.\n       The number is used to create a longer number, known as a \n     globally unique identifier. It is there, he said, to enable \n     computer users to create sophisticated documents comprising \n     work processing, spreadsheet, presentation and data base \n     information.\n       Each of those components in a document needs a separate \n     identity, and computer designers have found the Ethernet \n     number a convenient and widely available identifier, he said. \n     But such universal identifiers are of particular concern to \n     privacy advocated because they could be used to compile \n     information on individuals from many data bases.\n       ``The infrastructure relies a lot on serial numbers,'' Mr. \n     Smith said. ``We've let the genie out of the bottle.''\n       Jeff Ressler, a Microsoft product manager, said that if a \n     computer did not have an Ethernet adapter then another \n     identifying number was generated that was likely to be \n     unique. ``We need a big number, which is a unique \n     identifier,'' he said. ``If we didn't have, it would be \n     impossible to make our software programs work together across \n     networks.''\n       Indeed, an increasing range of technologies have provisions \n     for identifying their users for either technical reasons \n     (such as connecting to a network) or commercial ones (such as \n     determining which ads to show to Web surfers). But engineers \n     and network designers argue that identify information is a \n     vital aspect of modern security design because it is \n     necessary to authenticate an individual in a network, thereby \n     preventing fraud or intrusion.\n       Last month at the introduction of Intel's powerful Pentium \n     III chip, Intel executives showed more than a dozen data \n     security uses for the serial number contained electronically \n     in each of the chips, ranging from limiting access to \n     protecting documents or software against piracy.\n       Intel, the largest chip maker, had recently backed down \n     somewhat after it was challenged by privacy advocates over \n     the identity feature, agreeing that at least some processors \n     for the consumer market would be made in a way that requires \n     the user to activate the feature.\n       Far from scaling back its vision, however, Intel said it \n     was planning an even wider range of features in its chips to \n     help companies protect copyrighted materials. It also pointed \n     to software applications that would use the embedded number \n     to identify participants in electronic chat rooms on the \n     Internet and thereby, for example, protect children from \n     Internet stalkers.\n       But in achieving those goals, it would also create a \n     universal identifier, which could be used by software \n     applications to track computer users wherever they surfed on \n     the World Wide Web. And that, despite the chip maker's \n     assertions that it is working to enhance security and \n     privacy, has led some privacy advocates to taunt Intel and \n     accused it of a ``Big Brother Inside'' strategy.\n       They contend that by uniquely identifying each computer it \n     will make it possible for marketers or Government and law \n     enforcement officials to track the activities of anyone \n     connected to a computer network more closely. They also say \n     that such a permanent identifier could be used in a similar \n     fashion to the data, known as ``cookies,'' that are placed on \n     a computer's hard drive by Web site to track the comings and \n     goings of Internet users.\n\n\n                    putting privacy on the defensive\n\n       Intel's decision to forge ahead with identity features in \n     its chip technology may signal a turning point in the battle \n     over privacy in the electronic age. Until now, privacy \n     concerns have generally put industry's executives on the \n     defensive. Now questions are being raised about whether there \n     should be limits to privacy in an Inernet era.\n       ``Judge Brandeis's definition of privacy was `the right to \n     be left alone,' not the right to operate in absolute \n     secrecy,'' said Paul Saffo, a researcher at the Institute for \n     the Future in Menlo Park, Calif.\n       Some Silicon Valley engineers and executives say that the \n     Intel critics are being naive and have failed to understand \n     that all devices connected to computer networks require \n     identification features simply to function correctly.\n       Moreover, they note that identifying numbers have for more \n     than two decades been a requirement for any computer \n     connected to an Ethernet network. (Although still found most \n     widely in office settings, Ethernet connections are \n     increasingly being used for high-speed Internet Service in \n     the home via digital telephone lines and cable modems.)\n       All of Apple Computer's popular iMac machines come with an \n     Ethernet connection that has a unique permanent number \n     installed in the factory. The number is used to identify the \n     computer to the local network.\n       While the Ethernet number is not broadcast over the \n     Internet at large, it could easily be discovered by a \n     software application like a Web browser and transmitted to a \n     remote Web site tracking the identities of its users, a \n     number of computer engineers said.\n       Moreover, they say that other kinds of networks require \n     identify numbers to protect against fraud. Each cellular \n     telephone currently has two numbers: the telephone number, \n     which can easily be changed, and an electronic serial number, \n     which is permanently put in place at the factory to protect \n     against theft or fraud.\n       The serial number is accessible to the cellular telephone \n     network, and as cellular telephones add Internet browsing and \n     E-mail capabilities, it will potentially have the same\n\n[[Page S14540]]\n\n     identity capability as the Intel processor serial number.\n       Other examples include DIVX DVD disks, which come with a \n     serial number that permits tracking the use of each movie by \n     a centralized network-recording system managed by the \n     companies that sell the disks.\n\n\n                fearing the misuse of all those numbers\n\n       Industry executives say that as the line between \n     communications and computing becomes increasingly blurred, \n     every electronic device will require some kind of \n     identification to attach to the network\n       Making those numbers available to networks that need to \n     pass information or to find a mobile user while at the same \n     time denying the information to those who wish to gather \n     information into vast data bases may be an impossible task.\n       Privacy advocates argue that even if isolated numbers look \n     harmless, they are actually harbingers of a trend toward ever \n     more invasive surveillance networks.\n       ``Whatever we can do to actually minimize the collection of \n     personal data is good,' said March Rotenberg, director of the \n     Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of three groups \n     trying to organize a boycott of Intel's chips.\n       The groups are concerned that the Government will require \n     ever more invasive hardware modifications to keep track of \n     individuals. Already they point to the 1994 Communications \n     Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires that \n     telephone companies modify their network switches to make it \n     easier for Government wiretappers.\n       Also, the Federal Communications Commission is developing \n     regulations that will require every cellular telephone to be \n     able to report its precise location for ``911'' emergency \n     calls. Privacy groups are worried that this feature will be \n     used as a tracking technology by law enforcement officials.\n       ``The ultimate danger is that the Government will mandate \n     that each chip have special logic added'' to track identifies \n     in cyberspace, said Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist at San \n     Diego State University. ``We're on a slide in that \n     direction.''\n       Mr. Vinge is the author of ``True Names'' (Tor Books, \n     1984), a widely cited science fiction novel in the early \n     1980's, that forecast a world in which anonymity in computer \n     networks is illegal.\n       Intel executives insist that their chip is being \n     misconstrued by privacy groups.\n       ``We're going to start building security architecture into \n     our chips, and this is the first step,'' said Pat Gelsinger, \n     Intel vice president and general manager of desktop products. \n     ``The discouraging part of this is our objective is to \n     accomplish privacy.\n       That quandry--that it is almost impossible to \n     compartmentalize information for one purpose so that it \n     cannot be misused--lies at the heart of the argument. \n     Moreover providing security while at the same time offering \n     anonymity has long been a technical and a political \n     challenge.\n       ``We need to find ways to distinguish between security and \n     identity,'' said James X. Dempsey, a privacy expert at the \n     Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington lobbying \n     organization.\n       So far the prospects are not encouraging. One technical \n     solution developed by a cryptographer, David Chaum, made it \n     possible for individuals to make electronic cash payments \n     anonymously in a network.\n       In the system Mr. Chaum designed, a user employs a \n     different number with each organization, thereby insuring \n     that there is no universal tracking capability.\n       But while Mr. Chaum's solution has been widely considered \n     ingenious, it has failed in the marketplace. Last year, his \n     company, Digicash Inc. based in Palo Alto, Calif., filed for \n     bankruptcy protection.\n       ``Privacy never seems to sell,'' said Bruce Schneier, a \n     cryptographer and a computer industry consultant. ``Those who \n     are interested in privacy don't want to pay for it.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Privacy Isn't Dead Yet\n\n                          [By Amitai Etzioni]\n\n       It seems self-evident that information about your shoe size \n     does not need to be as well guarded as information about \n     tests ordered by your doctor. But with the Federal and state \n     governments' piecemeal approach to privacy protection, if we \n     release information about one facet of our lives, we \n     inadvertently expose much about the others.\n       During Senate hearings in 1987 about Robert Bork's fitness \n     to serve as a Supreme Court justice, a reporter found out \n     which videotapes Mr. Bork rented. The response was the \n     enactment of the Video Privacy Protection Act. Another law \n     prohibits the Social Security Administration (but hardly \n     anybody else) from releasing our Social Security numbers. \n     Still other laws limit what states can do with information \n     that we provide to motor vehicle departments.\n       Congress is now seeking to add some more panels to this \n     crazy quilt of narrowly drawn privacy laws. The House \n     recently endorsed a bill to prohibit banks and securities and \n     insurance companies owned by the same parent corporation from \n     sharing personal medical information. And Congress is \n     grappling with laws to prevent some information about our \n     mutual-fund holdings from being sold and bought as freely as \n     hot dogs.\n       But with superpowerful computers and vast databases in the \n     private sector, personal information can't be segmented in \n     this manner. For example, in 1996, a man in Los Angeles got \n     himself a store card, which gave him discounts and allowed \n     the store to trace what he purchased. After injuring his knee \n     in the store, he sued for damages. He was then told that if \n     he proceeded with his suit the store would use the fact that \n     he bought a lot of liquor to show that he must have fallen \n     because he was a drunkard.\n       Some health insurers try to ``cherry pick'' their clients, \n     seeking to cover only those who are least likely to have \n     genetic problems or contract costly diseases like AIDS. Some \n     laws prohibit insurers from asking people directly about \n     their sexual orientation. But companies sometimes refuse to \n     insure those whose vocation (designer?), place of residence \n     (Greenwich Village?) and marital status (single at 40-plus?) \n     suggest that they might pose high risks.\n       Especially comprehensive privacy invaders are ``cookies''--\n     surveillance files that many marketers implant in the \n     personal computers of people who visit their Web sites to \n     allow the marketers to track users' preferences and \n     transactions. Cookies, we are assured, merely inform \n     marketers about our wishes so that advertising can be better \n     directed, sparing us from a flood of junk mail.\n       Actually, by tracing the steps we take once we gain a new \n     piece of information, cookies reveal not only what we buy (a \n     thong from Victoria's Secret? Antidepressants?) but also how \n     we think. Nineteen eighty-four is here courtesy of Intel, \n     Microsoft and quite a few other corporations.\n       All this has led Scott McNealy, the chairman and chief \n     executive of Sun Microsystems, to state, ``You already have \n     zero privacy--get over it.'' This pronouncement of the death \n     of privacy is premature, but we will be able to keep it alive \n     only if we introduce general, all-encompassing protections \n     over segmented ones.\n       Some cyberspace anonymity can be provided by new \n     technologies like anti-cookie programs and encryption \n     software that allow us to encrypt all of our data. Corporate \n     self-regulation can also help. I.B.M., for example, said last \n     week that it would pull its advertising from Web sites that \n     don't have clear privacy policies. Other companies like \n     Disney and Kellogg have voluntarily agreed not to collect \n     information about children 12 or younger without the consent \n     of their parents. And some new Government regulation of \n     Internet commerce may soon be required, if only because the \n     European Union is insisting that any personal information \n     about the citizens of its member countries cannot be used \n     without the citizen's consent.\n       Especially sensitive information should get extra \n     protection. But such selective security can work only if all \n     the other information about a person is not freely accessible \n     elsewhere.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  A Middle Ground in the Privacy War?\n\n                   [By John Schwartz--March 29, 1999]\n\n       Jim Hightower, the former agriculture commissioner of \n     Texas, is fond of saying that ``there's nothing in the middle \n     of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.''\n       It's punchy, and has become a rallying cry of sorts for \n     activists on all sides. But is it right? Amitai Etzioni, a \n     professor at George Washington University, thinks not. He \n     thinks he has found a workable middle ground between the \n     combatants in one of the fiercest fights in our high-tech \n     society: the right of privacy.\n       Etzioni has carved out a place for himself over the decades \n     as a leader in the ``communitarian'' movement. \n     Communitarianism works toward a civil society that transcends \n     both government regulation and commercial intrusion--a \n     society where the golden rule is as important as the rule of \n     law, and the notion that ``he who has the gold makes the \n     rules'' does not apply.\n       What does all that have to do with privacy? Etzioni has \n     written a new book, ``The Limits of Privacy,'' that applies \n     communitarian principles to this thorny issue.\n       For the most part, the debate over privacy is carried out \n     from two sides separated by a huge ideological gap--a gap so \n     vast that they seem to feel a need to shout just to get their \n     voices to carry across it. So Etzioni comes in with a theme \n     not often heard, that middle of the road that Hightower hates \n     so much.\n       What he wants to do is to forge a new privacy doctrine that \n     protects the individual from snooping corporations and \n     irresponsible government, but cedes individual privacy rights \n     when public health and safety are at stake--``a balance \n     between rights and the common good,'' he writes.\n       In the book, Etzioni tours a number of major privacy \n     issues, passing judgment as he goes along. Pro-privacy \n     decisions that prohibited mandatory testing infants for HIV, \n     for example, take the concept too far and put children at \n     risk, he says. Privacy advocates' campaigns against the \n     government's attempts to wiretap and unscramble encrypted \n     messages, he says, are misguided in the face of the evil that \n     walks the planet.\n       The prospect of some kind of national ID system, which many \n     privacy advocates view as anathema, he finds useful for \n     catching criminals, reducing fraud and ending the crime of \n     identity theft. The broad distribution of our medical records \n     for commercial gain, however, takes too much away from us for \n     little benefit to society.\n       I called Etzioni to ask about his book. He said civil \n     libertarians talk about the threat of government intrusion \n     into our lives, and government talks about the threat of \n     criminals, but that the more he got into his research, the \n     more it seemed that the two\n\n[[Page S14541]]\n\n     sides were missing ``the number one enemy--it's a small group \n     of corporations that have more information about us than the \n     East German police ever had about the Germans.''\n       He's horrified, for example, by recent news that both \n     Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. have included identifier \n     codes in their products that could be used to track people's \n     online habits: ``They not only track what we are doing,'' he \n     says. ``They track what we think.''\n       His rethinking of privacy leads him to reject the notions \n     that led to a constitutional right of privacy, best expressed \n     in the landmark 1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut.\n       In that case, Justice William O. Douglas found a right of \n     privacy in the ``penumbra,'' or shadow border, of rights \n     granted by other constitutional amendments--such as freedom \n     of speech, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, \n     freedom from having troops billeted in our homes.\n       Etzioni scoffs at this ``stretched interpretation of a \n     curious amalgam of sundry pieces of various constitutional \n     rights,'' and says we need only look to the simpler balancing \n     act we've developed in Fourth Amendment cases governing \n     search and seizure, which give us privacy protection by \n     requiring proper warrants before government can tape a phone \n     or search a home.\n       ``We cannot say that we will not allow the FBI under any \n     conditions, because of a cyberpunk dream of a world without \n     government, to read any message.'' He finds such a view ``so \n     ideological, so extreme, that somebody has to talk for a \n     sense of balance.''\n       I was surprised to see, in the acknowledgements in his \n     book, warm thanks to Marc Rotenberg, who heads the Electronic \n     Privacy Information Center. Rotenberg is about as staunch a \n     privacy advocate as I know, and I can't imagine him finding \n     much common ground with Etzioni--but Etzioni told me that \n     ``Marc is among all the people in this area the most \n     reasonable. One can talk to him.''\n       So I called Rotenberg, too. He said he deeply respects \n     Etzioni, but can't find much in the book to agree with. For \n     all the talk of balance, he say, ``we have invariably found \n     that when the rights of the individual are balanced against \n     the claims of the community, that the individual loses out.''\n       We're in the midst of a ``privacy crisis'' in which ``we \n     have been unable to come up with solutions to the privacy \n     challenges that new business practices and new technologies \n     are creating,'' Rotenberg told me.\n       The way to reach answers, he suggested, is not to seek \n     middle ground but to draw the lines more clearly, the way \n     judges do in deciding cases. When a criminal defendant \n     challenges a policeman's pat-down search in court, Rotenberg \n     explained, ``the guy with the small plastic bag of cocaine \n     either gets to walk or he doesn't. . . . Making those lines \n     fuzzier doesn't really take you any closer to finding \n     answers.''\n       As you can see, this is one argument that isn't settled. \n     But I'm glad that Etzioni has joined the conversation--both \n     for the trademark civility he brings to it, and for the \n     dialogue he will spark.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Privacy \nProtection Study Commission Act of 1999 with my colleague, Senator \nKohl. This legislation creates a Commission to comprehensively examine \nprivacy concerns. This Commission will provide Congress with \ninformation to facilitate our decision making regarding how to best \naddress individual privacy protections.\n  The rise in the use of information technology--particularly the \nInternet, has led to concerns regarding the security of personal \ninformation. As many as 40 million people around the world have the \nability to access the Internet. The use of computers for personal and \nbusiness transactions has resulted in the availability of vast amounts \nof financial, medical and other information in the public domain. \nInformation about online users is also collected by Web sites through \ntechnology which tracks an individual's every interaction with the \nInternet.\n  Despite the ease of availability of personal information, the United \nStates is one of the few countries in the world that does not have \ncomprehensive legal protection for personal information. This is in \npart due to differences in opinion regarding the best way to address \nthe problem. While some argue that the Internet's size and constantly \nchanging technology demands government and industry self-regulation, \nothers advocate for strong legislative and regulatory protections. And, \nstill others note that such protections, although necessary, could lead \nto unconstitutional consequences if drafted without a comprehensive \nunderstanding of the issue. As a result, congressional efforts to \naddress privacy concerns have been patchwork in nature.\n  This is why Senator Kohl and I are proposing the creation of a \nCommission with the purpose of thoughtfully considering the range of \nissues involved in the privacy debate and the implications of self-\nregulation, legislation, and federal regulation. The Commission will be \ncomprised of experts in the fields of law, civil rights, business, and \ngovernment. After 18 months, the Commission will deliver a report to \nCongress recommending the necessary legislative protections are needed. \nThe Commission will have the authority to gather the necessary \ninformation to reach conclusions that are balanced and fair.\n  Americans are genuinely concerned about individual privacy. The \nPrivacy Commission proposed by Senator Kohl and myself will enable \nCongress and the public to evaluate the extent to which we should be \nconcerned and the proper way to address those concerns. The privacy \ndebate is multifaceted and I encourage my colleagues to join Senator \nKohl and myself in our efforts to gain a better understanding of it. \nSenator Kohl and I look forward to working with all those interested in \nfurthering this debate and giving Americans a greater sense of \nconfidence in the security of their personal information.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1902. A bill to require disclosure under the Freedom of \nInformation Act regarding certain persons and records of the Japanese \nImperial Army in a manner that does not impair any investigation or \nprosecution conducted by the Department of Justice or certain \nintelligence matters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             Japanese Imperial Army Disclosure Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Japanese \nImperial Army Disclosure Act of 1999.\n  This legislation will require the disclosure under the Freedom of \nInformation Act classified records and documents in the possession of \nthe U.S. Government regarding chemical and biological experiments \ncarried out by Japan during the course of the Second World War.\n  Let me preface my statement by making clear that none of the remarks \nthat I will make in discussing this legislation should be considered \nanti-Japanese. I was proud to serve as the President of the Japan \nSociety of Northern California, and I have done everything I can to \nfoster, promote, and develop positive relations between Japan, the \nUnited States, China, and other states of the region. The legislation I \nintroduce today is eagerly sought by a large number of Californians who \nbelieve that there is an effort to keep information about possible \natrocities and experiments with poisonous gas and germ warfare from the \npubic record.\n  One of my most important goals in the Senate is to see the \ndevelopment of a Pacific Rim community that is peaceful and stable. I \nhave worked towards this end for over twenty years. I introduce this \nlegislation to try to heal wounds that still remain, particularly in \nCalifornia's Chinese-American community.\n\n  This legislation is needed because although the Second World War \nended over fifty years ago--and with it Japan's chemical and biological \nweapons experimentation programs--many of the records and documents \nregarding Japan's wartime activities remain classified and hidden in \nU.S. Government archives and repositories. Even worse, according to \nsome scholars, some of these records are now being inadvertently \ndestroyed.\n  For the many U.S. Army veteran's who were subject to these \nexperiments in POW camps, as well as the many Chinese and other Asian \ncivilians who were subjected to these experiments, the time has long \nsince passed for the full truth to come out.\n  According to information which was revealed at the International \nMilitary Tribunal for the Far East, starting in 1931, when the so-\ncalled ``Mukden incident'' provided Japan the pretext for the \noccupation of Manchuria, the Japanese Imperial Army conducted numerous \nbiological and chemical warfare tests on Chinese civilians, Allied \nPOWs, and possibly Japanese civilians as well.\n  Perhaps the most notorious of these experiments were carried out \nunder General Ishii Shiro, a Japanese Army surgeon, who, by the late \n1930's had built a large installation in China with germ breeding \nfacilities, testing\n\n[[Page S14542]]\n\ngrounds, prisons to hold the human test subjects, facilities to make \ngerm weapons, and a crematorium for the final disposal of the human \ntest victims. General Ishii's main factory operated under the code name \nUnit 731.\n  Based on the evidence revealed at the War Crimes trials, as well as \nsubsequent work by numerous scholars, there is little doubt that Japan \nconducted these chemical and biological warfare experiments, and that \nthe Japanese Imperial Army attempted to use chemical and biological \nweapons during the course of the war, included reports of use of plague \non the cities of Ningbo and Changde.\n  And, as a 1980 article by John Powell in the Bulletin of Concerned \nAsia Scholars found,\n\n       Once the fact had been established that Ishii had used \n     Chinese and others as laboratory tests subjects, it seemed a \n     fair assumption that he also might have used American \n     prisoners, possibly British, and perhaps even Japanese.\n\n  Some of the records of these activities were revealed during the \nTokyo War Crimes trials, and others have since come to light under \nFreedom of Information Act requests, but many other documents, which \nwere transferred to the U.S. military during the occupation of Japan, \nhave remained hidden for the past fifty years.\n  And it is precisely for this reason that this legislation is needed: \nThe world is entitled to a full and compel record of what did \ntranspire.\n  Sheldon Harris, Professor of History Emeritus at California State \nuniversity Northridge wrote to me on October 7 of this year that:\n\n       In my capacity as an academic Historian, I can testify to \n     the difficulty researchers have in unearthing documents and \n     personal testimony concerning these war crimes * * *. Here in \n     the United States, despite the Freedom of Information Act, \n     some archives remain closed to investigators * * *. Moreover, \n     ``sensitive documents--as defined by archivists and FOIA \n     officers--are at the moment being destroyed.\n\n  Professor Sheldon's letter goes on to discuss three examples of the \ndestruction of documents relating to chemical and biological warfare \nexperiments that he is aware of: At Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah, at \nFort Detrick in Maryland, and at the Pentagon.\n  This legislation establishes, within 60 days after the enactment of \nthe act, the Japanese Imperial Army Records Interagency Working Group, \nincluding representation by the Department of State and the Archivist \nof the United States, to locate, identify, and recommend for \ndeclassification all Japanese Imperial Army records of the United \nStates.\n  This Interagency Work Group, which will remain in existence for three \nyears, is to locate, identify, inventory, recommend for classification, \nand make available to the public all classified Imperial Army records \nof the United States. It is to do so in coordination with other \nagencies, and to submit a report to Congress describing its activities.\n  It is my belief that the establishment of such an Interagency Working \nGroup is the best way to make sure that the documents which need to be \ndeclassified will be declassified, and that this process will occur in \nan orderly and expeditious manner.\n  This legislation also includes exceptions which would allow the \nInteragency Working Group to deny release of records on the basis of: \n1. Records which may unfairly invade an individual's privacy; 2. \nRecords which adversely affect the national security or intelligence \ncapabilities of the United States; 3. Records which might ``seriously \nor demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a \nforeign government''; and, 4. Records which might contribute to the \ndevelopment of chemical or biological capabilities.\n  My purpose in introducing this legislation is to help those who were \nvictimized by these experiments and, with the adage ``the truth shall \nset you free'' in mind, help build a more peaceful Asian-Pacific \ncommunity for the twenty-first century.\n  First, the declassification and release of this material will help \nthe victims of chemical and biological warfare experimentation carried \nout by the Japanese Army during the Second World War, as well as their \nfamilies and descendants, gain information about what occurred to them \nfifty years ago. If old wounds are to heal, there must be a full \naccounting of what happened.\n  Second, and perhaps just as importantly, this legislation is intended \nto create an environment of honest dialogue and discussion in the Asia-\nPacific region, so that the countries and people of the region can move \nbeyond the problems that have plagued us for the past century, and work \ntogether to build a peaceful and prosperous Asian-Pacific community in \nthe next century.\n  If the countries of Asia are to build a peaceful community it is \nnecessary that we deal fully, fairly, and honestly with the past. It is \nonly by doing so that we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the past \nand build a more just world for the future.\n  Indeed, as Rabbi Abraham Cooper has remarked, ``Since the end of \nWorld War II, professed neutral nations like Sweden and Switzerland \nhave had the courage to take a painful look back at their World War II \nrecord; can Japan be allowed to do anything less?''\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 7 letter by \nProfessor Harris and an article outlining some of the scholarly \nresearch on this issue: ``Japan's Biological Weapons: 1930-1945,'' by \nRobert Gromer, John Powell, and Burt Roling be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Granada Hills, CA,\n\n                                                  October 7, 1999.\n     Hon. Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Several Asian American activists \n     organizations in California, and organizations representing \n     former Prisoners of War and Internees of the Japanese \n     Imperial Army, have indicated to me that you are proposing to \n     introduce legislation into the United States Senate that \n     calls for full disclosure by the United States Government of \n     records it possesses concerning war crimes committed by \n     members of the Japanese Imperial Army. I endorse such \n     legislation enthusiastically.\n       My support for the full disclosure of American held records \n     relating to the Japanese Imperial Army's wartime crimes \n     against humanity is both personal and professional. I am \n     aware of the terrible suffering members of the Imperial \n     Japanese Army imposed upon innocent Asians, prisoners of war \n     of various nationalists and civilian internees of Allied \n     nations. These inhumane acts were condoned, if not ordered, \n     by the highest authorities in both the civilian and military \n     branches of the Japanese government. As a consequence, \n     millions of persons were killed, maimed, tortured, or \n     experienced acts of violence that included human experiments \n     relating to biological and chemical warfare research. Many of \n     these actions meet the definition of ``war crimes'' under \n     both the Potsdam Declaration and the various Nuremberg War \n     Crimes trials held in the post-war period.\n       I am the author of ``Factories of Death, Japanese \n     Biological Warfare, 1932-45, and the American Cover-up'' \n     (Routlege: London and New York; hard cover edition 1994; \n     paperback printings, 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999). I discovered in \n     the course of my research for this book, and scholarly \n     articles that I published on the subject of Japanese \n     biological and chemical warfare preparations, that members of \n     the Japanese Imperial Army Medical Corps committed heinous \n     war crimes. These included involuntary laboratory tests of \n     various pathogens on humans--Chinese, Korean, other Asian \n     nationalities, and Allied prisoners of war, including \n     Americans. Barbarous acts encompassed live vivisections, \n     amputations of body parts (frequently without the use of \n     anesthesia), frost bite exposure to temperatures of 40-50 \n     degrees Fahrenheit below zero, injection of horse blood and \n     other animal blood into humans, as well as other horrific \n     experiments. When a test was completed, the human \n     experimented was ``sacrificed'', the euphemism used by \n     Japanese scientists as a substitute term for ``killed.''\n       In my capacity as an academic Historian, I can testify to \n     the difficulty researchers have in unearthing documents and \n     personal testimony concerning these war crimes. I, and other \n     researchers, have been denied access to military archives in \n     Japan. These archives cover activities by the Imperial \n     Japanese Army that occurred more than 50 years ago. The \n     documents in question cannot conceivably contain information \n     that would be considered of importance to ``National \n     Security'' today. The various governments in Japan for the \n     past half century have kept these archives firmly closed. The \n     fear is that the information contained in the archives will \n     embarrass previous governments.\n       Here in the United States, despite the Freedom of \n     Information Act, some archives remain closed to \n     investigators. At best, the archivists in charge, or the \n     Freedom of Information Officer at the archive in question, \n     select what documents they will allow to become public. This \n     is an unconscionable act of arrogance and a betrayal of the \n     trust they have been given by the Congress and the\n\n[[Page S14543]]\n\n     President of the United States. Moreover, ``sensitive'' \n     documents--as defined by archivists and FOIA officers--are at \n     the moment being destroyed. Thus, historians and concerned \n     citizens are being denied factual evidence that can shed some \n     light on the terrible atrocities committed by Japanese \n     militarists in the past.\n       Three examples of this wanton destruction should be \n     sufficiently illustrative of the dangers that exist, and \n     should reinforce the obvious necessity for prompt passage of \n     legislation you propose to introduce into the Congress:\n       1. In 1991, the Librarian at Dugway Proving Grounds, \n     Dugway, Utah, denied me access to the archives at the \n     facility. It was only through the intervention of then U.S. \n     Representative Wayne Owens, Dem., Utah, that I was given \n     permission to visit the facility. I was not shown all the \n     holdings relating to Japanese medical experiments, but the \n     little I was permitted to examine revealed a great deal of \n     information about medical war crimes. Sometimes after my \n     visit, a person with intimate knowledge of Dugway's \n     operations, informed me that ``sensitive'' documents were \n     destroyed there as a direct result of my research in their \n     library.\n       2. I conducted much of my American research at Fort Detrick \n     in Frederick, Md. The Public Information Officer there was \n     extremely helpful to me. Two weeks ago I telephoned Detrick, \n     was informed that the PIO had retired last May. I spoke with \n     the new PIO, who told me that Detrick no longer would discuss \n     past research activities, but would disclose information only \n     on current projects. Later that day I telephoned the retired \n     PIO at his home. He informed me that upon retiring he was \n     told to ``get rid of that stuff'', meaning incriminating \n     documents relating to Japanese medical war crimes. Detrick no \n     longer is a viable research center for historians.\n       3. Within the past 2 weeks, I was informed that the \n     Pentagon, for ``space reasons'', decided to rid itself of all \n     biological warfare documents in its holdings prior to 1949. \n     The date is important, because all war crimes trials against \n     accused Japanese war criminals were terminated by 1949. Thus, \n     current Pentagon materials could not implicate alleged \n     Japanese war criminals. Fortunately, a private research \n     facility in Washington volunteered to retrieve the documents \n     in question. This research facility now holds the documents, \n     is currently cataloguing them (estimated completion time, at \n     least twelve months), and is guarding the documents under \n     ``tight security.''\n       Your proposed legislation must be acted upon promptly. Many \n     of the victims of Japanese war crimes are elderly. Some of \n     the victims pass away daily. Their suffering should receive \n     recognition and some compensation. Moreover, History is being \n     cheated. As documents disappear, the story of war crimes \n     committed in the War In The Pacific becomes increasingly \n     difficult to describe. The end result will be a distorted \n     picture of reality. As an Historian, I cannot accept this \n     inevitability without vigorous protest.\n       Please excuse the length of this letter. However, I do hope \n     that some of the arguments I made in comments above will be \n     of some assistance to you as you press for passage of the \n     proposed legislation. I will be happy to be of any additional \n     assistance to you, should you wish to call upon me for \n     further information or documentation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                            Sheldon H. Harris,\n\n                                    Professor of History emeritus,\n     California State University, Northridge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Oct., 1981]\n\n   Japan's Biological Weapons: 1930-1945--A Hidden Chapter in History\n\n         (By Robert Gomer, John W. Powell and Bert V.A. Roling)\n\n       When this story first reached the Bulletin, our reaction \n     was horrified disbelief. I think all of us hoped that it was \n     not true. Unfortunately, subsequent research shows that it is \n     all too true. In order to verify the facts set forth here we \n     enlisted the help of a number of distinguished scientists and \n     historians, who are hereby thanked. It seems unnecessary to \n     mention them by name; suffice it that the allegations set \n     forth in this article seem to be true and there is a \n     substantial file of documents in the Bulletin offices to back \n     them up.\n       What other comment need one really make? Any reader with a \n     sense of justice and decency will be nauseated, not only by \n     these atrocities, but equally so by the reaction of the U.S. \n     Departments of War and State.\n       The psychological climate engendered by war is horrible. \n     The Japanese tortured and killed helpless prisoners in search \n     of ``a cheap and effective weapon.'' The Americans and \n     British invented firestorms and the U.S. dropped two nuclear \n     bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In such a climate it may \n     have seemed reasonable not to bring the Japanese responsible \n     for the biological ``experiments'' to justice, but it was and \n     remains monstrous.\n       By acquiring ``at a fraction of the original cost'' the \n     ``invaluable'' results of the Japanese experiments, have we \n     not put ourselves on the same level as the Japanese \n     experimenters? Some politicians and generals like to speak of \n     the harsh realities of the world in order to act both \n     bestially and stupidly. The world clearly does contain harsh \n     realities but somehow there is a sort of potential divine \n     justice basic decency generally would have been the \n     smartest course in the long run. Unfortunately there are \n     few instances where it was actually taken.\n       The spirit and psychological climate which made possible \n     the horrors described in this article are not dead; in fact, \n     they seem to be flourishing in the world. The torture \n     chambers are busy in Latin America and elsewhere, and the \n     United States provides economic and military aid to the \n     torturers. The earth-and-people destroying was waged by the \n     United States not long ago in Vietnam, the apparently similar \n     war being waged by the Soviets in Afghanistan, the horrors of \n     the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia, and the contemplation with \n     some equanimity of ``limited'' nuclear war by strategists \n     here and in the Soviet Union display the spirit of General \n     Ishii. If we are to survive as human beings, or more \n     accurately, if we are to become fully human, that spirit must \n     have no place among men.--Robert Gomer (professor of \n     chemistry at the University of Chicago, and member of the \n     Board of Directors of the Bulletin.)\n       Long-secret documents, secured under the U.S. Freedom of \n     Information Act, reveal details of one of the more gruesome \n     chapters of the Pacific War; Japan's use of biological \n     warfare against China and the Soviet Union. For years the \n     Japanese and American governments succeeded in suppressing \n     this story.\n       Japan's desire to hide its attempts at ``public health in \n     reverse'' is understandable. The American government's \n     participation in the cover-up, it is now disclosed, stemmed \n     from Washington's desire to secure exclusive possession of \n     Japan's expertise in using germs as lethal weapons. The \n     United States granted immunity from war crimes prosecution to \n     the Japanese participants, and they in turn handed over their \n     laboratory records to U.S. representatives from Camp Detrick \n     (now Fort Detrick).\n       The record shows that by the late 1930s Japan's biological \n     warfare (BW) program was ready for testing. It was used with \n     moderate success against Chinese troops and civilians and \n     with unknown results against the Russians. By 1945 Japan had \n     a huge stockpile of germs, vectors and delivery equipment \n     unmatched by any other nation.\n       Japan had gained this undisputed lead primarily because its \n     scientists used humans as guinea pigs. It is estimated that \n     at least 3,000 people were killed at the main biological \n     warfare experimental station, code named Unit 731 and located \n     a few miles from Harbin. They either succumbed during the \n     experiments or were executed when they had become physical \n     wrecks and were no longer fit for further germ tests [1, pp. \n     19-21]. There is no estimate of total casualties but it is \n     known that at least two other Japanese biological warfare \n     installations--Unit 100 near Changchun and the Tama \n     Detachment in Nanjing--engaged in similar human \n     experimentation.\n       (End Notes at end of articles)\n       This much of the story has been available for some years. \n     What has not been known until very recently is that among the \n     human guinea pigs were an undetermined number of American \n     soldiers, captured during the early part of the war and \n     confined in prisoner-of-war camps in Manchuria. Official U.S. \n     reports reveal that Washington was aware of these facts when \n     the decision was made to forego prosecution of the Japanese \n     participants. These declassified ``top secret'' documents \n     disclose the details and raise disturbing questions about the \n     role of numerous highly placed American officials at the \n     time.\n       The first public indications that American prisoners of war \n     were among the human victims appeared in the published \n     summary of the Khabarovsk trial. A witness stated that a \n     researcher was sent to the camps where U.S. prisoners were \n     held to ``study the immunity of Anglo-Saxons to infectious \n     diseases'' [1, p. 268]. The summary noted: ``As early as \n     1943, Minata, a researcher belonging to Detachment 731, was \n     sent to prisoner of war camps to test the properties of the \n     blood and immunity to contagious diseases of American \n     soldiers'' [1, p. 415].\n       On June 7, 1947, Colonel Alva C. Carpenter, chief of \n     General Douglas MacArthur's legal staff, in a top secret \n     cable to Washington, expressed doubt about the reliability of \n     early reports of Japanese biological warfare, including an \n     allegation by the Japanese Communist Party that experiments \n     had been performed ``on captured Americans in Mukden and that \n     simultaneously research on similar lines was conducted in \n     Tokyo and Kyoto.'' On June 27, Carpenter again cabled \n     Washington, stating that further information strengthened the \n     charges and ``warrants conclusion'' that the Ishii group had \n     violated the ``rules of land warfare.'' He warned that the \n     Soviets might bring up evidence of Japanese use of biological \n     warfare against China and ``other evidence on this subject \n     which may have resulted from their independent investigation \n     in Manchuria and in Japan.'' He added that ``this expression \n     of opinion'' was not a recommendation that Ishii's group be \n     charged with war crimes.\n       Cecil F. Hubbert, a member of the State, War, Navy \n     Coordinating Committee, in a July 15, 1947 memo, recommended \n     that the story be covered up but warned that it might leak \n     out if the Russian prosecutor brought the subject up during \n     the Tokyo war crimes trials and added that the Soviets might \n     have found out that ``American prisoners of war were used for \n     experimental purposes of a bw nature and that they lost their \n     lives as a result of these experiments.''\n\n[[Page S14544]]\n\n       In his book, The Pacific War Professor Ienaga Saburo added \n     a few new details about Unit 731 and described fatal \n     vivisection experiments at Kyushu Imperial University on \n     downed American fliers [2, pp. 188-90].\n       The biological warfare project began shortly after the \n     Manchurian Incident in 1931, when Japan occupied China's \n     Northeast provinces and when a Japanese Army surgeon, Ishii \n     Shiro, persuaded his superiors that microbes could become an \n     inexpensive weapon potentially capable of producing enormous \n     casualties [1, pp. 105-107; 3]. Ishii, who finally rose to \n     the rank of lieutenant-general, built a large, self-contained \n     installation with sophisticated germ- and insect-breeding \n     facilities, a prison for the human experimentees, testing \n     grounds, an arsenal for makin germ bombs, an airfield, its \n     own special planes and a crematorium for the human victims.\n       When Soviet tanks crossed the Siberian-Manchurian border at \n     midnight on August 8, 1945, Japan was less than a week away \n     from unconditional surrender. In those few days of grace the \n     Japanese destroyed their biological warfare installations in \n     China, killed the remaining human experimentees (``It took 30 \n     hours to lay them in ashes [4]'') and ship out most of their \n     personnel and some of the more valuable equipment to South \n     Korea [1, pp. 43, 125, 130-31]. Reports that some equipment \n     was slipped into Japan are confirmed by American documents \n     which reveal that slides, laboratory records and case \n     histories of experiments over many years were successfully \n     transported to Japan [4].\n       A ``top secret'' cable from Tokyo to Washington on May 6, \n     1947, described some of the information being secured:\n       ``Statements obtained from Japanese here confirm statements \n     of ussr prisoners. . . Experiments on humans were . . . \n     described by three Japanese and confirmed tacitly by Ishii; \n     field trials against Chinese took place . . . scope of \n     program indicated by report . . . that 400 kilograms [880 \n     lbs.] of dried anthrax organisms destroyed in August 1945. . \n     . . Reluctant statements by Ishii indicate he had superiors \n     (possibly general staff) who . . . authorized the program. \n     Ishii states that if guaranteed immunity from ``war crimes'' \n     in documentary form for himself, superiors and subordinates, \n     he can describe program in detail. Ishii claims to have \n     extensive theoretical high-level knowledge including \n     strategic and tactical use of BW on defense and offense, \n     backed by some research on best agents to employ by \n     geographical areas of Far East, and the use of BW in cold \n     climates'' [5, 6].\n       A top secret Tokyo headquarters ``memorandum for the \n     record'' (also dated May 6), gave more details: ``USSR \n     interest in Japanese BW personnel arises from interrogations \n     of two captured Japanese formerly associated with BW. Copies \n     of these interrogations were given to U.S. Preliminary \n     investigation[s] confirm authenticity of USSR interrogations \n     and indicate Japanese activity in:\n       a. Human experiments\n       b. Field trials against Chinese\n       c. Large scale program\n       d. Research on BW by crop destruction\n       e. Possible that Japanese General Staff knew and authorized \n     program\n       f. Thought and research devoted to strategic and tactical \n     use of BW.\n       Data . . . on above topics are of great intelligence value \n     to U.S. Dr. Fell, War Department representative, states that \n     this new evidence was not known by U.S. [6].\n       Certain low echelon Japanese are now working to assemble \n     most of the necessary technical data. . . . Information to \n     the present have [sic] been obtained by persuasion, \n     exploitation of Japanese fear of USSR and Japanese desire to \n     cooperate with U.S. Additional information . . . probably can \n     be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information \n     will be kept in intelligence channels and not employed for \n     `war crimes' evidence.\n       Documentary immunity from ``war crimes'' given to higher \n     echelon personnel involved will result in exploiting twenty \n     years experience of the director, former General Ishii, who \n     can assure complete cooperation of his former subordinates, \n     indicate the connection of the Japanese General Staff and \n     provide the tactical and strategic information'' [7].\n       A report on December 12, 1947, by Dr. Edwin V. Hill, chief, \n     Basic Sciences, Camp Detrick, Maryland, described some of the \n     technical data secured from the Japanese during an official \n     visit to Tokyo by Hill and Dr. Joseph Victor [8]. \n     Acknowledging the ``wholehearted cooperation of Brig. Gen. \n     Charles A. Willoughby,'' MacArthur's intelligence chief, Hill \n     wrote that the objectives were to obtain additional material \n     clarifying reports already submitted by the Japanese, ``to \n     examine human pathological material which had been \n     transferred to Japan from BW installations,'' and ``to obtain \n     protocols necessary for understanding the significance of the \n     pathological material.''\n       Hill and Victor interviewed a number of Japanese experts \n     who were already assembling biological warfare archival \n     material and writing reports for the United States. They \n     checked the results of experiments with various specific \n     human, animal and plant diseases, and investigated Ishii's \n     system for spreading disease via aerosol from planes. Dr. Ota \n     Kiyoshi described his anthrax experiments, including the \n     number of people infected and the number who died Ishii \n     reported on his experiments with botulism and brucellosis. \n     Drs. Hayakawa Kiyoshi and Yamanouchi Yujiro gave Hill and \n     Victor the results of other brucellosis tests, including the \n     number of human casualties.\n       Hill pointed out that the material was a financial bargain, \n     was obtainable nowhere else, and concluded with a plea on \n     behalf of Ishii and his colleagues:\n       ``Specific protocols were obtained from individual \n     investigators. Their descriptions of experiments are detailed \n     in separate reports. These protocols . . . indicate the \n     extent of experimentation with infectious diseases in human \n     and plant species.\n       Evidence gathered . . . has greatly supplemented and \n     amplified previous aspects of this field. It represents data \n     which have been obtained by Japanese scientists at the \n     expenditure of many millions of dollars and years of work. \n     Information has accrued with respect to human susceptibility \n     to those diseases as indicated by specific infectious doses \n     of bacteria. Such information could not be obtained in our \n     own laboratories because of scruples attached to human \n     experimentation. These data were secured with a total outlay \n     of Y [yen] 250,000 to date, a mere pittance by comparison \n     with the actual cost of the studies.\n       Furthermore, the pathological material which has been \n     collected constitutes the only material evidence of the \n     nature of these experiments. It is hoped that individuals who \n     voluntarily contributed this information will be spared \n     embarrassment because of it and that every effort will be \n     taken to prevent this information from falling into other \n     hands.''\n       A memo by Dr. Edward Wetter and Mr. H.I. Stubblefield, \n     dated July 1, 1947, for restricted circulation to military \n     and State Department officials also described the nature and \n     quantity of material which Ishii was beginning to supply, and \n     noted some of the political issues involved [9]. They \n     reported that Ishii and his colleagues were cooperating \n     fully, were preparing voluminous reports, and had agreed to \n     supply photographs of ``selected examples of 8,000 slides \n     of tissues from autopsies of humans and animals subjected \n     to BW experiments.'' Human experiments, they pointed out, \n     were better than animal experiments:\n       ``This Japanese information is the only known source of \n     data from scientifically controlled experiments showing the \n     direct effect of BW agents on man. In the past it has been \n     necessary to evaluate the effects of BW agents on man from \n     data obtained through animal experimentation. Such evaluation \n     is inconclusive and far less complete than results obtained \n     from certain types of human experimentation.''\n       Wetter and Stubblefield also stated that the Soviet Union \n     was believed to be in possession of ``only a small portion of \n     this technical information'' and that since ``any `war \n     crimes' trial would completely reveal such data to all \n     nations, it is felt that such publicity must be avoided in \n     the interests of defense and national security of the U.S.'' \n     They emphasized that the knowledge gained by the Japanese \n     from their human experiments ``will be of great value to the \n     U.S. BW research program'' and added: ``The value to U.S. of \n     Japanese BW data is of such importance to national security \n     as to far outweigh the value accruing from war crimes \n     prosecution.''\n       A July 15 response to the Wetter-Stubblefield memo by Cecil \n     F. Hubbert, a member of the State, War, Navy Coordinating \n     Committee, agreed with its recommendations but warned of \n     potential complications because ``experiments on human beings \n     . . . have been condemned as war crimes by the International \n     Military Tribunal'' in Germany and that the United States \n     ``is at present prosecuting leading German scientists and \n     medical doctors at Nuremberg for offenses which included \n     experiments on human beings which resulted in the suffering \n     and death of most of those experimented upon'' [10].\n       Hubbert raised the possibility that the whole thing might \n     leak out if the Soviets were to bring it up in cross-\n     examining major Japanese war criminals at the Tokyo trial and \n     cautioned:\n       ``It should be kept in mind that there is a remote \n     possibility that independent investigation conducted by the \n     Soviets in the Mukden area may have disclosed evidence that \n     American prisoners-of-war were used for experimental purposes \n     of a BW nature and that they lost their lives as a result of \n     these experiments.''\n       Despite these risks, Hubbert concurred with the Wetter-\n     Stubblefield recommendation that the issue be kept secret and \n     that the Japanese biological warfare personnel be given \n     immunity in return for their cooperation. He suggested some \n     changes for the final position paper, including the following \n     casuistry: ``The data on hand . . . does not appear \n     sufficient at this time to constitute a basis for sustaining \n     a war crimes charge against Ishii and/or his associates.''\n       Hubbert returned to the subject in a memorandum written \n     jointly with E.F. Lyons, Jr., a member of the Plans and \n     Policy Section of the War Crimes Branch. This top secret \n     document stated, in part:\n       ``The Japanese BW group is the only known source of data \n     from scientifically controlled experiments showing direct \n     effects of BW agents on humans. In addition, considerable \n     valuable data can be obtained from this group regarding BW \n     experiments on animals and food crops. . . .\n       Because of the vital importance of the Japanese BW \n     information . . . the Working Group, State-War-Navy \n     Coordinating Sub-\n\n[[Page S14545]]\n\n     committee for the Far East, are in agreement that the \n     Japanese BW group should be informed that this Government \n     would retain in intelligence channels all information given \n     by the group on the subject of BW. This decision was made \n     with full consideration of and in spite of the following:\n       (a) That its practical effect is that this Government will \n     not prosecute any members of the Japanese BW group for War \n     Crimes of a BW nature.\n       (b) That the Soviets may be independent investigation \n     disclose evidence tending to establish or connect Japanese BW \n     activities with a war crime, which evidence the Soviets may \n     attempt to introduce at the International Military Trial now \n     pending at Tokyo.\n       (c) That there is a remote possibility that the evidence \n     which may be disclosed by the Soviets would include evidence \n     that American prisoners of war were used for experimental \n     purposes by the Japanese BW group'' [11].\n       In the intervening years the evidence that captured \n     American soldiers were among the human guinea pigs used by \n     Ishii in his lethal germ experiments remained ``closely \n     held'' in the top echelons of the U.S. government. A \n     ``confidential'' March 13, 1956, Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation internal memorandum, addressed to the \n     ``Director, FBI (105-12804)'' from ``SAC, WFO (105-1532)'' \n     stated in part:\n       ``Mr. James J. Kelleher, Jr., Office of Special Operations, \n     DOD [Department of Defense], has volunteered further comments \n     to the effect that American Military Forces after occupying \n     Japan, determined that the Japanese actually did experiment \n     with ``BW'' agents in Manchuria during 1943-44 using American \n     prisoners as test victims. . . . Kelleher added that . . . \n     information of the type in question is closely controlled and \n     regarded as highly sensitive.''\n       It is perhaps not surprising that it has taken so long for \n     the full story to be revealed. Over the years fragments have \n     occasionally leaked out, but each time were met with \n     denials, initially by the Japanese and later by the United \n     States. During the Korean War when China accused the \n     United States of employing updated versions of Japan's \n     earlier biological warfare tactics, not only were the \n     charges denied, but it was also claimed that there was no \n     proof of the earlier Japanese actions.\n       At the time of the Khabarovsk trial, the United States was \n     pressing the Soviet Union to return thousands of Japanese \n     prisoners held in Siberian labor camps since the end of World \n     War II. When news of the trial reached Tokyo, it was \n     dismissed as ``propaganda.'' William J. Sebald, MacArthur's \n     diplomatic chief, was quoted in a United Press story in the \n     Nippon Times on December 29, 1949, as saying the story of the \n     trial might just be fiction and that it obviously was a \n     ``smoke screen'' to obscure the fact that the Soviets had \n     refused to account for the missing Japanese prisoners.\n       It is possible that some of Ishii's attacks went \n     undetected, either because they were failures or because the \n     resulting outbreaks of disease were attributed to natural \n     causes by the Chinese. However, some were recognized. \n     Official archives of the People's Republic of China list 11 \n     cities as subjected to biological warfare attacks, while the \n     number of victims of artificially disseminated plague alone \n     is placed at approximately 700 between 1940 and 1944 [12, p. \n     11].\n       A few of the Chinese allegations received international \n     press coverage at the time. The Chinese Nationalists claimed \n     that on October 27, 1940, plague was dropped on Ningbo, a \n     city near Shanghai. The incident was not investigated in a \n     scientific way, but the observed facts aroused suspicion. \n     Something was seen to come out of a Japanese plane. Later, \n     there was a heavy infestation of fleas and 99 people came \n     down with bubonic plague, with all but one dying. Yet the \n     rats in the city did not have plague, and traditionally, \n     outbreaks of plague in the human population follow an \n     epizootic in the rat population.\n       In the next few years a number of other Japanese biological \n     warfare attacks were alleged by the Chinese. Generally, they \n     were based on similar cause and effect observations. One \n     incident, however, was investigated with more care.\n       On the morning of November 4, 1941, a Japanese plane \n     circled low over Changde, a city in Hunan Province. Instead \n     of the usual cargo of bombs, the plane dropped grains of \n     wheat and rice, pieces of paper and cotton wadding, which \n     fell in two streets in the city's East Gate District. \n     During the next three weeks six people living on the two \n     streets died, all with symptoms suggesting plague. Dr. \n     Chen Wen-kwei, a former League of Nations plague expert in \n     India, arrived with a medical team just as the last victim \n     died. He performed the autopsy, found symptoms of plague \n     which were confirmed by culture and animal tests. Again, \n     there was no plague outbreak in the rat population [12, \n     pp. 195-204].\n       On March 31, 1942, the Nationalist government stated that a \n     follow-up investigation by Dr. Robert K.S. Lim, Director of \n     the Chinese Red Cross, and Dr. R. Politzer, internationally \n     known epidemiologist and former member of the League of \n     Nations Anti-Epidemic Commission, who was then on a wartime \n     assignment to the Chinese government, had confirmed Chen's \n     findings.\n       Western reaction to the Chinese charges was mixed. Harrison \n     Forman of the New York Times, and Dr. Thomas Parran, Jr., the \n     U.S. Surgeon-General, thought the Chinese had made a case. \n     But U.S. Ambassador Clarence E. Gauss was uncertain in an \n     April 11, 1942, cable to the State Department, while Dr. \n     Theodor Rosebury, the well-known American bacteriologist, \n     felt that failure to produce plague bacilli from cultures of \n     the material dropped at Changde weakened the Chinese claim \n     [13, pp. 109-10]. Chen's full report, in which he suggested \n     that it was fleas that were infected rather than the other \n     material, was not made readily available by the Nationalist \n     government.\n       Later disclosures of Japanese techniques would support \n     Chen's reasoning: Fleas, after being fed on plague-infected \n     rats, were swaddled in cotton and wrapped in paper, while \n     grain was included in the mix in the hope that it would \n     attract rats so that the fleas would find a new host to \n     infect and thus start a ``natural'' epidemic.\n       At the December 1949 Soviet trial at Khabarovsk evidence \n     was produced supporting the Nationalist Chinese biological \n     warfare charges [14]. Witnesses testified that films had been \n     made of some tests, including the 1940 attack on Ningbo. \n     Japanese witnesses and defendants confirmed other biological \n     warfare attacks, such as the 1941 Changde incident. Military \n     orders, railroad waybills for shipment of biological warfare \n     supplies, gendarmerie instructions for sending prisoners to \n     the laboratories, and other incriminating Japanese documents \n     were introduced in evidence [1, pp. 19-20, 23-24].\n       Describing the operation of Unit 731, the main biological \n     warfare installation, located outside Harbin, the transcript \n     summary stated: ``Experts have calculated . . . that it was \n     capable of breeding, in the course of one production cycle, \n     lasting only a few days, no less than 30,000,000 billion \n     microbes. . . . That explains why . . . bacteria quantities \n     [are given] in kilograms, thus referring to the weight of \n     the thick, creamy bacteria mass skimmed directly from the \n     surface of the culture medium [1, pp. 13-14].\n       Total bacteria production capacity at this one unit was \n     eight tons per month [1, pp. 266-67].\n       Euphemistically called a ``water purification unit,'' \n     General Ishii's organization also worked on medical projects \n     not directly related to biological warfare. In the Asian \n     countries it overran, the Japanese Army conscripted local \n     young women to entertain the troops. The medical difficulties \n     resulting from this practice became acute. In an effort to \n     solve the problem, Chinese women confined in the detachment's \n     prison ``were infected with syphillis with the object of \n     investigating preventive means against this disease. [1, p. \n     357].\n       Another experiment disclosed at the Khabarovsk trial was \n     the ``freezing project.'' During extremely cold winter \n     weather prisoners were led outdoors:\n       ``Their arms were bared and made to freeze with the help of \n     an artificial current of air. This was done until their \n     frozen arms, when struck with a short stick, emitted a sound \n     resembling that which a board gives out when it is struck'' \n     [1, pp. 289, 21-22, 357-58].\n       Once back inside, various procedures for thawing were \n     tried. One account of Unit 731's prison, adjacent to the \n     laboratories, described men and women with rotting hands from \n     which the bones protruded--victims of the freezing tests. A \n     documentary film was made of one of the experiments.\n       Simulated field tests were carried out at Unit 731's Anta \n     Station Proving Ground. Witnesses described experiments in \n     which various infecting agents were used. Nishi Toshihide, \n     Chief of the Training Division, testified:\n       ``In January 1945 . . . I saw experiments in inducing gas \n     gangrene, conducted under the direction of the Chief of the \n     2nd Division, Col. Ikari, and researcher Futaki. Ten \n     prisoners . . . were tied facing stakes, five to ten metres \n     apart. . . . The prisoners' heads were covered with metal \n     helmets, and their bodies with screens . . . only the naked \n     buttocks being exposed. At about 100 metres away a \n     fragmentation bomb was exploded by electricity. . . . All ten \n     men were wounded . . . and sent back to the prison. . . . I \n     later asked Ikari and research Futaki what the results had \n     been. They told me that all ten men had . . . died of gas \n     gangrene.'' [1, pp. 289-90].\n       Among the many wartime recollections published by Japanese \n     exservicemen are a few by former members of Unit 731 [15]. \n     Akiyama Hiroshi told his story in two magazine articles and \n     Kimura Bumpei, a former captain, has published his memoirs \n     [16]. Sakaki Ryohei, a former major, has described how \n     plague was spread by air-dropping rats and voles and has \n     given details of the flea ``nurseries'' developed by Ishii \n     for rapid production of millions of fleas [17].\n       A more dramatic confirmation of Ishii's work was an hour-\n     long Japanese television documentary produced by Yoshinaga \n     Haruko and shown by the Tokyo Broadcasting System. A \n     Washington Post dispatch on November 19, 1976, reported:\n       ``In the little-publicized television documentary on the \n     germ warfare unit, Yoshinaga laid bare secrets closely held \n     in Japan during and since the war. . . . [She] traveled \n     throughout Japan to trace down 20 former members of the \n     wartime unit. . . . Four of the men finally agreed to help, \n     and the reporter found their testimony dovetailed with \n     reports of war crime trials held in the Soviet Union.''\n       Some of those interviewed by Yoshinaga claimed that they \n     had told their stories to American authorities. Eguchi said \n     that he ``was the second to be ordered to G.H.Q. [General \n     Headquarters]'' and ``they took a\n\n[[Page S14546]]\n\n     record'' of his testimony. Takahashi, an ex-surgeon and Army \n     major, stated: ``I went to the G.H.Q. twice in 1947. \n     Investigators made me write reports on the condition that \n     they will protect me from the Soviets.'' Kumamoto, an ex-\n     flight engineer, said that after the war General Ishii went \n     to America and ``took his research data and begged for \n     remission for us all'' [4].\n       Declassified position papers indicate a difference of \n     opinion on how to deal with the question of immunity. The War \n     Department favored acceding to Ishii's demands for immunity \n     in documentary form. The State Department, however, cautioned \n     against putting anything in writing which might later cause \n     embarrassment, arguing that if the Japanese were told the \n     information would be kept in classified intelligence channels \n     that would be sufficient protection. In any event, a \n     satisfactory arrangement apparently was worked out as none of \n     the biological warfare personnel was subsequently charged \n     with war crimes and the United States obtained full details \n     of Japan's program.\n       The Japanese experts who, Dr. Hill hoped, would ``be spared \n     embarrassment,'' not only used their human guinea pigs in \n     experiments to determine lethal dosages but on occasion--in \n     their pursuit of exact scientific information--made certain \n     that the experimentees did not survive. A group would be \n     brought down with a disease and, as the infection developed, \n     individuals would be selected out of the group and killed. \n     Autopsies were then performed, so that the progress of the \n     disease could be ascertained at various time-frames.\n       General Kitano Masaji and Dr. Kasahara Shiro revealed this \n     practice in a report prepared for U.S. officials describing \n     their work on hemorrhagic fever:\n       ``Subsequent cases were produced either by blood or blood-\n     free extracts of liver, spleen or kidney derived from \n     individuals sacrificed at various times during the course of \n     the disease. Morphine was employed for this purpose'' [18].\n       Kitano and Dr. Kasahara Yukio described the ``sacrificing'' \n     of a human experimentee when he apparently was recovering \n     from an attack of tick encephalitis:\n       ``Mouse brain suspension . . . was injected . . . and \n     produced symptoms after an incubation period of 7 days. \n     Highest temperature was 39.8 deg. C. This subject was \n     sacrificed when fever was subsiding, about the 12th day.''\n       Clearly, U.S. biological warfare experts learned a lot from \n     their Japanese counterparts. While we do not yet know exactly \n     how much this information advanced the American program, we \n     have the Fort Detrick doctors' testimony that it was \n     ``invaluable.'' And it is known that some of the biological \n     weapons developed later were at least similar to ones that \n     had been part of the Japanese project. Infecting feathers \n     with spore diseases was one of Ishii's achievements and \n     feather bombs later became a weapon in America's biological \n     warfare arsenal [19].\n       Dr. Leroy D. Fothergill, long-time scientific advisor to \n     the U.S. Army's Biological Laboratories at Fort Detrick, once \n     speculated upon some of the possible spin-off effects of a \n     biological warfare attack:\n       ``Everything that breathes in the exposed area has an \n     opportunity to be exposed to the agent. This will involve \n     vast numbers of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and \n     insects. . . . Surveys have indicated surprising numbers of \n     wild life inhabiting each square mile of countryside. It is \n     possible that many species would be exposed to an agent for \n     the first time in their evolutionary history . . . Would it \n     create the basis for possible genetic evolution of \n     microorganisms in new directions with changes in virulence of \n     some species? Would it establish public health and \n     environmental problems that are unique and beyond our present \n     experience?'' [20].\n       Perhaps President Richard Nixon had some of these things in \n     mind when, on November 25, 1969, he renounced the use of \n     biological warfare, declaring:\n       ``Biological weapons have massive unpredictable and \n     potentially uncontrollable consequences. They may produce \n     global epidemics and impair the health of future generations. \n     I have therefore decided that the U.S. shall renounce the use \n     of lethal biological agents and weapons, and all other \n     methods of biological warfare'' [21].\n       Some research on defensive aspects was permitted by the \n     ban. The line between defense and offense is admittedly a \n     thin one. Nearly a year after the Nixon renunciation of \n     biological warfare, Seymour Hersh wrote that the programs the \n     Army wanted to continue ``under defensive research included a \n     significant effort to develop and produce virulent strains of \n     new biological agents, then develop defenses against them. \n     `This sounds very much like what we were doing before,' one \n     official noted caustically'' [22].\n       There is a difference of opinion among observers as to \n     whether the United States and other major powers have indeed \n     given up on biological warfare. Some believe the issue is a \n     matter of the past. However, its history has been so replete \n     with deception that one cannot be sure. One thing seems \n     certain: The story did not end with Japan's use of biological \n     war fare against China; there are additional chapters to be \n     written.\n       Available documents do not reveal whether anyone knows the \n     names of any of the thousands of Chinese Mongolians, \n     Russians, ``half-breeds'' and Americans whose lives were \n     prematurely ended by massive doses of plague, typhus, \n     dysenteries, gas gangrene, typhoid, hemorrhagic fever, \n     cholera, anthax, tularemia, smallpox, tsutsugamushi and \n     glanders; or by such grotesqueries as being pumped full of \n     horse blood; having their livers destroyed by prolonged \n     exposure to X-rays or being subjected to vivisection.\n       It is known, however, that because of the ``national \n     security'' interests of the United States, General Ishii and \n     many of the top members of Unit 731 lived out their full \n     lives, suffering only the natural afflictions of old age. A \n     few, General Kitano among them, enjoyed exceptional good \n     health and at the time of writing were living in quiet \n     retirement.\n         General Headquarters, Supreme Commander for the Allied \n           Powers,\n                                                       Mar 27, 47.\n\n                      Brief for the Chief of Staff\n\n       1.

The Russian has made several attempts to get at this \n     man. We have stalled. He now hopes to make his point by \n     suddenly claiming the Japanese expert as a war criminal.\n       4.

At Chuhsien \n     Japanese planes scattered rice and wheat grains mixed with \n     fleas on 4th October 1940. Bubonic plague appeared in same \n     area on 12th November. Plague never occurred in Chuhsien \n     before occurrence. Fleas were not properly examined to \n     determine whether plague infected. At Kinghwa, located \n     between Ningpo and Chupuien, 3 Japanese planes dropped a \n     large quantity of small granules on 28th November 1940. \n     Microscopic examination revealed presence of numerous gram-\n     negative bacilli possessing * * *.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n                             A Judge's View\n\n                         (By Bert V.A. Roling)\n\n       As one of the judges in the International Military Tribunal \n     for the Far East, it is a bitter experience for me to be \n     informed now that centrally ordered Japanese war criminality \n     of the most disgusting kind was kept secret from the Court by \n     the U.S. government. This Japanese war criminality consisted, \n     in part, of using human beings, prisoners of war, Chinese as \n     well as American, as ``guinea pigs'' in an endeavor to test \n     the impact of specific biological warfare weapons. Research \n     on and production of these weapons was not forbidden at that \n     time. The Protocol of Geneva, 1925, forbade their use only in \n     battle. But to use human beings for biological experiments, \n     causing the death of at least 3,000 prisoners of war, was \n     among the gravest war crimes.\n       The first information about these Japanese atrocities \n     became known through the trial at Khabarovsk, December 25 to \n     30, 1949. I remember reading about it [1], and not believing \n     its contents. I could not imagine that these things had \n     happened, without the Court in Tokyo being informed. \n     According to the book about the trial all the facts were \n     transmitted to the chief prosecutor, Joseph B. Keenan. But \n     some of the information was incorrect. The book mentions that \n     the Military Tribunal was informed of the wicked experiements \n     done by the Tama division in Nanking, and that it requested \n     the American prosecution to submit more detailed proof [1, p. \n     443]. Such Court procedures would not have been in conformity \n     with Anglo-Saxon practice. It is more likely that the \n     information was given to the chief prosecutor.\n       A further feature of the Khabarovsk book is the strange \n     character of the confessions made by the accused. Some are \n     quoted as saying that they acted upon the special secret \n     orders of the Japanese emperor [1, pp. 10, 519]. This was \n     bound to cause doubts about its credibility. The emperor does \n     not give orders to perform specific military acts. Everything \n     that is ordered by the government and its officials is ``in \n     the name of the emperor.'' But his role is remarkable in that \n     he may not make decisions; he has only to confirm decisions \n     of the government. The ``imperial will is decisive, but \n     it derives wholly from the government and the small circle \n     around the throne. Titus stresses the\n\n[[Page S14547]]\n\n     ``ratification function'' of the reached consensus [2, p. \n     321]. It is clear that this imperial confirmation gives a \n     decision an exceptional authority: the command of the \n     emperor is obeyed. In fact, however, the emperor has a \n     kind of loud-speaker function. He is heard, and obeyed, \n     but he speaks only on the recommendation of the \n     government.\n       Very seldom does the emperor act in a personal manner. One \n     such occasion was his criticism of the behavior of the \n     Japanese army in Manchuria (the so-called Manchurian \n     Incident). Another related to his role in connection with the \n     capitulation at the end of World War II. Despite the atomic \n     bombs and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war, the \n     cabinet was divided and could not come to a decision because \n     the military members refused to surrender. Their motivation: \n     the existence of the imperial system was not sufficiently \n     guaranteed. In a very exceptional move, the emperor was \n     brought in to make the decision. He took the risk, and \n     decided for immediate capitulation.\n       Thus the emphasis on the personal secret involvement of the \n     emperor in the Khabarovsk trial account make it appear \n     untrustworthy. The whole setup could be perceived as a source \n     of arguments in favor of indicting the emperor. I remember at \n     that time, writing to show the danger of national postwar \n     judgments which could easily be misused for political \n     purposes, and giving the Khabarovsk trial as an example. I \n     must state now that the Japanese misbehavior as described in \n     the judgment, has been confirmed by the recently disclosed \n     American documents.\n       Immunity from prosecution was granted in exchange for \n     Japanese scientific findings concerning biological weapons, \n     based on disgusting criminal research on human beings. We \n     learn from these documents that it was considered a bargain: \n     almost for nothing, information was obtained that had cost \n     millions of dollars and thousands of human lives. The \n     American authorities were worrying only about the prospect of \n     the human outcry in the United States, which surely would \n     have taken place if the American people had been informed \n     about this ``deal.''\n       The security that surrounds the military makes it possible \n     for military behavior to deviate considerably from the \n     prevailing public standard, but it is a danger to society \n     when such deviation takes place. It leads gradually to \n     contempt for the military, as witness the public attitude in \n     connection with military behavior in the Vietnam war. The \n     kind of military behavior that occurred in connection with \n     the Japanese biological weapon atrocities can only contribute \n     further to this attitude.\n       Respect for what the Nuremberg judgment called ``the \n     honorable profession of arms'' is needed. Military power is \n     still indispensable in our present world to provide for peace \n     and security, so it is desirable for it to be held in high \n     esteem. Power which is despised may become dangerous. \n     Moreover, only if the military is regarded with respect, will \n     it attract the personnel it should have.\n       The same is true of diplomatic service, which needs \n     national and international respect. This respect will \n     disappear if the service indulges in subversive activities, \n     as the U.S. diplomatic mission did in Iran. That diplomatic \n     misbehavior in Iran led to developments--the hostage crisis--\n     which were disastrous for the whole world.\n       The documents which have come to light inform us also of \n     the use of biological weapons in the war against the Chinese \n     people. The criminal warfare was not mentioned in the Tokyo \n     indictment, and not discussed before the Military Tribunal. \n     It was kept secret from the world. The immunity granted to \n     the Japanese war criminals covered not only deadly research \n     on living persons, but also the use of biological weapons \n     against the Chinese. And all this so that the United States \n     could obtain exclusive access to the information, gained at \n     the cost of thousands of human lives.\n       Knowledge about what kind of bargain was being struck in \n     the biological weapons area may strengthen the perception of \n     the repulsiveness of war. It may also show the danger of \n     moral depravity, in peacetime, within the circles that have \n     the instruments of military power in their hands.\n\n\n                               end notes\n\n       1.

This volume is a summary of the \n     transcript of the Soviet trial in Khabarovsk, Siberia, Dec. \n     20-25, 1949, of 12 captured Japanese Army personnel charged \n     with participation in the biological warfare program. For a \n     later reference to the program see Outline History of Science \n     and Technology in Japan, (``Nihon Kagaku Gijutsu-shi \n     Taikei''), Vol. 25 (Medicine 2, 1967), pp. 309-10. This \n     account states that the biological warfare program was \n     organized in 1933 and that ``for special research on \n     bacteria, members of the epidemic-prevention section shall be \n     sent to Manchuria.'' It also stated that little was known \n     about the program after the war since all records were said \n     to have been destroyed and that the only evidence was that \n     produced at the Khabarovsk trial. It did add, however, that \n     there were reports that General Ishii had avoided prosecution \n     by turning over his materials to U.S. authorities. I have not \n     seen this volume and am indebted to John Dower, of the \n     University of Wisconsin, who supplied the citation.\n       2.

Although most U.S. documents and the Soviet trial \n     summary give Ishii credit for originating the biological \n     warfare program, it is possible that he was only the chosen \n     instrument. There are references indicating interest in the \n     program at higher levels. The ``staff officer'' of Ishii's \n     Operations Division was Lieutenant Colonel Miyata, who in \n     real life was Prince Takeda [1, p. 40]. Ishii's friend at \n     court was Gen. Nagata Tetsuzan, long Japan's top military man \n     [1, pp. 106, 295], while the orders establishing the two \n     original units were reputedly issued by the Emperor [1, pp. \n     10, 104, 413].\n       4. ``A Bruise--Terror of the 731 Corps,'' Tokyo \n     Broadcasting System television documentary, produced by \n     Yoshinaga Haruko, shown Nov. 2, 1976. It has also been \n     screened in Europe but not in the United States. However, the \n     Washington Post (Nov. 19, 1976) carried a lengthy news story \n     describing the film. In an interview with Post reporter John \n     Saar, Yoshinaga said five former members of the biological \n     warfare unit told her they were promised complete protection \n     in return for cooperation with U.S. authorities. ``All the \n     important documents were given to the United States,'' she \n     said.\n       5. This ``top secret'' cable [C-52423] also reveals that \n     the first of the biological warfare experts to be sent from \n     Washington to Japan had already arrived, referring to ``Dr. \n     Norbert H.

A bill to amend the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               consumer's right to financial privacy act\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the ``Consumer's \nRight to Financial Privacy Act'' for myself and Senator Bryan. This \nbill would address the significant deficiencies in the Financial \nServices Modernization Act passed by this very body last week.\n\n  Our bill would provide that consumers have (1) notice of the \ncategories\n\n[[Page S14548]]\n\nof nonpublic personal information that institutions collect, as well as \nthe practices and policies of that institution with respect to \ndisclosing nonpublic information; (2) access to the nonpublic personal \ninformation collected and shared; (3) affirmative consent, that is that \nthe financial institution must receive the affirmative consent of the \nconsumer, also referred to as an opt-in, in order to share such \ninformation with third parties and affiliates. Lastly, my provision \nwould require that this federal law not preempt stronger state privacy \nlaws. This bill is drafted largely after the amendment Senator Bryan \nand I offered in the Conference on Financial Services Modernization, \nbut failed to get adopted due to the Conference's rush to pass a \nfinancial modernization bill, no matter what the cost.\n  I know some think that opt-in is extreme, but I have to tell you that \nis what the American people want. Over the past year I have learned a \ngreat deal about the activities of institutions sharing sensitive \npersonal information. Many may not be aware, but it had become a common \npractice for state department of motor vehicles to sell the drivers \nlicense information, including name, height, weight, social security \nnumber, vehicle identification number, motor vehicle record and more. \nSome states even sold the digital photo image of each driver's license.\n  I was not aware of this practice going on. When I learned about it \nand studied it a little closer, I found several groups who were \noutraged by this practice. One such group was Eagle Forum. Another such \ngroup was the ACLU. Still another group was the Free Congress \nFoundation. Before I knew it, there was an ad hoc coalition of groups \nnot only supporting the issue of driver's license privacy, but \ndemanding it.\n  Thanks to the hard work of these groups, I was able to include an \nopt-in provision for people applying for drivers licenses at their \nstate department of motor vehicles. That provision sailed through the \nSenate and then the House. That bill was signed into law by President \nClinton. Despite significant lobbying by the direct marketing industry, \nnot one member of the House or Senate took to the floor and said, ``I \nbelieve we should not allow consumers to choose whether or not their \ndrivers license information, including their picture, should be sold or \ntraded away like an old suit.'' No, no one objected to the opt-in. As a \nresult, I believe very strongly that Congress has already set the bar \non this issue. Opt-in is not just reasonable, it is the right thing to \ndo.\n\n  Meanwhile, the ad hoc coalition, which is continuing to grow and \nincludes every ideology from conservative to liberal, has signed on to \nfour basic principles with regard to financial privacy. The principles \ninclude notice, access and consent, but also a requirement that weak \nfederal laws not preempt stronger state laws. Our amendment \nincorporates those four basic principles.\n  Now my basic question is this, why would anyone oppose this bill? \nOnly if you believe the financial services industry cannot make money \nby doing business above the table and on the level for everyone to see \nin the ``sunshine'' if you will. If you believe that financial \ninstitutions make money only by deceiving their customers or leaving \nthose customers in the dark, then maybe you should oppose this bill. I \ndo not subscribe to such a belief.\n  Industry will tell you that if they are required to include an opt-\nin, consumers will not, and therefore business will shut down. What \ndoes that tell you that consumers won't choose to opt-in? It means \npeople don't want their information shared. If that is such a problem, \nit seems to me the business would spend more time educating the \nconsumer as to the benefits of information sharing. That is where the \nburden to convince the consumer to buy the product should be--on the \nbusiness.\n  During the financial modernization debate, the financial industry, \nalong with Citigroup communicated to Congress that they would not be \nable to operate or function appropriately with an opt-in requirement. I \nfind that very difficult to comprehend, seeing as Citibank signed an \nagreement with their German affiliates in 1995 affording German \ncitizens the opportunity to tell Citibank ``no,'' they did not want \ntheir personal data shared with third parties. I have a copy of the \ncontract to prove it.\n  Entitled, Agreement on ``Interterritorial Data Protection'' one can \nsee this is an agreement on the sharing of customer information between \nCitibank (South Dakota), referred in the document as CNA, and its \nGerman affiliates. On page two paragraph 4, entitled, Use of \nSubcontractors, Transmission of Data to Third Parties, number 2 reads:\n\n       For marketing purposes, the transfer of personal data to \n     third parties provided by the Card Service Companies (that is \n     Citicorp of Germany and Citicorp Card Operations of Germany) \n     is prohibited, except in those cases where such personal data \n     is transferred to affiliated companies engaged in banking \n     business in order to market financial services; the transfer \n     of such data beyond the aforementioned scope to third \n     parties, shall require the Card Service Companies' express \n     approval. Such approval is limited to the scope of the Card \n     Customers' consent as obtained on the application form.\n\n  That ladies and gentlemen, is an opt-in to operate in Germany, by \nnone other than Citigroup, the number one proponent of financial \nmodernization. Now if they can offer financial privacy to individuals \nin Germany, why on God's green earth can't they agree to an opt-in here \nin America? Do Germans have special rights over Americans? I should \nhope not.\n  Mr. President, simply put, this bill is what Americans want. This \nbill is workable as proven in the Citicorp agreement. The truth is that \nthe American people do not understand the intricacies of banking law or \nsecurities regulation. They probably do not know or care much about \naffiliates or operating subsidiaries. What I do know, is that if you \nwalked outside and polled people from New York City to Los Angeles, CA, \nand everywhere in between, they would not only understand financial \nprivacy, 90 percent of them would demand financial privacy and the \nability to tell an institution ``no.''\n  Mr. President, in passing the financial modernization bill, Congress \ngave mammoth financial services companies significant expanded powers \nand unprecedented ability to collect, share, buy and sell a consumers \nnonpublic personal financial information. During the debate, many \nmembers promised they would address privacy, but only in a separate \nbill at a later time. Well, Mr. President, the time is now and the bill \nis the ``Consumer's Right to Financial Privacy Act.''\n  The financial industry may have won the battle by keeping stronger \nfinancial privacy provisions out of the financial modernization bill. \nBut I assure you they have not won the war. They cannot win the war on \nfinancial privacy because the American people just won't allow it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement on \n``International Data Protection'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Agreement on Interterritorial Data Protection\n\n\n                             by and between\n\n     1.

CIP has unrestricted authority to engage in banking \n     transactions. As a license of VISA International, CIP issues \n     the Citibank Visa Card''. Additionally, since July 1st, 1995, \n     CIP has been cooperating with the Deutsche Bahn AG in issuing \n     the ``DB/Citibank BahnCard'' with a cash-free payment \n     function--hereinafter referred to as ``DB/Citibank-\n     BahnCard''--on the basis of a Co-Branding Agreement concluded \n     between Deutsche Bahn AG and CIP on November 18th, 1994. \n     After the conclusion of the Agreement, the co-branding \n     business was extended to include the issuance of the DB/\n     Citibank BahnCard without a cash-free payment function, known \n     as BahnCard ``pure''.\n       2. CIP transferred to CKS the operations of the Citibank \n     Visa credit card business, including accounting and \n     electronic data processing, on the basis of the terms of a \n     Service Agreement (non-gratuitous contract for services) \n     dated March 24, 1998, supplemented as of June 1, 1989 and \n     November 30, 1989. Details are contained in the ``CKS Service\n\n[[Page S14549]]\n\n     Agreement'', according to which CKS performs for CIP all \n     services pertaining to the Citibank Visa card business. \n     Concurrent with the application for a Citibank Visa Card, the \n     Citibank Visa Card customers agree to the transfer of their \n     personal data to CKS and to those companies entrusted by CKS \n     with such data processing.\n       3. In the Co-Branding Agreement with the Deutsche Bahn AG \n     dated November 18, 1994, CIP assumed responsibility for the \n     issuance of the DB/Citibank BahnCard as well as for the \n     entire management and operations associated with this \n     business.\n       4. On the basis of a Service Agreement dated April 1, 1995, \n     CIP transferred the entire operations of the DB/Citibank-\n     BahnCard business, including data processing and accounting, \n     to the Card Service Companies. Details are contained in the \n     ``BahnCard Service Agreement''. Concurrent with the \n     application for issuing a DB/Citibank BahnCard, the BahnCard \n     customers agree to the transfer of their personal data to CCO \n     and to those companies entrusted by CCO with such data \n     processing.\n       5. Due to reasons of efficiency, service and \n     centralization, the Card Service Companies have entrusted CNA \n     with the processing of the Citibank Visa card business and of \n     the DB/Citibank BahnCard business as of July 1, 1995. In \n     light of such considerations, the Card Service Companies--as \n     principals--and CNA--as contractors--concluded the ``CNA \n     Service Agreement'', to which CIP expressly consented.\n       6. The performance of the CNA Service Agreement requires \n     the Card Service Companies to transfer the personal data of \n     the Citibank Visa card customers and the DB/Citibank BahnCard \n     customers--hereinafter collectively referred to as ``Card \n     Customers''--to CNA and further requires CNA to process and \n     use these data.\n       In order to protect the Card Customers' rights with respect \n     to both the data protection law, as well as the banking \n     secrecy, and in order to comply with the banking supervisory \n     and data protection requirements.\n       The contractual parties agree and covenant as follows:\n\n\n                        Sec. 1  Basic Principles\n\n       The parties hereto undertake to safeguard the Card \n     Customers' right to protection against unauthorized capture, \n     storage and use of their personal data and their right to \n     informational self-determination. The scope of such \n     protection shall be governed by the standards as laid down in \n     the German Federal Data Protection Law \n     (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, abbreviated to ``BDSG''). The \n     parties hereto additionally agree to comply with the banking \n     secrecy regulations.\n\n\n           Sec. 2  instructions of the card service companies\n\n       1. CNA shall process the data provided by the Card Service \n     Companies solely in accordance with the Card Service \n     Companies' instructions and rules, and the provisions \n     contained in this Agreement. CNA undertakes to process and \n     use the data only for the purpose for which the data have \n     been provided by the Card Service Companies to CNA, said \n     purposes including those as described in the CNA Service \n     Agreement. The use of such data for purposes other than \n     described above requires the Card Service Companies' express \n     written consent.\n       2. At any time, the Card Service Companies may make \n     inquiries to CNA about the personal data transferred by the \n     Card Service Companies and stored at CNA, and the Card \n     Service Companies may require CNA to perform corrections, \n     deletions or blockings of such personal data transferred by \n     the Card Service Companies to CNA.\n\n\n        Sec. 3  inspection rights of the Card Service Companies\n\n       At regular intervals, an (joint) agent appointed by the \n     Card Service Companies shall verify whether CNA complies with \n     the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in particular \n     with the data protection law as well as the banking secrecy \n     regulations. CNA shall grant the Card Service Companies' \n     agent supervised unimpeded access to the extent necessary to \n     accomplish the inspection and review of all data processing \n     facilities, data files and other documentation needed for \n     processing and utilizing the personal data transferred by the \n     Card Service Companies in a fashion which is consistent with \n     the CNA Operational Policies. CNA shall provide the agent \n     with all such information as deemed necessary to perform this \n     inspection function.\n\n\n  Sec. 4  use of subcontractors, transmission of data to third parties\n\n       1. CNA may not appoint non-affiliated third parties, in \n     particular subcontractors, to perform and fulfill CNA's \n     commitments and obligations under this Agreement.\n       2. For marketing purposes, the transfer of personal data to \n     third parties provided by the Card Service Companies is \n     prohibited, except in those cases where such personal data is \n     transferred to affiliated companies engaged in the banking \n     business in order to market financial services; the transfer \n     of such data beyond the aforementioned scope to third parties \n     shall require the Card Service Companies' express approval. \n     Such approval is limited to the scope of the Card Customers' \n     consent as obtained on the application form. The personal \n     data of customers having obtained a BahnCard ``pure'' may \n     only be used or transferred for BahnCard marketing purposes.\n       CNA and the Card Service Companies undertake to institute \n     and maintain the following data protection measures:\n     1. Access control of persons\n       CNA shall implement suitable measures in order to prevent \n     unauthorized persons from gaining access to the data \n     processing equipment where the data transferred by the Card \n     Service Companies are processed.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Establishing security areas;\n       b. Protection and restriction of access paths;\n       c. Securing the decentralized data processing equipment and \n     personal computers;\n       d.

Access control to data\n       CNA commits that the persons entitled to use CNA's data \n     processing system are only able to access the data within the \n     scope and to the extent covered by the irrespective access \n     permission (authorization).\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Allocation of individual terminals and/or terminal user, \n     and identification characteristics exclusive to specific \n     functions;\n       b. Functional and/or time-restricted use of terminals and/\n     or terminal users, and identification characteristics;\n       c. Persons with function authorization codes (direct \n     access, batch processing) access to work areas;\n       d. Electronic verification of authorization;\n       e. Evaluation of records.\n     7. Transmission control\n       CNA shall be obligated to enable the verification and \n     tracing of the locations/destinations to which the Card \n     Customers' data are transferred by utilization of CNA's data \n     communication equipment/devices.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Documentation of the retrieval and transmission \n     programs;\n\n[[Page S14550]]\n\n       b. Documentation of the remote locations/destinations to \n     which a transmission paths (logical paths).\n     8. Input control\n       CNA shall provide for the retrospective ability to review \n     and determine the time and the point of the Card Customers' \n     data entry into CNA's data processing system.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Proof established within CNA's organization of the input \n     authorization;\n       b. Electronic recording of entries.\n     9. Instructional control\n       The Card Customers' data transferred by the Card Service \n     Companies to CNA may only be processed in accordance with \n     instructions of the Card Service Companies.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Binding policies and procedures for CNA employees, \n     subject to the Card Service Companies' prior approval of such \n     procedures and policies,\n       b. Upon request, access will be granted to those Card \n     Service Companies' employees and agents who are responsible \n     for monitoring CNA's compliance with this Agreement (c.f. \n     Sec. 3 hereof.)\n     10. Transport control\n       CNA and the Card Service Companies shall implement suitable \n     measures to prevent the Card Customers' personal data from \n     being read, copied, altered or deleted by unauthorized \n     parties during the transmission thereof or during the \n     transport of the data media.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a. Encryption of the data for on-line transmission, or \n     transport by means of data carriers, (tapes and cartridges);\n       b. Monitoring of the completeness and correctness of the \n     transfer of data (end-to-end check).\n     II. Organization control\n       CNA shall maintain its internal organization in a matter \n     that meets the requirements of this Agreement.\n       This shall be accomplished by:\n       a.

Formulation of a data security concept whose content has \n     been reconciled with the Card Service Companies;\n       c. Industry standard system and program examination;\n       d. Formulation of an emergency plan (back-up contingency \n     plan).\n\n\n                   Sec. 6  Data Protection Supervisor\n\n       1. CNA undertakes to appoint a Data Protection Supervisor \n     and to notify the Card Service Companies of the appointee(s). \n     CNA shall only select an employee with adequate expertise and \n     reliability necessary to perform such a duty, and provide the \n     Card Service Companies with appropriate evidence thereof.\n       2. The Data Protection Supervisor shall be directly \n     subordinate/accountable to CNA's General Management. He shall \n     not be bound by instructions which obstruct or hinder the \n     performance of his duty in the field of data protection. He \n     shall cooperate with the Card Service Companies' agent--as \n     indicated in Sec. 3 hereof--in monitoring the performance of \n     this Agreement and adhering to the data protection \n     requirements in conjunction with the data in question. In the \n     event that CNA chooses to change the person who serves as a \n     Data Protection Supervisor, CNA shall give timely notice to \n     the Card Service Companies of such change. The Data \n     Protection Supervisor shall be bound by confidentiality \n     obligations.\n       3. The Data Protection Supervisor shall be available as the \n     on-site contact for the Card Service Companies.\n\n\n                   Sec. 7  Confidentiality Obligation\n\n       CNA shall impose a confidentiality obligation on those \n     employees entrusted with processing the personal data \n     transferred by the Card Service Companies. CNA shall \n     furthermore obligate its employees to adhere to the banking \n     and data secrecy regulations and document such employees' \n     obligation in writing. Upon request, CNA shall provide the \n     Card Service Companies with satisfactory evidence of \n     compliance with this provision.\n\n\n                  Sec. 8  Rights of Concerned Persons\n\n       1. At any time, Card Customers whose data are transferred \n     by CIP to the Card Service Companies, and thereafter further \n     transferred by the Card Service Companies to CNA, shall be \n     entitled to make inquiries to CNA (who are required to \n     respond) as to: the stored personal data, including the \n     origin and the recipient of the data; the purpose of storage; \n     and the persons and locations/destinations to which such data \n     are transferred on a regular basis.\n       The requested information shall generally be provided in \n     writing.\n       2. The Card Service Companies shall honour the concerned \n     person's request to correct his personal data at any time, \n     provided that the stored data are incorrect. The same shall \n     apply to data stored at CNA.\n       3. The concerned person may claim from the responsible Card \n     Service Companies the deletion or blocking of any data stored \n     at the Card Service Companies or CNA, in the event that: such \n     storage is prohibited by law; the data in question relate to \n     information about health criminal actions, violations of the \n     public order, or religious or political opinions, and its \n     truth/correctness cannot be proved by the Card Service \n     Companies; and such data are processed to serve Card Service \n     Companies' own purposes, and such data are no longer \n     necessary to serve the purpose of the data storage under the \n     agreement with the respective Card Customers.\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto submit to \n     the provisions of Sec. 35 of the German Federal Data \n     Protection Law (BDSG), and agree to be familiar with such \n     provisions.\n       4. The concerned person may demand that the responsible \n     Card Service Companies block his or her personal data, if he \n     or she contests the correct nature thereof and if it is not \n     possible to determine whether such data is correct or \n     incorrect. This shall also apply to such data stored by CNA.\n       5. If CIP. the Card Service Companies or CNA should violate \n     the data protection or banking secrecy regulations, the \n     person concerned shall be entitled to claim damages caused \n     and incurred thereby as provided in the German Federal Data \n     Protection Law (BDSG). CIP's and the Card Service Companies' \n     liability shall moreover extend to those claims arising from \n     breach of this Agreement and asserted against CNA and/or its \n     employees in performance of this Agreement.\n       6. CNA acknowledges the obligation assumed by CIP and the \n     Card Service Companies towards the concerned person, and \n     undertakes to comply with all Card Service Companies' \n     instructions concerning such person. The concerned person may \n     also directly assert claims against CNA and file an action at \n     CNA's applicable place of jurisdiction.\n\n\n              Sec. 9  Notification to the Concerned Person\n\n       The Card Service Companies undertake to appropriately \n     notify the concerned Card Customers of the transfer of their \n     data to CNA.\n\n\n                  Sec. 10  Data Protection Supervision\n\n       1. According to the German Federal Data Protection Law \n     (BDSG), the Card Service Companies and CIP are subject to \n     public control exercised by the respective responsible \n     supervisory authorities.\n       2. Upon request of CIP or either of the Card Service \n     Companies, CNA shall provide the respective supervisory \n     authorities with the desired information and grant them the \n     opportunity of auditing to the same extent as they would be \n     entitled to conduct audits at the Card Service Companies and \n     CIP; this includes the entitlement to inspections at CNA's \n     premises by the supervisory authorities or their nominated \n     agents, unless barred by binding instructions of the \n     appropriate U.S. authorities.\n\n\n                      Sec. 11  Banking Supervision\n\n       1. Any vouchers, commercial books of accounting, and work \n     instructions needed for the comprehension of such documents, \n     as well as other organizational documents shall physically \n     remain at the Card Service Companies, unless electronically \n     archived by scanning devices in a legally permissible \n     fashion.\n       2. The Card Service Companies and CNA undertake to adhere \n     to the principles of proper accounting practice applicable in \n     Germany for computer-aided processes and the auditing \n     thereof, in particular FAMA 1/1987.\n       3. The Card Service Companies undertake to submit a data \n     processing concept and a data security concept to the German \n     Federal Authority for the Supervision of Banks \n     (Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Kreditwesen) prior to commencing \n     transfer of data to CNA.\n       4. The remote processing of the data shall be subject to \n     the internal audit department of CIP and the Card Service \n     Companies. CNA agrees to cooperate with the internal auditors \n     of CIP and the Card Service Companies, who shall have the \n     right to inspect the files of CNA's internal auditors, \n     insofar as they relate to the data files transferred by the \n     Card Service Companies to CNA. The internal auditors of the \n     Card Service Companies and of CIP shall conduct audits of CNA \n     as required by due diligence.\n       5. In a joint declaration to the Federal Banking \n     Supervisory Authority; CIP, the Card Service Companies and \n     CNA shall undertake to allow the inclusion of CNA in audits \n     in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 44 of the Banking \n     Law (Kreditwesengesetz abbreviated to KWG) at any time and \n     not to impede or obstruct such audits, provided that legal \n     requirements and/or instructions of U.S. authorities bind CNA \n     to the contrary.\n       6. CNA shall request the US banking supervisory \n     authorities' confirmation in writing to the effect that no \n     objections will be raised against the intended remote data \n     processing concept. In the event that CNA cannot procure such \n     written confirmation upon the Card Service Companies' \n     request, the Card Service Companies and CIP may withdraw from \n     this Agreement and the underlying CNA Service Agreement.\n       7. CIP, the Card Service Companies and CNA undertake to \n     abide by the requirements for interterritorial remote data \n     processing in bank accounting as set forth in the letter of \n     the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Banks dated \n     October 16, 1992. This letter is appended as a Schedule \n     hereto and forms an integral part of this Agreement.\n\n\n                     Sec. 12  Indemnification Claim\n\n       1. CNA shall indemnify the Card Service Companies within \n     the scope of their internal and contractual relationship from \n     any claims of damages asserted by the Card Customers, and \n     resulting from CNA's incompliance with the terms and \n     conditions of this Agreement.\n       2. The Card Service Companies shall indemnify CNA within \n     the scope of their internal and contractual relationship from \n     any claims of damages asserted by the Card Customer, and \n     resulting from one or both of the\n\n[[Page S14551]]\n\n     Card Service Companies' incompliance with the terms and \n     conditions of this Agreement.\n\n\n                     Sec. 13  Term of the Agreement\n\n       1. This Agreement is effective as of July 1st, 1995, until \n     terminated. It may be terminated by any party hereto at the \n     end of each calendar year upon 12 months notice prior to the \n     expiration date, subject to each party's right of termination \n     of the Agreement for material, unremedied breach hereof. The \n     termination of this Agreement by any one of the parties shall \n     result in the termination of the entire Agreement with \n     respect to the other parties.\n       2. CNA commits to return and delete all personal data \n     stored at the time of termination hereof in accordance with \n     the Card Service Companies' instructions.\n\n\n                        Sec. 14  Confidentiality\n\n       The parties hereto commit to treat strictly confidential \n     any trade, business and operating secrets or other sensitive \n     information of the other parties involved. This obligation \n     shall survive termination of this Agreement.\n\n\n    Sec. 15  Data protection Agreement with Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG)\n\n       1. The Deutsche Bahn AG captures personal data at its \n     counters and appears as a joint issuer of the DB/Citibank \n     BahnCard. The parties hereto agree that the Deutsche Bahn AG \n     therefore bears responsibility for such data.\n       2. The Deutsche Bahn AG and CIP concluded a Data Protection \n     Agreement as of February 13, 1996, defining the scope of data \n     protection obligations and commitments between the parties. \n     The parties hereto are familiar with said Data Protection \n     Agreement and acknowledge the obligations arising for CIP \n     thereunder.\n       3. The parties hereto authorize CIP to provide DB AG with \n     written notification of this Agreement on Interterritorial \n     Data Protection.\n\n\n                      Sec. 16  General Provisions\n\n       1. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding \n     between the parties hereto in conjunction with the subject \n     matter as laid down herein and none of the parties hereto has \n     entered into this Agreement in reliance upon any \n     representation, warranty or undertaking of any other party \n     which is not contained in this Agreement or incorporated by \n     reference herein. Any subsequent amendments to this Agreement \n     shall be in writing duly signed by authorized representatives \n     of the parties hereto.\n       2. If one or more provisions of this Agreement becomes \n     invalid, or the Agreement is proven to be incomplete, the \n     validity and legality of the remaining provisions hereof \n     shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The parties hereto \n     agree to substitute the invalid part of this Agreement by \n     such a legally valid provision which constitutes the closest \n     representation of the parties' intention and the economical \n     purpose of the invalid term, and the parties hereto further \n     agree to be bound by such a valid term. An incompleteness of \n     this Agreement shall be bridged in a similar fashion.\n       3. The Parties hereto submit to the jurisdiction and venue \n     of the courts of Frankfurt/M.\n       4. This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted and \n     construed in accordance with German law.\n\n       What are the main features of the International Agreement?\n\n       1. The parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree to apply \n     German Data Protectional Law to their handling of \n     cardholders' data (Sec. 1).\n       2. Customer data may only be processed in the United States \n     for the purpose of producing the cards (Sec. 2).\n       3. Citibank in the United States and in Europe is not \n     allowed to transfer personal data to third parties for \n     marketing purposes except in two cases:\n       (a) Data of applicants for a RailwayCard with payment \n     function may be transferred to other Citibank companies in \n     order to market financial services; (b) Data of applicants \n     for a pure RailwayCard may only be used or transferred for \n     BahnCard marketing purposes, i.e., to try to convince the \n     cardholder that he should upgrade his RailwayCard to have a \n     ``better BahnCard'' with credit card function (Sec. 4 II).\n       4. The technical requirements on data security according to \n     German law are spelt out in detail in Sec. 5.\n       5. The American Citibank subsidiary has to appoint data \n     protection supervisors again following the German legal \n     requirements (Sec. 6).\n       6. The German card customers have all individual rights \n     against the American Citibank subsidiary which they have \n     under German law. They can ask for inspection, claim \n     deletion, correction or blocking of their data and they can \n     bring an action for compensation under the strict liability \n     rules of German law either against German Railway, the German \n     Citibank subsidiary or directly against the American Citibank \n     subsidiary (Sec. 8).\n       7. The Citibank subsidiaries in the United States accept \n     on-site audits by the German data protection supervisory \n     authority, i.e., the Berlin Data Protection Commissioner, or \n     his nominated agents, e.g. an American consulting or auditing \n     firm acting on his behalf (Sec. 10 II).\n       This very important provision contains a restriction in \n     case US authorities instruct Citibank in their country not to \n     allow foreign auditors in. However, this restriction is not \n     very likely to become practical. On the contrary, US \n     authorities have already declared by way of a diplomatic note \n     sent to the German side that they will accept these audits. \n     This follows an agreement between German and United States \n     banking supervisory authorities on auditing the trans-border \n     processing of accounting data (cf.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor an election for special tax treatment of certain S corporation \nconversions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nelection for special tax treatment of certain s corporation conversions\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Enzi in \nintroducing legislation that will give small businesses more \nflexibility in how they choose to operate.\n\n  One of the most important decisions for the founder of a business is \n``choice of entity,'' whether to operate the business through a \ncorporation, partnership, limited liability company or other form of \nbusiness. This choice is plainly important for reaching business goals, \nand may be critical to the survival of the business. For the family \nbusiness, the choice also is inseparable from the owner's preferences \nas to how the owner wants to relate to family co-owners. Choice of \nentity is therefore potentially one of the most important decisions for \nan owner.\n  The law concerning choice of entity has changed enormously in the \nlast decade, particularly with the widespread adoption of laws \nauthorizing the limited liability company (LLC). As a result, business \nowners have more flexibility in this area than ever before. Even so, \nolder family businesses operated as S corporations may be ``locked'' \ninto the corporate form, simply because of the tax cost of changing to \nanother form. These businesses are thus unable to take advantages of \nthe recent advancements in choice of entity.\n  In order to help these older businesses remain competitive with their \nyounger rivals, the bill Senator Enzi and I introduce today will allow \na one-time election for an S corporation to change to another form of \nbusiness without incurring the normal tax cost of doing so.\n  Thousands of corporations have elected subchapter S status since \nPresident Eisenhower signed into law the Technical Amendments Act of \n1958, which added subchapter S to the code. The legislative history \nmakes clear that the purpose of subchapter S was to offer simplified \ntax rules for the small and family-owned business operating in the \ncorporate form.\n  Until the rise of the LLC in the mid 1990's, the S corporation \nremained, for all practical purposes, the sole means for a small or \nfamily business to obtain the benefits of limited liability without the \ncomplex corporate tax. For many years, a change to another form of \nbusiness was relatively easy. But by the time an alternative to the S \ncorporation became widely available, this avenue had been foreclosed by \nchanges to the tax code. Thus thousands of S corporations are saddled \nwith the cumbersome and inflexible rules of the corporate form.\n  The Internal Revenue Code itself reflects a policy of respecting \neconomic reality over form in the conduct of a trade or business. For \nexample, Section 1031, which existed even in 1939, allows \nnonrecognition of gain or loss in the exchange of property used in a \ntrade or business, or for investment, on the theory that the taxpayer \nhas not cashed out his investment. Code Sections 351 and 721 allow \nnonrecognition on the contribution of property to a corporation or a \npartnership, on the rationale that the taxpayer is only changing the \nform of his investment.\n  The S election itself was a giant stride in removing tax \nconsiderations in choice of entity. More recently, the Internal Revenue \nService has done much to remove tax considerations from the choice of \nbusiness form through the check the box regulations.\n\n[[Page S14552]]\n\nThe Service should be commended for taking this step.\n  The next step in the process is allowing those S corporations that \ncan more efficiently function as an LLC the one-time chance to make the \nconversion, without tax cost being the controlling factor. Until these \nconversions can be accomplished, the task of reducing the role of taxes \nin choosing a business form will remain unfinished.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Roth and the other members of \nthe Senate Finance Committee so we may take action on this measure as \nsoon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1905. A bill to establish a program to provide for a reduction in \nthe incidence and prevalence of Lyme disease; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  the lyme disease initiative of 1999\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is with great enthusiasm that \nI rise today to join my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Christopher Dodd, in introducing the Lyme Disease \nInitiative of 1999. This legislation is aimed at waging a comprehensive \nfight against Lyme disease--America's most common tick-borne illness.\n  I know that Mr. Dodd shares my sentiments in believing that this \nlegislation could not be more timely or necessary. Lyme remains the 2nd \nfastest growing infectious disease in this country after AIDS. The \nnumber of annually reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States \nhas increased about 25-fold since national surveillance began in 1982, \nand an average of approximately 12,500 cases annually were reported by \nstates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from \n1993-1997.\n  Every summer, tens of thousands of Americans enjoying or working in \nthe outdoors are bitten by ticks. While most will experience no medical \nproblems, others are not so lucky--including the 16,801 Americans who \ncontracted Lyme disease last year.\n  According to some estimates, Lyme disease costs our nation $1 billion \nto $2 billion in medical costs annually. The number of confirmed cases \nof Lyme disease in 1998 increased 31.2 percent from the previous year--\nand that is only the tip of the iceberg. Many experts believe the \nofficial statistics understate the true number of Lyme disease cases by \nas much as ten or twelve-fold, because Lyme disease can be so difficult \nto diagnose.\n  And Lyme is a disease that does not discriminate. Persons of all ages \nand both genders are equally susceptible, although among the highest \nattack rates are in children aged 0-14 years.\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative is a five year, $125 million blueprint \nfor attacking the disease on all fronts. In addition to authorizing the \nnecessary resources to wage this war, this legislation outlines a \npublic health management plan to make the most of our efforts on all \nfronts to combat Lyme disease:\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative makes the development of better detection \ntests for Lyme disease the highest research priority;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative sets goals for public health agencies, \nincluding a 33 percent reduction in Lyme disease within five years of \nenactment in the ten states with the highest rates;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative fosters better coordination between the \nscattered Lyme disease programs within the federal government through a \nfive year, joint-agency plan of action;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative helps protect workers and visitors at \nfederally-owned lands in endemic areas through a system of periodic, \nstandardized, and publicly accessible Lyme disease risk assessments;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative requires a review of current Lyme disease \nprevention and surveillance efforts to search for areas of improvement;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative fosters additional research into other \nrelated tick-borne illnesses so that the problem of co-infection can be \naddressed;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative initiates a plan to boost public and \nphysician understanding about Lyme disease;\n  The Lyme Disease Initiative creates a Lyme Disease Task Force to \nprovide Americans with the opportunity to hold our public health \nofficials accountable as they accomplish these tasks.\n  This legislation is the product of countless meetings that Senator \nDodd and I have had with patients and families struggling to cope with \nthis debilitating disease. Although Lyme disease can be treated \nsuccessfully in the early stages with antibiotics, sadly, the lack of \nphysician knowledge about Lyme disease and the inadequacies of existing \nlaboratory detection tests compound the physical suffering, which can \ninclude damage to the nervous system, skin, and joints and other \nsignificant health complications where patients go undetected, and \nhence untreated. Patients relate heart breaking stories about visiting \nmultiple doctors without getting an accurate diagnosis, undergoing \nunnecessary tests while getting progressively weaker and sicker --and \nracking massive medical bills in the process.\n  Although Lyme disease poses many challenges, they are challenges the \nmedical research community is well equipped to meet. This legislation \nwill enhance efforts to discover new information on and establish \ntreatment protocols for Lyme disease. Thanks to the scientific research \nbeing conducted here in the United States and around the world, new and \npromising research is already accumulating at a rapid pace. We have a \nunique opportunity to help re-build the shattered lives of Lyme victims \nand their families, and I look forward to working with Senator Dodd, my \ncolleagues, and the administration to accomplish this worthy public \nhealth goal.\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Santorum \nin introducing The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999, companion \nlegislation to a bill introduced by Representative Christopher Smith of \nNew Jersey. The objective of this bill is simple--to put us on the path \ntoward eradicating Lyme disease--a disease that is still unfamiliar to \nsome Americans, but one that those of us from Connecticut and the \nNortheast know all too well.\n  Last Congress I was pleased to introduce similar legislation, The \nLyme Disease Initiative of 1998, and to see a critical component of \nthat legislation enacted into law. Through an amendment that I offered \nto the FY 1999 Department of Defense (DoD) appropriations bill, an \nadditional $3 million was directed toward the DoD's Lyme disease \nresearch efforts. This was an important step in the fight to increase \nour understanding of this condition, but clearly much more remains to \nbe done.\n  Almost every resident of my state has witnessed firsthand the \ndevastating impact that this disease can have on its victims. As most \nof my constituents know, Lyme disease is a ``home-grown'' illness--it \nfirst achieved prominence in the 1980s in the state of Connecticut and \ngot its name from the town of Lyme, CT. And today, Connecticut \nresidents have the dubious distinction of being 10 times more likely to \ncontract Lyme disease than the rest of the nation.\n  To begin to address this crisis, this legislation would establish a \nfive-year, $125 million blueprint for attacking the disease on all \nfronts by bolstering funding for better detection, prevention, \nsurveillance, and public and physician education. Additionally, this \nlegislation would require the primary federal agencies involved in Lyme \ndisease research and education to substantially improve the \ncoordination of their efforts, in an effort to minimize duplication and \nto enhance federal leadership.\n  In my opinion, money to fund Lyme disease research and public \neducation is money well spent. Studies indicate that long-term \ntreatment of infected individuals often exceeds $100,000 per person--a \nphenomenal cost to society. Health problems experienced by those \ninfected can include facial paralysis, joint swelling, loss of \ncoordination, irregular heart-beat, liver malfunction, depression, and \nmemory loss. Because Lyme disease mimics other conditions, patients \noften must visit multiple doctors before a proper diagnosis is made. \nThis results in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, costly \nand futile treatments, and devastating emotional consequences for \nvictims and their families.\n  Tragically, the number of Lyme disease cases reported to the CDC has \nsky-\n\n[[Page S14553]]\n\nrocketed--from 500 in 1982 to 17,000 in 1998. In the last year alone, \nthe number of infected individuals rose 25%. And these cases represent \nonly the tip of the iceberg. Several new reports have found that the \nactual incidence of the disease may be ten times greater than current \nfigures suggest.\n  While continuing to fight for additional funding for research into \nthis disease, it is also critical that we ensure that current and \nfuture federal resources for Lyme disease are used wisely and in the \nbest interest of the individuals and families affected by this \ncondition. To that end, I intend to ask the General Accounting Office \nto review current federal funding priorities for Lyme disease.\n  I truly look forward to the day when Lyme disease no longer plagues \nour nation and view The Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999 as a critical \nstep toward that goal. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1906. A bill to amend Public Law 104-307 to extend the expiration \ndate of the authority to sell certain aircraft for use in wildfire \nsuppression, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n     wildfire suppression aircraft transfer act of 1996 extension \n                              legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Airplanes, known as airtankers, play a \ncritical role in fighting wildfires. They are used in the initial \nattack of wildfires in support of firefighters on the ground and, on \nlarge wildfires, to aid in the protection of lives and structures from \nrapidly advancing fires.\n  Today, Senators Allard, Craig and I are introducing legislation that \nwill help ensure that Federal firefighters continue to have access to \nairtanker services. This technical amendment will extend the expiration \ndate of the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996 from \nSeptember 30, 2000 to September 30, 2005. The regulations under the act \nare still being finalized, so no aircraft have yet been transferred. \nExtending the 1996 act is critical to help facilitate the sale of \nformer military aircraft to contractors who provide firefighting \nservices to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior. The \nexisting fleet of available airtankers is aging rapidly, and fleet \nmodernization is critical to the continued success of the firefighting \nprogram.\n  This bill will extend legislative authority to transfer or sell \nexcess turbine-powered military aircraft suitable for conversion to \nairtankers. If we fail to pass this extension, airtanker operators will \nnot have access to the planes they need to update the aging airtanker \nfleet. The Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996 required \nthat the aircraft be used only for firefighting activities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to ensure that Federal \nfirefighters have the resources they need to protect the public and \ntheir property from the threat of wildfires.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 2 of the Wildlife Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act \n     of 1996 (Public Law No. 104-307) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(1) by striking ``September 30, 2000'' \n     and inserting ``September 30, 2005'';\n       (2) in subsection (d)(2)(C), by striking ``and'' at the \n     end;\n       (3) in subsection (d)(2)(D), by striking the period at the \n     end and inserting ``; and'';\n       (4) in subsection (d)(2), by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(E) be in effect until September 30, 2005''; and\n       (5) in subsection (f), by striking ``March 31, 2000'' and \n     inserting ``March 31, 2005''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Kennedy) (by request):\n  S. 1907. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination against parents \nand those with parental responsibilities, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           ending discrimination against parents act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``the Ending \nDiscrimination Against Parents Act of 1999,'' on behalf of President \nClinton, to prohibit employment discrimination against private and \npublic employees because they are parents. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Kennedy in this effort.\n\n  Mr. President, today more than ever parents work. One may argue \nwhether it is right or wrong--but the facts are clear. In 1998, 38 \npercent of all U.S. workers had children under the age of 18. Nearly \none in five working parents is a single parent; moreover, a fifth of \nthese are single fathers. Labor force participation has also increased \nin two parent families, with both parents often holding down jobs.\n  Clearly, this has revolutionized our culture. Child care is a \nconstant personal as well as public policy issue. Grocery stores and \nother retailers are open later--many catalogues offer round the clock \nservice via the telephone or Internet. Take out meals and delivered \npizza, which in the past were often reserved as a special weekend \ntreat, are now commonplace on week nights. Cellular telephone companies \neven offer special family plans with unlimited calling among family \nmembers, for those families entirely on the go.\n  Workplaces too have changed. Women and men work side by side in \nnearly every occupation. Many employers attract workers with on-site \nday care, flexible work arrangements and generous family leave. Take \nYour Daughter to work day has introduced millions of girls and boys to \nthe world of work.\n  But not all change has come easy. Many parents have made agonizing \nchoices about work and family. Some have chosen to scale back their \ncareers, move to less demanding jobs, pursue part-time work, or take a \nfew years off. Others have continued in their careers without \ninterruption relying on committed child care or the support of a \npartner. Each working parent has come to their own decision about how \nto move forward in their jobs and in their role as parents. And most \nemployers are supportive of these decisions. They recognize that good \nemployees are good employees regardless of their status as parents.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not about these employers. \nFrankly, it is not even about encouraging, much less requiring, work \nplace accommodations of parents and their family obligations--as much \nas I support those efforts. It is, instead, about those hopefully rare \ncases where employers discriminate in their employment practices \nagainst parents. It is about eliminating bias not about guaranteeing \naccommodation.\n  Specifically, the proposed statute would include parental status as a \nprotected class with respect to employment discrimination. Parental \nstatus would cover parents of children under 18 years of age and \nchildren who remain under parental supervision because of a mental or \nphysical disability, as well as those seeking legal custody of children \nand those who stand ``in loco parentis.'' The legislation would bar \ndiscrimination against parents in all aspects of employment, including \nrecruitment, referral, hiring, promotions, discharge, training and \nother terms and conditions of employment.\n  For example, this legislation would make illegal policies against \nhiring single parents. Employers would be prohibited from taking a \nmother or a father off a career-advancing path out of a belief that \nparents uniformly cannot meet the requirements of these jobs. Neither \ncould employers hire less qualified non-parents over parents because of \nunfounded concerns about parents. Basic discrimination against parents \nwould be barred.\n  I want to be very clear, Mr. President, this legislation does not \nrelease working parents from any job performance requirements. \nEmployers are free to make decisions based on an employee's job \nperformance or ability to meet job requirements or qualifications--no \nmatter what that employee's parental status is. Thus, an employer may \ndiscipline an employee who is late because of childcare issues. \nSimilarly, an employer may reject an applicant for a job that requires \nextensive travel if that applicant is unwilling to travel because of \nhis or her parental responsibilities. What the bill would prohibit\n\n[[Page S14554]]\n\nis rejection of an applicant who is willing to travel based simply on \nthe assumption that he or she, as a parent, will be unable to fulfill \nthat commitment.\n  Mr. President, this is unfortunately not a new problem for parents. \nSeveral states, including Alaska, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, \nand South Dakota, and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that \nprohibit discrimination based on parental or familial status. There \nhave also been several federal cases filed under gender discrimination \nstatutes that have found discrimination based on parental status. In \none case, an employer transferred a new mother recently back to work \nfrom maternity leave into a lower paying job, not based on her request \nor her performance, but because the employer simply felt it better \nsuited a new mother. Beyond anecdotes and a few court cases, it is \ndifficult to gauge the extent of this problem--rare or common--given \nthe extremely limited avenues of redress open to parents currently.\n  But no matter how rare--if it happens just once it is wrong. And \nworking parents deserve better. This legislation makes sure they get \nit. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ending Discrimination \n     Against Parents Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) In 1998, thirty-eight percent of all United States \n     workers had children under 18.\n       (b) The vast majority of Americans with children under 18 \n     are employed.\n       (c) Federal law protects working parents from employment \n     discrimination in a number of important areas. For instance, \n     title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits \n     discrimination against workers on the basis of sex; the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 prohibits \n     discrimination against workers on the basis of disability; \n     and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits \n     discrimination against workers on the basis of pregnancy. \n     Also, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 provides \n     covered workers with job protection when they take time off \n     for certain family responsibilities.\n       (d) However, no existing Federal statute protects all \n     workers from employment discrimination on the basis of their \n     status as parents.\n       (e) Such discrimination against parents occurs where, for \n     example, employers refuse to hire or promote both men and \n     women who are parents based on unwarranted stereotypes or \n     overbroad assumptions about their level of commitment to the \n     work force.\n       (f) Such discrimination has occurred in the workplace and \n     has been largely unremedied.\n       (g) Such discrimination occurs in both the private and the \n     public sectors.\n       (h) Such discrimination--\n       (1) reduces the income earned by families who rely on the \n     wages of working parents to make ends meet;\n       (2) prevents the best use of available labor resources;\n       (3) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of several States;\n       (4) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (5) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce; and\n       (6) leads to labor disputes burdening an obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce.\n       (i) Elimination of such discrimination would have positive \n     effects, including--\n       (1) solving problems in the economy created by unfair \n     discrimination against parents;\n       (2) promoting stable families by enabling working parents \n     to work free from discrimination against parents; and\n       (3) remedying the effects of past discrimination against \n     parents.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (a) to prohibit employers, employment agencies, and labor \n     organizations from discriminating against parents and persons \n     with parental responsibilities based on the assumption that \n     they cannot satisfy the requirements of a particular \n     position; and\n       (b) to provide meaningful and effective remedies for \n     employment discrimination against parents and persons with \n     parental responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to protect students from commercial exploitation; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     Student Privacy Protection Act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation, ``the \nStudent Privacy Protection Act,'' to provide parents and their children \nwith modest, but appropriate, privacy protection from questionable \nmarketing research in the schools.\n  There are few images as enduring as those we experienced as school-\nchildren: the teachers and chalkboards, the principal's office, \nchildren at play during recess, school libraries, and desks organized \naround a room. All define a school in our memories and continue to \ndefine schools today. Clearly, there have been changes and many of \nthose for the good. Computers have become more common and are now in a \nmajority of classrooms. Students with disabilities are routinely \nincluded in regular classes rather than segregated in separate \nclassrooms or schools.\n  However, some changes in my view have not been for the best. More and \nmore schools and their classrooms are becoming commercialized. Schools, \nteachers and their students are daily barraged with commercial messages \naimed at influencing the buying habits of children and their parents. A \n1997 study from Texas A, estimated that children, aged 4-12 years, \nspent more than $24 billion themselves and influenced their parents to \nspend $187 billion. Marketing to children and youth is particularly \npowerful however, because students are not just current consumers, they \nwill be consumers for decades to come. And just as we hope that what \nstudents learn in schools stays with them, marketers know their \nmessages stick--be it drinking Coke or Pepsi, or wearing Nikes or \nReeboks, these habits continue into adulthood.\n  There is no question that advertising is everywhere in our society \nfrom billboards to bathroom stalls. But what is amazing is how \nprevalent it has become in our schools. Companies no longer just \nfinance the local school's scoreboard or sponsor a little league team, \nmajor national companies advertise in school hallways, in classrooms, \non the fields and, even, in curriculum which they have developed \nspecifically to get their messages into classrooms. One major spaghetti \nsauce firm has encouraged science teachers to have their student test \ndifferent sauces for thickness as part of their science classes. Film \nmakers and television studios promote new releases with special \ncurriculum tied to their movies or shows. In one school, a student was \nsuspended for wearing a Pepsi T-shirt on the school's Coke Day. In \nanother, credit card applications were sent home with elementary school \nstudents for their parents and the school collected a fee for every \nfamily that signed up.\n  Mr. President, this is not to say that companies cannot and should \nnot be active partners in our schools. Indeed, business leaders have \nbeen some of the strongest advocates for school improvement. Many \ncorporations partner with schools to contribute to the educational \nmission of the schools, be it through mentoring programs or through \ndonations of technology. Other businesses have become well-known for \ntheir scholarship support of promising students. And one cannot imagine \na successful, relevant vocational education program without the \nparticipation of business.\n  Each of these activities meets the central test of contributing to \nstudent learning. Unfortunately, too much commercial activity in our \nschools does not. These issues are not black and white. Channel One \nwhich is in many, many of our nation's secondary schools offers high \nquality programming on the news of the day and issues of importance. \nThey provide televisions, VCR's, and satellite dishes along with other \nsignificant educational programming. But Channel One is a business; in \nexchange for all that is good comes advertising.\n  Teachers, principals and parents are on the front lines of this \nissue; each day making decisions on what goes in and what stays out of \nclassrooms. In my view, too often these decisions are made in the face \nof very limited resources. I believe most educators recognize the \npotential down-sides of exposing children to commercial messages--but \ntoo often they have no choice. They are faced with two poor choices: \nprovide computers, current events or other activities with corporate \nadvertising or not at all.\n  The legislation I offer today does not second guess these hard \ndecisions. This bill, which is a companion to legislation introduced in \nthe other body by Congressman George Miller, would prohibit schools \nfrom letting students participate in various forms of market research \nwithout their parents' written permission. This bill would also provide \nfor a study of the extent and effect of commercialism in our schools.\n  This is, I believe, a modest proposal that deals with one of the most \ndisturbing commercial trends in our schools. Existing school privacy \nlaws protect official records and educational research. Current law \nleaves a loophole for companies to go into classroom and get \ninformation directly from children--information about family income, \nbuying habits, preferences, etc. --without the consent of their \nparents. Marketers and advertisers use this information to target and \nbetter hone their message to reach youngsters and their families.\n  This is not some scenario from a science fiction novel. Elementary \nschool students in New Jersey filled out a 27-page booklet called ``My \nAll About Me Journal'' as part of a marketing survey for a cable \ntelevision channel. A technology firm provides schools with free \ncomputers and Internet access, but monitors students' web activity by \nage, gender and ZIP code. Children in a Massachusetts school did a \ncereal taste test and answered an opinion poll. This legislation does \nnot presume that these activities are bad or unrelated to learning--it \nsimply requires parents give their permission before their children \nparticipate.\n  Mr. President, public education is not a new topic for discussion \nhere on the Senate floor. But we rarely think about the actual words we \nuse--``Public education''--and what they mean. These are schools that \nbelong to us, to the public as a whole: schools that serve all \nchildren, schools that are the central element in their communities, \nand that are financed by all of us through our taxes--local, state and \nfederal. This bill helps ensure that they remain true to their name.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1908\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the preparation of a Governmental \nreport detailing injustices suffered by Italian Americans during World \nWar II, and a formal acknowledgment of such injustices by the \nPresident; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       wartime violation of italian american civil liberties act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nis important not only to every American of Italian descent, but to any \nAmerican citizen who values our Constitutional freedoms. This \nlegislation draws attention to the plight of Italian Americans during \nWorld War II. Their story has received little attention until now, and \nI am pleased to be able to heighten public awareness about the \ninjustices they suffered.\n  Hours after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation arrested 250 Italian Americans and \nshipped them to internment camps in Montana and Ellis Island. These men \nhad done nothing wrong. Their only crime was their Italian heritage and \nthe suspicion that they could be dangerous during war time. By 1942, \nall Italian immigrants, approximately 600,000 people, were labeled \n``enemy aliens'' and given photo IDs which they had to carry at all \ntimes. They could travel no further than five miles from their homes \nand were required to turn in all cameras, flashlights and weapons.\n  These violations did not discriminate against class or social status. \nIn San Francisco, Joe DiMaggio's parents were forbidden to go further \nthan five miles from their home without a permit. Even Enrico Fermi, a \nleading Italian physicist who was instrumental in America's development \nof the atomic bomb, could not travel freely along the East Coast. Yet, \nwhile these activities persisted in the United States, Italian \nAmericans comprised the largest ethnic group in the Armed Forces. \nDuring the war, Italian Americans fought valiantly to defend the \nfreedoms that their loved ones were being denied at home.\n  These are the stories we know about and the facts which have come to \nlight. Yet more than fifty years after the end of World War II, the \nAmerican people still do not know the details of the Italian American \ninternment, and the American government has yet to acknowledge that \nthese events ever took place. Through this legislation, the \nAdministration will be required to report on the extent to which civil \nliberties were violated. The Justice Department would conduct a \ncomprehensive review of the Italian American internment, and report its \nfindings, including the name of every person taken into custody, \ninterned, or arrested. The specific injustices they suffered in camps \nand jail cells would also be detailed in the report. Moreover, federal \nagencies, from the Department of Education to the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities, would be encouraged to support projects like ``Una \nStoria Segreta'' that draw attention to this episode of American \nhistory.\n  The United States has rightfully admitted its error in interning \nJapanese Americans. However, Americans of Italian descent suffered \nequal hardships and this same recognition has been denied to them. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to secure passage of this \nlegislation so that the United States government will begin to release \nthe facts about this era. Only then can Italian Americans begin to come \nto terms with the treatment they received during World War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Violation of Italian \n     American Civil Liberties Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The freedom of more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     immigrants in the United States and their families was \n     restricted during World War II by Government measures that \n     branded them ``enemy aliens'' and included carrying \n     identification cards, travel restrictions, and seizure of \n     personal property.\n       (2) During World War II more than 10,000 Italian Americans \n     living on the West Coast were forced to leave their homes and \n     prohibited from entering coastal zones. More than 50,000 were \n     subjected to curfews.\n       (3) During World War II thousands of Italian American \n     immigrants were arrested, and hundreds were interned in \n     military camps.\n       (4) Hundreds of thousands of Italian Americans performed \n     exemplary service and thousands sacrificed their lives in \n     defense of the United States.\n       (5) At the time, Italians were the largest foreign-born \n     group in the United States, and today are the fifth largest \n     immigrant group in the United States, numbering approximately \n     15,000,000.\n       (6) The impact of the wartime experience was devastating to \n     Italian American communities in the United States, and its \n     effects are still being felt.\n       (7) A deliberate policy kept these measures from the public \n     during the war. Even 50 years later much information is still \n     classified, the full story remains unknown to the public, and \n     it has never been acknowledged in any official capacity by \n     the United States Government.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT.\n\n       The Inspector General of the Department of Justice shall \n     conduct a comprehensive review of the treatment by the United \n     States Government of Italian Americans during World War II, \n     and not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act shall submit to the Congress a report that documents the \n     findings of such review. The report shall cover the period \n     between September 1, 1939, and December 31, 1945, and shall \n     include the following:\n       (1) The names of all Italian Americans who were taken into \n     custody in the initial roundup following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor, and prior to the United States declaration of war \n     against Italy.\n       (2) The names of all Italian Americans who were taken into \n     custody.\n       (3) The names of all Italian Americans who were interned \n     and the location where they were interned.\n       (4) The names of all Italian Americans who were ordered to \n     move out of designated areas under the United States Army's \n     ``Individual Exclusion Program''.\n       (5) The names of all Italian Americans who were arrested \n     for curfew, contraband, or other violations under the \n     authority of Executive Order 9066.\n       (6) Documentation of Federal Bureau of Investigation raids \n     on the homes of Italian Americans.\n       (7) A list of ports from which Italian American fishermen \n     were restricted.\n       (8) The names of Italian American fishermen who were \n     prevented from fishing in prohibited zones and therefore \n     unable to pursue their livelihoods.\n       (9) The names of Italian Americans whose boats were \n     confiscated.\n       (10) The names of Italian American railroad workers who \n     were prevented from working in prohibited zones.\n       (11) A list of all civil liberties infringements suffered \n     by Italian Americans during World War II, as a result of \n     Executive Order 9066, including internment, hearings without \n     benefit of counsel, illegal searches and seizures, travel \n     restrictions, enemy alien registration requirements, \n     employment restrictions, confiscation of property, and forced \n     evacuation from homes.\n       (12) An explanation of why some Italian Americans were \n     subjected to civil liberties infringements, as a result of \n     Executive Order 9066, while other Italian Americans were not.\n       (13) A review of the wartime restrictions on Italian \n     Americans to determine how civil liberties can be better \n     protected during national emergencies.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the story of the treatment of Italian Americans during \n     World War II needs to be told in order to acknowledge that \n     these events happened, to remember those whose lives were \n     unjustly disrupted and whose freedoms were violated, to help \n     repair the damage to the Italian American community, and to \n     discourage the occurrence of similar injustices and \n     violations of civil liberties in the future;\n       (2) Federal agencies, including the Department of Education \n     and the National Endowment for the Humanities, should support \n     projects such as--\n       (A) conferences, seminars, and lectures to heighten \n     awareness of this unfortunate chapter in our Nation's \n     history;\n       (B) the refurbishment of and payment of all expenses \n     associated with the traveling exhibit ``Una Storia Segreta'', \n     exhibited at\n\n[[Page S14558]]\n\n     major cultural and educational institutions throughout the \n     United States; and\n       (C) documentaries to allow this issue to be presented to \n     the American public to raise its awareness;\n       (3) an independent, volunteer advisory committee should be \n     established comprised of representatives of Italian American \n     organizations, historians, and other interested individuals \n     to assist in the compilation, research, and dissemination of \n     information concerning the treatment of Italian Americans; \n     and\n       (4) after completion of the report required by this Act, \n     financial support should be provided for the education of the \n     American public through the production of a documentary film \n     suited for public broadcast.\n\n     SEC. 5. FORMAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.\n\n       The United States Government formally acknowledges that \n     these events during World War II represented a fundamental \n     injustice against Italian Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1910. A bill to amend the Act establishing Women's Rights National \nHistorical Park to permit the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \ntitle in fee simple to the Hunt House located in Waterloo, New York; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             hunt house purchase authorization legislation\n\n   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize the Secretary of the Interior to purchase the Hunt \nHouse in Seneca Falls, New York. This summer the owners of the Hunt \nHouse put it on the market for $135,000. Of four historic buildings in \nSeneca Falls that should be part of the Women's Rights National \nHistorical Park, the Hunt House is the only one that is not. It was the \nsite of the gathering of five women (the founding mothers, you might \nsay) who decided to hold the Nation's first women's rights convention. \nThat convention took place in Seneca Falls in July, 1848. The Women's \nRights Park is a monument to the idea they espoused that summer, that \nwomen should have equal rights with men; one of the most influential \nideas of the last 150 years.\n  Adding the Hunt House to the Park would complete it. The problem is \nthat the Department was not given the authorization to purchase the \nHunt House in the bill I offered 20 years ago so that speculation would \nnot drive up the price of the house when it eventually went on the \nmarket. That worked. But now the lack of an authorization should not \nkeep us from being able to acquire the house at all. This bill simply \nremoves the restriction against a fee simple purchase by the Park \nService. I hope my colleagues will offer their support, and I ask that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ACQUISITION OF HUNT HOUSE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1601(d) of Public Law 97-607 (94 \n     Stat. 3547; 16 U.S.C. 410ll(d)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence--\n       (A) by inserting a period after ``park''; and\n       (B) by striking the remainder of the sentence; and\n       (2) by striking the last sentence.\n       (b) Technical Corrections.--Section 1601(c)(8) of Public \n     Law 97-607 (94 Stat. 3547; 16 U.S.C. 410ll(c)(8)) is amended \n     by striking ``Williams'' and inserting ``Main''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Shelby, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Sessions, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1911. A bill to conserve Atlantic highly migratory species of \nfish, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                 ATLANTIC HIGHLY MIGRATORY SPECIES ACT\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to send to the desk a \nbill that is called the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Act of 1999. \nThe legislation cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Hollings, Shelby, Kerry, \nSessions and Landrieu results from a far reaching conservation \nagreement among four key recreational and commercial fishing \norganizations. These organizations include the Billfish Foundation, the \nCoastal Conservation Association, the American Sportfishing Association \nand the Blue Water Fishermen's Association.\n  The legislation will prohibit pelagic long line fishing for \ndesignated months each year in U.S. waters determined to be swordfish \nnursery and billfish bycatch areas based on extensive analyses of the \nbest available science. Based upon the effectiveness of this type of \nmanagement strategy in other U.S. fisheries, I am optimistic about the \nbenefits that can come from the legislation.\n  Mr. President, the legislation has three major components that I \nwould like to briefly outline.\n  First, the bill would prohibit pelagic longline fishing for certain \nmonths each year in U.S. waters where swordfish and billfish are caught \nwith other fish. Essentially, more than 160,000 square nautical miles \nin the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico would become a conservation \narea to rebuild populations of swordfish, sailfish, tuna, marlin and \nsharks.\n  Recognizing the economic impact on commercial fishermen, the \nlegislation provides a fair and equitable program for longline vessel \nowners who are adversely impacted by the fishing prohibition. Funding \nof the permit buyback program would come through a partnership of the \nrecreational and commercial fishing industries and federal funds.\n  The bill also directs the National Marine Fisheries Service to \nconduct a comprehensive research program in cooperation with the U.S. \nlongline fleet to identify and test a variety of longline gear \nconfigurations to determine which are the most effective at reducing \nbillfish bycatch in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.\n  I believe that a true solution to the bycatch issue will require \ninternational cooperation. Ironically, next week the U.S. Commissioners \nto the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas \n(ICCAT) will be meeting in Brazil to consider many challenging issues, \nincluding a rebuilding plan for the north Atlantic stock of swordfish.\n  Under the bill we introduce today, we are taking a bold first step to \naddress the problems in our own coastal waters. I am confident that \nthis first step will serve as an example to the international community \non focusing much needed attention to this important issue.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Breaux, in introducing the Atlantic Highly Migratory \nSpecies Conservation Act of 1999. I am pleased to co-sponsor this \nlegislative effort to promote conservation and bycatch reduction of \nsmall swordfish, billfish, and other highly migratory species.\n  The Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Conservation Act would create \ntime-area closures for pelagic longline fishing along 160,000 miles of \nthe Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico coasts. These closures include the \nthree major spawning areas where a significant portion of juvenile \nswordfish and billfish bycatch mortality occurs. I am particularly \npleased to see that these closures encompass the coastal waters of my \nhome state of South Carolina and particularly a highly productive \nswordfish spawning and nursery ground, the Charleston Bump. In \nconjunction with the closures, the bill would reduce fishing capacity \nby retiring approximately 68 longline vessels from the commercial \nfishery through a fair and equitable program funded by the federal \ngovernment and the recreational and commercial fishing industries. In \naddition, the Act would establish a research program, in conjunction \nwith the National Marine Fisheries Service, to study longline gear and \npotential gear improvements. All too frequently we are forced to make \nfisheries management decisions with too little information; these \nresearch provisions will provide data crucial for management of highly \nmigratory species.\n  The current proposal results from arduous work and negotiation among \ncommercial and recreational fishing groups including the Coastal \nConservation Association, the American Sportsfishing Association, the \nBillfish Foundation, and the Blue Water Fisherman's Association. I \ncommend these groups for their cooperation in developing this truly \nconstructive conservation plan based on extensive analyses of the best \navailable science. I also approve of their effort to make this bill \nconsistent with the principles governing capacity reduction established \nin the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.\n  The introduction of the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species \nConservation Act of 1999 couldn't come at a better time. Many of the \nhighly migratory\n\n[[Page S14559]]\n\nspecies, including North Atlantic swordfish, are currently overfished. \nThe National Marine Fisheries Service reports that billfish and some \nshark and tuna species are at all-time lows in abundance as a result of \nlongline fishing bycatch and widespread disregard for international \nrules by commercial fishermen of other nations. The international \nmanagement body for highly migratory species, the International \nCommission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), recently \nexpressed concern about the high catches and discards of small \nswordfish and emphasized that future gains in yield could accrue if \nfishing mortality on small fish could be reduced. Further, ICCAT \nencouraged member nations to consider alternative methods such as time/\narea closures to aid rebuilding of highly migratory stocks. I commend \nSenator Breaux for attempting to establish such areas domestically, and \nhope that we can serve as a model for other nations.\n  While this legislation can result in important conservation \nachievements, we must also employ other means to protect and rebuild \nour highly migratory species such as swordfish. Next week, ICCAT will \nconvene in Rio de Janero, Brazil to determine new international \nmanagement measures for Atlantic swordfish. The United States must \nsupplement Senator Breaux's proposal by securing an agreement at ICCAT \nthat will reduce catches by all member nations sufficient to allow the \nNorth Atlantic swordfish population to recover within ten years or \nless--a goal that scientists tell us can only be achieved if we count \ndiscarded dead swordfish against the catch quotas. In addition, I am \ncertain that Senator Breaux's effort to reduce bycatch and establish \ntime-area closures will serve as a powerful example to the \ninternational community of a responsible method for sustaining and \nrestoring highly migratory species.\n  I applaud my colleague and the other architects of this ambitious \nconservation effort and look forward to working with Senator Breaux and \nother cosponsors to ensure that this legislation is part of an \neffective national plan that ensures recovery of the North Atlantic \nswordfish stock within 10 years in a manner consistent with the goals \nof the Magnuson-Stevens Act.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill \nintroduced by Mr. Breaux, that is called the Atlantic Highly Migratory \nSpecies Act of 1999.\n  This legislation closes large areas to longline gear, including the \nimportant spawning areas where juvenile bycatch of swordfish and other \nbillfish species are the highest. This legislation will also provide a \nfair and equitable program for longline vessel owners who are adversely \nimpacted by the fishing prohibition. Funding of the permit buyback \nprogram would come through a partnership of the recreational and \ncommercial fishing industries and federal funds. Lastly, this \nlegislation directs the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct a \ncomprehensive research program in cooperation with the U.S. longline \nfleet to identify and test a variety of longline gear configurations to \ndetermine which are the most effective at reducing billfish bycatch in \nthe Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.\n  We are introducing this legislation at an important time. It will \nserve as an example to show the international community at next week's \nnegotiations in Brazil, at the International Commission for the \nConservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), that the U.S. embraces use of \ntime-area closures to help swordfish recover.\n  I believe that this legislation will serve as one prong, of a two-\nprong U.S. strategy in international negotiations on swordfish quotas \nthat ensures the total mortality of swordfish, including discards, is \nlimited to levels that will allow the stock to recover in 10 years.\n  I look forward to working with Mr. Breaux and other cosponsors of the \nbill to ensure that this legislation is both consistent with the \nprinciples of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and part of an effective \nnational plan to ensure recovery of the North Atlantic swordfish stock \nwithin 10 years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1912. A bill to facilitate the growth of electronic commerce and \nenable the electronic commerce market to continue its current growth \nrate and realize its full potential, to signal strong support of the \nelectronic commerce market by promoting its use within Federal \ngovernment agencies and small and medium-sized businesses, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            the electronic commerce technology promotion act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nElectronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act. I am very pleased to be \njoined by Senators McCain and Bingaman.\n  Electronic commerce has fundamentally changed the way we do business, \npromising increased efficiency and improved quality at lower cost. It \nhas been widely embraced by industry, both in the United States and \nabroad. This is evident in the growth of the electronic commerce \nmarket, which though almost non-existent just a few years ago, is \nexpected to top a staggering $1 trillion by 2003, according to market \nresearch reports.\n  The basis for the growth of electronic commerce is the potential that \nelectronic transactions can be completed seamlessly and simultaneously, \nregardless of geographical boundaries. Inherent in this is the ability \nof different systems to communicate and exchange data, commonly \nreferred to as ``system interoperability''. The continued growth of \nglobal electronic commerce depends on a fundamental set of technical \nstandards that enable essential technologies to interoperate, and on a \npolicy and legal framework that supports the development that the \nmarket demands in a timely manner.\n  The United States is leading this global revolution. Our industries \nare at the forefront in every sector, continually evolving their \nbusinesses and developing new technologies to adapt to changing market \nneeds. Continued growth of the overall electronic commerce market is \nvital to our economy as well as the global market.\n  For the electronic commerce market to sustain its current phenomenal \ngrowth rate, companies must be allowed to be agile and flexible in \nresponding to market needs, their activities unfettered by cumbersome \nand static regulations. The federal government must allow the private \nsector to continue to take the lead in developing this dynamic global \nmarket, and refrain from undue regulatory measures wherever possible.\n  At the same time, the federal government must unambiguously signal \nits strong desire to promote and facilitate the growth of the \nelectronic commerce market by adopting and deploying relevant \nelectronic commerce technologies within the federal agencies, as well \nas widely promoting their use by small and medium-sized enterprises.\n  Usage of these technologies in the federal agencies enables us to \nshare in the benefits of the electronic commerce revolution and \nparticipate more effectively as an active contributor in the private \nsector efforts to develop the frameworks and specifications necessary \nfor systems and components to interoperate. This has the added \nadvantage of allowing the government to intercede in a timely manner, \neither in failure conditions or to remove barriers erected by foreign \ngovernments. Furthermore, we would be strengthening our global \nleadership position, while at the same time establishing a model for \nother governments and enabling the growth of the global electronic \ncommerce market.\n  Small and medium-sized businesses have traditionally been the fastest \ngrowing segment of our economy, contributing more than 50 percent of \nthe private sector output in the United States. Electronic commerce has \nthe potential to enable these enterprises to enter the market with \nlower entry costs, yet extend their reach to a much larger market. The \nfederal government has an inherent interest in helping them to maintain \ntheir global competitiveness.\n  It is in response to these needs that I introduce today the \nElectronic Commerce Technology Promotion Act. The legislation \nestablishes a Center of Excellence for Electronic Commerce at the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technologies (NIST) that will act \nas a centralized resource of information for federal agencies and small \nand medium-sized businesses in electronic commerce technologies and \nissues. My\n\n[[Page S14560]]\n\nintention is not to create yet another program at NIST which will \nrequire substantial appropriations, but to create an office that \nfocuses solely on electronic commerce by building upon existing \nexpertise and resources. We have proposed that the Center be organized \nas a matrix organization that will coordinate existing as well as \nfuture activities at the Institute on electronic commerce.\n  The Center will also coordinate its activities with the Department of \nCommerce's Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP) and the Small Business \nAdministration to provide assistance to small and medium-sized \nenterprises on issues related to the deployment and use of electronic \ncommerce technologies, including developing training modules and \nsoftware toolkits. In working jointly, the Center can build upon the \nexisting MEP infrastructure to reach out to these businesses. It is \nimportant to note that my intention is not to enlarge or modify the \ncharter of the MEP program.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the growth of the electronic commerce \nmarket is vital to our economic growth. It is our responsibility to \nfacilitate this growth as well as do our best to enable the market to \nsustain its current phenomenal growth rate. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support timely passage of this legislation so that we can \ngive our unambiguous support for the development of electronic commerce \nas a market-driven phenomenon, and signal our strong desire to promote \nand facilitate the growth of the electronic commerce market.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators Frist \nand McCain today in introducing the ``Electronic Commerce Technology \nPromotion Act.'' This bill, which sets up a center of Excellence in \nElectronic Commerce at the National Institutes of Standards and \nTechnology, or NIST, is a solid step towards adapting an important \nfederal agency to the digital economy we see blooming around us.\n  NIST was established in 1901 as the National Bureau of Standards \nduring a time of tremendous industrial development, when technology \nbecame a key driver of our economic growth. Making those technologies \nliterally fit together reliably through standards became crucial, and \nCongress realized that one key to sustaining our industrial growth and \nthe quality of our products would be a federal laboratory devoted to \ndeveloping standards. The Bureau of Standards is a classic example of \nhow the federal government can support technical progress that \nundergirds economic growth and enables the competitive marketplace to \nwork.\n  Around ten years ago, Congress modified the Bureau's charter in \nresponse to the problems of the 1980's, increasing its focus on \ncompetitiveness, adding efforts like the highly regarded Manufacturing \nExtension Program (MEP), and changing the name to NIST. Turning to the \nchallenges of today's growing digital economy, this bill makes NIST a \nfocal point in the federal government for promoting electronic commerce \nthroughout our economy by establishing a Center of Excellence in \nElectronic Commerce there. While the challenges of making things fit \ntogether in a digital economy are different--and now go under the un-\nmelodic term ``interoperability''--they are just as crucial as they \nwere in the industrial economy of 1901. And, NIST remains an excellent \nplace to lead the work.\n  I'm particularly pleased that this bill includes the fundamental idea \nbehind my bill S. 1494, the Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment \nAct of 1999. That is, NIST ought to lead an electronic commerce \nextension program or service to provide small businesses with low cost, \nimpartial technical advice on how to enter and succeed in e-commerce. \nThis service will help ensure that small businesses in every part of \nthe nation fully participate in the unfolding e-commerce revolution \nthrough a well-proven policy tool--a service analogous to the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service and NIST's \nown MEP. I believe such a service would help both small businesses and \nour entire economy as the productivity enhancements from e-commerce are \nspread more rapidly, and I recently asked Secretary Daley for a report \non how such a service should work. So, I thank Senator Frist for \nincluding my basic policy idea in his bill and look forward to working \nwith him to flesh it out, particularly in light of the report we should \nget from the Commerce Department.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join Senators Frist, McCain, \nand myself in supporting this bill, as one step the Congress can take \nto make sure an important federal agency, NIST, continues its strong \ntradition of helping our economy--our growing digital economy--to be \nthe most competitive in the world.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. McCain (for himself and Mr. Kyl)):\n  S. 1913. A bill to amend the Act entitled ``An act relating to the \nwater rights of the Ak-Chin Indian Community'' to clarify certain \nprovisions concerning the leasing of such water rights, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n       The Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act Amendments of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl, to offer legislation that will make an \nimportant clarification to the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act of \n1984. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Shadegg.\n  Let me explain why this legislation is necessary.\n  In 1992, Congress amended the Ak-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act to \nallow the Ak-Chin Indian Community to enter into leases of the \nCommunity's water for a term not to exceed 100 years. On December 15, \n1994, the Ak-Chin Indian Community entered into an agreement with the \nDel Webb Corporation to allow the company the option to lease up to \n10,000 acre-feet of water for a period of 100 years from the date the \noption was exercised. Del Webb exercised the option on December 6, \n1996, with a principal objective of providing a water supply for its \ndevelopment of a master-planned community in the Phoenix area.\n  However, since 1995, the State of Arizona, through its Department of \nWater Resources, has required certificates of assured water supply for \n100 years for developments within the Phoenix Active Management Area. \nThe 100-year assured water supply requirement is one of the key tenets \nof Arizona's water resource management. A certificate cannot be \nobtained unless a developer demonstrates that sufficient groundwater, \nsurface water or adequate quality effluent will be continuously \navailable to satisfy the proposed use of the development for at least \n100 years.\n  Unfortunately, the lease as signed in 1996 has now matured for three \nyears without the actual application to the Arizona Department of Water \nResources for a certificate of assured water supply. The Arizona \nDepartment of Water Resources advised the company that it interprets \nits regulations to require Del Webb to demonstrate that water leased \nunder the agreement with the Community will be available for a period \nof 100 years from the date each certificate issued. Under ADWR's \ninterpretation, if Del Webb applies for a certificate of assured water \nsupply on December 6, 1999, it must show that water will be available \nunder the lease agreement until December 6, 2099. However, because Del \nWebb exercised its option in 1996, the lease agreement between Del Webb \nand the Community will expire on December 6, 2096, and will not meet \nthe State's test of continuing legal and physical availability of water \nsupply. Moreover, the Community does not have statutory authority to \ngrant leases with terms in excess of 100 years.\n  To resolve this unanticipated conflict, the affected parties have \nagreed that what is required is a simple modification to the Ak-Chin \nWater Rights Settlement Act of 1984 to allow the extension of leasing \nauthority to include options to lease and renew or extend existing \nleases. This change will allow the Ak-Chin Indian Community to extend \nor renew the existing lease to Del Webb for a cumulative term that \nwould expire more than 100 years from today.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will make a technical change to the \nAk-Chin Water Rights Settlement Act in order for the Ak-Chin/Del Webb \nagreement to be in compliance with State law. All parties and interests \ndirectly impacted by this lease agreement are\n\n[[Page S14561]]\n\nsupportive of this amendment. Therefore, it is our hope that we can \nmove this legislation quickly.\n  I ask to include a complete text of the legislation in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the creation of disaster protection funds by property and casualty \ninsurance companies for the payment of policyholders' claims arising \nfrom future catastrophic events; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  policyholder disaster protection act\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to address a problem \nthat ought to be a concern to all of us: natural disasters and the \nexposure of the private insurance industry to catastrophic risks. In my \nstate of Florida, we have a particular concern about hurricane risk, \nbut many areas of the country are exposed to the risks of other major \ncatastrophes--whether they be volcanoes, earthquakes or tornadoes. \nIncreasingly, I am concerned about the state of the private insurance \nindustry and its ability to withstand a major catastrophe--a \ncatastrophe of Hurricane Andrew size ($15 billion in insured losses) or \ngreater.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to help address this problem and \nstrengthen disaster protection for homeowners and businesses while \nprotecting the interests of the taxpayer. I am pleased my friend from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, has joined me in this effort. I believe our \napproach is an innovative, private-sector solution to the problem of \ncatastrophic risk and I encourage my colleagues to review this proposal \ncarefully.\n  Consumers of property and casualty insurance must be able to rely on \ntheir insurers for protection against the risk of catastrophic loss. \nHowever, protection for policyholders in today's system is weak; a \nmajor future catastrophe could leave consumers without protection and--\nif past experience is any indication--the government would intervene to \nensure the people in the disaster areas receive timely compensation. It \nis important to note that current law actually poses a disincentive for \ninsurers to set aside special reserves for catastrophic events. Any \nmoney set aside to cover potential risk is considered taxable income. \nTo fix this flaw in America's insurance system, we need to provide \nincentives for insurers to set aside a portion of their policy premiums \nin secure reserve funds that will be available to meet policyholder \nneeds in the event of future catastrophes. Our bill does just that.\n  The typical property and casualty insurance company in the United \nStates is exposed to multiple forms of catastrophic risk. This risk can \ntake the form of major disasters that occur only once in a decade or \nonce in several decades (e.g., severe earthquakes, major hurricanes). \nThese can also be in the form of localized natural disasters (e.g., \ntornadoes, wildfires, floods, winter storms) that cause unusually large \npolicyholder losses in a region and imperil the ability of smaller \ninsurance companies to help their policyholders in the area.\n  The nation's exposure to these large natural disasters is staggering. \nWhile millions of families and small businesses rely on insurance \npayments to recover from natural disasters, it is important to remember \nthat--under our current insurance tax and regulatory systems--many \nprivate insurers may not be able to pay all claims arising from a major \ndisaster. Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge Earthquake opened our \neyes to the country's massive exposure to catastrophic losses. Insured \nlosses in my state from Hurricane Andrew exceeded $15 billion. But if \nthis storm had passed over Miami, rather than Homestead just 40 miles \nsouth, insured losses could have reached $50 billion, leaving the \nFlorida economy crippled and more than a third of all insurers in that \nmarket insolvent.\n  There is always the potential for a major disaster in any given year \nin the United States. Estimates of insured losses from highly probable \nevents range from about $75 billion in California and Florida to $100 \nbillion or more in areas of the Midwest. The Gulf, Intermountain West, \nand Atlantic states all face exposures of approximately $20 billion or \nmore.\n  Unfortunately, our current system of tax laws and accounting rules \nwork against consumers and taxpayers because they discourage private \nmarket preparation for future major disasters. Present tax laws do not \npermit portions of consumers' insurance policy payments to be set aside \nand tax deferred in order to provide for the risk of truly catastrophic \nloss events. Ironically, our tax system allows insurers to set aside \nfunds on a tax-deductible basis to address disasters that have already \nhappened but it gives them no incentive to prepare for those major \ndisasters that have not yet happened.\n  Policyholder premiums needed to fund policyholders' catastrophic \nlosses in future years are subject to current tax if not used in a \nparticular year. This diminishes the power of insurers to protect \npolicyholders against future losses. This structure is inadequate for \nassuring that property-casualty policies will protect consumers from \nfuture major catastrophic losses.\n  The tax law should be revised in order to make accommodation for \ndisaster protection reserves and bring about a more practical, and \nsensible, system for insurance companies and consumers.\n  Under the Policyholder Disaster Protection Act, insurers could set \naside portions of policyholder payments in a tax-deferred disaster \nprotection fund. Amounts from this fund used to pay for losses from a \nmajor disaster would be subject to taxation. This concept is similar to \nprograms presently in place in many other developed countries.\n  I believe this legislation would result in greater stability for \ninsurers providing catastrophic coverage and fewer insolvencies after a \nmajor disaster. A recent study by a major U.S. accounting firm \ndetermined that approximately $21 billion in pre-funded reserves would \nbe accumulated within the first ten years of the program.\n\n[[Page S14562]]\n\nAlso, the tax incentive in the bill will encourage insurers to serve \ndisaster-prone areas in a responsible manner by setting aside funds to \npay for major losses.\n  The treatment of the fund by insurers would be closely regulated. \nFollowing is a general description of the provisions of the bill:\n  Insurers would be able to set aside special tax-deferred reserves to \ncover potential catastrophic events.\n  The maximum amount any insurer could set aside in a given year would \nbe determined by reference to each insurance company's exposure to the \nrisk of catastrophic loss events.\n  Deductible contributions to disaster protection funds would be \nvoluntary, but would be irrevocable once made (except to the extent of \n``drawdowns'' for actual catastrophic loss events, or drawdowns \notherwise required by state insurance regulators). No company could use \nthese funds to shelter income from taxation.\n  The maximum allowable reserve for any given company will increase or \ndecrease as they enter or exit lines of business that pose catastrophic \nrisk.\n  Insurers would only be allowed to drawdown the disaster reserves if \nthe loss event in question is declared an emergency or disaster by \ncertain recognized bodies or government officials (for example, a \ndisaster declared by the President under the Stafford Act) and that \nlosses in a year exceed the specified high level. The amounts \ndistributed from the fund are added to company's taxable income for the \nyear in which the drawdown occurred.\n  Insurance companies would pay taxes on income generated when funds in \nthe disaster reserve are invested. This income would be distributed out \nof the fund to the insurance company and taxed to the company on a \ncurrent basis.\n  The maximum reserve (or ``cap'') would be phased in at the rate of \nfive percent per year over 20 years. Industry estimates indicate \nprivate reserves of $40 billion would be built up over this time.\n  Various concepts to address the problem of catastrophic losses have \nbeen proposed over the years. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to craft a comprehensive solution to both the short-term and \nlong-term problems presented by the risk of catastrophic disasters. In \nmy view, the private-sector focus of this bill, which puts a \nstrengthened private insurance market for consumers in the forefront of \ndisaster protection, is an approach designed to ensure disaster relief \nis efficient and cost-effective for taxpayers. While the federal \ngovernment may still need to provide last-resort safety net for \ndisaster victims, it is important to do what we can to ensure private \ninsurance is available, affordable and secure for those citizens in \nthose areas of the country at risk to a catastrophic disaster. This \nbill will help to bring precisely that availability, affordability and \nsecurity to insurance policyholders throughout the country, and I \nbelieve it is worthy of support and consideration.\n  The bill we're introducing today mirrors a bill introduced by \nCongressman Foley and Matsui in the House of Representatives. It is \nalso supported by taxpayer, homeowner, consumer, business and emergency \nservice organizations, as well as local and state policy makers and \ninsurance organizations. I believe it is a sensible approach and I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1915. A bill to enhance the services provided by the Environmental \nProtection Agency to small communities that are attempting to comply \nwith national, State, and local environmental regulations; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 small committee assistance act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, for years small communities across the \nUnited States have labored to meet environmental regulations written \nfor major cities. They have struggled unduly with complicated \nregulations designed for Chicago or Los Angeles. Today I am introducing \nlegislation designed to end this problem: the Small Community \nAssistance Act of 1999.\n  We who live in small towns such as my home town of Shrewsbury, \nVermont are proud of our community and our environment. We want to \ncomply with reasonable health and environmental standards in order to \nleave a healthy legacy for our children. But we do not have the staff \nor financial capacity of larger communities to respond to far-reaching \nregulations. We are concerned about standards written without \nconsideration for the special circumstances small towns in America \nface. While we recognize the importance of environmental regulations in \nsafeguarding our air and water, we need the ability to respond \nintelligently to local priorities and needs. We want to comply with \nenvironmental regulations, but we need some flexibility in order to \ncomply in a reasonable manner. We do not want preferential treatment, \nwe want treatment that recognizes our unique size and fiscal situation.\n  In 1991, I authored the Small Town Environmental Planning Act. This \nact passed overwhelmingly in the House and Senate and was signed into \nlaw by President Bush in 1992. This act mandated that the Environmental \nProtection Agency give more assistance to small towns. It created a \ntask force comprised of representatives from small communities across \nthe nation. These small town representatives developed a list of ways \nin which the EPA can better help small towns enjoy and maintain a \nhealthy environment.\n  It is now time to take their advice. The Small Community Assistance \nAct of 1999 will give much needed assistance to small towns and \ncommunities in Vermont and across the nation. This bill will give small \ncommunities more input into the regulatory review process, clearer and \nsimpler environmental guidelines, and more assistance in meeting \nenvironmental obligations.\n  This legislation acts on the recommendations of people from small \ncommunities throughout the United Stats. Small community members \nprovided the impetus for this bill, helped write the bill itself, and \nprovided numerous helpful comments. To these small community members I \noffer my sincere appreciation. I would especially like to thank the \nmembers of EPA's Small Community Advisory Subcommittee for all of their \nhelp, and I thank the committee for its unanimous endorsement of this \nbill.\n  I would like to thank the original cosponsors of this bill, Senators \nCrapo, Murkowski, Schumer, Harkin, Bryan, Burns, and Reid. Their \nleadership on this bill underscores their dedication to helping people \nin our small towns. I urge every one of my colleagues to cosponsor this \nbill. Together, we can improve the quality of life and further \nenvironmental protections in our small communities nationwide.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with a \ngeographically and politically diverse group of Senators to introduce \nthe Small Community Assistance Act of 1999. I commend Senator Jeffords \nfor investing his time and energy in developing this important \nlegislation. This Small Community Assistance Act will help ensure that \nsmall towns all across America are included in a combined local, state, \nand national effort to protect the environment.\n  This bill would help increase communications and cooperation between \nthe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and smaller communities. By \nestablishing a Small Town Ombudsman Office in each of EPA's regions, \nthis bill will ensure that communities with less than 7500 residents \nhave improved access to the technical expertise and information that \nare necessary for small towns to cost effectively protect the quality \nof their air and water and their citizens' health.\n  By incorporating the perspectives of a Small Community Advisory \nCommittee early in the development of EPA's environmental policies, \nthis bill will improve the working relationship between small towns and \nEPA and ultimately strengthen environmental protection.\n  The Small Community Advisory Committee will build on the valuable \nwork already done by EPA's Small Community Task Force, which includes \nrepresentatives of towns, governmental agencies, and public interest \ngroups from across the country. Cherie Aiazzi of Carlin, a town of \nabout 2800 people in northern Nevada, contributed\n\n[[Page S14563]]\n\nher time, insight and creativity to this task force and I know that \nperspectives of rural towns across the country are better understood as \na result of her efforts.\n  By coincidence of history and geography Nevada is a state with more \nsmall towns than big cities. In our efforts to enhance the quality of \nlife for all Nevadans, it is crucial that small communities play an \nimportant role in the development and achievement of our environmental \ngoals. The Small Community Assistance Act of 1999 provides an valuable \nopportunity for small towns to contribute to and benefit from this \nimportant effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1917. A bill to abolish the death penalty under Federal law; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY ABOLITION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nFederal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 1999. This bill will abolish the \ndeath penalty at the federal level. It will put an immediate halt to \nexecutions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence \nfor violations of federal law.\n  Since the beginning of this year, this Chamber has echoed with debate \non violence in America. We've heard about violence in our schools and \nneighborhoods. Some say it's because of the availability of guns to \nminors. Some say Hollywood has contributed to a culture of violence. \nOthers argue that the roots of the problem are far deeper and more \ncomplex. Whatever the causes, a culture of violence has certainly \ninfected our nation. As schoolhouse killings have shown, our children \nnow can be reached by that culture of violence. And they aren't just \ncasual observers; some of them are active participants and many have \nbeen victims.\n  But, Mr. President, I'm not so sure that we in government don't \ncontribute to this casual attitude we sometimes see toward killing and \ndeath. With each new death penalty statute enacted and each execution \ncarried out, our executive, judicial and legislative branches, at both \nthe state and federal level, add to a culture of violence and killing. \nWith each person executed, we're teaching our children that the way to \nsettle scores is through violence, even to the point of taking a human \nlife.\n  At the same time, the public debate on the death penalty, which was \nan intense national debate not very long ago, is muted. As the online \nmagazine Slate recently noted, with crime rates down and incomes up, \n``unspeakable crimes are no longer spoken of, murder is what happens to \nyour portfolio on a bad day, `family values' are debated through the \nInternal Revenue code, and the `death penalty' is [often used as a term \nfor] a tax issue.'' What has happened to our nation's sense of striving \nto do what we know to be the right thing? Those who favor the death \npenalty should be pressed to explain why fallible human beings should \npresume to use the power of the state to extinguish the life of a \nfellow human being on our collective behalf. Those who oppose the death \npenalty should demand that explanation adamantly, and at every turn. \nBut only a zealous few try.\n  Our nation is a great nation. We have the strongest democracy in the \nworld. We have expended blood and treasure to protect so many \nfundamental human rights at home and abroad and not always for only our \nown interests. But we can do better. Mr. President, we should do \nbetter. And we should use this moment to do better as we step not only \ninto a new century but also a new millennium, the first such landmark \nsince the depths of the Middle Ages.\n  Courtesy of the Internet and CNN International, the world observes, \nperplexed and sometimes horrified, the violence in our nation. When the \nLittleton tragedy erupted, newspapers all over the world marveled at \nhow readily available guns are to American children. And across the \nglobe, with every American who is executed, the entire world watches \nand asks how can the Americans, the champions of human rights, \ncompromise their own professed beliefs in this way.\n  Religious groups and leaders express their revulsion at the continued \npractice of capital punishment. Pope John Paul II frequently appeals to \nAmerican governors when a death row inmate is about to die. I am \npleased that in a recent case, involving an inmate on death row in \nMissouri, the Missouri governor heeded the good advice of the pontiff \nand commuted the killer's sentence to life without parole. That case \ngenerated a lot of press--but only as a political issue, rather than a \nmoral question or a human rights challenge.\n  But the Pope is not standing alone against the death penalty. He is \njoined by the chorus of voices of various people of faith who abhor the \ndeath penalty. Religious groups from the National Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the United Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, \nthe Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Mennonites, the Central \nConference of American Rabbis, and so many more people of faith have \nproclaimed their opposition to capital punishment. And, I might add, \neven conservative Pat Robertson protested the execution in 1998 of \nKarla Faye Tucker, a born-again Christian on Texas death row. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to see the commutation of sentences to life \nwithout parole for all death row inmates--whether they are Christians, \nMuslims, Jews, Buddhists, or some other faith, or no faith at all.\n  The United States' casual imposition of capital punishment is \nabhorrent not only to many people of faith. Our use of the death \npenalty also stands in stark contrast to the majority of nations that \nhave abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Even Russia and \nSouth Africa--nations that for years were symbols of egregious \nviolations of basic human rights and liberties--have seen the error of \nthe use of the death penalty. The United Nations Commission on Human \nRights has called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death \npenalty. And soon, Italy and other European nations are expected to \nintroduce a resolution in the UN General Assembly calling for a \nworldwide moratorium.\n  The European Union denies membership in their alliance to those \nnations that use the death penalty. In fact, the European Union \nrecently warned Turkey that if it executes the Kurdish leader, Abdullah \nOcalan, Turkey would jeopardize its membership application. Just this \npast December, the European Union actually passed a resolution calling \nfor the immediate and unconditional global abolition of the death \npenalty, and it specifically called on all states within the United \nStates to abolish the death penalty. This is significant because it \nreflects the unanimous view of the nations with which the United States \nenjoys its closest relationships--nations that so often follow our \nlead.\n  Mr. President, what is even more troubling in the international \ncontext is that the United States is now one of only six countries that \nimposes the death penalty for crimes committed by children. I'll repeat \nthat because it is remarkable. We are one of only six nations on this \nearth that puts to death people who were under 18 years of age when \nthey committed their crimes. The others are Iran, Pakistan, Nigeria, \nSaudi Arabia and Yemen. These are countries that are often criticized \nfor human rights abuses. And let's look at the numbers. Since 1990, the \nUnited States has executed ten child offenders. That's more than any \none of these five other countries and equal to all five countries \ncombined. Even China --the country that many members of Congress, \nincluding myself, have criticized for its human rights violations--\napparently has the decency not to execute its children. This is \nembarrassing. Is this the kind of company we want to keep? Is this the \nkind of world leader we want to be? But these are the facts for this \npast decade, 1990 to the present.\n  Now, let's look at the last two years. In the last two years, the \nUnited States has been the only nation in the world to put to death \npeople who were minors when they committed their crimes. We have \nexecuted four child offenders during the last two years. Today, over 70 \nchild offenders remain on death row. No one, Mr. President, no one can \nreasonably argue that based on this data, executing child offenders is \na normal or acceptable practice in the world community. And I \ndon't think we should be proud of the fact that the United States is \nthe world leader in the execution of child offenders.\n\n  Is the death penalty a deterrent for our children's conduct, as well \nas that\n\n[[Page S14564]]\n\nof adult Americans? For those who believe capital punishment is a \ndeterrent, they are sadly, sadly mistaken. The federal government and \nmost states in the U.S. have a death penalty, while our European \ncounterparts do not. Following the logic of death penalty supporters \nwho believe it's a deterrent, you would think that our European allies, \nwho don't use the death penalty, would have a higher murder rate than \nthe United States. Yet, they don't and it's not even close. In fact, \nthe murder rate in the U.S. is six times higher than the murder rate in \nBritain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than in \nAustralia, and five times higher than in Sweden.\n  But we don't even need to look across the Atlantic to see that \ncapital punishment has no deterrent effect on crime. Let's compare \nWisconsin and Texas. I'm proud of the fact that my great state, \nWisconsin, was the first state in this nation to abolish the death \npenalty completely, when it did so in 1853. Wisconsin has been death \npenalty-free for nearly 150 years. In contrast, Texas is the most \nprodigious user of the death penalty, having executed 192 people since \n1976. Let's look at the murder rate in Wisconsin and Texas. During the \nperiod 1995 to 1998, Texas has had a murder rate that is nearly double \nthe murder rate in Wisconsin. This data alone calls into question the \nargument that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder.\n  In fact, according to a 1995 Hart Research poll, the majority of our \nnation's police chiefs do not believe the death penalty is a \nparticularly effective law enforcement tool. When asked to rank the \nvarious factors in reducing crime, police chiefs ranked the death \npenalty last. Rather, the police chiefs --the people who deal with \nhardened criminals day in and day out --cite reducing drug abuse as the \nprimary factor in reducing crime, along with a better economy and jobs, \nsimplifying court rules, longer prison sentences, more police officers, \nand reducing guns. It looks like most police chiefs recognize what our \nEuropean allies and a few states like Wisconsin have known all along: \nthe death penalty is not an effective deterrent.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I believe murderers and other violent \noffenders should be severely punished. I'm not seeking to open the \nprison doors and let murderers come rushing out into our communities. I \ndon't want to free them. The question is: should the death penalty be a \nmeans of punishment in our society? One of the most frequent refrains \nfrom death penalty supporters is the claim that the majority of \nAmericans support the death penalty. It's repeated so often, everybody \nassumes it's true. Mr. President, the facts do not support this claim. \nSurvey after survey, from around the country, shows that when offered \nsentencing alternatives, more Americans prefer life without parole plus \nrestitution for the victim's family over the death penalty. For \nexample, a 1993 national poll found that when offered alternatives to \nthe death penalty, 44% of Americans supported the alternative of life \nwithout parole plus restitution over the death penalty. Only 41% \npreferred the death penalty and 15% were unsure. This is remarkable. \nSure, if you ask Americans the simple, isolated question of whether \nthey support the death penalty, a majority of Americans will agree. But \nif you ask them whether they support the death penalty or a realistic, \npractical alternative sentence like life without parole plus \nrestitution, support for the death penalty falls dramatically to below \n50%. More Americans support the alternative sentence than Americans who \nsupport the death penalty.\n  The fact that our society relies on killing as punishment is \ndisturbing enough. Even more disturbing, however, is the fact that the \nStates' and federal use of the death penalty is often not consistent \nwith principles of due process, fairness and justice. These principles \nare the foundation of our criminal justice system and, in a broader \nsense, the stability of our nation. It is clearer than ever before that \nwe have put innocent people on death row. In addition, those States \nthat have the death penalty are more likely to put people to death for \nkilling white victims than for killing black victims.\n  Mr. President, are we certain that innocent persons are not being \nexecuted? Obviously not. Are we certain that racial bias is not \ninfecting the criminal justice system and the administration of the \ndeath penalty? I doubt it.\n  It simply cannot be disputed that we are sending innocent people to \ndeath. Since the modern death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s, we \nhave released 79 men and women from death row. Why? Because they were \ninnocent. Seventy-nine men and women sitting on death row, awaiting a \nfiring squad, lethal injection or electrocution, but later found \ninnocent. That's one death row inmate found innocent for every seven \nexecuted. One in seven! That's a pretty poor performance for American \njustice. A wrong conviction means that the real killer may have gotten \naway. The real killer may still be on the loose and a threat to \nsociety. What an injustice that the victims' loved ones cannot rest \nbecause the killer is still not caught. What an injustice that an \ninnocent man or woman has to spend even one day in jail. What a \nstaggering injustice that innocent people are sentenced to death for \ncrimes they did not commit. What a disgrace when we carry out those \nsentences, actually taking the lives of innocent people in the name of \njustice.\n  I call my colleagues' attention to the recent example of an Illinois \ndeath row inmate, Ronald Jones, who had been sentenced to death for the \nrape and murder of a Chicago woman. After a lengthy interrogation in \nwhich Mr. Jones was beaten by police, he signed a confession. As a \nclass assignment, a group of Northwestern University journalism \nstudents researched the case of Ronald Jones. What did they learn? They \nlearned that Mr. Jones was clearly innocent and not for some technical \nreason--he just didn't do it. As a result of the students' efforts, Mr. \nJones was later exonerated based on DNA evidence. Mr. President, our \ncriminal justice system sent an innocent man to death row. Mr. Jones \nwas tried and convicted in a justice system that is sometimes far from \njust and that sometimes just gets it wrong. And Mr. Jones is not alone. \nIn Illinois alone, three death row inmates so far this year have been \nproven innocent. Since 1987, Illinois has freed 12 inmates from death \nrow because they were later found innocent.\n  Innocent, Mr. President, and they were sitting on death row. \nInnocent, and yet they were about to be killed. Why? Because our \ncriminal justice system is sometimes far from fair and far from just. \nWe can all agree that it is profoundly wrong to convict and condemn \ninnocent people to death. But sadly, that's what's happening. With the \ngreater accuracy and sophistication of DNA testing available today \ncompared to even a couple of years ago, states like Illinois are \nfinding that people sitting on death row did not commit the crimes to \nwhich earlier, less accurate DNA tests appeared to link them. This DNA \ntechnology should be further reviewed and compared to other tests. We \nshould consider the role of DNA tests in all those committed to death \nrow.\n  Some argue that the discovery of the innocence of a death row inmate \nproves that the system works. This is absurd. How can you say the \ncriminal justice system works when a group of students--not lawyers or \ninvestigators but students with no special powers, who were very much \noutside the system--discover that a man about to be executed was in \nfact innocent? That's what happened in Illinois to Ronald Jones. The \nsystem doesn't work. It has failed us.\n  A primary reason why justice has been less than just is a series of \nSupreme Court decisions that seem to fail to grasp the significance and \nresponsibility of their task when a human life is at stake. The Supreme \nCourt has been narrowly focused on procedural technicalities, ignoring \nthe fact that the death penalty is a unique punishment that cannot be \nundone to correct mistakes. One disturbing decision was issued by the \nSupreme Court just a few months ago. In Jones v. United States, which \ninvolved an inmate on death row in Texas and the interpretation of the \n1994 Federal Death Penalty Act, the judge refused to tell the jury that \nif they deadlocked on the sentence, the law required the judge to \nimpose a sentence of life without possibility of parole. As a result, \nsome jurors were under the grave misunderstanding that lack of \nunanimity would mean the judge could give a sentence where the\n\n[[Page S14565]]\n\ndefendant might one day go free. The Supreme Court, however, upheld the \nlower court's imposition of the death penalty. And one more person will \nlose a life, when a simple correction of a misunderstanding could have \nresulted in a severe yet morally correct sentence of life without \nparole.\n  As legal scholar Ronald Dworkin recently observed, ``[t]he Supreme \nCourt has become impatient, and super due process has turned into due \nprocess-lite. Its impatience is understandable, but is also \nunacceptable.'' Mr. President, America's impatience with the protracted \nappeals of death row inmates is understandable. But this impatience is \nunacceptable. The rush to judgment is unacceptable. And the rush to \nexecute men, women and children who might well be innocent is \nhorrifying.\n  The discovery of the innocence of death row inmates and misguided \nSupreme Court decisions disallowing potentially dispositive exculpatory \nevidence, however, aren't the only reasons we need to abolish the death \npenalty. Another reason we need to abolish the death penalty is the \ncontinuing racism in our criminal justice system. Our nation is facing \na crucial test. A test of moral and political will. We have come a long \nway through this nation's history, and especially in this century, to \ndismantle state-sponsored and societal racism. Brown v. Board of \nEducation, ensuring the right to equal educational opportunities for \nwhites and blacks, was decided only 45 years ago. Unfortunately, \nhowever, we are still living with vestiges of institutional racism. In \nsome cases, racism can be found at every stage of a capital trial--in \nthe selection of jurors, during the presentation of evidence, when the \nprosecutor contrasts the race of the victim and defendant to appeal to \nthe prejudice of the jury, and sometimes during jury deliberations.\n  After the 1976 Supreme Court Gregg decision upholding the use of the \ndeath penalty, the death penalty was first enacted as a sentence at the \nfederal level with passage of the Drug Kingpin Statute in 1988. Since \nthat time, numerous additional federal crimes have become death \npenalty-eligible, bringing the total to about 60 statutes today. At the \nfederal level, 21 people have been sentenced to death. Another eight \nmen sit on the military's death row. Of those 21 defendants on the \nfederal government's death row, 14 are black and only 5 are white. One \ndefendant is Hispanic and another Asian. That means 16 of the 21 people \non federal death row are minorities. That's just over 75%. And the \nnumbers are worse on the military's death row. Seven of the eight, or \n87.5%, on military death row are minorities.\n  Some of my colleagues may remember the debates of the late 1980's and \nearly 1990's, when Congress considered the Racial Justice Act and other \nattempts to eradicate racism in the use of capital punishment. A noted \nstudy evaluating the role of race in death penalty cases was frequently \ndiscussed. This was the study by David Baldus, a professor at the \nUniversity of Iowa College of Law. The Baldus study found that \ndefendants who kill white victims are more than four times more likely \nto be sent to death row than defendants who kill black victims. An \nargument against the Baldus study was made by some opponents of the \nRacial Justice Act. They argued that we just needed to ``level up'' the \nplaying field. In other words, send all the defendants who killed black \nvictims to death row, too. They argued that legislative remedies were \nnot needed, just tell prosecutors and judges to go after perpetrators \nof black homicide as strongly as against perpetrators of white \nhomicide.\n  In theory, this may sound reasonable but one thing is clear: no \nmatter how hard we try, we cannot overcome the inevitable fallibility \nof being human. That fallibility means that we will not be able to \napply the death penalty in a fair and just manner. We will always run \nthe risk that we will condemn innocent people to death. Mr. President, \nlet's restore some certainty, fairness, and justice to our criminal \njustice system. Let's have the courage to recognize our human \nfallibilities. Let's put a halt to capital punishment.\n  The American Bar Association agrees. In 1997, the American Bar \nAssociation called for a moratorium on the death penalty because it \nfound that the application of the death penalty raises fairness and due \nprocess concerns. Several states are finally beginning to recognize the \ngreat injustice when the ultimate punishment is carried out in a biased \nand unfair way. Moratoriums have been considered by the legislatures of \nat least ten states over the last several months. The legislatures of \nIllinois and Nebraska have made the most progress. They actually passed \nmoratorium measures earlier this year.\n  I am glad to see that some states are finally taking steps to correct \nthe practice of legalized killing that was again unleashed by the \nSupreme Court's Gregg decision in 1976. The first post-Gregg execution \ntook place in 1977 in Utah, when Gary Gilmore did not challenge and \ninstead aggressively sought his execution by a firing squad. The first \npost-Gregg involuntary execution took place on May 25, 1979. I vividly \nremember that day. I had just finished my last law school exam that \nmorning. Later that day, I recall turning on the television and \nwatching the news report that Florida had just executed John \nSpenkelink. I was overcome with a sickening feeling. Here I was, fresh \nout of law school and firm in my belief that our legal system was \nadvancing through the latter quarter of the twentieth century. Instead, \nto my great dismay, I was witnessing a throwback to the electric chair, \nthe gallows, and the routine executions of our nation's earlier \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I haven't forgotten that experience or what I thought \nand felt on that day. At the end of 1999, at the end of a remarkable \ncentury and millennium of progress, I cannot help but believe that our \nprogress has been tarnished with our nation's not only continuing, but \nincreasing use of the death penalty. As of today, the United States has \nexecuted 584 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in \n1976. In those 23 years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of \nexecutions. This year the United States has already set a record for \nthe most executions in our country in one year, 84--the latest \nexecution being that of Thomas Lee Royal, Jr., who was executed by \nlethal injection just last night by the state of Virginia. And the year \nisn't even over yet. We are on track to hit close to 100 executions \nthis year. This is astounding and it is embarrassing. We are a nation \nthat prides itself on the fundamental principles of justice, liberty, \nequality and due process. We are a nation that scrutinizes the human \nrights records of other nations. We are one of the first nations to \nspeak out against torture and killings by foreign governments. It is \ntime for us to look in the mirror.\n  Two former Supreme Court justices did just that. Justice Harry \nBlackmun penned the following eloquent dissent in 1994:\n       From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the \n     machinery of death. For more than 20 years I have \n     endeavored--indeed, I have struggled--along with a majority \n     of this Court, to develop procedural and substantive rules \n     that would lend more than the mere appearance of fairness to \n     the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to coddle \n     the Court's delusion that the desired level of fairness has \n     been achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel \n     morally and intellectually obligated simply to concede that \n     the death penalty experiment has failed. It is virtually \n     self-evident to me now that no combination of procedural \n     rules or substantive regulations ever can save the death \n     penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. The \n     basic question--does the system accurately and consistently \n     determine which defendants ``deserve'' to die?--cannot be \n     answered in the affirmative. . . . The problem is that the \n     inevitability of factual, legal, and moral error gives us a \n     system that we know must wrongly kill some defendants, a \n     system that fails to deliver the fair, consistent, and \n     reliable sentences of death required by the Constitution.\n\n  Justice Lewis Powell also had a similar change of mind. Justice \nPowell dissented from the Furman decision in 1972, which struck down \nthe death penalty as a form of cruel and unusual punishment. He also \nwrote the decision in McCleskey v. Kemp in 1987, which denied a \nchallenge to the death penalty on the grounds that it was applied in a \ndiscriminatory manner against African Americans. In 1991, however, \nJustice Powell told his biographer that he had decided that capital \npunishment should be abolished.\n  After sitting on our nation's highest court for over 20 years, \nJustices Blackmun and Powell came to understand the randomness and \nunfairness of the death penalty. Mr. President, it is time for our \nnation to follow the lead of these two distinguished jurists and\n\n[[Page S14566]]\n\nre-visit its support for this form of punishment.\n  At the end of 1999, as we enter a new millennium, our society is \nstill far from fully just. The continued use of the death penalty \ndemeans us. The death penalty is at odds with our best traditions. It \nis wrong and it is immoral. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a \nright,'' could not be more appropriate here. Our nation has long ago \ndone away with other barbaric punishments like whipping and cutting off \nthe ears of suspected criminals. Just as our nation did away with these \npunishments as contrary to our humanity and ideals, it is time to \nabolish the death penalty as we enter the next century. And it's not \njust a matter of morality. Mr. President, the continued viability of \nour justice system as a truly just system requires that we do so. And \nin the world's eyes, the ability of our nation to say truthfully that \nwe are the leader and defender of freedom, liberty and equality demands \nthat we do so.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great nation. Today, I introduce a bill that \nabolishes the death penalty at the federal level. I call on all states \nthat have the death penalty to also cease this practice. Let us step \naway from the culture of violence and restore fairness and integrity to \nour criminal justice system. I close with this reminder to my \ncolleagues. Where would our nation be if members of Congress were \nfollowers, not leaders, of public opinion? We, of course, would still \nbe living with slavery, segregation and without a woman's right to \nvote. Like abolishing slavery and segregation and establishing a \nwoman's right to vote, abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy \ntask. It will take patience, persistence and courage. As we head into \nthe next millennium, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to waive the 24-month waiting period for disabled \nindividuals to qualify for Medicare benefits in the case of individuals \nsuffering from terminal illness with not more than 2 years to live; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           medicare for individuals with terminal illness act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \ncorrect a weakness in the Medicare law for those who develop a terminal \nillness.\n  Under current law, individuals under age 65 who are unable to work \nbecause of a disability can qualify for Medicare after a two-year \nwaiting period. That is, two years after developing a disability, \nindividuals can start to receive Medicare benefits to help pay for \ntheir health care.\n  There are reasons for this two-year waiting period, and this \nlegislation would not change that. What I am concerned about, Mr. \nPresident, is the fact that thousands of individuals develop a \ndisability that is terminal within two years.\n  I am talking about people with cancer, people with AIDS, people with \nLou Gehrig's Disease, to name to just a few examples. In some cases, \nwhen these individuals are diagnosed and can no longer work, they have \nless than two years to live. That means they will die before the end of \nthe waiting period, before they become eligible for Medicare, before \nthey qualify to receive health care benefits. That is not right and not \nfair.\n  The Medicare for Individuals with Terminal Illness Act would change \nthis. My bill would say that for people whose doctors expect them to \nlive less than two years because of their disability or illness, there \nwill be no waiting period. They would qualify for Medicare immediately \nand could get the health care they need.\n  Mr. President, to date, 10 individuals and 44 organizations--groups \ninvolved with AIDS, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's Disease, hospice care, \nand diabetes, among others--have endorsed this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to look at this list of \nsupporters, look at the bill, and join me in correcting a problem that \nis denying health care benefits to thousands of Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of endorsements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1918\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit travel to or from Cuba by United States \ncitizens and lawful resident aliens of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n               The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2000\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today my colleague, Senator Leahy and \nI are introducing ``The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2000.'' We \nbelieve the time has come to lift the very archaic, counterproductive, \nand ill-conceived ban on Americans traveling to Cuba. Not only does \nthis ban hinder rather than help our effort to spread democracy, it \nunnecessarily abridges the rights of ordinary Americans. The United \nStates was founded on the principles of liberty and freedom. Yet when \nit comes to Cuba, our Government abridges these rights with no greater \nrationale than political and rhetorical gain.\n  Cuba lies just 90 miles from America's shore. Yet those 90 miles of \nwater might as well be an entire ocean. We have made a land ripe for \nAmerican influence forbidden territory. In doing so, we have enabled \nthe Cuban regime to be a closed system with the Cuban people having \nlittle contact with their closest neighbors.\n  Surely we do not ban travel to Cuba out of concern for the safety of \nAmericans who might visit that island nation. Today Americans are free \nto travel to Iran, Sudan, Burma, Yugoslavia, North Korea--but not to \nCuba. You can fly to North Korea; you can fly to Iran; you can travel \nfreely. It seems to me if you can go to those countries, you ought not \nbe denied the right to go to Cuba. If the Cubans want to stop Americans \nfrom visiting that country, that ought to be their business. But to say \nto an American citizen that you can travel to Iran, where they held \nAmerican hostages for months on end, to North Korea, which has declared \nus to be an enemy of theirs completely, but that you cannot travel 90 \nmiles off our shore to Cuba, is a mistake.\n  To this day, some Iranian politicians believe the United States to be \n``the Great Satan.'' We hear it all the time. Just two decades ago, \nIran occupied our Embassy and took innocent American diplomats hostage. \nTo this day, protesters in Tehran burn the American flag with the \nencouragement of some officials in that Government. Those few Americans \nwho venture into such inhospitable surroundings often find themselves \npelted by rocks and accosted by the public.\n  Similarly, we do not ban travel to Sudan, a nation we attacked with \ncruise missiles last summer for its support of terrorism; to Burma, a \nnation with one of the most oppressive regimes in the world today; to \nNorth Korea, whose soldiers have peered at American servicemen through \ngun sights for decades; or Syria, which has one of the most egregious \nhuman rights records and is one of the foremost sponsors of terrorism.\n  We believe that it is time to end the inconsistency with respect to \nU.S. travel restrictions to Cuba. We ban travel to Cuba, a nation which \nis neither at war with the United States nor a sponsor of international \nterrorist activities. Why do we ban travel? Ostensibly so that we can \npressure Cuban authorities into making the transition to a democratic \nform of government.\n  I fail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values \nand ideals will foster the transition to democracy in that country. I \nfail to see how isolating the Cuban people from democratic values and \nfrom the influence of Americans when they go to that country to help \nbring about the change we all seek serves our own interests.\n  The Cuban people are not currently permitted the freedom to travel \nenjoyed by many peoples around the world. However, because Fidel Castro \ndoes not permit Cubans to leave Cuba and come to this country is not \njustification for adopting a similar principle in this country \nthat says Americans cannot travel freely. We have a Bill of Rights. We \nneed to treasure and respect the fundamental rights that we embrace as \nAmerican citizens. Travel is one of them. If other countries want to \nprohibit us from going there, then that is their business. But for us \nto say that citizens of Connecticut or Alabama cannot go where they \nlike is not the kind of restraint we ought to put on people.\n\n  If Americans can travel to North Korea, to the Sudan, to Iran, then I \ndo not understand the justification for saying that they cannot travel \nto Cuba. I happen to believe that by allowing Americans to travel to \nCuba, we can begin to change the political climate and bring about the \nchanges we all seek in that country.\n  Today, every single country in the Western Hemisphere is a democracy, \nwith one exception: Cuba. American influence through person-to-person \nand cultural exchanges was a prime factor in this evolution from a \nhemisphere ruled predominantly by authoritarian or military regimes to \none where democracy is the rule. Our current policy toward Cuba blocks \nthese exchanges and prevents the United States from using our most \npotent weapon in our effort to combat totalitarian regimes, and that is \nour own people. They are the best ambassadors we have. Most \ntotalitarian regimes bar Americans from coming into their countries for \nthe very reasons I just mentioned. They are afraid the gospel of \nfreedom will motivate their citizens to overthrow dictators, as they \nhave done in dozens of nations over the last half century. Isn't it \nironic that when it comes to Cuba we do the dictator's bidding for him \nin a sense? Cuba does not have to worry about America spreading \ndemocracy. Our own Government stops us from doing so.\n  Let me review for my colleagues who may travel to Cuba under current \nGovernment regulations and under what circumstances. The following \ncategories of people may travel to Cuba without applying to the \nTreasury Department for a specific license to travel. They are deemed \nto be authorized to travel under so-called general license: Government \nofficials, regularly employed journalists, professional researchers who \nare ``full time professionals who travel to Cuba to conduct \nprofessional research in their professional areas'', Cuban Americans \nwho have relatives in Cuba who are ill (but only once a year.)\n  There are other categories of individuals who theoretically are \neligible to travel to Cuba as well, but they must apply for a license \nfrom the Department of the Treasury and prove they fit a category in \nwhich travel to Cuba is permissible. What are these categories? The \nfirst is so called freelance journalists, provided they can prove they \nare journalists; they must also submit their itinerary for the proposed \nresearch. The second is Cuban Americans who are unfortunate enough to \nhave more than one humanitarian emergency in a 12-month period and \ntherefore cannot travel under a general license. The third is students \nand faculty from U.S. academic institutions that are accredited by an \nappropriate national or regional educational accrediting association \nwho are participating in a ``structural education program.'' The fourth \nis members of U.S. religious organizations. The fifth is individuals \nparticipating in public performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and \nother competitions and exhibitions. If that isn't complicated enough--\njust because you think you may fall into one of the above enumerated \ncategories does not necessarily mean you will actually be licensed by \nthe U.S. Government to travel to Cuba.\n\n[[Page S14569]]\n\n  Under current regulations, who decides whether a researcher's work is \nlegitimate? Who decides whether a freelance journalist is really \nconducting journalistic activities? Who decides whether or not a \nprofessor or student is participating in a ``structured educational \nprogram''? Who decides whether a religious person is really going to \nconduct religious activities? Government bureaucrats are making those \ndecisions about what I believe should be personal rights of American \ncitizens.\n\n  It is truly unsettling, to put it mildly, when you think about it, \nand probably unconstitutional at its core. It is a real intrusion on \nthe fundamental rights of American citizens. It also says something \nabout what we as a Government think about our own people. Do we really \nbelieve that a journalist, a Government official, a Senator, a \nCongressman, a baseball player, a ballerina, a college professor or \nminister is somehow superior to other citizens who do not fall into \nthose categories; that only these categories of people are ``good \nexamples'' for the Cuban people to observe in order to understand \nAmerican values?\n  I do not think so. I find such a notion insulting. There is no better \nway to communicate America's values and ideals than by unleashing \naverage American men and women to demonstrate by daily living what our \ngreat country stands for and the contrasts between what we stand for \nand what exists in Cuba today.\n  I do not believe there was ever a sensible rationale for restricting \nAmericans' right to travel to Cuba. With the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion and an end to the cold war, I do not think any excuse remains \ntoday to ban this kind of travel. This argument that dollars and \ntourism will be used to prop up the regime is specious. The regime \nseems to have survived 38 years despite the Draconian U.S. embargo \nduring that entire period. The notion that allowing Americans to spend \na few dollars in Cuba is somehow going to give major aid and comfort to \nthe Cuban regime is without basis, in my view.\n  This spring, we got a taste of what people-to-people exchanges \nbetween the United States and Cuba might mean when the Baltimore \nOrioles and the Cuban National Team played a home-and-home series. The \ngame brought players from two nations with the greatest love of \nbaseball together for the first time in generations. It is time to \nbring the fans together. It is time to let Americans and Cubans meet in \nthe baseball stands and on the streets of Havana.\n  Political rhetoric is not sufficient reason to abridge the freedoms \nof American citizens. Nor is it sufficient reason to stand by a law \nwhich counteracts one of the basic premises of American foreign policy; \nnamely, the spread of democracy. The time has come to allow Americans--\naverage Americans--to travel freely to Cuba. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the legislation that Senator Leahy and I have introduced today. \nWe will be working to ensure that the full Senate has an opportunity to \ndebate and vote on this matter when the Senate convenes next year. I \nhope our colleagues will join with us at that time in restoring \nAmerican citizens' rights to travel wherever they choose, including to \nthe Island of Cuba.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1920. A bill to combat money laundering and protect the United \nStates financial system by addressing the vulnerabilities of private \nbanking to money laundering, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 money laundering abatement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with Senator \nSpecter, the Money Laundering Abatement Act of 1999.\n  The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of which I am \nthe ranking member, is currently holding hearings on problems specific \nto private banking, a rapidly-growing financial service in which banks \nprovide one-on-one services tailored to the individual needs of wealthy \nindividuals. The Subcommittee's investigation and hearings show that \nprivate bankers have operated in a culture which emphasizes secrecy, \nimpeding account documentation for regulators and law enforcement \nentities. This culture makes private banking peculiarly susceptible to \nmoney laundering.\n  The Money Laundering Abatement Act is intended to supplement and \nreinforce the current anti-money-laundering laws and bolster the \nefforts of regulators and law enforcement bodies in this nation and \naround the world and the efforts of others in Congress.\n  The Subcommittee's year-long investigation and testimony by \ndistinguished financial experts, regulators, and banking industry \npersonnel, revealed that private bankers regularly create devices such \nas shell corporations established in offshore jurisdictions to hide the \nsource of and movement of clients' funds. The motives may be benign or \nthey may be questionable but one thing is certain: they make it harder \nfor regulators and law enforcement personnel to track the ownership and \nflow of funds and avert or apprehend laundering of the proceeds of drug \nand weapons trafficking, tax evasion, corruption, and other \nmalfeasance. To make matters worse, many activities which Americans \nfind reprehensible and which can destabilize regimes and economies are \nnot currently illegal under foreign laws. Therefore, as the current \nmoney laundering laws are written, transactions in funds derived from \nsuch activities do not constitute money laundering, but they ought to \nconstitute money laundering punishable under United States laws.\n  My bill would patch these holes, particularly as they apply to \nprivate banking activities, the volume of which experts predict will \ngrow exponentially as more and more wealth is created and banks compete \nfor this lucrative line of business. Accordingly, I am today \nintroducing legislation that would significantly increase the \ntransparency of our banking system and make it possible for law \nenforcement and civil process to pierce the veil of secrecy that for \ntoo long has made it possible for institutions and individuals \noperating in largely unregulated off-shore jurisdictions to gain \nunfettered access to the U.S. financial system for purposes of \nlegitimizing the proceeds of illegal or unsavory activity.\n  A great problem in detecting money laundering is that many private \nbanking transactions are conducted through fictitious entities or under \nfalse names or numbered accounts in which the actual or beneficial \nowner is not identified. The bill requires a financial institution that \nopens or maintains a U.S. account for a foreign entity to identify and \nmaintain a record in the U.S. of the identity of each direct or \nbeneficial owner of the account. The bill would further help banks in \nverifying customers' identities by making it illegal to misrepresent \nthe true ownership of an account to a bank. The bill also imposes a \n``48-hour rule'' under which, within 48 hours of a request by a federal \nbanking agency, a financial institution would have to provide account \ninformation and documentation to the agency.\n\n  Our investigation into private banking has shown that money \nlaunderers may launder their transactions by commingling the proceeds \nin so-called ``concentration accounts'' and aggregate the funds from \nmultiple customers and transactions. The bill curtails the illicit use \nof these accounts by prohibiting institutions from using these accounts \nanonymously. The bill also prohibits U.S. financial institutions from \nopening or maintaining correspondent accounts with so-called ``brass \nplate'' banks--most often in off-shore locations--that are not licensed \nto provide services in their home countries and are not subject to \ncomprehensive home country supervision on a consolidated basis, \nreducing the likelihood that U.S.-based institutions will receive funds \nthat may derive from illicit sources.\n  The bill would also eliminate significant gaps in current U.S. law by \nexpanding the list of crimes committed on foreign soil that can serve \nas predicate offenses for money laundering prosecutions in the U.S., \nincluding corruption and the misappropriation of IMF funds. It would \nexpand the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, by including transactions in \nwhich money is laundered through a foreign bank as a U.S. crime if the \ntransaction has a ``nexus'' in the United States. The bill addresses \nthe reality that governmental corruption weakens economies\n\n[[Page S14570]]\n\nand causes political instability and when U.S. banks profit from the \nfruits of such corruption they run counter to U.S. interests in ending \nsuch corruption.\n  Another problem that we have encountered repeatedly in our \ninvestigation is that many private banks have written policies that \nrepeatedly stress that the banker must know a customer's identity and \nsource of funds. Yet in practice, many private bankers do not comply \nwith their own bank's policies. To rectify this, the bill requires \nfinancial institutions to develop and apply due diligence standards for \naccounts for private banking customers to verify the customers' \nidentity and source of wealth, both when opening such accounts and on \nan ongoing basis.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize funding for FinCEN to develop an \nautomated ``alert database.'' FinCEN, an arm of the Department of the \nTreasury, tracks Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity \nReports, important tools in fighting money laundering. However, FinCEN \nofficials have told me that they lack a database which will \nautomatically alert them to patterns of suspicious activity that could \nindicate money laundering or other illicit activity. Such a database is \nimperative to enable FinCEN to adequately serve the law enforcement \nbodies that it supplies information to.\n  This bill will close gaps in our anti-money-laundering laws and \nregulations. I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Money Laundering Abatement \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Money laundering is a serious problem that enables \n     criminals to reap the rewards of their crimes by hiding the \n     criminal source of their profits.\n       (2) When carried out by using banks, money laundering \n     erodes the integrity of our financial institutions.\n       (3) United States financial institutions are a critical \n     link in our efforts to combat money laundering.\n       (4) In addition to organized crime enterprises, corrupt \n     government officials around the world increasingly employ \n     sophisticated money laundering schemes to conceal wealth they \n     have plundered or extorted from their nations or received as \n     bribes, and these practices weaken the legitimacy of foreign \n     states, threaten the integrity of international financial \n     markets, and harm foreign populations.\n       (5) Private banking is a growing activity among financial \n     institutions based in and operating in the United States.\n       (6) The high profitability, competition, high level of \n     secrecy, and close relationships of trust developed between \n     private bankers and their clients make private banking \n     vulnerable to money laundering.\n       (7) The use by United States bankers of financial centers \n     located outside of the United States that have weak financial \n     regulatory and reporting regimes and no transparency \n     facilitates global money laundering.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to eliminate the \n     weaknesses in Federal law that allow money laundering to \n     flourish, particularly in private banking activities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

be a federal crime to knowingly falsify or conceal \n     the identity of a financial institution customer.\n       An appropriation would be authorized for FinCEN, which \n     tracks reports filed by financial institutions under the Bank \n     Secrecy Act, to establish an automated system of alerting \n     authorities when multiple reports are filed regarding the \n     same customer.\n       United States courts would be given ``long-arm'' \n     jurisdiction over foreign persons and institutions that \n     commit money laundering offenses that occur in whole or part \n     in the United

Con. Res. 72\n\n       Whereas in 1999 approximately 300,000 individuals under the \n     age of 18 are participating in armed conflict in more than 30 \n     countries worldwide and hundreds of thousands more are at \n     risk of being conscripted at any given moment;\n       Whereas many of these children are forcibly conscripted \n     through kidnapping or coercion, while others join military \n     units due to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a \n     family member, or for their own personal safety;\n       Whereas many military commanders frequently force child \n     soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or \n     torture against their enemies, including against other \n     children;\n       Whereas many military commanders separate children from \n     their families in order to foster dependence on military \n     units and leaders, leaving children vulnerable to \n     manipulation, deep traumatization, and in need of \n     psychological counseling and rehabilitation;\n       Whereas child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions \n     and risk physical injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, \n     malnutrition, deformed backs and shoulders from carrying \n     overweight loads, and respiratory and skin infections;\n       Whereas many young female soldiers face the additional \n     psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, \n     being enslaved for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and \n     forced to endure severe social stigma should they return \n     home;\n       Whereas children in northern Uganda continue to be \n     kidnapped by the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) which is \n     supported and funded by the Government of Sudan and which has \n     committed and continues to commit gross human rights \n     violations in Uganda;\n       Whereas children in Sri Lanka have been forcibly recruited \n     by the opposition Tamil Tigers movement and forced to kill or \n     be killed in the armed conflict in that country;\n       Whereas an estimated 7,000 child soldiers have been \n     involved in the conflict in Sierra Leone, some as young as \n     age 10, with many being forced to commit extrajudicial \n     executions, torture, rape, and amputations for the rebel \n     Revolutionary United Front;\n       Whereas the international community is developing a \n     consensus on how to most effectively address the problem, and \n     toward this end, the United Nations has established a working \n     group to negotiate an optional international agreement on \n     child soldiers which would raise the legal age of recruitment \n     and participation in armed conflict to age 18;\n       Whereas on October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary \n     General Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United \n     Nations peacekeeping personnel that are made available by \n     member nations of the United Nations;\n       Whereas United Nations Under-Secretary General for \n     Peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet, announced in the Fourth \n     Committee of the General Assembly that contributing \n     governments of member nations were asked not to send civilian \n     police and military observers under the age of 25, and that \n     troops in national contingents should preferably be at least \n     21 years of age but in no case should they be younger than 18 \n     years of age;\n       Whereas on August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning \n     the use of children in armed conflicts;\n       Whereas in addressing the Security Council, the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary General for Children and \n     Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global \n     three-pronged approach to combat the use of children in armed \n     conflict: first, to raise the age limit for recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict from the present age of 15 to \n     the age of 18; second, to increase international pressure on \n     armed groups which currently abuse children; and third, to \n     address the political, social, and economic factors which \n     create an environment where children are induced by appeal of \n     ideology or by socio-economic collapse to become child \n     soldiers; and\n       Whereas the United States delegation to the United Nations \n     working group relating to child soldiers has opposed efforts \n     to raise the minimum age of participation in armed conflict \n     to the age of 18 despite the support of an overwhelming \n     majority of countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the Congress joins the international community in \n     condemning the use of children as soldiers by governmental \n     and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should not oppose current efforts to \n     negotiate an optional international agreement to raise the \n     international minimum age for military service to the age of \n     18;\n       (B) the Secretary of State should address positively and \n     expediently this issue in the next session of the United \n     Nations working group relating to child soldiers before this \n     process is abandoned by the international community; and\n       (C) the President and the Congress should work together to \n     enact a law that establishes a fund for the rehabilitation \n     and reintegration into society of child soldiers.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent \nresolution expressing condemnation of the use of children as soldiers \nand the belief that the United States should support and, where \npossible, lead efforts to establish and enforce international standards \ndesigned to end this abuse of human rights.\n  In 1999, an estimated 300,000 individuals under the age of 18, some \nas young as age 5, were serving as soldiers in dozens of armed \nconflicts around the world, some with armed insurgencies, and some in \nregular armies.\n  Over the past five years, children were combatants in at least 33 \ncountries around the world: in Africa, in the Americas, in Europe, the \nMiddle East and Persian Gulf, and in Asia.\n  Throughout the world, children are exploited by adults for cruel \npurposes. These children have no voice. Some children are kidnaped and \nforced to become combatants. In the conflict in Sierra Leone, rebel \narmies willfully conscripted children into their ranks after forcing \nthem to kill their family members and neighbors.\n  Once conscripted, many children are subject to brutal induction \nceremonies. The impact of the regular use of physical and emotional \nabuse involving degradation and humiliation of younger recruits to \n``indoctrinate'' discipline, and to induce fear of superiors usually \nresults in low self-esteem, guilt feelings and violent solutions to \nproblems.\n  In addition, children are treated like their adult counterparts. This \ncan have severe physical effects. Poor and inadequate food and medical \ncare have more serious implications for children, whose bodies are \nstill growing and may be weakened by the exertions of military life. \nChildren who cannot ``keep up'' are routinely killed by their leaders \nso that they cannot reveal any secrets.\n  Child soldiers are sometimes drugged so that they will fight even \nmore fiercely. They may be used as human shields, to protect the more \nvaluable, trained adult soldiers.\n  Some children may appear to become combatants of their own accord. \nThese are children--children without the capacity to judge what is in \ntheir own best interest. Children who are subject to subtle \nmanipulations by family and community members may succumb to pressures \nthat lead them to participate in hostilities.\n  Some children become so enraged by the violence against their \nfamilies and communities they become combatants to seek revenge. These \n``volunteers'' are children who have witnessed extremes of physical \nviolence, including death squad killings, disappearances, torture, \ndestruction of home or property and massacres. Young children seldom \nappreciate the dangers which they face. Alone, orphaned, frightened, \nbored, and frustrated, they will often finally choose to fight.\n\n  When a conflict has ended, child soldiers often do not receive any \nspecial treatment for their reintegration into civil society. Child \nsoldiers have different needs than adult soldiers and require special \nservices, such as education, training, and social and psychological \nrehabilitation.\n  Although child soldiers are subjected to unspeakable horrors, the \ninternational community has been slow in outlawing the use of children \nunder 18 in armed conflicts. Today, international law regarding child \nsoldiers is governed primarily by the UN Convention on the Rights of \nthe Child. The Convention states that children under 15 cannot be \nrecruited, conscripted, or made to participate in armed conflict. Every \ncountry in the United Nations, except the United States and Somalia has \nratified the Convention.\n  Currently, a number of governments are working in Geneva to establish \nan Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that \nwould raise the minimum age for recruitment and participation in \nconflict in 18. The\n\n[[Page S14575]]\n\nworking group has met over the past five years, but so far has been \nunable to reach consensus as to the wording and terms of the protocol. \nThis delay is in part due to the United States, which does not want to \ngive up its practice of recruiting youths under 18 for military \nservice.\n  Although in the United States conscription is limited to those 18 and \nover, the United States military has a long standing practice of \nrecruiting youths under the age of 18 and allowing them to be \ndesignated to fill combat positions. According to the U.S. Defense \nDepartment, children under the age of 18 make up less than one-half of \none percent of active U.S. troops, about 7,000 individuals. I urge the \nDefense Department to examine its policy of recruiting children under \nthe age of 18. Further, I urge the Defense Department to reassign those \nrecruits under 18 to non-combat positions and adopt a clear policy \nbarring those under 18 from participating in armed conflict. These \nsteps would bring the United States closer to the emerging \ninternational consensus regarding the minimum age for military service.\n  Further, to move forward, the United States government must drop its \nobjection to an international agreement establishing 18 as the minimum \nage for recruitment or participation in armed conflict. Since the \nUnited States is not even a party to the parent treaty, our opposition \nis inappropriate. The United States should not object to other \ncountries moving forward in protecting their children even if we choose \nnot to follow suit.\n  Mr. President, I speak today for these children who have grown up \nsurrounded by violence and can only see this as a permanent way of \nlife; for the children who are the victims of unfathomable terror and \nviolence; and, for the children who are forced to perpetrate equal \natrocities upon others.\n  I speak for the children who have no other voice to speak for them, \nand no voice to speak for themselves. I submit this resolution so that \nthe United States Congress can speak for these children.\n\n  I ask the United States Senate, as we look to the new millennium, to \nbegin the process whereby we eliminate the use of children as soldiers. \nI ask the Senate to give voice to these children and to future \ngenerations of children through passage of this concurrent resolution.\n  The resolution simply provides that (1) the Congress joins the \ninternational community in condemning the use of children as soldiers; \nand (2) it is the sense of the Congress that (A) the United States \nshould not oppose current efforts to negotiate an optional \ninternational agreement to raise the international minimum age for \nmilitary service to the age of 18; (B) The Secretary of State should \naddress positively and expediently this issue in the next session of \nthe United Nations working group relating to child soldiers before this \nprocess is abandoned by the international community; and (C) the \nPresident and the Congress should work together to enact a law that \nestablishes a fund for the rehabilitation and reintegration into \nsociety of child soldiers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14575-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14575-S14576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 73--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n                         REGARDING FREEDOM DAY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 73\n\n       Whereas on November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall was torn down \n     by those whom it had imprisoned;\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall has become the \n     preeminent symbol of the end of the Cold War;\n       Whereas the Cold War, at is essence, was a struggle for \n     human freedom;\n       Whereas the end of the Cold War was brought about in large \n     measure by the dedication, sacrifice, and discipline of \n     Americans and many other peoples around the world united in \n     their opposition to Soviet Communism;\n       Whereas freedom's victory on the Cold War against Soviet \n     Communism is the crowning achievement of the free world's \n     long 20th century struggle against totalitarianism; and\n       Whereas it is highly appropriate to remind Americans, \n     particularly those in their formal educational years, that \n     America paid the price and bore the burden to ensure the \n     survival of liberty on this planet: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a Freedom Day should be celebrated each year in the \n     United States; and\n       (2) the United States should join with other nations, \n     specifically including those which liberated themselves to \n     help end the Cold War, to establish a global holiday called \n     Freedom Day.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we have just marked the 10th \nanniversary of the fall of the Berln Wall, one of the most important \nmilestones of our era. In honor of this event, I am submitting a \nresolution urging that a ``Freedom Day'' be celebrated each year in the \nUnited States. It also calls on the United States to work with other \nnations to establish a global holiday called ``Freedom Day.'' The House \nalready passed an identical resolution, introduced by my friend House \nPolicy Chairman Christopher Cox, by a vote of 417-0, and it is my hope \nthat we can pass it in the Senate before adjournment.\n  A decade later, it is sometimes easy to forget the profound \nsignificance of November 9, 1989, the day that Berlin Wall came down. \nIt was the symbolic end of four decades of a Cold War that had \ndominated our foreign and defense policies and threatened international \nstability. The Cold War's end was a resounding success for the United \nStates and the international community, that set off a worldwide \nmovement toward greater democratization and the embrace of free \nmarkets.\n  In the United States, credit for this success can be generously \ndistributed to generations of American leaders, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, who never wavered in their courageous determination to \ncontain the Soviet Union and resist totalitarianism. The end of the \nCold War was truly a bi-partisan effort and a national achievement, and \nis a model of cooperation that we should not forget as we seek to \naddress the international concerns we face now and in the future.\n  The fall of the wall was a transcendent moment in the struggle \nagainst totalitarianism and for democracy, a smashing victory for the \nhuman spirit and the cause of human rights. It is only fitting that we \nchoose the anniversary of this epochal triumph to honor and celebrate \nfreedom's march of progress across the planet.\n  This effort to establish a ``Freedom Day,'' in recognition of the end \nof the Cold War, was inspired by my good friend Ben Wattenberg, Senior \nFellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a long time champion of \nfreedom and democracy. His recent column entitled ``moving Forward With \nFreedom Day'' is particularly noteworthy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of Mr. \nWattenberg's column be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Moving Forward With Freedom Day\n\n       Ten years ago, on Nov. 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall was \n     battered down by the people it had imprisoned. The event is \n     regarded as the moment the Cold War ended. For Americans \n     without sentiment memories of World War II, the end of the \n     Cold War has been the most momentous historical event of \n     their lifetimes, and so it will likely remain.\n       Long yearned for, the end of the Cold War has more than \n     lived up to expectations: Democracy is on the march globally, \n     defense budgets are proportionately down, market economies \n     are beginning to flourish most everywhere, everyday people \n     are benefiting each and every day.\n       The end of the Cold War actually was a process, not an \n     event. By early 1989, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had \n     pulled his troops from Afghanistan, whipped. Poles elected a \n     noncommunist government; the Soviets did nothing. Hungary, \n     Czechoslovakia, East Germany and later Bulgaria installed \n     non-communist governments. It was called ``the velvet \n     revolution,'' with only Romania the exception; Nicolae \n     Ceausescu and his empress were executed.\n       For almost two years, the U.S.S.R. remained a one-party \n     communist state, gradually eroding. Hard-liners attempted to \n     resist the slow motion dis-memberment. On Aug. 19, 1991, \n     Boris Yeltsin stood on a tank to resist a hard-line coup. The \n     hammer-and-sickle came down; the Russian tricolor went up. \n     Other Soviet republics declared independence, including the \n     big guy on the block, Ukraine.\n       U.S. diplomats did not ``gloat'' about it. The sovereign \n     state of Russia would be unstable enough without the United \n     States rubbing it in.\n       On Dec. 4, 1991, I proposed in a column that a new national \n     holiday be established to\n\n[[Page S14576]]\n\n     commemorate the end of the Cold War. I asked readers to \n     participate in a contest to: 1. Name it; 2. pick a date; and \n     3. propose a method of celebration.\n       Several hundred submissions came in. Some of the most \n     imaginative entries for a name were: ``Defrost Day,'' ``Thaw \n     Day,'' ``Ronald Reagan Day,'' ``Gorbachev Day,'' ``Borscht \n     Day,'' ``Peace Through Strength Day,'' ``E Day'' (which would \n     stand for ``Evil Empire Ends Day''), ``E2D2'' (``Evil Empire \n     Death Day''), ``Jericho Day,'' ``Pax Americana Day'' and \n     ``Kerensky Future Freedom Day'' (recalling that Mr. Yeltsin \n     was not the first pro-democratic leader of Russia).\n       Scores of respondents offered ``Liberty Day,'' ``Democracy \n     Day,'' and, mostly, ``Freedom Day.'' In June of 1992, I \n     publicly proclaimed '`Freedom Day'' the winner.\n       One suggestion for the date of the new holiday was June 5, \n     for Adam Smith's birthday. But the most votes went for Nov. \n     9, the day the wall fell. So today I proclaim that date \n     Freedom Day.\n       There were ideas about how to celebrate and commemorate \n     Freedom Day: Build a sibling sculpture to the statue of \n     Liberty; eat potatoes, the universal food; build a tunnel to \n     Russia across the Bering Strait; thank God for peace; welcome \n     immigrants; meditate; issue a U.N. stamp; build ice \n     sculptures; send money to feed Russians; and do something you \n     can't do in an unfree country--make a public speech, see a \n     dirty movie, celebrate a religion, travel across a border.\n       I propose that discussion on the matter of how to celebrate \n     be put on hold until we get the holiday established.\n       How? Because all the major presidential candidates \n     participated in the Cold War, they should endorse the \n     holiday. Legislators ought to push for it. Anyone who worked \n     in a defense industry, or paid federal taxes from 1945 to \n     1989, ought to support it. President Clinton ought to go to \n     the Reagan Library to endorse it.\n       I met with Mark Burman of the Reagan Presidential \n     Foundation. He says they are on board for a campaign. The \n     other great presidential libraries--Truman, Eisenhower, \n     Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter--should join in.\n       So should anyone concerned with the teaching of American \n     history. The holiday will remind American children that their \n     recent ancestors preserved freedom. The Cold War generation \n     may not be ``the greatest'' but they did their job--victory \n     without a major hot war.\n       Americans can only create an American holiday. But we ought \n     to invite all other countries to join in, Russia first. The \n     citizens of Russia won the Cold War as surely as we did. If I \n     were a Chinese dissident I'd promote the idea; it might give \n     their leaders a clue.\n       If you like the idea, or have ideas, you may e-mail me at \n     Watmail@aol.com. I'll pass the correspondence along to the \n     appropriate persons, as soon as I figure out who they are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14576-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 231--REFERRING S. 1456 ENTITLED ``A BILL FOR THE \nRELIEF OF ROCCO A.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the right of privacy is a longstanding personal right \n     embedded in United States history and jurisprudence;\n       (2) the openness of Government records, procedures, and \n     actions has become increasingly important in recent years, \n     and should remain so in a free and democratic society;\n       (3) the use of electronic data collection, storage, \n     communications, transfer, and usage has increased \n     exponentially, thus heightening the potential impact upon \n     individual privacy;\n       (4) national surveys indicate that the growth and expansion \n     of technology has resulted in concern regarding electronic \n     data privacy for more than 80 percent of United States \n     citizens;\n       (5) currently, there is no uniform Government policy \n     addressing either Government or private sector uses of \n     personal data;\n       (6) the right of individual privacy must be weighed against \n     legitimate uses of personal information that benefit the \n     public good; and\n       (7) the private sector has made notable efforts to self-\n     regulate privacy protection, especially in the online \n     environment, but there remains room for improvement.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     study commission to--\n       (1) examine the implications of new and existing \n     technologies on individual privacy;\n       (2) ensure appropriate privacy protection of both \n     Government and private sector uses of personal information, \n     recognizing that a balance exists between individual rights \n     and the public good including the legitimate needs of law \n     enforcement;\n       (3) identify Government efforts to establish privacy \n     policy, including recommendations for improved coordination \n     among Government agencies, and foreign governments, and if \n     necessary, legislative proposals;\n       (4) evaluate new technology (i.e. biometrics) to enhance \n     electronic data privacy; and\n       (5) study the extent, need, and feasibility of individual \n     control over personal information.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my fellow \nNew Yorker George Gabriel on the occasion of his 90th birthday. George \nhas been a war veteran, tennis instructor, lawyer, and vice president \nof Broadcast Music, Incorporated (B.M.I.). His family will always know \nhim for his love of classical music, quick wit, and pertinent advice.\n  During World War II, George was stationed in Australia and the \nPhilippines. He distinguished himself as a member of the Army's code-\nbreaking operations, reading enciphered cables intercepted from Japan. \nThis might explain his affinity for the always challenging New York \nTimes crossword puzzles!\n  After the war, he graduated from Brooklyn Law School and went to work \nfor B.M.I. His work in the field of music copyright prompted a quick \nrise up the corporate ladder. He was eventually promoted to the \nposition of vice president, where he remained until the time of his \nretirement.\n  Yet, for all his professional achievements, it is his personal life \nthat gives him the most fulfillment. This epochal moment marks a grand \nachievement for a man who is a mentor to grandchildren, nieces, and \nnephews. I offer my prayers to George for continued good health and \ncheer, and close with a particularly apt Irish blessing:\n\n     May joy and peace surround you,\n     Contentment latch your door,\n     And happiness be with you now,\n     And bless you evermore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14578-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14578-S14579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, several weeks ago the Senate \nwisely rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Much was written \nabout how the debate evolved here in the Senate. As one closely \ninvolved in this historic debate, I submit for the Record an excellent \narticle in the November 8 issue of National Review by Richard Lowry.\n  The article follows.\n\n                [From the National Review, Nov. 8, 1999]\n\n                              Test-Ban Ban\n\n                           (By Richard Lowry)\n\n       ``If we had a hearing and had a vote on the CTBT, we would \n     win overwhelmingly.''\n       --Sen. Joe Biden, July 29, 1998\n       Jesse Helms mounted his motorized cart and left the \n     Republican cloakroom, just off the Senate floor. Arizona \n     senator Jon Kyl was right behind him. Georgia's Paul \n     Coverdell got word in his office and immediately headed out \n     the door. All were converging on the offices of majority \n     leader Trent Lott late Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 12, as Senate \n     staffers and others buzzed of an imminent deal to avoid a \n     vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Minority leader \n     Tom Daschle had just offered Lott a treaty-saving agreement. \n     Now the small group of Republicans-after clearing Lott's \n     cramped conference room of all staff, to ensure privacy--\n     would decide whether the Senate would vote down a major \n     international treaty for the first time in 80 years.\n       Their decision would be the culmination of months of work, \n     and it would determine whether the congressional wing of the \n     GOP would win its most significant victory since welfare \n     reform in 1996. They knew they had a strong case on the \n     merits. Defeating the treaty would, among other things, fit \n     into a two-pronged national-security strategy featuring both \n     missile defense and nuclear deterrence; deterrence is \n     impossible without a safe, reliable American arsenal of the \n     sort that the treaty would endanger. Shrewd GOP tactics and a \n     series of Democratic miscalculations had brought the treaty \n     to the brink, and now the senators were back where they had \n     started--around that conference table--pondering whether to \n     push it over the edge.\n       The first meeting in Lott's office had been in late April, \n     when those same four began a quiet, well-organized effort to \n     defeat the treaty. Kyl was the point man. A bright, serious-\n     minded conservative and an authority on arms control, he had \n     hosted meetings of anti-treaty staff as early as February. \n     Soon after, he enlisted the help of Coverdell, always an \n     important behind-the-scenes Senate player. Treaty opponents \n     realized from the beginning that they would be wise to learn \n     from their defeat on the  Chemical Weapons Convention two \n     years earlier, when Lott undercut them at the last minute. \n     The first lesson? Get Lott on board early.\n       At the April meeting, Lott indicated his opposition to the \n     treaty but said that no decisions could be made until the \n     group determined how many Republicans were with them. So, in \n     early May, treaty opponents began the first in a series of \n     careful ``whip checks'' of how GOP Senators intended to vote. \n     They gave wide berth to Senators who were likely to support \n     the treaty or might spread word that something was afoot. \n     ``There were 15 to 20 members we didn't even ask,'' says a \n     Senate aide. The first count showed 24 votes against the \n     treaty--10 short of the number needed to stop it--with \n     another 11 ``leaning against.''\n       Around this time, an internal debate among treaty opponents \n     was close to resolution, at least in the minds of Kyl and \n     Coverdell. The question had been whether it was better to \n     ``go fast''--gather the votes to defeat the treaty, then vote \n     on it right away--or ``go slow,'' in the hope of bottling it \n     up forever. The ``go fast'' advocates figured treaty \n     opponents would only lose strength as the November 2000 \n     elections neared. With the approach of Election Day, Senators \n     would want to avoid any controversial vote, while the White \n     House would benefit from additional time to hammer its \n     opponents. The chemical-weapons fight had demonstrated the \n     awesome communications power of the administration. Why wait \n     for it to shift into gear?\n       In early August, Lott was shown a binder full of clips--op-\n     eds and letters--that supported the treaty, which seemed to \n     indicate that the administration's push for it was underway. \n     For a long time, treaty opponents had feared the \n     administration would use a September conference commemorating \n     the third anniversary of the treaty's signing as a deadline \n     for Senate action. A July 20 letter from all the Senate \n     Democrats--demanding hearings and a vote by October--seemed \n     to confirm this plan. A fall treaty fight would coincide \n     nicely with the period in which Republicans would be \n     scrambling to pass appropriations bills. Democrats would have \n     leverage to threaten to bollix up the spending process--\n     creating the conditions for another ``government shutdown''--\n     unless Republicans released the treaty.\n       Lott settled on a three-part interim strategy: (1) Helms--\n     with 25 years' experience opposing ill-conceived arms-control \n     treaties--would continue to hold up the treaty in his Foreign \n     Relations Committee; (2) meanwhile, influential former \n     national-security officials would continue to be lined up in \n     opposition to it; and (3) Kyl and Coverdell would continue to \n     work the vote count. By the time of a Sept. 14 meeting in \n     Lott's office, Kyl could guarantee 34 votes in opposition--\n     just enough. He could also deliver the energetic help of \n     former secretary of defense (and secretary of energy) James \n     Schlesinger.\n       Before long, the education effort by treaty opponents was \n     in full swing. Kyl's staff prepared briefing books to \n     distribute to other Senate staffers. Two nuclear-weapons \n     experts who had worked in the labs briefed senators both \n     individually and in small groups. And Schlesinger, who had \n     served in both Republican and Democratic administrations, \n     spoke at a luncheon for Republican Senators, then returned \n     for more briefings the following week. ``He was key to us,'' \n     says the Senate aide. The effort began to show in the \n     steadily rising vote count: Sept. 14-34 opposed; Sept. 17-35; \n     Sept. 22-38; Sept. 30--an amazing 42.\n       At the same time, Democrats heedlessly stepped up their \n     agitation for action on the treaty. North Dakota Senator \n     Byron Dorgan\n\n[[Page S14579]]\n\n     was threatening to tie up Senate business, getting under \n     Lott's skin. ``They were a huge influence on the decision to \n     say, `Okay, let's just hold this vote,' '' says Coverdell \n     about the Democrats. On Sept. 28, Biden showed Helms a \n     resolution that he planned to offer, proposing hearings on \n     the treaty this year and a vote by March 31, 2000. Biden's \n     ploy seemed to indicate that the Democrats now planned to \n     raise the temperature on the treaty in the spring, when it \n     would get enmeshed in the presidential campaign and discomfit \n     George W. Bush. As a result, Lott decided to move. He quietly \n     reassured Biden that his resolution would be unnecessary.\n       On Sept. 30, Lott offered a ``unanimous consent'' \n     agreement--all Senators have to sign on to such an agreement \n     for it to go into effect--to bring up the treaty for an \n     immediate vote. Daschle objected, charging that, among other \n     things, there wasn't enough time for debate. Lott gave the \n     Democrats the additional time they wanted, and on Oct. 1, \n     Daschle lent his support to a new agreement. There would be a \n     vote on the treaty within two weeks. Every Democrat in the \n     Senate had endorsed the timing--and this was a mistake of \n     major proportions.\n       Why did the Democrats do it? In part, they were trapped by \n     their own rhetoric. Gleeful GOP staffers had a sheaf of \n     statements from Democrats demanding a treaty vote this year. \n     How could they back out now? They were also probably unaware \n     of the direness of their situation. ``It was plain \n     arrogance,'' says Kyl. ``They didn't have any idea they \n     wouldn't win.'' Democrats also might have figured that they \n     could, if necessary, cut a last-minute deal with Lott to \n     avert a vote. The final days of the treaty fight featured a \n     panicked Democratic effort to reverse course and do just \n     that, even as the vote count against them continued to mount: \n     Oct. 1-43 against; Oct. 7-45.\n       Lott was still open to avoiding a vote, but only if he \n     could get an ironclad agreement from the Democrats that it \n     would not come up again for the duration of the Clinton \n     administration. It was this possibility--and the wiggle room \n     the administration would surely find in any such deal--that \n     had treaty opponents on edge. ``We were nervous until the \n     vote took place that something was going to sidetrack it,'' \n     says Arkansas Senator Tim Hutchinson. On Oct. 12, Daschle \n     sent Lott a letter proposing to shelve the treaty, barring \n     ``unforeseen changes.'' Lott promised to run it by his \n     members. Hence the call that brought Helms, Kyl, and \n     Coverdell dashing to Lott's office. Daschle's staff was \n     already telling reporters that a deal was at hand, prompting \n     yet another treaty opponent, Oklahoma's Jim Inhofe, to sprint \n     to Lott's office unbidden.\n       Kyl, Helms, and Coverdell huddled with Lott over Daschle's \n     proposal. What did ``unforeseen changes'' mean? Coverdell \n     thought it was a ``glaring escape clause.'' The consensus of \n     the group was that it was unacceptable. ``We couldn't have \n     had a more calm, considerate discussion,'' says Kyl. ``Lott \n     didn't need to be persuaded or harangued in the least.'' \n     There was a brief discussion of going back to the Democrats \n     with a draft of a foolproof deal. But it dawned on everyone \n     that any deal would be impossible. The Democrats weren't \n     serious, and some Republicans were unwilling to go along no \n     matter what. Inhofe, arriving at Lott's office, emphasized \n     just that. The only way out, as one Senate aide puts it, \n     would have been ``an internal Republican bloodbath.''\n       So, the next day, all systems were go. Lott firmly rejected \n     a last-minute floor attempt by Democratic lion Robert Byrd to \n     place obstacles in the way of a vote. Byrd threw a fit--to no \n     avail. It was too late. Republican Senator John Warner was \n     running around the floor, still gathering signatures on a \n     letter asking that the vote be put off. Again, too late. \n     President Clinton called Lott, asking if there was anything \n     he could do. Replied Lott: Too late. When the floor debate \n     was concluded, 51 Republican Senators voted down the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in the face of international \n     pressure, the opposition of the White House, and hostile \n     media.\n       Surprising? Well, yes. ``I thought we had 50,'' says Jon \n     Kyl.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14579-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF JULIE ROLING\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nappreciation for the hard work of Julie Roling, a Brookings Institution \nFellow who has worked as part of my staff for the past six months. \nJulie has been a tremendous asset to my legislative staff, and I am \nfortunate to have had her assistance. When she returns to the National \nSecurity Agency in December, I know she will be missed by me and my \nstaff.\n  Very often, Brookings Fellows have reputations that precede them in \nCapitol Hill offices. Known as some of the best and brightest \ngovernment employees, they are considered secret weapons to the Members \nthey assist. Julie has been no exception. She came to my office with a \nwealth of government experience and policy knowledge, as well as a \nmodel work ethic and positive attitude. While her expertise lies in \ndefense procurement, Julie welcomed projects in a broad array of new \nissue areas and contributed a great deal to my legislative staff.\n  Throughout the past six months, Julie has worked on a number of \nprojects dealing with the environment, natural resources, agriculture \nand trade. Julie led research efforts regarding a controversial \nwetlands policy during her time in my office. The unfortunate \ncircumstances surrounding this issue pitted the interests of \nagricultural producers against environmental groups. It was imperative \nthat my staff and I have access to the most recent information, in \norder to effectively address the concerns of my constituents. Julie's \nresearch provided my office with up-to-date and unbiased information \nthat enabled me to communicate clearly with both farmers and \nenvironmentalists during this time. Julie handled frequent \ncommunication with government agencies and almost daily communications \nwith South Dakotans.\n  Julie also provided valuable assistance on crop insurance legislation \nthis year as well. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate \nintroduced numerous bills to reform the crop insurance program in this \nCongress, an issue of great importance to the farmers of South Dakota. \nJulie collected and synthesized information that enabled me and my \nstaff to decide which crop insurance reform bills most effectively \naddressed the concerns of South Dakota farmers.\n  One of the most challenging tasks Julie undertook was the creation of \na comprehensive resource guide regarding restructuring of the \nelectricity industry. The end result of Julie's work was a thorough \nindex of restructuring terms, industry positions, key issues and \nlegislative proposals. Anyone who is familiar with the complexity of \nderegulation proposals can appreciate the hard work and attention to \ndetail required to create such a resource, which will be invaluable to \nme as the Senate Energy Committee continues to discuss and evaluate \nrestructuring legislation.\n  Again, I wish to express my deep gratitude to Julie for a job well \ndone. I wish her the very best in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14579-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO CIVIL WAR HERO FREDERICK ALBER\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate Frederick Alber of Lapeer County, MI. On November 13, 1999, the \ncommunity of Oregon Township will dedicate a new headstone for Mr. \nAlber and also honor other veterans buried in the Oregon Township \nCemetery.\n  Frederick Alber enlisted in the Seventeenth Michigan Infantry on July \n2, 1862 at age 24 and served valiantly during the Civil War. On July \n30, 1896, Private Alber was issued the Medal of Honor for his undaunted \nbravery in the wilderness and his heroic actions at Spotsylvania. On \nMay 12, 1864, Private Alber rescued Lieutenant Charles Todd of the 17th \nMichigan Infantry who was in the hands of a party of rebels. Private \nAlber shot down one enemy rebel and knocked over another with the butt \nof his musket. He then took the rebels as prisoners and conducted them \nboth to the rear of the formation.\n  The Civil War is one of the most important events in our nation's \nhistory. Thanks to the brave actions of soldiers like Frederick Alber, \nwe are a united, free country. It is only fitting that we remember the \ngreat sacrifices made by those who have gone before us. The marker \ndedication at Frederick Alber's grave site is a meaningful way to \nremember and honor the past heroes of our country and is an appropriate \nmanner in which to salute our cherished liberties.\n  I join the entire community of Oregon Township and Lapeer County as \nthey pay their respects to a real American hero, Frederick \nAlber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14579-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14579-S14580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO RICHARD P.

He has now \nretired to Las Vegas, Nevada where he is able to enjoy this new venture \nwith members of his family.\n\n[[Page S14580]]\n\n  Mr. Augulis joined the National Weather Service in August 1961 as a \nWeather Bureau Student Trainee at WBAS Midway Airport while attending \nSt. Louis University. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Meteorology \nin 1963 and added a Masters Degree in 1967. He distinguished himself in \na variety of forecasting and management positions--in Salt Lake City; \nAnchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska; Garden City, New York; and, finally, \nKansas City.\n  Beginning in 1974, as Meteorologist in Charge of the new Fairbanks \nWeather Forecast Office, Mr. Augulis presided over a staff that \noperated service programs during the exciting and challenging times of \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline construction. Mr. Augulis' leadership was \nalso invaluable to employees during the mid-1970s when the National \nWeather Service implemented the Automation of Field Operations (AFOS) \ncommunications network, making a breakthrough transition from teletype \nto computers.\n  Mr. Augulis' last decade with the National Weather Service included \nthe largest modernization and reorganization ever undertaken by the \nagency. He helped guide his region through the introduction and \nimplementation of state-of-the-art Doppler radar, computer-enhanced \nweather modeling and forecasting, and restructuring from more than 300 \noffices of varying sizes and capabilities to an efficient network of \n123 21st Century Weather Forecast Offices across the United States.\n  Mr. Augulis has served proudly as an employee and a manager of the \nNational Weather Service. He is a distinguished executive branch \nemployee whose accomplishments reflect credit on himself, the National \nWeather Service and our nation.\n  On this occasion, I am honored to join his family, friends and \ncolleagues as we recognize Richard P.

Mr. President, in the days since the untimely \ndeath of our beloved friend and colleague, Senator John Chafee, we have \nheard numerous testimonies to the impact Senator Chafee had on the \nlives of those who were fortunate enough to associate with him. From \nthose with whom he served, both in Rhode Island and here on the floor \nof this august body, we have heard of his skills as a statesman and his \nbenevolent manner as a friend. I am sure all of us are also aware of \nthe love and pride he felt for those who were most important in his \nlife--his family.\n  We would be remiss, however, if we did not also acknowledge another \nset of lives that Senator Chafee touched--those of his staff. His \nsignificance in their lives is perhaps best reflected in the story of \nDavid Griswold, Senator Chafee's chief-of-staff.\n  As a friend of Senator Chafee's, I wanted to thank Dave for the \ninvaluable assistance that he provided the Senator over the past 23 \nyears. A recent article in the Providence Journal reflects on the years \nthat Dave worked with Senator Chafee for the people of Rhode Island and \nthe people of this great nation. This article, which is a thoughtful \nreflection on Dave's 23 years of dedicated service, captures \nbeautifully the loyalty, modesty and sincerity with which he did his \njob. I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the Providence Journal-Bulletin, Oct. 30, 1999]\n\n                Aide Became a Reflection of John Chafee\n\n\n in a 23-year journey, David J. Griswold rose from being the senator's \n                driver to serving as his chief of staff\n\n                        (By Maria Miro Johnson)\n\n       U.S. Sen. John H. Chafee in a bowling alley.\n       That was a bad night, says David J. Griswold, reflecting \n     yesterday on his life alongside the man he'd served for 23 \n     years.\n       Griswold started out as his go-fer and driver, then rose \n     through the ranks to become his chief of staff, a position he \n     has held for 10 years.\n       Now he sat in the senator's sunny office on Dorrance \n     Street, having just come from a service, which he wrote \n     himself, at the State House rotunda. His mind, he said, was \n     ``numb.'' At one point, he interrupted himself in mid-\n     sentence ``It's so hurtful to be referring to him in the past \n     tense, I cannot tell you.''\n       But he also laughed now and then to recall certain stories. \n     Such as the bowling alley story.\n       It was an October day in 1982, says Griswold, the closing \n     days of a tense reelection campaign against Democratic Atty. \n     Gen. Julius Michaelson. President Ronald Reagan had tumbled \n     in the polls and people were anxious about the economy. \n     Republicans feared people might vote Democratic simply to \n     signal their displeasure with the president.\n       Griswold, working as a scheduler then in Chafee's \n     Providence office, had an idea: Why not campaign in a \n     Cranston bowling alley on a Saturday night? The place was \n     sure to be full of good-natured Rhode Islanders.\n       Chafee had never campaigned in a bowling alley, Griswold is \n     sure, ``he said, `All right, we'll try this.' '' So they \n     loaded up the car with brochures and headed for the lanes on \n     Elmwood Avenue.\n       ``And it was awful,'' says Griswold. The place was full of \n     kids and teenagers, the adult leagues having bowled during \n     the week. ``They didn't know who he was. They weren't rude, \n     but they were just not tuned in. Many of them were not even \n     voting age.''\n       Nonetheless, ``we schlepped along dowwwn one side and \n     baaaaack up the other side,'' with Chafee shaking every hand. \n     ``He must've been just ready to burst and I was feeling like \n     I wanted to die, 'cause I knew immediately, `Oh boy, this was \n     not a good idea.' ''\n       Griswold drove the senator home to Warwick, and that's when \n     ``he let me have it.''\n       ``He said, `Whose idea was this? That was the biggest waste \n     of time I ever had. Don't you know how tired I am? Don't you \n     know how stressful this is? What was the point of wasting \n     time in there with that crowd? They weren't very friendly\n       ``And I said, `Senator, it was my idea. I'm sorry.' And he \n     was very quiet. The whole way home, neither of us said \n     anything, and I dropped him off.''\n       The next day, Griswold returned from some errands to find a \n     phone message: ``Senator Chafee called. He called to say that \n     he was sorry that he was cross with you last night. He \n     appreciates everything you do, and he's very proud of you.''\n       ``I saved that note,'' says Griswold. ``Here it was Sunday \n     before the election. We were all in a state of terror. I \n     would have forgiven him for being much worse to me than he \n     had been. I would have forgiven him for hitting me. . . .\n       ``I fell in love with him forever at that point. That made \n     me know I would stay with this organization for as long as \n     the door would open.''\n       David J. Griswold, 45, grew up in Warwick, the son of David \n     F. and Nancy Griswold, a salesman and a secretary, both of \n     them Republicans who ``revered'' John Chafee, as did so many \n     members of their generation.\n       Over the years, he says, parents of younger staffers have \n     expressed the same feeling his own parents did that working \n     for Chafee ``lifted up their families'' and made them proud.\n       Griswold was only 14 when, in 1968, he first encountered \n     then-Governor Chafee, who was throwing a rally at Providence \n     City Hall for Nelson Rockefeller, who was seeking the \n     Republican nomination for president.\n       ``I heard about it and came downtown,'' says Griswold. ``In \n     those days, we didn't have C-Span and all these constant \n     reports of everything, minute by minute. When a presidential \n     candidate came to Providence, Rhode Island, it was a big \n     deal.''\n       The teenager handed out fliers directing people to City \n     Hall, and then he went to the rally himself. The speeches \n     were great, he said, and afterward, Chafee shook Griswold's \n     hand. ``It was thrilling.''\n       Later, as Griswold headed to the Outlet building to catch a \n     bus, a limo came rolling by. ``And Rockefeller looks out of \n     the car and gives me a thumbs-up. And I knew in that split \n     second it was me that he was gesturing to. And it was \n     magical. And then in a flash, the care was gone and the \n     day was over and real life returned. . . .\n       But ``that day, I began to love politics because I had made \n     a connection with this figure and had felt that he was \n     reaching out to me.''\n       Griswold kept volunteering for Republicans, kept going down \n     to defeat after defeat. (Republicans in Rhode Island, says \n     Griswold, are ``a pathetically lonely, small community.'') \n     And it wasn't until 1975, when he was a 21-year-old \n     Providence College student, that he encountered Chafee again.\n       Chafee had lost his first Senate race to Claiborne Pell in \n     1972, but was gearing up for a run in '76.\n       ``Oh, he didn't know me from Adam,'' says Griswold of their \n     meeting at Chafee's headquarters in the Turks Head Building. \n     ``I was one of a hundred people, but he made me feel as if he \n     and I connected.''\n       The day after graduating from PC, Griswold joined Senator \n     Chafee's staff. He has never looked back.\n       One of his early jobs was to drive the senator to his \n     appointments. Though Chafee was a friendly enough passenger, \n     Griswold made it a practice to speak only when spoken to. For \n     one thing, he was nervous about getting lost which, at time, \n     he did.\n       Inevitably, he says it was Chafee who got them back on \n     track ``He knew all the roads of Rhode Island. He knew every \n     village in the State.'' Realizing that Griswold felt awful \n     about it, he'd say,'' `Well, you know David, if that's the \n     worst thing you ever do, you don't have much to worry about.'\n       ``It always felt so good to hear that.''\n       After his reelection in 1982, Chafee was aware that \n     Griswold was a conscientious\n\n[[Page S14581]]\n\n     worrywart and was a bit afraid of inviting him to be one of \n     his legislative assistants in Washington.\n       ``He valued thoroughness,'' says Griswold. ``He valued the \n     willingness to stay until the job was done at night. He \n     valued commitment and honesty. He valued when you didn't know \n     the answer to something, you said, `Senator, I don't know,' \n     rather than inventing a guess about what the answer might be, \n     because that would just be a waste of time.''\n       Griswold went on to become Chafee's chief legislative \n     assistant, then his legislative director, then his chief of \n     staff.\n       One former colleague, Christine C. Ferguson, now head of \n     the state Department of Human Services, worked closely with \n     Griswold from 1981 to 1995 ``some of the best working years \n     of my life.''\n       Unlike some chiefs of staff, who are ``really political \n     animals, operators, very slick,'' she says, ``David is very \n     much a reflection of John Chafee.''\n       As Griswold recalls those days, the work of advising Chafee \n     could be ``painful.''\n       He and Ferguson were always having to remind the senator of \n     the political ramifications of his upcoming votes. ``We would \n     say things like, `What good is it to know you're gonna do the \n     right thing if in the end, you lose an election and you can't \n     come back here and try to keep on doing what you're doing?'\n       ``And he struggled. I remember nights that he would pound \n     his fist on the desk and say to us, `Thank you. I've heard \n     enough.' ''\n       Griswold was seldom sure how Chafee would end up voting \n     when he went to the floor ``He had his own compass.''\n       Griswold sometimes warns young applicants for staff jobs \n     that it's easier to work for a conservative or a liberal than \n     for a moderate like Chafee, ``because you at least start out \n     kind of knowing where you're headed.''\n       On the other hand, ``it made us do our jobs better. You \n     really had to think to step back from each question and try \n     to look at it from everybody's side.''\n       Over the years, Griswold became ``very slightly less \n     afraid'' of Chafee, but still never called him by his first \n     name, always ``Senator.'' Frankly, he says, he resented \n     staffers who did otherwise, because it presumed an equality \n     that could never exist. (Chafee, for his part, never \n     complained about it, Griswold says.)\n       ``This is the biggest person that has served this state in \n     this century,'' he said, ``in terms of length of tenure, in \n     terms of types of jobs he's done, in terms of the barriers \n     he's broken politically and in terms of just his \n     statesmanship.''\n       When it's pointed out that Griswold has given his entire \n     adult life to serving Chafee, he says that in fact, it's \n     Chafee who has given him something. ``He's given me \n     opportunities at every turn which I could not have expected I \n     was ready for.''\n       In recent years, Chafee has reminded Griswold to ``smell \n     the roses'' and indeed, Griswold has eased up a bit on work. \n     ``Ironically,'' he says, ``it is he that I wanted to be \n     smelling roses.''\n       Griswold had known that the senator was ailing, and that \n     the job was requiring more of a struggle. But he was active \n     to the end.\n       ``He had made a wonderful speech, just three or four days \n     before his death, at the National Cathedral to a hugh \n     gathering of the National Trust for Historic \n     Preservation.''\n       Chafee had worked hard on the speech, and it won him a \n     standing ovation from the crowd of 2,000 people. ``He felt \n     pumped up and he knew he'd done a good job.''\n       Then, last weekend, Chafee called Griswold to say he wasn't \n     feeling well, and needed to cancel two planned events. \n     Griswold thought he heard something different in his voice.\n       ``I think he was always prepared for everything,'' he says \n     even death. ``He was a person of faith and a person with a \n     compass that guided him and he was ready even when he was \n     unprepared, in the sense of having no script in hand just \n     ready to do what he was called to do, and do it with grace.''\n       On Sunday night, at about 8, Griswold got the call from \n     Chafee's daughter, Georgia Nassikas.\n       ``When I heard her voice, my heart just fell to the floor. \n     I knew this had to be something bad.'' But the way she said \n     the last three words ``my father died'' with such composure \n     and strength, helped Griswold.\n       He realized ``this was where we were now,'' and felt \n     prepared.\n       Nonetheless, as he paced around the room with the phone in \n     his hand, he found himself double-checking his facts: `` `Did \n     you tell me now that your dad has died?' '' he asked. ``And \n     she laughed, and said yes.''\n       Such, he says, are the habits born of working for John \n     Chafee.\n       So many logistical details are involved in helping arrange \n     today's massive funeral that Griswold has had no time to \n     grieve.\n       It's as if the funeral was one more big project, which the \n     staff is handling as it has handled so many others through \n     the years. ``At any given point in the process, we've all \n     thought he might walk in and say, `Well, how's this coming \n     along, folks?' ''\n       Now, every morning, when Griswold wakes up, it takes him a \n     moment to remember that ``the world is different now, \n     completely different. . . . I never thought he'd leave. I \n     never believed that John Chafee would leave. And it's scary \n     to me, not to have him.''\n       In the smallest, most everyday actions just making a phone \n     call Griswold remembers him. It's always, Hello, this is \n     David Griswold with Senator Chafee.\n       ``I had five names. David Griswold With Senator Chafee.

Dr. John O. Lusins of Oneonta, New York will \ncelebrate his sixtieth birthday. In his five decades, this New Yorker \nhas grown from a childhood war refugee into a beloved husband, devoted \nphysician, respected oenophile, and caring father of five children. \nSuffice to say, Dr. Lusins has accomplished the American dream. I wish \nhim hearty congratulations on this achievement.\n  Named after his physician father, John O. Lusins was born December \n15th, 1939 in the Baltic country of Latvia. At age twelve, John and his \nmother, Elza, immigrated to the United States after being displaced for \nseveral years as a result of World War II. Seeking a better life after \nwitnessing the atrocities in Europe, the two lived briefly in \nGreensboro, North Carolina before settling in Yonkers, New York.\n  John entered the Andrus Home for Children at age fifteen, and proved \nhimself to be an anomaly among his peers by graduating from Charles E. \nGorton High School in 1958. With continued perseverance, Lusins, under \nthe aegis of a SURDNA scholarship, went on to graduate from Columbia \nUniversity in 1963 and the Albany School of Medicine in 1967.\n  During these years, John not only excelled academically but proved \nhimself as an athlete, leader, and a patriot. Throughout his collegiate \ncareer, John powered Columbia's varsity crew down the Harlem River and \nwas named captain for his senior year in 1962. Following his junior \nyear, however, Lusins was called to military duty in Germany as the \nSoviets erected the Berlin Wall. After fulfilling his military \nobligations, he returned to New York and subsequently finished college.\n  Before leaving for Berlin, John met a dashing young lady by the name \nof Anna Marie Dahlgard Bistany. Upon his return, the two promptly fell \nin love and were married on the 17th of August, 1963. Their first \nchildren were two daughters: Gillian, born in 1964, and Noelle in 1966. \nThree boys followed: Carl in 1968, John in 1973, and, finally, Matthew \nin 1976.\n  The family moved over the years, from Yonkers to Bronxville, finally \nmaking Oneonta their home in 1982. Filling a needed void, John \nestablished his neurology practice at Oneonta's A.O. Fox Hospital in \nthe same year. Since then, Lusins and his practice, now the multi-\npartner Catskill Neurodiagnostics and MRI, has become one of Central \nNew York's finest and most respected medical centers.\n  Revered not only for his medical capabilities, Dr. Lusins has also \nestablished himself as a prominent American asset to the world of fine \nwine. Equipped with erudition and a discerning palate, this afficionado \nis not only a member of the prestigious New York Commandeire de \nBordeaux but has proficiently ascended the ranks of the Confrerie des \nChevaliers du Tastevin to become their distinguished Delegue General of \nthe Northeast. Dedicated to these roles, Dr. Lusins educates family, \ncolleagues, and all constituents about the intricacies and appreciation \nof wine. This significant task should not be taken lightly, as our \nFounding Framer and President Thomas Jefferson once noted:\n\n       By making this wine vine known to the public, I have \n     rendered my country as great a service as if I had enabled it \n     to pay back the national debt. . . Its extended use will \n     carry health and comfort to a much enlarged circle.\n\n  With the gathering of all his friends and family, I wish Dr. Lusins a \nsplendid sixtieth birthday and continued success in all his \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14581-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14581-S14582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL TRADE EDUCATION DAY\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today has been designated National \nTrade Education Day. We should use this opportunity to demonstrate how \nthe United States' belief in free trade and open markets have fostered \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S14582]]\n\nprosperity. This issue is especially timely, because the United States \nwill be hosting a Ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization \n(WTO) in Seattle later on this month. Public support of these WTO \nnegotiations is necessary to ensure continued economic growth in the \n21st Century.\n  The United States' economy is currently in a period of historic \neconomic growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. America's open \nmarket plays a vital role in this achievement. Growth in the volume of \nAmerican exports in goods and services accounted for more than 40% of \noverall U.S. economic growth in 1997. Today, exports represent 12% of \nthe U.S. Gross Domestic Product. Export sales are now responsible for \nover 41% of the production of American semiconductors, 42% of aircraft, \n43% of computers, and 68% of power turbines. Recent stories about the \ntrade deficit also show promise. The resurgence of the economies of our \nAsian, Latin American, and European trading partners created an \nincrease in American exports of $2.9 billion totaling $82 billion in \nAugust. The trade deficit dropped $800 million last month to $24.1 \nbillion.\n  The recent economic news gives credence to the saying that ``A rising \ntide lifts all boats.'' American exports help everyone from corporate \nCEOs to the average American worker. In 1997, over 11,500,000 jobs \ndepended on American exports. In addition, export-supported jobs pay \n13% more than the average domestic wage. High technology industry jobs \nthat are directly supported by exports have averaged hourly earnings \n34% higher than the national average. The continued bipartisan free \ntrade policy has benefitted the American people.\n  It is important that the United States remain a leader in promoting \npolicies of open markets worldwide. While our trade deficit has \nstabilized, we should remove remaining foreign barriers to American \ngoods to reduce this deficit. American farmers, manufacturers and \nworkers are hurt, when foreign countries use high tariffs, quotas, and \nquestionable legal and safety procedures to lock American goods out of \ntheir markets. The President should make it a top priority to remove \nthese barriers, and the Congress must give him the authority to achieve \nthis objective.\n  The World Trade Organization (WTO) can play an important role in \npursuing American trade objectives. All members of the WTO have to make \ncommitments to reduce barriers to goods and services, and protect \nintellectual property rights. The WTO has an established procedure to \nensure that countries meet their obligations. The United States should \nensure that our trading partners meet their commitments. When our \ntrading partners do not meet their obligations, such as the European \nUnion has done concerning American agricultural goods, then we should \nuse the WTO to apply as much pressure as possible to bring these \ncountries into compliance. The upcoming Seattle negotiations offer us a \ngreat opportunity to use the WTO to reduce more foreign barriers to \nAmerican goods, agricultural products, and services. We should also \nensure the growth of our high technology exports by making permanent \nthe international moratorium on customs duties relating to electronic \ncommerce.\n  It is also important that we realize that international trade meets \nmany of our national security interests. As countries trade with the \nUnited States and each other, they learn the benefits of peace and \nstability to economic growth. These countries see the benefits of \npursuing policies that support stability, which is a major American \nnational security objective.\n  Last week, the Senate sent a strong message that the United States is \ncommitted to the principles of free trade by passing major trade \nlegislation. However, the President and Congress must work together to \npass another major piece of trade legislation to ensure American \nprosperity in the 21st Century. It is imperative that the President \nmake a serious effort to work with the Congress to pass ``fast track'' \nlegislation. As the next round of the WTO negotiations develop, it is \nimportant that American negotiators have the leverage to secure our \ntrade policy objectives. In addition, ``fast track'' authority lets our \ntrading partners know that any agreement they negotiate with the United \nStates will not be subject to exemptions and gross re-writings by the \nspecial interests in Washington. When the negotiations concerning the \nWTO, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and other ongoing trade talks \ncome to fruition, the President will need to have ``fast track'' \nauthority to ensure that the agreements are implemented. My hope is \nthat we can pass ``fast track'' legislation soon in order to establish \nthe framework for another century of American economic growth.\n  In conclusion, I hope that we can use National Trade Education Day to \ngain public support for the continued pursuit of policies based on the \nprinciples of free trade. Bipartisan American trade policies, based on \nthe belief in open markets free of regulations and tariffs, have played \na major role in causing the current American prosperity. The United \nStates should continue to pursue free trade policies that will remove \nbarriers to American exports. I urge my colleagues to establish the \nfoundation for future prosperity by passing ``fast-track'' legislation \nduring this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14582-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DAVID A. JUNGEMANN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay \ntribute to David A. Jungemann, a U.S. Air Force retiree with over 22 \nyears of active military service and a great citizen from South Dakota \nwho recently completed a very successful two-year term as Chairman of \nThe Retired Enlisted Association TREA Senior Citizens League TSCL Board \nof Trustees. During his chairmanship, TSCL expanded its efforts to \ndefend and protect the earned retirement benefits of older Americans. \nThrough his leadership, TSCL was successful in expanding its \nlegislative lobbying goals and objectives and, as a result, increased \nthe League's membership from 600,000 to over 1.5 million members and \nsupporters in just two years.\n  Dave was born on November 11, 1938 in Wolsey, SD. He graduated from \nWolsey High School in May 1956, and in the following month, enlisted in \nthe United States Air Force (USAF) and headed for Parks Air Force Base, \nCalifornia, for Basic Training. During his military career, Dave was \nstationed in Colorado, Texas, Florida, California, and Ellsworth AFB, \nSouth Dakota. His military career also took him to many overseas \nlocations including Japan, Guam, and Thailand. During a nine-month \nperiod of Temporary Duty to Andersen Air Force Base on the island of \nGuam, he served in support of the ARC Light Missions over the Republic \nof Vietnam and in 1968, flew 10 combat missions over Vietnam as a Bomb/\nNavigation Systems Technician. His service gave him the opportunity to \nearn the Bronze Star Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal with one oak \nleaf cluster, and numerous other awards and decorations.\n  With his military career behind him, Dave worked for the Douglas \nSchool System for over 14 years and subsequently retired from service \nto the State of South Dakota. During this period, he also served a two-\nyear term as City Councilman for the City of Box Elder, South Dakota, \nand currently serves as Trustee for the Zion Lutheran Church in Rapid \nCity, South Dakota.\n  What is truly remarkable about Dave Jungemann is that in addition to \nall the accomplishments I just mentioned, he still made time to \ncontribute to the success of TREA and the TREA Senior Citizens League. \nFor instance, he served on the TREA Chapter 29 Board of Directors for 9 \nyears and the TSCL Board of Trustees for 4 years, during which time he \ncompleted a two-year term as Chairman. Even today, Dave still \nparticipates in numerous parades and ceremonies to honor the veterans \nof the United States of America.\n  Today I rise in recognition of a great American, a solid citizen of \nSouth Dakota and a man who is a symbol of service to God, Country, \nState, veterans and older Americans. Congratulations on your \naccomplishments, Dave, and I wish you a Happy Birthday this coming \nVeterans' Day, a fitting time to celebrate the life of a distinguished \nAmerican veteran.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14583-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S14583]]\n  HONORING THE 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE MOTORCYCLE RIDERS FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize a not-for-profit organization which has been \non the national forefront of motorcyclists' rights. The Motorcycle \nRiders Foundation here in Washington, D.C. is a nation-wide grassroots \nactivist group that is completing its tenth year representing \nmotorcycling rights. As the year draws to an end and we look forward to \na new century, we should be proud of an organization such as MRF which \nembodies our forefathers' commitment to the Constitution and the values \nof freedom and the self- determination of a citizen government.\n  In the mid-1980's the leadership of the various state motorcyclist \nassociations, which had been around since the early 1970's, began to be \nconcerned about the possibility of and need for becoming involved with \nfederal legislation that had an impact on motorcyclists. In 1985, these \nleaders began hosting a national conference, the Meeting Of The Minds, \nto educate motorcyclists on how to be more effective in their state \nlegislatures.\n  In September of this year the MRF hosted the Fifteenth Annual Meeting \nOf The Minds in Denver, Colorado. In 1986, the idea of establishing a \nnational association and opening an office in Washington, DC, was \nconceived. In 1987, the Motorcycle Rights Fund (MRF) was incorporated \nas a 501 (4) not-for-profit association and fund raising began. In \n1988, the name of the association was changed to the Motorcycle Riders \nFoundation, and with less than $30,000 in the bank, the MRF hired its \nfirst employee and opened its Washington, D.C. headquarters on November \n8, 1988.\n  Since its inception the MRF has had two primary goals. One has been \nits educational program, which sponsors national and regional \nconferences every year, with the purpose of training and educating \nleaders of state motorcyclist associations. The MRF's second, and \nprimary program, is its government relations activity. The MRF was \nrecently recognized by the American Society of Association Executives \nwith its Award of Excellence, for the overall federal legislative \nprogram. The awards committee recognized the commitment of the MRF and \nits on-going efforts for the past ten years.\n  In 1996 MRF's federal legislative program was also the recipient of \nASAE's Excellence in Government Relations Award for a Single Issue. In \nits ten-year presence in the Nation's Capital, MRF has had a number of \nlegislative accomplishments in diverse areas ranging from highway \nsafety, personal liberty, law enforcement and discrimination issues; \ntechnology development policies, highway access, and state to federal \nrelationships.\n  As we recognize MRF's 10-Year Anniversary, I look forward to hearing \nabout MRF's future successes in the months and years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14583-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SAGINAW COUNTY CONVENTION AND VISITOR'S BUREAU PINNACLE AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the third \nyear that the Saginaw County Convention & Visitor's Bureau has \nrecognized an organization, person or event with its Pinnacle Award. \nNominees for the Pinnacle Award are chosen by the staff of the Saginaw \nCounty CVB, county-wide chambers of commerce, or from the county \nhospitality industry and are given based on the following criteria:\n  Someone who has brought a convention or conference(s) to Saginaw \nCounty that has significant fiscal impact on the county.\n  Someone or something that has garnered strong and positive press for \nthe county and its various communities.\n  An activity or event that significantly improved or contributed to \nthe quality of life in the county, or has had a significant economic \nimpact.\n  A person who has initiated a program or event that has a positive \nimpact on more than just their own business or interests.\n  A person who has assisted the Saginaw County Convention and Visitors \nBureau ``above and beyond'' the call of duty for the greater good of \nthe County.\n  A person who or an organization that has preserved or revitalized \nhistorical aspects of the County.\n  A person who or organization that has created or supported an event \nthat showcases favorable aspects of the County, or which brings new \ntourism to the area.\n  The winners of the 1999 Pinnacle Award are:\n  Tony D'Anna, who has taken the lead on creating the Frankenmuth \nOldies Fest and annual classic car show (Autofest).\n  Bishop Ed Leidel of the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Michigan for \nbringing many conventions and meetings to Saginaw County.\n  Frankenmuth Oktoberfest which has grown over the past 10 years to \nbecome one of Michigan's great ethnic festivals.\n  P.R.I.D.E. (Positive Results In a Downtown Environment). Since 1975, \nP.RI.D.E. has operated as a volunteer association with goals that \ninclude the organization of events that encourage people to come to the \ncity as well as the improvement of the downtown area.\n  Sarah Schultz, owner of Sarah's Attic in Chesaning, whose newly \nformed educational pilot program teaches children the importance of \nlove, respect, and dignity through different ethnic dolls.\n  Rev.

Through their hard work and diligent efforts, the \neconomy and quality of life in Saginaw County is greatly \nenhanced.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14583-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14583-S14584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    BOISE MODEL PROGRAM NAMED 1999 PRESIDENT'S SERVICE AWARD HONOREE\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, every year the President's Service \nAward honors volunteers for their efforts directed at solving critical \nsocial problems facing today's communities. This year, Hewlett \nPackard's Hispanic Student Outreach program, based in Boise, ID, has \nbeen named one of 21 honorees. This unparalleled distinction is the \nhighest honor given annually by the President of the United States for \nvolunteerism. The award is sponsored by the Points of Light Foundation \nand the Corporation for National Service.\n  As a 1999 honoree, program representatives traveled to Washington, \nDC, to participate in awards festivities October 13-15. This trip \nincluded a Capitol Hill Reception, an awards dinner and the \nparticipation in 1999 President's Service Awards Ceremony.\n  In 1995, Hewlett Packard employees in Boise, ID, started the Hispanic \nStudent Outreach Program (HSOP) because they were concerned about the \nalarming 60 to 70 percent high school dropout rate among Hispanic \nyouths. Based on the adopt-a-school concept, the program matches \nHewlett Packard employees with teachers and students at a local middle \nschool. The volunteers act as role models, motivating and encouraging \nthe students to stay in school. The HSOP is the only program of its \nkind in Idaho. Through this program more than 250 Hewlett Packard \nvolunteers have touched the lives of nearly 1,600 Hispanic students.\n  The program includes many activities, one of which is Career Day. \nThese educational field trips for 7th and 8th grade students include \nthe students to Hewlett Packard offices for hands-on science \nexperiments, job shadowing and computer lab sessions, local science \ncenter trips, and university campus talks and tours. The college campus \ntrips have proven especially significant by allowing the Hispanic \nmiddle school students to interact with Hispanic college students. \nAnother effective program is the after school math tutoring program \nwhich pays local college students to tutor younger students. \nProfessionals are also brought into the schools monthly to talk about \ncareer opportunities and the importance of math, science and writing \nskills beyond middle school.\n\n[[Page S14584]]\n\n  Elena Tsuxton, the founder and Chairperson for the HSOP, commented \nthat the ``program is absolutely thrilled to be receiving the \nPresident's Service Award.'' She saw it as a ``validation of our \nefforts that we are definitely meeting a critical need in our community \nand state. If we can help one more Hispanic student to finish school \nand go out to college, we will have met the HSOP program vision.''\n  The President's Service Awards were created as the President's \nVolunteer Action Award in 1982 to honor outstanding individuals and \norganizations engaged in volunteer service directed at solving critical \nsocial problems while calling public attention to the contributions \nmade by the nation's 93 million volunteers. In 1999, more than 3,500 \nnominations were submitted and reviewed in four activity areas: human \nneeds, environmental needs, educational improvement, and public safety. \nA select panel of distinguished Americans judged the nominations based \non achievement, meeting community needs innovation and mobilizing \nothers to serve.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate this Idaho volunteer program for \nreceiving this well deserved honor and thank them for their service to \nIdaho and its youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14584-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           UNITED HEALTHCARE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support and \nappreciation regarding actions taken at United Healthcare that clearly \ndemonstrate to me that proposed congressional action in the area \nreferred to as ``patient's rights'' can be best handled by the \nmarketplace.\n  Yesterday, United Healthcare announced they will be changing the way \nthey manage care in their health plans by giving physicians the final \nsay in determining what course of treatment their patients will \nreceive. In citing the reasons for the change of policy, United noted \nthe savings resulting from their $100 million review process do not \njustify continuing it.\n  United Healthcare is the second-largest health insurer in the nation \nand I believe their actions signal an industrywide realization that \ntheir review process may be saving them less than they thought.\n  According to United Healthcare, 99 percent of their claims are \napproved despite an exhaustive review process. While this raises the \nquestion of exactly why the federal government needs to disrupt the \nentire health system by getting involved with one percent of health \ncare claims, it also demonstrates our current private-sector health \ncare providers must respond to consumer concerns or lose their \ncustomers to health providers that do.\n  Of course, United Healthcare will still have some review process and \nrequire physicians to notify them when a patient needs an expensive \nprocedure or requires hospitalization. This is clear in all of our \ninterests to ensure the appropriate treatments are considered. We \nshould trust our physicians, but with the rapid advancements made in \nhealth care every day it is reasonable for us to have a team of experts \nreview all the latest treatments, devices and pharmaceuticals. Clearly, \nthis is an area where health plans are, and should be assisting \nphysicians and ensuring quality health services are offered \nappropriately in their facilities.\n  By changing their review process, United Healthcare will reduce its \nmedical monitoring staff by 20 percent and re-focus the remaining staff \non Care Coordination efforts.\n  This saves money for the plan which in turn saves money for consumers \nthrough lower premiums. I believe it is a significant step in the right \ndirection, proving once again, that market forces and demands are \nproductive and responsive. Government solutions usually distort market \nforces and end up with poorer services at higher costs.\n  I should like to be clear about my support for the Patient's Bill of \nRights Plus legislation I cosponsored and voted for--it is still needed \nbecause it addresses other important issues. What this change of \npractice announced by United Health does signal is the potential for us \nto reach a reasonable conclusion to negotiations underway between the \nHouse-passed Patient's Bill of Rights and the Senate-passed Patient's \nBill of Rights Plus, particularly on the contentious issue of health \nplan liability.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to overstate the importance of this \nannouncement from United Healthcare and I felt it was imperative \nsomeone in Congress acknowledged private market forces for positive \nchange far outweigh a government imposed remedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14584-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE'S STAFF\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

Jimmie has served Congress over the last 20 years in various \npositions, and has worked on every major environmental statute over the \nlast 20 years. Earlier this year, the National Journal called him a \n``low key aide whose political insights and institutional memory are \nsought out by industry lobbyists.'' This is an understatement. There is \nno Senate staffer, or House staffer, with more environmental experience \nand political know-how than Jimmie Powell.\n  I believe that Jimmie served his boss, Chairman Chafee well. I did \nnot always agree with the positions that Senator Chafee took, but \nJimmie always did an excellent job in representing his boss's \ninterests. I am not sure what position Jimmie Powell will take next, \nbut I am confident that he will approach any new challenge with the \nsame integrity and honor he exhibited as a Senate staffer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14584-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14584-S14585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PUBLIC SERVICE OF JIMMIE POWELL\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

To staff, and to \nsome members, Jimmie was an adversary, as well as a motivator and \neducator.\n  He began his Senate career with former Senator David Durenberger in \n1978, serving as his staff director of the Government Affairs \nSubcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and later as legislative \ndirector. In 1985, Jimmie began his long service as a professional \nstaff member and staff director for the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works. While his service primarily focused on legislative \npriorities for Senator Durenberger, Chairman Stafford and Chairman \nChafee, he worked tirelessly for all Republican members of the \nCommittee.\n  When one examines the environmental laws enacted in the past 20 \nyears, those of us on the committee know of Jimmie's leadership and \naccomplishments. This lengthy list includes the Leaking Underground \nStorage Tank program as part of the Hazardous and Solid Waste \nAmendments of 1984, Superfund, the 1987 Clean Water Act with \ngroundwater protections and nonpoint source programs, the 1986 and the \n1996 Safe Drinking Water Act, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, \nparticularly provisions on air toxics and alternative fuels, the 1991 \nIntermodal\n\n[[Page S14585]]\n\nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act and the 1998 Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st century.\n  In every legislative challenge that came before the committee, Jimmie \neffectively worked to forge consensus, to find common ground, to \ndevelop solutions that represented the views of the members of the \ncommittee. While we may not have agreed on every issue, he is a person \nof great integrity. He effectively executed the views of the Senators \nhe served. A Senator could ask for no more. He was tough, but fair.\n  All of us owe Jimmie Powell a debt of gratitude for the many years he \nhas served the Senate and this country. We wish him every success and \nthank him for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14585-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAA AUTHORIZATION EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nconfirmed Faith Hochberg for a seat on the U.S. District Court for New \nJersey. I want to thank Senators Hatch and Leahy for moving ahead with \nthis nomination at a time when New Jersey's Federal bench is struggling \nwith heavy caseloads and a shortage of judges. Today's action will help \nNew Jersey's Federal courthouses be more fair and more efficient.\n  Ms. Hochberg has served with distinction as the U.S. Attorney for New \nJersey since 1994 and she couldn't be more qualified for a Federal \njudgeship.\n  President Clinton nominated Ms. Hochberg for the District Court on \nApril 22. As the first female U.S. Attorney in New Jersey's history, \nMs. Hochberg spearheaded corruption probes that led to the conviction \nof numerous Newark officials.\n  She also participated in the prosecution of Unabomber Theodore \nKaczynski, and she unraveled widespread police corruption in several \nNorth Jersey communities.\n  Her office also has a record of aggressively pursuing child \npornography cases. From 1994 through 1998, Ms. Hochberg's attorneys \nhandled 67 of those cases, which was the second-highest number among \nU.S. Attorneys offices across the country.\n\n[[Page S14588]]\n\n  Since 1997, Ms. Hochberg has been a member of the Attorney General's \nAdvisory Committee, which advises Attorney General Janet Reno on issues \naffecting the U.S. Attorney's Office. Ms. Hochberg, in fact, chairs the \nWhite Collar Crime Subcommittee and has focused the committee's \nattention on cyber-crime issues, which of course will be an increasing \nconcern in the next century.\n  This is particularly true in New Jersey, which has a concentration of \nhigh-tech industries and serves as a computer nerve center for large \nNew York-based corporations and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n  Prior to her service as U.S. Attorney, Ms. Hochberg served as Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury for law enforcement as well as \nSenior Deputy Chief Counsel for the Treasury's Office of Thrift \nSupervision.\n  She also has experience in the private sector, having worked as a \npartner in a prominent New Jersey law firm.\n  Ms. Hochberg also has outstanding academic credentials. She graduated \nmagna cum laude in 1975 from Harvard Law School, where she edited the \nLaw Review. In 1972, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts \nUniversity.\n  Mr. President, Ms. Hochberg has also been a pioneer in her efforts to \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals. She and a former New Jersey \nAttorney General organized a project that alerts law enforcement each \ntime a gun is recovered during a criminal incident. That allows those \nguns to be traced to their sources.\n  Mr. President, this confirmation could not come at a better time. New \nJersey's Federal courthouses are stressed to the limit and delays are \nbecoming more and more common.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy for their efforts to \nconfirm Faith Hochberg. I know she will be an outstanding judge.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senate has just confirmed Daniel \nFrench as the new United States Attorney for the Northern District of \nNew York and may I say I could not be more pleased.\n  Dan French is a native of the District having been born and brought \nup in Jefferson County, graduated cum laude from the University of the \nState of New York College at Oswego and is a cum laude graduate of the \nSyracuse University Law School where he served as an editor of the Law \nReview. Following law school Mr. French clerked for Judge Rosemary \nPooler. Judge Pooler was then a United States District Court Judge and \nnot sits on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. French then joined \nthe U.S. Attorney's office where he served until being named interim \nUnited States Attorney by Attorney General Janet Reno.\n  Like all of the District Court and U.S. Attorney Candidates I have \nrecommended to the President, Mr. French was sent to me by my Screening \nPanel after he and other candidates were seen and their credentials \nreviewed.\n  But I must say I was particularly pleased to send Dan's name to the \nPresident. And pleased that the President, after reviewing his record, \nagreed that he should be nominated. For Dan French was with me for \nseveral years as a professional staff member on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the Committee on Finance and on my personal \nstaff. I know him well. And I know that he has the kind of \nintelligence, learning, judgment and integrity that will make him an \noutstanding U.S. Attorney.\n  Mr. President, the Northern District of New York, in which our family \nhome at Pindars Corners is located is vast. It services 3.5 million \ncitizens and encompasses 32 of New York's 62 counties, covering 60% of \nthe State's geographical area. By comparison, the district is larger \nthan the combined land areas of Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and \nRhode Island. This large area with a diverse population is fortunate to \nhave a native son, who understands its ways, enforcing the laws of the \nUnited States.\n  Years ago, another upstater, Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson \nwrote that ``the citizen's safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers \nzeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves \nthe law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with \nhumility.'' I know that Dan French will be guided by Justice Jackson's \nwords.\n  Dan French will be a splendid U.S. Attorney and I congratulate him on \nhis confirmation and salute his wife, television broadcaster Kelly \nFrench and their two children Margaret Anne and Gavin Mitchell.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has voted \ntoday on the confirmation of Judge Florence-Marie Cooper to be a United \nStates District Court Judge for the Central District of California.\n  Florence-Marie Cooper is a distinguished Californian. She has \ndistinguished herself with a long career of service in the California \nstate court system. She was a Deputy City Attorney for the City of Los \nAngeles in 1977. From 1978 to 1983, she was a Senior Research Attorney \nfor the California Court of Appeal Second Appellate District. Then, \nfrom 1983-1990 she was a Court Commissioner for the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court. From 1990-1991 she was a Judge in the Los Angeles \nMunicipal Court. Since 1991 she has been a Judge in the Los Angeles \nSuperior Court.\n  Judge Cooper received her undergraduate degree in 1971 from the City \nCollege of San Francisco, and her law degree from Whittier College \nSchool of Law in 1975. Following law school, she clerked for the \nHonorable Arthur Alarcon on the Los Angeles Superior Court Appellate \nDepartment.\n  The Senate could help Judge Florence-Marie Cooper's future workload \nif it would likewise take up and consider the nominations of the other \nnominees to her District Court: Judge Virginia Phillips, Dolly Gee and \nFrederic Woocher. Virginia Phillips was first nominated back in May \n1998 and is still awaiting a hearing in order to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy on that Court. The Judiciary Committee recently \nreceived a letter from Chief Judge Hatter of that Court in which he \nimplored the Senate to act promptly on the nomination of Judge Virginia \nPhillips. Judge Hatter notes that the Eastern Division of the Central \nDistrict is one of the fastest growing areas in the nation and has only \none judge with a ``staggering caseload.'' He explains that the \nreassignment of cases to Los Angeles from San Bernadino ``results in a \nlarge number of litigants, witnesses, lawyers, and law enforcement \nofficers having to travel to Los Angeles, some sixty (60) miles away, \nby way of the most traffic congested roads in the United States.'' I \nthank Chief Judge Hatter for his letter and want him to know that I, \nfor one, understand. Those who say there is no judicial vacancies \nproblem ought to consider Chief Judge Hatter's perspective and the \nproblems created for thousands of people each year in his District.\n  The Senate also has before it ready for a final confirmation vote the \nnominations of Judge Richard Paez, Marshal Berzon and Ronald Gould, to \nthe Ninth Circuit. The nomination that has been longer before the \nSenate is that of Judge Richard Paez, 44 months. The nomination that \nhas been longest on the Senate Executive Calendar is that of Marshal \nBerzon, whose nomination was reported on July 1, before the 4th of July \nrecess, before the extended August recess and before the Columbus Day \nrecess.\n  The Senate could and should be voting up or down on the Paez and \nBerzon nominations. The Senate needs to fulfill its duty to each of \nthese outstanding nominees and to the tens of millions of people served \nby the Ninth Circuit. A few anonymous Republican Senators are holding \nup action on these important nominations. Two weeks ago, the Majority \nLeader came to the floor and said that he would try to find a way to \nhave these two nominations considered by the Senate. The way is to call \nthem to a fair up-or-down vote. I want to help the Republican leader \nand help the Senate find its way clear to do that without additional \ndelay and obstruction.\n\n  Despite the policy announced at the beginning of this year doing away \nwith ``secret holds,'' that is what Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon still \nconfront as their nominations continuing to be obstructed under a cloak \nof anonymity after 44 months and 20 months, respectively. That is wrong \nand unfair. This continuing delay demeans the Senate, itself.\n  I have great respect for this institution and its traditions. Still, \nI must say that this use of secret holds for extended periods that doom \na nomination\n\n[[Page S14589]]\n\nfrom ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and \nunfair and beneath us. Who is it that is afraid to vote on these \nnominations? Who is it that must hiding their to these nominees? After \nalmost 4 years with respect to Judge Paez and almost 2 years with \nrespect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate to vote up-or-down \non these nominations.\n  The Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in January \nlast year:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     * * * The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  At the time the Chief Justice issued this challenge, Judge Paez' \nnomination had already been pending for 24 months. The Senate received \nthe Berzon nomination within days of the Chief Justice's report. That \nwas almost 2 years ago and still the Senate stalls and refuses to vote. \nLet us follow the advice of the Chief Justice. Let the Republican \nleadership schedule fair up or down votes on the nominations of Judge \nPaez and Marsha Berzon so that the Senate can finally act on them. Let \nus be fair to all.\n  The debate on judicial nominations over the last couple of weeks has \nfocused the Senate and the public on the unconscionable treatment by \nthe Senate majority of selected nominees. The most prominent current \nexamples of that treatment are Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. With \nrespect to these nominations, the Senate is refusing to do its \nconstitutional duty and vote. I challenged the Senate last Friday, in \nthe aftermath of the rejection of the nomination of Justice Ronnie \nWhite by the Republican caucus, to vote on the nominations of Judge \nPaez, Marshal Berzon, Judge Julio Fuentes, Judge Ann Williams, Judge \nJames Wynn, Kathleen McGee Lewis and Enrique Moreno.\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed \nfor 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate \nleadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican \nmajority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There \nis no excuse for their continuing failure to do so.\n  I know the Senate has done the right thing and confirmed Judge \nFlorence-Marie Cooper to the Central District of California and that \nshe will be an outstanding judge. I will continue my efforts to bring \nto a vote the nominations of Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14589-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n224 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 224) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate to designate November 11, 1999, as a special day for \n     recognizing the members of the Armed Forces and the civilian \n     employees of the United States who participated in the recent \n     conflict in Kosovo and the Balkans.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am reminded of incredibly sacred places \nand moments in our history when I rise to talk about recognition of our \nveterans--past and present--on Veteran's Day--recognizing all our \nveteran's from all our wars. Places like Arlington National Cemetery, \nAndersonville, Georgia, the beaches of Normandy, Pearl Harbor, the \nChosin Reservoir, Keshan, the deserts of Kuwait, and now the skies over \nKosovo, should be indelibly etched in all our thoughts.\n  It is often said ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes, but poorer \nstill is the nation which has them but forgets.'' We will gather all \nover this great nation on Thursday, November 11, 1999 to remember for \nthe last time this century our veterans and to restate our commitment \nthat they will never be forgotten. I consider all those who has ever \nbeen in uniform to my brothers and sisters. We all came to these \nhollowed chambers through distinguished routes, I got to Washington \nbecause of those who served in the military and I work here, day in and \nday out, for them!\n  As we depart Washington, I ask that we reiterate our promise to our \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, DoD civilians, and their families--\nthat they will not be slighted, now or ever--that we honor their \nservice--that we honor the service of those still missing, because \ntheir plight is our plight.\n  We cannot remember our Veterans properly without remembering the \nsacrifices of war--these are the issues that hit home. We remember \nthose service members who have sacrificed for this nation, and we pay \nspecial tribute to their families.\n  I ask through my resolution that we additionally pay special tribute \nthis Veteran's Day to those service members--active, guard, reserve, \nand civilians--who participated in the recently successful military \noperations--combat and humanitarian--in Kosovo and the entire Balkans \narea of operations.\n  Over 39,000 members of the Armed Services deployed to the Balkans \narea during the peak of Kosovo operations, 700 U.S. aircraft were \ndeployed, 37,000 overall missions were flown with 25,000 of these by \nU.S. aircraft, and 5,000 missions were weapons strike missions. We all \nknow that this is only a partial picture of what was occurring on the \nground, on the high seas, and in the air. These facts fit any \ndefinition of warfare.\n  We can not forget these individuals and their families any more than \nwe can forget those of all of our past wars. If freedom is the fruit of \nvictory, Veteran's Day reminds us too of the cost of war--casualties, \nPOWs, and MIAs. They live in our hearts while we live in the world they \nmade safe for us. I call for us all this Veteran's Day to remember \nspecially our Kosovo and Balkans service members as we remember all \npast veterans.\n  Every day I wake up, I thank God I am here. I am inspired to continue \nliving by the memory of our veteran's. The vigilance of those that went \nto Kosovo, like those who still serve in the Balkans, those in the \ndesert, those in ships, and those in Korea and in the far corners of \nthe earth, is now my vigilance, their fight is now my fight. I ask my \ncolleagues to remember and to ensure that their sacrifices are not made \nin vain.\n  Secretary Cohen recently stated at the POW/MIA recognition ceremony \nat Arlington Cemetery--an awesome, somber experience--that ``we are the \nheirs of freedom, paid for with the blood of patriots.'' I ask my \ncolleagues to remember our Kosovo and Balkans patriots in their \nceremonies this Veteran's Day.

I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, an exchange of notes which was signed on \nSeptember 30, 1999, which provides for its provisional application, as \nwell as the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nTreaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance \ntreaties being negotiated by the United States in order to counter \ncriminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective \ntool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of crimes, \nincluding drug trafficking offenses. The Treaty is self-executing. It \nprovides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters. Mutual \nassistance available under the Treaty includes: taking of testimony or \nstatements of persons; providing documents, records, and articles of \nevidence; serving documents; locating or identifying persons; \ntransferring persons in custody for testimony or other purposes; \nexecuting requests for searches and seizures; assisting in proceedings \nrelated to restraint, confiscation, forfeiture of assets, restitution, \nand collection of fines; and any other form of assistance not \nprohibited by the laws of the requested state.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

For the information of all Senators, the Senate will \nconvene on Friday for a pro forma session only. No business will be \ntransacted on Friday.\n  On Tuesday, the Senate will convene and begin processing the \nappropriations items and various conference reports received from the \nHouse.\n  On Wednesday morning, the Senate will conduct a rollcall vote in \nrelation to the agricultural amendment by Senator Wellstone. Additional \nvotes can be anticipated in an effort to complete the first session of \nthe 106th Congress. Therefore, Senators should adjust their schedules \nfor the possibility of votes throughout the day and into the evening on \nWednesday.\n  I appreciate the patience and cooperation of our colleagues as we \nattempt to complete the appropriations process and end the first \nsession of the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished acting majority \nleader for the number of nominations that have been cleared. I hope my \nside of the aisle will work with the majority leader to clear some more \nbefore we go out, especially among the judges. We have a number that \nhave been pending and are noncontroversial and should be cleared.\n  I also hope that on Wednesday we will go to the conference report on \nthe satellite bill. It passed the House, I think, 411-8, which shows \nthe enormous support it has. I hope we get it out of here; otherwise, \nwe run the risk of hundreds of thousands of satellite dishes and TV \nsets around this country going black on a number of their channels on \nDecember 31. This has enormous importance.\n\n  As I said, the House passed it 411-8. They are showing more unanimity \nthan on just about anything they have done this year. We passed it, I \nbelieve, unanimously. That, and the attendant Hatch-Leahy patent bill--\nwhich I think\n\n[[Page S14591]]\n\nis extremely important--I hope we get through before we go out.\n  I mention that, but I also did want to commend the Senator from Iowa, \nboth in his capacity as the Senator from Iowa and in his capacity as \nacting leader, for the number of nominations that have gone through. I \nhope my side of the aisle will be as diligent in clearing the rest.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in response to what the Senator from \nVermont said, obviously I am in no position to speak for our majority \nleader or assistant majority leader on some of the things he said. But \nI do share his view, especially coming from a rural State, as the \nSenator from Vermont does, that there is very much benefit for our \nrural constituents in that satellite viewers legislation. I, too, would \nlike to see it pass.\n  I can say again, not for the leader but for myself, I have observed a \nlot of contact between important Senators around here on that issue. \nThere is a real effort being made to find a solution so that can be \npassed so on December 31 what you said would happen, and what would \nactually happen if the bill does not pass will not in fact happen.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/10/senate-section/article/S14591-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M., FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1999\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.
