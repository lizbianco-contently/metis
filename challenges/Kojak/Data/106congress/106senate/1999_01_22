O God of righteousness and grace, guide this Senate at \nthis decisive hour. You are our Lord and Savior. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators may be seated. The Sergeant at Arms will \nmake a proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, the Senate is \nprovided up to 16 hours during which Senators may submit questions in \nwriting directed to either the managers, on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives, or counsel for the President. The Chair recognizes the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This afternoon, the Senate will begin the question-and-\nanswer period for not to exceed 16 hours, as provided in Senate \nResolution 16. I have consulted several times about this procedure with \nSenator Daschle and others, and we have determined that the majority \nwill begin the questioning process with the first question, and we will \nthen alternate back and forth.\n  As I noted yesterday, this has not been done in quite a while, so we \nwill just have to go forward in a way that we feel is fair and \ncomfortable. We ask that you give the benefit of the doubt to us in how \nwe send the questions up to the Chief Justice. Senator Daschle and I \nwill try to make sure that the time stays pretty close to even as we go \nthrough the day. Of course, the Chief Justice, I am sure, will make \nsure the deliberations and the answers are fair. We hope the answers \nwill be succinct and that they will respond to the questions.\n  One question that has arisen from Senators on both sides is, can we \ndirect a question to both sides, the White House counsel and the House \nmanagers, simultaneously, and the answer is no. Under our rules, we \nwill direct the question to one side or the other, and our questions \nfor either side may go to either one of the parties, but only one can \nanswer that question.\n  Of course, there is the possibility for a follow-up question that \nmight be directed to one side or the other. We will just deal with that \nas we go forward.\n  I expect, for the information of all Senators, that we will go \napproximately 5 hours today. I don't know how many questions we can get \ndone in an hour, but I suspect by 6 o'clock on Friday we will have \nexhausted a series of questions that will entitle us to a break at that \npoint. But, again, we will just have to see how we feel about it. We \nwould not stop, obviously, in the middle of a question.\n  We will resume again on Saturday at 10 a.m., alternating between both \nsides. The schedule at this point is undecided. We need to see how many \nquestions are left that Senators really feel need to be asked and, \nagain, we will have to see how the day progresses.\n  I did have Senators come up to me yesterday and talk to me about we \nneed some reasonable limit on that. But I am thinking in general terms \nof not going beyond 4 o'clock on Saturday. We will converse and make \nthose announcements after consultation as we go forward tomorrow or \nduring the day even tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S870]]\n\n  I hope we can complete our questioning period by the close of \nbusiness tomorrow, but if we go with the times I basically mentioned, \nwe are talking about 10 hours, not 16. So we will have to consult and \ndetermine if we ask the basic questions or if we want to continue it \nlater or even over on Monday.\n  I believe, Mr. Chief Justice, that completed the explanation that I \nwanted to give at this time.\n  I do have the first question prepared to send to the Chief Justice, \nbut I thought perhaps he had some further business he might want to \naddress before I did that.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes. I would like to advise counsel on both sides \nthat the Chair will operate on a rebuttable presumption that each \nquestion can be fully and fairly answered in 5 minutes or less. \n(Laughter.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I do send the first question to the \ndesk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Allard, Bunning, Coverdell and Craig ask \nthe House managers:\n\n       Is it the opinion of the House Managers that the \n     President's defense team, in the presentation, \n     mischaracterized any factual or legal issue in this case? If \n     so, please explain.\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Mr. Chief Justice, distinguished colleagues, and \nMembers of the Senate, there are--first of all, let me thank you for \nthe opportunity to respond to questions. We hope we can do that in a \nsuccinct manner today.\n  There are a number of mischaracterizations in statements that we \ndisagree with that the President's defense team made. I will not \nattempt to cover all of these. And I would like to highlight just a few \nof these, and perhaps might, in a short manner, exceed the rebuttal \npresumption of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Craig made the argument on behalf of the President that this is a \nlot about an oath versus oath perjury case. Article I is the perjury \nallegation--one word against another person's word, ``he said, she \nsaid.'' However, we would submit that there was not discussed in their \npresentation the fact that there is ample corroboration which is \nprovided for under the law as it being necessary.\n  But we believe factually there was much corroboration; that is, \nanother person or other evidence to support the fact that the President \ndid commit the perjury, and particularly those aspects of the perjury \ncharge that deal with the personal relationship that Ms. Lewinsky and \nthe President had.\n  Very clearly, White House records and phone logs, along with Ms. \nLewinsky's incredible recollection of particular names and events, and \nthe circumstances surrounding these particular occasions, that have \nalready been highlighted in the past--and we all know about those types \nof telephone conversations. And she was very clear in the facts. The \npeople have all corroborated her on her presence in the White House at \ncertain times.\n  No. 2, the Secret Service testimony that placed her inside the Oval \nOffice, on occasion alone; the fact that there have been \ncontemporaneous statements made by Ms. Lewinsky describing the details \nof this relationship. And as we all know, the law permits this \ncontemporaneous statement to, in this case, at least eight friends and \ntwo professional counselors detailing the particular relationship while \nit was ongoing.\n  The blue dress is very clearly corroboration, and the DNA testing \nthat resulted from that. Also, the transfer of Ms. Lewinsky from the \nWhite House, and the later surreptitious efforts with Ms. Currie to \nsneak her back into the White House, again, indication that efforts had \nbeen made to move her, to relocate her, away from the President to \nprotect him from those circumstances.\n  Also, the President's prepared statement in the grand jury is another \nexample that was not mentioned. And in particular, I highlight the \nstatement that he made that would lead you to believe that this \nrelationship evolved over a period of time, and that being that he was \nsorry that what had started out as a friendship turned into this type \nof relationship, where, in fact, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony is very clear \nthat that relationship began immediately, the very first day that he \nactually spoke to her.\n\n  Mr. Ruff's statement that the managers' case was misleading is also \nincorrect, I believe. He used words like ``fudging the facts,'' ``a \nwitches' brew,'' and ``be wary of a prosecutor who feels like he must \ndeceive the court.'' And this comes to somewhat of a surprise to many \nof us at this table who know that Mr. Ruff is familiar with the facts \nof this case.\n  And just last month, when he testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee, he said: I have no doubt that the President walked up to \nthat line that he thought he understood. Reasonable people--reasonable \npeople--and you may have reached that conclusion that he could have \ncrossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but \nmisleading or nonresponsive or misleading and evasive was in fact \nfalse.\n  Now, he didn't tell you in his presentation that just a month ago he \ntook the position that reasonable people can disagree, and yet before \nthis Senate, and the audience that we have watching, he asserts that \nanyone who would accuse his client of perjury is guilty of ``fudging \nthe facts,'' ``brewing a witches' brew,'' and ``deception.'' And even \nMr. Craig, unfortunately, borrowed many of those same words in that \ncharacterization. It may be good theater, but it is simply not the case \nthat these managers are engaged in that type of practice before the \nSenate and the American people.\n  White House Counsel Cheryl Mills spoke in a similar manner and tone \nto this House about inconvenient and stubborn facts--oh, those stubborn \nfacts. In her meticulous presentation, she passed over--she completely \nmissed--the second occasion wherein President Clinton attempted to \ncoach Ms. Currie.\n  Did anyone hear about the second event? As carefully as she tried to \nmake innocent the wrongful effort of the President to tamper with the \npotential witness, she just as carefully skirted the entire similar \nepisode 2 or 3 days after the first one where he again tampered with \nher testimony. According--according to Ms. Currie--he spoke with her, \njust recapitulating. Remember that in our presentation?\n  Likewise, in her review of witness tampering, she mischaracterized \nthe law--the law--stating that a threat--an actual threat was required. \n18 U.S.C. 1503 states that obstruction of justice occurs when a person \ncorruptly endeavors to influence the testimony of another person. And \n``corruptly'' has been interpreted by the District Court here in D.C. \nto mean acting for an improper purpose.\n  And, clearly, this was an improper purpose when the President was \ntrying to get her to testify falsely, but a threat is not a part of the \nlaw and not needed.\n  And I will just quickly, if I might, just mention two more quick \nones.\n  Mr. Ruff stated the President gave the same denial to his aides that \nhe gave to his country and family. You recall him specifically saying \nthat he just has said nothing different to the American public and his \nfamily that he told the aides that we talked about--John Podesta, \nSidney Blumenthal.\n  Well, that's not right. ``He told''--the President told Mr. Podesta--\nand this is Mr. Podesta talking--``He told me that he never had sex \nwith her and that he never asked--you know, he repeated the denial. But \nhe was extremely explicit in saying he never had sex with her in any \nway whatsoever, that they had not had oral sex.''\n  And Blumenthal--Mr. Blumenthal--he told Mr. Blumenthal an entirely \ndifferent story, that ``Monica Lewinsky came at me and made a sexual \ndemand on me. [And I, the President,] rebuffed her.'' He said that \n``I've gone down that road before [and] . . . caused pain for a lot of \npeople and I'm not going to do that again.''\n  ``She threatened him.'' Ms. Lewinsky threatened the President. And \n``[s]he said that she would tell [other] people [that she] had an \naffair, that she was known as a stalker among her peers, and that she \nhated [that], and if she had an affair . . . [with the President] she \nwouldn't be . . . anymore.''\n  That is not the story that he told the American people and that he \ntold his family. These are embellishments that are very important, \nbecause he anticipated that they would go into the grand jury and \nrepeat those misstatements.\n  And finally, the affidavit of Monica Lewinsky. White House defense \nlawyers spoke so eloquently about the procurement of this affidavit--as \nhe glided\n\n[[Page S871]]\n\nthrough how the President believed that Monica Lewinsky could have \nfiled a truthful affidavit while still skirting their sexual \nrelationship sufficiently to--sufficiently to--avoid testifying in the \nPaula Jones case.\n  This is an important issue. As it was specifically raised in the \nanswer before this Senate, the President's lawyers brought this \nstatement into this Senate as part of their answer that he could have \nadvised her that she could have filed an affidavit that would have been \ntruthful while still at the same time denying a sexual relationship \nsufficiently that she would not be called as a witness.\n  I know opposing counsel makes light of the hairsplitting and the \nlegal gymnastics that people have talked about here, but that is an \nincredible statement that you can do the twister enough to go into a \ndeposition where the purpose of being there is to discover this type of \ninformation, who you might have had an affair with, and have her tell a \ntruthful affidavit and still not to be able to testify.\n  Had she told a truthful affidavit, she would have been immediately \ncalled. Plus, the President was given an opportunity by Ms. Lewinsky to \nreview the affidavit.\n  Remember the statement that he didn't need to, he had seen 15 just \nlike it? If he had that ``out'' for her where she could have told the \ntruth and still not been able to testify, don't you think he owed it to \nher to cause her not to have to commit perjury in that affidavit--which \nshe did--not to have to commit a crime? Wouldn't he have shared that \nwith her if he had that information at that time?\n  I suggest that he didn't. I have others that I would like to talk to, \nbut in the interest of time and fairness I will stop my presentation at \nthis point.\n  I thank the Senate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I recognize the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Could I inquire as to the length of time that response \ntook.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Approximately 9 minutes.\n  Senator Sarbanes asks:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question from Senators Allard, Bunning, Coverdell \n     and Craig?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  It may be that I will need to call on some of my colleagues to be of \nassistance here, but let me begin, and we will strive mightily to stay \nwithin the rebuttal of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Manager Bryant began by suggesting that there really is \ncorroboration on the key issue that he focussed on, which as you know, \nis the nature of the specific details of the relationship between the \nPresident and Ms. Lewinsky. And he suggested that among the \ncorroborating matters that he would point to were her recollection of \nevents, which is alleged to be detailed; records reflecting that she \nwas, indeed, in the White House on particular days; Secret Service \nrecords; DNA testing. None of those have anything to do with the \nessential issue that Congressman Bryant raised, because nobody disputes \nthe fact that Ms. Lewinsky was in the White House engaged in \ninappropriate conduct with the President on a particular day.\n  The only point that I think the manager raises that is new and needs \nto be addressed is this notion that contemporary, consistent statements \nmade to third parties about these events are somehow corroborative of \nMs. Lewinsky's testimony in this regard. And as all of you who had the \npain of suffering through an evidence course will know, or have had the \npain of trying lawsuits in which this issue arises, so-called prior \nconsistent statements are not, in fact, viewed as some corroborating \nevidence that can be introduced by the prosecutors in this Senate; for \nthey know, and I am sure those of you who suffered through these pangs \nknow, as well, that the law rejects the notion that merely because you \ntell the same story many times it is corroborative of the underlying \ncredibility of the witness' version, and that there are only certain \nvery limited areas in which prior consistent statements are, in fact, \nadmissible.\n  A couple of others and I will turn this briefly over to Ms. Mills.\n  Manager Bryant suggests that I have somehow gone too far in \nsuggesting that the prosecutors here have in my words ``engaged in \nfudging.'' I have never suggested that the entire presentation is so, \nand I made very clear in my comments to the Senate the other day the \nspecific examples which I think we documented quite fully. But beyond \nthat, let me go back to his reference to my earlier testimony before \nthe House Judiciary Committee in which I did, indeed, in response to \nquestions, comment that the President may well have walked up to the \nline believing he didn't cross it, but that reasonable people might \nconclude otherwise.\n\n  The only problem with that example, as broached by Mr. Manager \nBryant, is that I was talking there--and the record is very clear--I \nwas talking about his testimony in the Jones deposition which, as \neveryone in this room will fully understand, is not before you because \nthe House of Representatives specifically decided that the President's \ntestimony in the Jones deposition was not a basis for impeachment.\n  With that, without having used, I hope, all of my time, Mr. Chief \nJustice, I will allow Ms. Mills, if she would, to come forward and \nrespond specifically to the point raised with respect to her \npresentation.\n  Ms. Counsel MILLS. Thank you.\n  I just want to address briefly two issues that the House managers \nraised. With regard to the statute on obstruction of justice, with \nrespect to witness tampering, the House managers focused on 1512, with \nrespect to Ms. Currie which does require a threat or intimidation and, \nindeed, specifically addressed that--they wanted to focus on 1512--when \nthey were addressing her and the situation where the President spoke \nwith her.\n  With regard to 1503, though, to the extent that the House managers \nsuggest that the President's actions and his conversation with Ms. \nLewinsky violated 1503, I think probably you all might recall from my \npresentation that we discussed the Aguilar case in which it is clearly \nnecessary that you have a nexus between the actual conduct and the \nofficial proceeding that would be going forward. In that case, we had a \njudge who lied to an FBI agent who indicated that he was going to--that \nthis might, might come up in a grand jury proceeding, and Mr. Chief \nJustice, in his opinion, indicated that was insufficient to find the \nnexus that was necessary to violate 1503.\n  And if you all have my package, you can look back. I provided you \nwith a specific quotation. So in this instance, we clearly wouldn't \nhave the nexus between the President's conversation with Ms. Currie, \nwho was not yet a witness. There was no suggestion that she was going \nto be a witness in the Jones case; indeed, no one even mentioned that \nfact to him, as you actually did have in Aguilar.\n  In addition, with regard to both statutes, the specific intent is not \nfulfilled. That is something we spoke about when I gave my presentation \nbefore.\n  With regard to the President's conversation with Ms. Currie, which \nhappened on the 18th and again on a subsequent day, in that instance it \nalso happened prior to all of the media attention and other matters \nthat came out. So in effect, all of the same issues apply because there \nwas no--at that point--no indication that the independent counsel was \ninvolved in this matter, and the President still was concerned about \nthe Jones proceeding; indeed, he was concerned that the media attention \nwould be significant, and he was accurate as it began to grow and grow.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, we send our next question to the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Enzi and Coverdell ask the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Please elaborate on whether the President's defense team \n     failed to respond to any allegations made by the House \n     managers.\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of \nthe Senate, as to the areas that were not covered by the President's \ndefense team, I think that my fellow Manager Bryant already mentioned \none, but I thought it was significant that in the questioning of Ms. \nCurrie, or the statements made to Betty Currie after the President's \ndeposition on January 17 where he brought her into the office and he \nwent through that series of questions--``I was never alone, right,''\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nand that series of questions everybody is so familiar with, they \ndiscussed that primarily in the terms that she was not a witness. But \nduring 3 days of presentation they never discussed the fact that it was \n2 days later that the same series of questions or statements or \ncoaching were addressed to Ms. Currie.\n  So the President's defense that, ``Well, I was just trying to refresh \nmy recollection on the facts so I could respond to media inquiries,'' \ndoes not make sense in light of the fact that it was done on one day--\nthe series of questions. But Betty Currie testified that 2 days later \nshe was called into the office, the same series of statements, \ndeclarations, coaching was made to her, and the only possible \nexplanation for that is that the President was trying to make a very \nclear statement to her--``This is what I remember; this is what I want \nyou to do,'' and for 3 days, for 3 days of presentations, the \nPresident's defense lawyers never, never mentioned that.\n  Now, I want to come back to what Ms. Mills just said because this was \na big issue in the presentation of Mr. Ruff. In fact, I have the quotes \nhere. I hope that that will be turned over to you. But whenever Betty \nCurrie was questioned, they say, well, she wasn't a witness. There was \nnever any clue she was going to be a witness, that the Jones lawyers \nnever anticipated she was going to be a witness, and that it was never \nput at all on the witness list. That's very significant.\n  I just want to drive this point home. This is Mr. Ruff--talk about \nprosecutorial fudging; how about defense fudging? Mr. Ruff said this:\n\n       Ms. Currie was neither an actual nor prospective witness.\n       In the entire history of the Jones case, Ms. Currie's name \n     had not appeared on any witness list, nor was there any \n     reason to suspect that Ms. Currie would play a role in the \n     Jones case.\n       Discovery was down to its final days.\n\n  That was Counsel Ruff.\n\n       Yet, in the days and weeks following the deposition, the \n     Jones lawyers never listed her, never contacted her, never \n     added her to any witness list.\n\n  That was the presentation of Mr. Ruff, and it was also that of Ms. \nMills. Yet, if you look at the facts in the Jones case, the deposition \nwas concluded on January 17. There was a holiday on the 18th. In fact, \non January 22, within 5 days of the deposition, a subpoena was issued \nfor Betty Currie. Within 5 days, a subpoena was issued for Betty \nCurrie, and, in fact, on the 23rd, there was a supplement to the \nwitness list by the Jones lawyers, which included Betty Currie's name \nas 163. This was served on Mr. Bennett and the other lawyers for the \nPresident.\n  In addition, I have--which I will distribute to you--the actual \nsubpoena that was issued for Betty Currie, as I indicated, which was \nissued on January 22nd, and the proof of service in which Betty Currie \nwas served as a witness in that case on January 27--the proof of \nservice. So the statements by Mr. Ruff that there was never any \nindication that the Jones people knew she was going to be a witness is \ntotally not within the record. In fact, it is clear that the subpoena \nwas issued; it was served.\n  Whenever that deposition was over of the President, both the \nPresident left there and the Jones lawyers left there knowing \nimmediately that Betty Currie was going to be a witness. She had to be \na witness, with the President asserting, ``ask Betty, ask Betty, ask \nBetty,'' so many times during that. That is why the President came back \nand had to deal with Betty Currie being a witness, and the Jones lawyer \nwent out and immediately amended the witness list so as to do that, and \nthen issued a subpoena, which was served on Betty Currie. That is the \nrecord. Those are the facts. We will distribute this to you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Levin asks White House counsel:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me respond very \nbriefly to Manager Hutchinson's last remarks, because I owe him indeed \nan explanation and he is correct in one respect. I did not accurately \nreflect the fact that after the January 21 story in the Washington \nPost, the Jones lawyers did, in fact, attempt to track the entire \nindependent counsel investigation. And I think Mr. Hutchinson will tell \nyou, they indeed issued a long list of subpoenas. For that misleading \nstatement, I apologize, and I trust we will hear equally candid \nassessments from the managers. But more importantly, let me return to \nthe substance of that issue because it is important to note, without \nthe chart being up there, that indeed, at the moment, which is the \ncritical moment, when the President was talking about Betty Currie, \nwhether it be on the 18th or on the 20th or 21st--the 21st, you \nremember, is when the story breaks. The answer is the same. He had no \nreason to believe at that stage--and that is the critical stage because \nthat's what's in his mind and that is what you have to ask if you are \ntalking about obstruction of justice or witness tampering--at that \nstage, he had no more reason to know that Ms. Currie was going to be a \nwitness than he did, as we explained it, both I and Ms. Mills, in our \nearlier presentations.\n\n  The fact that the Jones lawyers, once this story became a matter of \npublic knowledge, which it did on the 21st, thereafter dumped a series \nof subpoenas and deposition notices literally in the closing days of \ndiscovery does not bear on the question of what was in the President's \nmind, which is the critical moment for testing his intent, at the \nmoment when he first had his conversations with Betty Currie.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Thurmond, Grassley, Chafee and Craig \ndirect to the House managers:\n\n       President Clinton has raised concerns about whether the \n     articles of impeachment are overly vague and whether they \n     charge more than one offense in the same article. How do you \n     respond to this concern?\n\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, I \nwill be pleased to do my best to address this question.\n  The President has made two claims against the forum in which the \narticles of impeachment have been drafted. I submit to you that neither \nof these claims has any merit, and I will be pleased to address both \nclaims as briefly as I can.\n  First, the President claims that the two articles of impeachment are \nvague and lack specificity and, therefore, prevent him from knowing \nwhat he has been charged with.\n  Second, the President asserts that the articles are flawed because \nthey charge multiple defenses in a single article. With respect to the \nfirst claim, it is clear in the President's trial memorandum and his \npresentation here that President Clinton and his counsel know exactly \nwhat he is being charged with. And I submit to you that if President \nClinton had suffered from any lack of specificity in the articles, he \ncould have filed a motion for a bill of particulars. He did not choose \nto do so.\n  Moreover, articles of impeachment have never been required to be \ndrafted with the specificity of indictments. After all, this proceeding \nis not a criminal trial. If it were, then we, as the prosecutors, would \nnot only be entitled to call witnesses, but would be required to call \nthem to prove our case. We would certainly not be put in the position \nof defending the appropriateness of witnesses.\n  President Clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial without \nbearing any of its burdens. Impeachment is a political and not a \ncriminal proceeding. That has been clear from the institution of this \nproceeding in our Constitution. As recognized by Justice Joseph Story, \nthe Constitution's greatest interpreter during the 19th century, \n``Impeachment is designed not to punish an offender by threatening \ndeprivation of his life, liberty, or property, but to secure the State \nby divesting him of his political capacity.'' Justice Story thus found \nthe analogy of articles of impeachment to an indictment to be invalid. \nI quote what Justice Story had to say, which is directly pertinent to \nthis question:\n\n       The articles need not and indeed do not pursue the strict \n     form and accuracy of an indictment. They are sometimes quite \n     general in the form of the allegations, but ought to contain \n     certainty as to enable the party to put himself upon the \n     proper defense, and also in the case of acquittal, to avail \n     himself of it as a bar to another impeachment.\n\n  Indeed Alexander Hamilton had commented on the same point in the \nFederalist. We have heard many references\n\n[[Page S873]]\n\nto Federalist number 65, and in this trial today I will refer once \nagain to what Alexander Hamilton said in the Federalist on this \nparticular point. There Alexander Hamilton stated that impeachment \nproceedings:\n\n       . . . can never be tied down by such strict rules, either \n     in the delineation of the offense by the prosecutors, or in \n     the construction of it by the judges, as in common cases \n     served to limit the discretion of courts in favor of personal \n     security.\n\n  By that, he means in criminal cases. I think this statement from \nAlexander Hamilton refutes the argument of the President's counsel \ndirectly.\n  I also point out that unlike the judicial impeachments in the 1980s, \nPresident Clinton has not committed a handful of specific misdeeds that \ncan be easily listed in separate articles of impeachment. In order to \nencompass the whole assortment of misdeeds that caused the House of \nRepresentatives to impeach the President, the Judiciary Committee \nlooked to the more analogous case, that of President Nixon. In 1974, in \nthe proceedings with respect to President Nixon, the committee also was \nfaced with drafting articles of impeachment of a reasonable length \nagainst a President who had committed a series of improper acts \ndesigned to achieve an illicit end.\n  The first article against President Nixon charged that in order to \ncover up an unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic \nNational Committee and to delay, impede, and obstruct the consequent \ninvestigation and for certain other purposes, he engaged in a series of \nacts such as ``making or causing to be made false or misleading \nstatements to lawfully authorized investigative officers, endeavoring \nto misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, and endeavoring to cause \nprospective defendants and individuals, duly tried and convicted, to \nexpect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence \nor false testimony.\n  The articles did not--I repeat ``did not''--list each false or \nmisleading statement, did not list each misuse of the CIA, and did not \nlist each respective defendant and what they were promised. That is the \nrecord. Anyone who is familiar with the Nixon case--President Nixon \ncase--is familiar with those facts.\n  In like fashion, the articles of impeachment against President \nClinton charged him with providing perjurious, false, and misleading \ntestimony concerning four subjects, such as sexual relations with a \nsubordinate government employee, engaging in a course of conduct \ndesigned to prevent, obstruct, impede the administration of justice, \nwhich of course included four general acts, such as an effort to secure \njob assistance for that employee.\n  I would submit to you that an argument can be made that the articles \nof impeachment against President Clinton were drafted with more \nspecificity than the articles that were drafted against President \nNixon.\n  I will do my best to briefly address the second claim which has been \nasserted by the President's lawyers against the form of the articles of \nimpeachment; that is, that they are invalid, charging multiple offenses \nin one article. The articles of impeachment allege that President \nClinton made one or more perjurious, false and misleading statements to \nthe grand jury and committed one or more acts in which he obstructed \njustice.\n  Once again, these articles are modeled after the articles adopted by \nthe House Committee on the Judiciary against President Nixon and were \ndrafted with the rules of the Senate. Specifically in mind, the Senate \nrules explicitly contemplate that the House may draft articles of \nimpeachment in this manner and prior rules of the Senate have held that \nsuch drafting is not sufficient and will not support a motion to \ndismiss.\n  Rule XXIII of the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When \nSitting On Impeachment Trials now states that an article of impeachment \n``shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time \nduring trial.'' When the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration \namended rule XXIII in 1986, it explained that. And I quote this at \nlength. And this goes right to the heart of the matter. This is what \nthe Rules Committee in its report said. It said:\n\n       The portion of the amendment effectively enjoining the \n     division of an article into separate specifications is \n     proposed to permit the most judicious and efficacious \n     handling of the final question both as a general matter and, \n     in particular, with respect to the form of the articles that \n     proposed the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. The \n     latter did not follow the more familiar pattern of embodying \n     an impeachable offense in an individual article but, in \n     respect to the first and second of those articles, set out \n     broadly based charges alleging constitutional improprieties \n     followed by a recital of transactions illustrative or \n     supportive of such charges. The wording of Articles I and II \n     expressly provided that a conviction could be had thereunder \n     if supported by ``one or more of the enumerated \n     specifications. . . . [I]t was agreed to write into the \n     proposed rules language which would allow each Senator to \n     vote to convict under either the first or second articles if \n     he were convinced that the person impeached was `guilty' of \n     one or more of the enumerated specifications.''\n\n  The Senate rules themselves, thus, specifically contemplate that an \narticle of impeachment may include multiple specifications of \nimpeachable conduct as in the case of President Nixon. The Senate \nitself has recognized the articles against President Nixon as an \nappropriate model to be followed. The House has, in the articles now \nbefore the Senate, simply followed that model.\n  Moreover, I would point out in conclusion that the Senate has \nconvicted a number of judges on such omnibus articles, including Judges \nArchibald, Louderback and Claiborne.\n  I would submit to the Members of the Senate that the articles of \nimpeachment against President Clinton present his offenses and their \nconsequences in an appropriately transparent and understandable manner. \nThey are not constitutionally deficient.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is sent by Senators Dodd and Leahy:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question by Senators Thurmond, Grassley, Chafee, and \n     Craig; particularly what would have stopped or limited the \n     House in specifying precisely the statements on which the \n     articles were based?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. In our case, we are talking about an allegation of \nperjury. In the Nixon case--in the 1974 Nixon case--he was not charged \nwith perjury. I think our argument was that perjury is a different kind \nof thing. You have to be very specific in what you charge, and you have \nto be very clear as to what the statement is when you are charging \nperjury. And that is the tradition of our criminal justice system and \nof our jurisprudence.\n  The danger here is that if you do not, if you are overly broad, as we \ncontend in article I, that at any given moment you can fill the vessel \nwith what your meaning is.\n  Let me give you a little history of these allegations of grand jury \nperjury against the President.\n  The Starr referral had three allegations. The Starr referral was \nSeptember 9. Mr. Schippers, when he made his presentation to the \nJudiciary Committee, had two allegations. One was different. He \nincorporated one of Starr's. When Starr appeared and testified on \nNovember 19 in front of the Judiciary Committee, he almost spent no \ntime on this at all--one or two sentences. But he added a new charge, \nwhich was that the President was not truthful when he testified that he \nhad been truthful in the deposition.\n  Then, we appeared and made our representations and our defense on \nbehalf of the President on the basis of what Mr. Starr had written in \nhis referral and what Mr. Schippers had presented to the Judiciary \nCommittee and in addition to what Mr. Starr had said when he appeared. \nBut then when Mr. Schippers gave his closing argument the following \nday, we saw the new articles. We had, by my count, 10 allegations from \nMr. Schippers. Two had to do with the definition of sexual relations. \nThree had to do with the prepared statement. Two had to do with things \nthat were never alleged again and never surfaced again in the course of \nthe case. And they had to do with Mr. Bennett and his proffer of the \nLewinsky affidavit.\n  Then, on December 16 we had a whole new additional collection of \nreports of allegations. And on January 11, the file brief here set \nforth eight examples.\n\n  Just to highlight the danger of not being specific, of not tying \nyourself to a definition, let me compare, for example, the trial brief \nthat was submitted\n\n[[Page S874]]\n\nby the House managers 3 days before Mr. Rogan made his presentation.\n  The precise statement that the President is accused of testifying \nfalsely in front of a grand jury was that he was lying when he said \nthat the reason that he was seeing Betty Currie was to refresh his \nrecollection. In the trial brief--they make that reference one, two, \nthree, four times--that the statement that is specific here in the \ntrial brief is he lied when he said he was going to refresh his \nrecollection. That is not even mentioned in Mr. Rogan's presentation. \nHe changes it. And he says he lied when he said he wanted to ascertain \nwhat the facts were, trying to ascertain what Betty's perception was--a \nvery different statement requiring a very different defense. And 2 days \nbefore, 3 days before we even hear the allegations on the floor of the \nSenate, we still don't know precisely what they are.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may absorb whatever \nrebuttal time is still available to us, may I for just a moment, sir?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Sure.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you.\n  I want to talk briefly about just two aspects of Manager Canady's \npresentation.\n  First of all, he asks why didn't we seek a bill of particulars. Well, \nlet me all remind the Senators, although I don't think any of you were \nhere at the time of the trial of Judge Louderback who also saw a bill \nof particulars, and the House of Representatives at the time made it \nclear that the managers do not have the authority to rewrite the \narticles, though they certainly have, I suggest, attempted to do so on \nthe fly, but that it would have required a remand to the House of \nRepresentatives in order to have a bill of particulars to judge what \nthey themselves meant when they had passed these articles.\n\n  Second, just very briefly, I spoke to the issue of multiplicity, \nduplicity, the other day, and the question of whether the rule 23 \nrevision makes any difference. As I pointed out--and I won't embarrass \nhim any further--one Member of this body spoke at length about the \nimportance of not loading up multiple offenses into one count well \nafter the revision of rule 23, clearly with no sense that this body had \nbeen precluded from dealing with the critical issue of whether a two-\nthirds vote can sensibly be taken on an article that contains multiple \nand, particularly as my colleague, Mr. Craig, indicated, multiple \nnonspecific violations.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Thompson and Grassley, Thurmond, Allard, \nFrist, Burns, and Inhofe direct this question to the President's \ncounsel:\n\n       If the President were a Federal judge accused of committing \n     the same acts of perjury and obstruction of justice and the \n     Senate found sufficient evidence that the acts alleged were \n     committed, should the Senate vote to convict?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. This will sound half hearted, but it is not. I am \nglad you asked that question. This really goes right to the heart of \nthe managers' argument here, which is that there is no difference in \nthe consideration of the impeachment process between an allegation \nagainst a Federal judge and an allegation against the President of the \nUnited States.\n  I will not repeat the extended discussion of this subject of a few \ndays ago, but let me try to summarize very briefly. It is absolutely \ncrystal clear from the history of the drafting of the impeachment \nclause that the concern of the framers was, is there such action as to \nsubvert our Government that we can no longer persist in permitting, in \ntheir case, the President of the United States to remain in office. \nThat question must be dramatically different when you ask it about the \nconduct of 1 of 1,000 judges.\n  Beyond that, it is also clear that there has been extended debate in \nmany forums and at many times in the past 210 years about, indeed, just \nwhat the standard is for the impeachment of judges.\n  I hesitate to do this, and I do it apologetically, Mr. Chief Justice, \nbut the Chief Justice himself in an earlier time and an earlier guise \nspoke to this issue and made it clear--this during his tenure as \nassistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel--when the \nissue was being debated whether there was a nonconstitutional, \nnonimpeachment device for disposing of judges alleged to have engaged \nin misconduct that may not fall within the high crimes and misdemeanors \nprovision of the impeachment clause, that, indeed, the good behavior \nstandard for judges was something far broader than the standard to be \napplied under the high crimes and misdemeanors standard. And, indeed, \nthat debate was resumed many years later in the context of a further \neffort to establish a nonconstitutional device for removing judges.\n  That history, and just the core question, do you ask the same \nquestions about the trauma that the Nation suffers when you are \nremoving a judge and you are removing a President, the answer must be \nno. You must ask, what is the nature of the perjury that has been \ncommitted? What is the nature of the offense that has been committed? \nWhat is the factual setting in which it occurs? And, ultimately, does \nit so subvert the accused's ability to perform the duties of his office \nthat you must remove him?\n\n  That question for Judge Nixon, convicted and imprisoned, has got to \nbe different from--``different'' is much too mild a word--stunningly \ndifferent from the question you ask against the backdrop of our history \nwhen you ask whether the President of the United States should be \nremoved and the will of the electorate overturned.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Dorgan and Baucus and Schumer to the \nPresident's counsel:\n\n       In Counselor Ruff's presentation, he set forth a time line \n     that undermined the managers' theory that Judge Wright's \n     December 11 discovery letter triggered an intensification of \n     the President's and Jordan's efforts to assist Lewinsky in \n     finding a job. In response to Mr. Ruff's presentation, the \n     managers handed out a press release outside the Senate \n     Chamber asserting that it was the December 5 issuance of the \n     witness list in the Jones case and not the judge's discovery \n     order on the 11th that triggered the intensification of the \n     job search. It does not appear consistent with assertions \n     made by the House managers in their trial brief and oral \n     presentations. Please comment.\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. It was the assertion very clearly voiced in Mr. \nManager Hutchinson's presentation and very clearly made in the trial \nbrief of the House managers that it was, indeed, the December 11 order \nthat--I used the word ``jump-started'' yesterday--that catalyzed, that \npushed forward, the job search.\n  If you look at page 21 of the House managers' brief, you see them say \nthis sudden interest was inspired by a court order entered on December \n11, 1997. Now, their position could not have been clearer until we \nbegan our presentations, and then, all of a sudden, it wasn't the \nDecember 11 order; it was, instead, the December 5 witness list.\n  Well, there are a number of things to be said about that. One of them \nis that they have very clearly said that there was no urgency at all \nafter the witness list arrived to help Ms. Lewinsky. They have said \nthat Mr. Jordan met with the President on December 5 but that meeting \nhad nothing to do with Ms. Lewinsky. This was in the majority report at \npage 11. They said that very clearly.\n  So they have now suddenly--because it has been clear that the \nDecember 11 order was entered at a time when Mr. Jordan was flying to \nEurope, he could not have known about it. He had met with Ms. Lewinsky \nearlier that day. And, indeed, that December 11 meeting had sprung from \nactions taken by Ms. Lewinsky in a phone call with Mr. Jordan in \nNovember. They had set that--they agreed that when Mr. Jordan returned \nto the country, they would set up a meeting. They did that on December \n5, or she tried to get in touch on December 5. They tried to get--they \nfinally succeeded in getting in touch on December 8, and that was not \nat a time she knew she was on the witness list.\n  So the point is these were two entirely separate chains of events \ngoing forward--the job search and the witness list. And nothing \nsupports the intensification theory presented by the managers, \ncertainly not this new, ``Well, it wasn't the December 11th order; it \nwas the December 5th order.''\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Ashcroft and Hatch--is there anyone on \nthe floor who can't hear me? This is for the House managers:\n\n       The White House makes much of the fact that Vernon Jordan \n     was on a flight to Holland on December 11 before Judge Wright\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\n     ruled that afternoon that other women who may have had \n     relationships while in President Clinton's employ were \n     relevant to the Jones suit. However, the President was faxed \n     a witness list on December 5 and actually reviewed it no \n     later than the 8th. Thus, isn't the White House argument that \n     the President had no incentive to assist Ms. Lewinsky's job \n     search until December 11 just a red herring?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And I \nappreciate the opportunity to respond here.\n  Just let me say, by way of preface, that we are lawyers. We are \ntrying to do three things at once. Usually you have an opening \nstatement where you outline where you want to go in a case, then you \nhave a presentation of the evidence, then you have a closing argument. \nAnd we are trying to do it all at the same time.\n  It is for that reason, as I said at the very beginning of my \npresentation, that you need to pay attention to the record and to the \nfacts. That is what you depend upon. And I get carried away in my \nargument. I am arguing, just as they are arguing their theory of the \ncase. We are both arguing a point of view here, and it is up to you to \nmake the determination.\n  I have great respect for these counselors. They are admirable. They \nare doing a great job for their client, and they are presenting their \ntheory of the case. We are arguing our point of view, and it is the \nfacts that make the determination.\n  Now, let me go back to--and you have it in front of you--my \npresentation, exhibit C, which I guess is the third exhibit, which is \nreally the White House exhibit that Mr. Ruff had up here for a number \nof days, because they were really trying to hammer home this statement \nthat I made in my presentation. I hope you all have that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Just tell us.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I will tell it to you then. Thank you.\n  Exhibit C--which I hope you have; we asked them to distribute that--\nis a statement that Mr. Ruff portrayed, from me, which in my \npresentation I said: ``The judge--the witness list came in, the judge's \norder came in, that triggered the president into action and the \npresident triggered Vernon Jordan into action.''\n  Now there are two things that I am pointing to as the trigger \nmechanisms for the job search intensification. One of them is the \nwitness list that comes in on December 5, the President knows about, at \nthe latest, on December 6. The other thing that intensified that effort \nwas the judge's order on December 11.\n  They went through this long circumstance of Mr. Jordan being in \nHolland and the time of the phone call with the judge and all of that, \nshowing that the judge's order of December 11 could not have triggered \nany action on the 11th. There is no question about that. That is \nobvious from the facts, as it was obvious when I made my presentation. \nThe meetings on the 11th, with Vernon Jordan and Monica Lewinsky, were \ntriggered by the witness list coming on the 5th, that the President \nknew about on the 6th, that he discussed with Vernon Jordan as well.\n\n  Now, we say that the judge's order of the 11th, which was filed that \nday--the only thing that was filed on the 12th was their memorandum of \nthat telephone conversation--that triggered additional action down the \nroad. The job search was not over; the activity continued into January. \nAnd, so, that all put pressure on the ultimate fact, in January when \nthe job was obtained, the false affidavit was filed.\n  Now let me just point to a couple of other things along that line. We \nneed to look at this because they basically make the point that there \nis not any connection between the false affidavit--and that is my \ncharacterization--that was filed, and the job search. But if you look \nat the testimony of Vernon Jordan, and that is exhibit--I think they \nare giving them out now--F, that I am presenting to you, the sworn \ntestimony of Vernon Jordan which was on March 3 of 1998, he testifies \nin answer to a question:\n\n       Counselor, the lady comes to me with a subpoena in the \n     Paula Jones case that I know, as I have testified here today \n     was about sexual harassment. . . . you didn't have to be an \n     Einstein to know that that was a question that had to be \n     asked by me at that particular time because heretofore this \n     discussion was about a job.\n\n  And then he says, ``The subpoena changed the circumstances.'' And I \nthink this is important, that Mr. Jordan, who is filled with common \nsense, he says you don't have to be an Einstein. You don't have to be \nlearned, like Mr. Ruff or any of the other White House counsel, to \napply common sense. Common sense tells you that whenever he knew about \nthe subpoena, it escalated to a new arena and obviously the witness \nlist would have the same impact.\n  And, so, Mr. Jordan himself makes the connection, the job search was \none thing but whenever she became a witness in the Jones case, that \nchanged everything. That changed the circumstances. And let me tell \nyou, that is a friend of the President who is making that statement.\n  And, so, we have to take this picture, that they were related as they \nwere going two tracks, they became interconnected and became one track.\n  The final point--and this was raised on the job search issue--that \nthe call by Mr. Jordan to Mr. Perelman, the CEO of the parent company \nof Revlon, really had no impact on Monica Lewinsky getting a job \nbecause there is a misinterpretation as to how well she did on the \ninterview. But if you look back to the testimony, the grand jury \ntestimony, there was a connection, because Mr. Jordan calls Mr. \nPerelman and, as he characterized it: Make it happen if it can happen. \nMr. Perelman then calls Mr. Durnan, and then Mr. Durnan calls Ms. \nSeidman, who was actually doing the interview the next day with Monica \nLewinsky.\n  So the person who was going to make the decision whether to hire \nMonica Lewinsky got the word down through the channel before that \ninterview took place and before the decision was made. And of course \nthe important thing is: What was the intent? Not the result, but the \nintent. And I think that you can see that there was an intent to make \nsure that Monica Lewinsky was taken care of. Again she was on board, \npart of the team, before she actually would have to give testimony or \nthe President would have to give testimony.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question from Senator Boxer, and it is to \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       In light of the concession of Manager Hutchinson that Judge \n     Wright's order had no bearing on the ``intensity'' of the job \n     search, can you comment on the balance of his claim on the \n     previous question?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, could I object to the form \nof the question? That was not proper characterizing what I just stated.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I don't think managers--I am not sure whether the \nmanagers--can the managers object to a question? (Laughter.)\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I withdraw my objection.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. I think--the Parliamentarian says they \ncan only object to an answer, not to a question, which is kind of an \nunusual thing, but----\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I was going to remark that they \ncan if they have the courage.\n  I want to link up my response to Manager Hutchinson's most recent \ncomments with the previous discussion about vagueness. If there was \never a moving target, we have just seen it in motion: Well, it really \nwasn't December 11, because now we know it didn't happen on December \n11, so let's go to December 19, or maybe January 8, and somewhere in \nthere we are going to find the right answer.\n  I suggest to you that that is reflective of both the difficulty we \nhave had in coming to grips with these charges and, candidly, the \ndifficulty that the House might have had figuring out what those \ncharges really were.\n  Let me just respond briefly to Mr. Manager Hutchinson's argument. And \nlet me focus, first, on another portion of his presentation in which he \nstates, and there--and he is referring now to Ms. Lewinsky--she is \nreferring to a December 6 meeting with the President in which, as you \nwill recall, she has testified that there was a brief discussion about \nher efforts to get a job through Mr. Jordan and the President sort of \nvaguely said, ``Yes, I'll do something about that.'' And this is Mr. \nManager Hutchinson's characterization of that moment. December 6, you \nwill recall, is the day after the witness list comes out and the day on \nwhich she learns of it:\n\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\n\n       So you can see from that that it was not a high priority \n     for the President either. It was, ``Sure, I'll get to that, I \n     will do that.'' But then the President's attitude suddenly \n     changed. What started out as a favor for Betty Currie \n     dramatically changed after Ms. Lewinsky became a witness and \n     the judge's order was issued again on December 11.\n\n  But to the extent the managers now seek to drag the intensification \nprocess back into the December 5 or 6 period, which is when Ms. \nLewinsky went onto the witness list, you must look at what they say.\n  Page 11, majority brief, Mr. Jordan met President Clinton the next \nday, December 7, but they didn't discuss the job at all. Now, it is \nabsolutely clear that the President knew that Ms. Lewinsky was on the \nwitness list when he met with Mr. Jordan on December 7, and yet the \nissue of Monica Lewinsky didn't even surface.\n  I am getting some help here.\n  ``The first''--``the first,'' their words, page 11, majority brief, \nmajority report--``The first activity calculated to help Ms. Lewinsky \nactually get a job took place on December 11. There was no urgency.''\n  It is possible, of course, as their trial brief reflects, to bob and \nweave and dodge around the facts here, but their trial brief says:\n\n       There was obviously--\n\n  Referring to the period after she appears on the witness list--\n\n       There was obviously still no urgency to help Ms. Lewinsky.\n\n  And even they acknowledge that the December 7 meeting with Mr. Jordan \nwas unrelated to Ms. Lewinsky.\n  But let me point, because I think this really goes to the heart of \nit, to what the managers ask you to think about in this context in \nwhich now, whether we call it a confession or simply an acknowledgment, \nwhat they asked you to do when you heard the recitation about the \nDecember 11 events. We now know Mr. Jordan is flying over the Atlantic \nat the critical moment, and here is what Mr. Manager Hutchinson asks \nyou to do with Vernon Jordan, distinguished citizen, distinguished \nlawyer:\n\n       Now, if we had Mr. Jordan on the witness stand--which I \n     hope to be able to call Mr. Jordan--you would need to probe \n     where his loyalties lie, listen to the tone of his voice, \n     look into his eyes and determine the truthfulness of his \n     statements. You must decide whether he is telling the truth \n     or withholding information.\n\n  There is only one message there: Vernon Jordan must have been lying \nor at least there is enough question about his credibility and his \nhonesty and his decency to explore whether he was lying. If you \npredicate that question on the, shall we say, erroneous recitation of \nevents on December 11, you need to know nothing more about what the \ntime line and the chronology and the managers' theory of this case is \nall about.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Sessions, Gramm of \nTexas, Smith of New Hampshire, Inhofe, Allard, and Roberts. It is \ndirected to the House managers:\n\n       In defense of the President, Ms. Mills has repeatedly \n     stated, and has just reiterated, that the crime of witness \n     tampering requires some element of threat, intimidation or \n     pressure. Isn't it true that section 1512(b) criminalizes \n     anyone who corruptly persuades or engages in misleading \n     conduct with the intent to influence the testimony of any \n     person in an official proceeding? Please explain.\n\n  Mr. Manager BARR. Mr. Chief Justice, we appreciate the question from \nthe Senators, since it bears on a number of different questions and a \ngreat deal of the evidence that you all have heard in this case.\n  One can talk around the law, one can talk about the law, one can \nignore the law and, as we have seen, one can break the law, but one has \nto deal with the law in court and in these proceedings. And that is why \nthroughout these proceedings the Senators have heard us, as the House \nmanagers on behalf of the House of Representatives, and as the \npresenters of this case against the President, refer repeatedly and \nexplicitly to the actual language of the statutes which form the basis \nfor the articles of impeachment against President William Jefferson \nClinton.\n  Counsel Mills has, in fact, misrepresented the law of tampering with \nwitnesses as set forth very explicitly in section 1512 of title 18 of \nthe United States Code. In her arguments 2 days ago, Ms. Mills quite \nexpressly stated that one of the elements that a prosecutor must charge \nand that must be found here, if, indeed, article II, which is \nobstruction of justice, should lie as the basis for a conviction \nthereon, one must find that tampering under 1512 requires threats or \ncoercion. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Now, if, in fact, Ms. Mills had stated to this body that one of the \nbases, one of several bases on which a prosecutor or we, as House \nmanagers, could, indeed, show this body that tampering with a witness \nwould lie, includes, as an alternative, as an option, threats or \ncoercion, she would have, instead of being misleading, been absolutely \ncorrect. That was not her position.\n  Section 1512 of the United States Code expressly does not require \nthreats of force, intimidation or coercion. It may be based on the \nperson corruptly persuading another person or engaging in misleading \nconduct toward another person, both of which are terms, the definitions \nfor which are not found in the ether but are found, yet further \nreading, in title 18. Neither of them requires threats, intimidation or \ncoercion.\n  Moreover, in considering whether or not section 1512 or, indeed, its \ncompanion section, 1503, also obstruction of justice under the U.S. \nCriminal Code, which also does not require for a conviction to lie \nthereon threats of force, intimidation or coercion, but also may be and \nis based on corruptly influencing, those terms are expressly defined \nand dealt with not only in the definitional provisions of title 18, and \nincluding specifically definitions that apply to these provisions, \nthese sections, but also in the case law.\n  We would respectfully direct the attention of the Senators in \nreviewing the law of obstruction of justice and the law of tampering \nwith witnesses to some of the very cases cited by the attorneys for the \nPresident in their effort to deflect attention away from these \nparticular provisions of the law as they apply to the conduct of the \nPresident.\n  For example, in her presentation, Presidential Counsel Mills relied \non the Supreme Court case of United States versus Aguilar in her \nstatements. In that case, the Court held that a lie told to a criminal \ninvestigator was insufficient to prove witness tampering.\n  What Ms. Mills failed to disclose, however, was that the Court's \ndecision in that case, in that Aguilar case, was based on a specific \nfinding not applicable to the facts of this case that the evidence was \ninsufficient to prove that the defendant could have even thought that \nthe investigator was a potential witness at the time that he lied to \nhim.\n  The overwhelming body of evidence in this case, as we have heard yet \nthis morning, most recently in response to questions, is that not only \ncould the President, and the President did in fact reasonably presume, \nindeed almost invite, the lawyers in the Jones case to subpoena Ms. \nCurrie as a witness, but we have found, contrary to the prior \nmisleading statements of Counsel Ruff, she was, in fact, subpoenaed and \ncalled as a witness.\n  Therefore, we believe that on both arguments raised by counsel for \nthe President seeking to deflect attention away from and render \ninapplicable both obstruction provisions, 1503 and 1512, because they, \none, require--as we have shown they do not--but they would argue they \nrequire coercion, threats, intimidation or force or, two, they are \ninapplicable because the President could not have reasonably believed \nor did not know that Ms. Currie was a witness, could reasonably be \nexpected to be a witness at the time the coercion took place.\n  I would yield for 1 minute to House Manager Graham.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I believe the House managers' time has expired.\n  Mr. Manager BARR. I will not yield to House Manager Graham.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Byrd, to the President's counsel:\n\n       Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist essay No. 65, states that \n     ``The subjects of impeachment are ``those offenses which \n     proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other \n     words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.'' \n     Putting aside the specific legal questions concerning perjury \n     and obstruction of justice, how does the President defend \n     against the charge that, by giving false and misleading \n     statements under oath, such ``misconduct'' abused or violated \n     ``some public trust\"?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, this, too, goes to the very \nheart of the deliberations in which you must engage at the end of these \nproceedings.\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nAs I have tried to make clear in my earlier arguments, it is not enough \nsimply, I think, to ask does a particular generic form of misconduct, \nhowever serious it may be, lead inexorably to the conclusion that the \nPresident of the United States has committed an impeachable offense?\n  As the framers made clear, and I think the history that lay behind \ntheir deliberations and the history that has followed make clear, when \nwe speak of the kind of political--in caps, which is what it was in \nFederalist 65--offenses against the man in his public role, we speak of \noffenses which this body must ultimately judge as being so violative of \nhis public responsibilities that our system cannot abide his continuing \nin office.\n  Let us assume for a moment--and we will disagree with each and every \nelement of the accusation--but let us assume for a moment that this \nbody were to conclude that the President lied in the grand jury about \nhis relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. That in and of itself does not lead \nto the judgment, and in our view must not lead to the judgment, that he \nneeds to be removed from office. It must give you pause. You must think \ncarefully about it.\n  But ultimately you must ask, despite our rejection of any such \nconduct--whether it be a judge or a President or any other civil \nofficer--have the framers instructed us to remove from his office, and \noverturn the will of the electorate, a President who, admittedly, if \nyou conclude that he did violate the law in this regard, has violated a \npublic trust in the broadest sense, as each of us does who serves the \npublic, if we do anything other than that which are our properly \nassigned responsibilities, and do them with the utmost of integrity? \nEach of us violates that trust if we don't meet that standard.\n  But the one thing we can be certain of is that the framers understood \nthe frailties with which they were dealing. They understood the nature \nof the offense that had been the background of impeachment proceedings \nin England. And certainly the framers, in their debate, made it clear \nthat it has to be at the highest level of public trust--the breach of \nthe public trust that is embodied in the words ``treason,'' \n``bribery,'' ``selling your office'' and similar other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n  And so all I ask the Senators in this regard is not to simply leap, \nas the managers would have you do it, from the definition of the \noffense or the statute governing their conduct, but to ask the \nconstitutional question, as I know you will, the framers' question. If \nwe have not convinced you on the facts, I hope we will convince you \nthat the framers would have asked: Is our system so endangered that we \nmust not only turn the President over to the same rule of law that any \nother citizen would be put under, after he leaves office, but must we \ncut short his term and overturn the will of the Nation? And in our \nview, in the worst case scenario, you can find the answer to that \nquestion must still be no.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Lott asks the House managers:\n\n       Do the managers wish to respond to the answer just given by \n     the President's counsel?\n\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, we \nwould briefly respond to the response just given by counsel for the \nPresident. We believe that the response and the position taken by the \ncounsel for the President here really involves two great errors. One \nerror is in establishing a standard of conduct for the Presidency that \nis too low. The other error is in attempting to minimize the \nsignificance of the offenses that this President has been charged with \nand which we submit to you the evidence supports the charges.\n  Now, we do not submit that any President--this President, whoever it \nmay be--should be impeached and removed from office for trivial or \ninsubstantial offenses. We believe that an essential part of the focus \nof your inquiry must be on whether there was a serious, corrupt intent \ninvolved in the underlying conduct.\n  A President should not be impeached and removed from office for a \nmistake of judgment. He should not be impeached and removed for a \nmomentary lapse. Instead, he should be impeached and removed if he \nengages in a conscious and deliberate and settled choice to do wrong, a \nconscious and deliberate and settled choice to violate the laws of this \nland.\n  We submit that he must be impeached and removed if he does that, \nbecause in doing so he has violated his oath of office and in doing so \nhe has turned away from the unique role which he has under our \nConstitution, as the Chief Executive, charged with ensuring that the \nlaws be faithfully executed. He steps aside from that role and takes on \nthe role of one who attacks the rule of law. And it is for that reason \nthat we believe that this President should be removed. And we would \nfurther submit that the attempt to minimize the significance of the \nconduct of this President does a disservice to the laws of this land.\n  The attempt to minimize this course of conduct, which started out as \nan effort to deprive a plaintiff in a civil rights case of her just day \nin court, is a serious course of conduct, a course of conduct which \nbrings disrespect on the office of the Presidency and, indeed, \nundermines the integrity of the office of the Presidency, the integrity \nof the judicial system. And it is for all of those reasons that we \nwould submit to you that the President's counsels' efforts to persuade \nyou that this course of conduct is not impeachable are not persuasive \nand should not be accepted by the Senate in this case.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Torricelli and Rockefeller ask, to the \nPresident's counsel:\n\n       The House managers have made the overly broad argument that \n     ``[n]othing in the text, structure, or history of the \n     Constitution suggests officials are subject to impeachment \n     only for official conduct.'' Can this unbending argument be \n     reconciled with the following statement from Justice James \n     Wilson: ``Our President . . . is amenable to [the laws] in \n     his private character as a citizen, and in his public \n     character by impeachment''--and with the standard adopted by \n     a bipartisan majority in the Watergate proceedings?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I could probably \nsimply say no, given the articulate framing of that question, and I \nwould have said as much as needed to be said.\n  I think the managers have, in their strawman-building role, tried to \nsuggest that our position somehow is so distant from constitutional \nrealities and the realities of the operations of our Government that we \ncould not conceive of a situation in which private conduct, no matter \nhow egregious, would lead to removal. Of course, that is not the case. \nNone of us could contemplate a setting in which even personal conduct--\nand I need not go through any examples--was so egregious that the \npeople simply could not contemplate the notion of a President remaining \nin office.\n  But other than that, if there is one message that comes out, not only \nof Judge Wilson but of the entire debate of 1787 and all of the \ncommentary since then, it is that, indeed, the focus of attention must \nbe--and this goes back to, in large measure to Senator Byrd's \nquestion--must be on the public character of the man; the political, in \na broader sense, character of the man; and of his acts.\n  And if you look back at the 1974 writings of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, both majority and minority, this is not a partisan view. It \nmakes it absolutely--they make it absolutely clear that the House then \nbelieved something which they must either not believe today or have \nignored as they engaged in their discussions, which is that the test to \nbe applied is whether the President in this case has so abused the \npublic trust, so abused the powers of his office, that he goes to the \nvery heart of what the framers had in mind in 1787 when they carefully \nconfined and carefully limited the range of activity that could lead to \ncontemplation of removal, and that is not a range of activity that, \nwith all due respect, touches anywhere near the conduct that you have \nbefore you today.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Nickles asks the House managers:\n\n       President's counsel stated the President did not commit \n     perjury. Please respond.\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I trust that the presumption of \n5 minutes is a rebuttable one, correct? I will do my best not to have \nto go beyond the time. I thank the Senator for the question.\n  First, just as a predicate, obviously in 5 minutes I could not do a \ncomprehensive review on the perjury aspects of this case, so let me \njust start with a preliminary issue and we can\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nmove on with different questions and revisit the issue at another time. \nIf anybody wants a lesson in legal schizophrenia, please read the \nPresident's trial brief on this very subject. They skirt the issue by \nsaying nowhere in the President's grand jury deposition did he ever \naffirm the truth of his civil deposition testimony. But they won't come \nout and say he lied, they won't come out and say he perjured himself, \nand they try to ignore the actual fact of when the President was asked \nquestions about his oath that he took during the grand jury.\n  I read, therefrom:\n  Question to the President:\n\n       You understand the oath required you to give the whole \n     truth that is a complete answer to each question, sir.\n       Answer: I will answer each question as accurately and fully \n     as I can.\n\n  Question to the President:\n\n       Now, you took the same oath to tell the truth, the whole \n     truth, and nothing but the truth, on January 17, 1998, in a \n     deposition in the Paula Jones litigation, is that correct, \n     sir?\n       Answer: I did take an oath there.\n       Question: Did the oath you took on that occasion mean the \n     same to you then as it does today?\n       Answer: I believed then that I had to answer the questions \n     truthfully, that's correct.\n\n  The colloquy goes on. It is in your materials.\n  They attempt to say that that somehow inoculates the President from \nhaving to admit that he perjured himself during the Paula Jones \ndeposition.\n  But let's take a quick look at some of the answers he gave during the \nPaula Jones deposition that he affirmed in his grand jury testimony \nthat we now know is false.\n  Question to the President:\n\n       If she [Monica Lewinsky] told someone she had a sexual \n     affair with you beginning in November 1995, would that be a \n     lie?\n       Answer: It certainly would not be the truth.\n       Question: I think I used the term ``sexual affair;'' and so \n     the record is completely clear, have you ever had sexual \n     relations with Monica Lewinsky as that term is defined in \n     deposition exhibit No. 1?\n       Answer: I have never had sexual relations with Monica \n     Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.\n\n  Then they go on to ask:\n\n       Is it true that when Monica Lewinsky worked at the White \n     House, she met with you several times?\n       Answer: I don't know about ``several times.'' There was a \n     period when the Republican Congress shut the government down. \n     The whole White House staff was being run by interns. She \n     was assigned to work back in the Chief of Staff's Office. \n     We were all working there. I saw her on two or three \n     occasions then. And then when she worked at the White \n     House I think there were one or two times when she brought \n     some documents down to me.\n       Question: At any time were you and Monica Lewinsky in the \n     hallway between the oval office and the kitchen area?\n       Answer: I don't believe so unless we were walking back to \n     the dining room with pizzas. I just don't remember. I don't \n     believe we were in the hallway, no.\n\n  This colloquy goes on and on. I invite the Senate to review the \nPresident's deposition testimony.\n  He clearly was giving answers that were false. They were not part of \nthe record. He wasn't doing it to protect himself from embarrassment; \nhe was doing it to defeat Paula Jones' sexual harassment case. When the \nPresident testified in August before the grand jury, he never denied \nthe truth of those testimonies. He refused to admit he lied during the \ndeposition. He reiterated the truth of those because he knew he would \nbe subject to perjury.\n  The question for the President's counsel is this, and it is a simple \nquestion: Did the President lie under oath on January 17 when he was \nasked questions about the nature of his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky? Did he lie when the U.S. Supreme Court had said Paula Jones \nhad a right to proceed in a sexual harassment case? Did he lie when \nJudge Susan Webber Wright ordered him to answer those basic questions \nunder oath? And if the answer to that question is yes, then we have an \nincredible admission; if the answer is no, I invite them to point to \nthe record where that is demonstrated.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. To the President's counsel from Senators Conrad \nand Torricelli:\n\n       The House of Representatives rejected two proposed articles \n     of impeachment, including an article of alleged perjury in \n     the Jones deposition. Do you believe that the Senate may, \n     consistent with its constitutional role, convict and remove \n     the President based on the allegations under the rejected \n     articles, including the allegations of perjury?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Mr. Chief Justice, article II was defeated. But \nmore importantly, article I specifically incorporates by reference, or \ntries to incorporate by reference, all the elements of article II. And \nthe House of Representatives, when they voted to reject article II, I \nthink, voted also to eliminate these issues that you have just heard \nabout.\n  Now, we predicted--and our prediction has come true--that the \nmanagers would like to argue this case. If you look at--if you look at \nthe majority point that comes out before the vote occurs on all four \narticles and you go to article I and you try to find out where in \narticle I they define those perjurious statements that compose subpart \n(2), the civil deposition, you will see in the majority report they say \ngo look at article II--which is the argument about the civil \ndeposition--and the House of Representatives specifically voted to take \nout all those accusations and allegations of misconduct with respect to \nthe civil deposition.\n  Now, I have testified, as did Mr. Ruff, before the Judiciary \nCommittee on this issue. I said that the President's responses in the \nJones deposition were surely evasive, that they surely were incomplete, \nthat they surely were intended to mislead; and it was wrong for him to \ndo all that. But they were not perjurious.\n  If you want to try a perjury case about all of the things and the \nstatements that the House of Representatives did not want to accuse him \nof, that would be inconsistent, I think, with your duty as members of \nthis court. You cannot impeach the President on the issues that are \nincluded in article II. He was not impeached; you cannot remove.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we have had an equal number of \nquestions, although the timing may not be exactly equal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we take a 15 minute recess at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, at 2:41 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n3:01 p.m.; whereupon the Senate reassembled when called to order by the \nChief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready to resume the \nquestions, and I believe this will be question No. 16. We send the \nquestion to the Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senator Santorum, Smith of \nOregon, and Thomas to the House managers:\n\n       Please respond to the presentation made by counsel to the \n     President, including the argument made by Mr. Craig, to the \n     effect that the rejection of article II had the effect of \n     eliminating that portion of article I. Did the House conclude \n     that lying in a civil deposition is not impeachable, but that \n     lying to the grand jury about whether the witness lied in a \n     civil deposition is impeachable?\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the Senators for the \nquestion and for the opportunity to rebut the presentation a few \nminutes ago by counsel for the President, Mr. Craig.\n  In his response he asks the Senate to do specifically what none of \nthe attorneys can do in their presentations, and that is go beyond the \nrecord. Specifically, Mr. Craig is asking the Senate to make \nassumptions as to why the House of Representatives defeated what was \nthen known as article II, a stand-alone article of impeachment that the \nPresident lied during the civil deposition. And he goes so far in his \npresentation to say because the House of Representatives defeated what \nwas then article II, the Senate should not consider any of the language \nrelating to the President's perjury during the civil deposition.\n  First, I ask the Senate not to make those assumptions because if \nthere was any reasonable inference to be drawn, it would be that it was \ncumulative. Why is it cumulative? Why did the House not want this to be \na stand-alone article? It is cumulative because, if Mr. Craig would \nread article I, he would see that one of the allegations of perjury is \nthat the President committed perjury in the grand jury when he \nreferenced his civil deposition answers and reiterated those to the \ngrand jury. And so the House made a decision not to use a separate \nstand-alone article. But I would respectfully submit to this body that \nthat is the only inference that can be drawn.\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\n  The other thing that I want to mention briefly about Mr. Craig's \npresentation on that issue is what I found to be a startling admission \non his part. Assuming, of course, that the Senate is going to look at \narticle I as it was drafted and passed by the House and is presented to \nyou dealing with civil deposition perjury, Mr. Craig said that the \nPresident's testimony in the Jones case was evasive and incomplete.\n  He goes even further in his testimony, or statement to the Senate a \ncouple days ago, and I am quoting. He said, ``The President's testimony \nin the Jones case, the President was evasive, misleading, incomplete in \nhis answers.''\n  That begs the question. What kind of oath did the President take in \nthe civil deposition? Did he take an oath, did he raise his hand and \nswear to tell the truth, the evasive truth, and nothing but the evasive \ntruth? Did he take an oath to tell the truth, the misleading truth, and \nnothing but the misleading truth? Did he take an oath to tell the \ntruth, the incomplete truth, and nothing but the incomplete truth? \nBecause, if he did, if that was the language that the President used \nwhen he took his oath and testified, then perhaps Mr. Craig's position \nis well taken. But a brief review of the oath that the President took \nclearly states that he took an oath and was obliged under the law to \ntell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth--not the \nincomplete or misleading truth, the truth, the whole truth, and nothing \nbut the truth.\n\n  And so this body has to make a determination when they review that \ntestimony, both given during the civil deposition and reiterated during \nthe grand jury, whether the President fulfilled his legal obligation in \na sexual harassment lawsuit. And if he did, then clearly that should be \nstricken, and you should not consider that. But if he did not, if you \nfind that in fact he testified, as Mr. Craig says he testified, \nincompletely, evasively, and misleadingly, then I believe this body has \nan obligation to cast a vote accordingly.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Reed of Rhode Island asks the White House \ncounsel:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question.\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  You know, Mr. Manager Rogan asked you not to make assumptions about \nwhat the actions of the House mean, and then proceeded to make a series \nof assumptions about what the House might have meant.\n  The problem with Mr. Manager Rogan's analysis is twofold: One, he and \nhis colleagues in the House on the Judiciary Committee drafted these \nfour articles. They believed, at least 20 of the majority believed, \nthat it should be an impeachable offense, as he now puts it: did he \nfulfill, did the President fulfill his obligation in the Jones \ndeposition? You don't need to make a lot of assumptions to understand \nmerely on the face of the action that was taken that the full House \nsaid, no, it is not, even if we were to conclude, as the House \nJudiciary majority wishes us to conclude, an impeachable offense.\n  And so the managers have had to find a way to drag back into article \nI all of the problems that they see in the President's testimony in the \nJones deposition. The problem is that--and you can listen to it in the \nlanguage that Mr. Manager Rogan has used not only today but earlier and \nthat is used in the brief filed by the House managers--that the \nPresident, in his words, referenced and reiterated his testimony in the \nJones case. Senators, that is not so.\n  Now, they try to hook onto a statement, as best we are able to tell \nin searching their position and their writings on the subject, the \nmanagers hook onto a statement in which the President said, I tried to \nwalk through the minefield of the Jones deposition without violating \nthe law and think I did. And, on that frail hook--which is clearly a \nstatement of the President's state of mind about whether he succeeded \nor didn't succeed in testifying without violating the law in the Jones \ncase--on that hook they hang every single item. They didn't tell us \nwhat they were--but they hang every single item that the House rejected \nout of hand in article II.\n\n  Now, wholly apart from the inadequacy of the predicate that they lay, \nif there was ever an example of a situation that Mr. Craig talked about \nearlier and that I talked about on Tuesday, in which I challenge \nanybody in this room to tell me how you would have known coming into \nthis Chamber what it was that the managers were alleging with respect \nto the Jones deposition, this is it.\n  If you listened--look at the trial brief. If you look at Manager \nRogan's presentation of the other day, if you listened to his \npresentation today, where, amongst all that, do we pick and choose to \nfind the statements? Even if you agree with Mr. Manager Canady that it \nis all right just to sort of generally charge, as a constitutional \nproposition--and I firmly disagree with that. I don't care under what \nlevel you are operating--the lowest trial court in the country--nobody \nwould ever say: Now, Mr. Defendant, I want you to understand that you \nare being charged with what you'll find at page, whatever it is, of the \nmajority report where we refer you over to this list of other things \nthat was rejected by--just let us say the grand jury--and somewhere in \nthere you are going to find the charges to which we ask you to respond.\n  The bottom line is, you can go down that list. Some of them you will \nnever hear mentioned in this Chamber--haven't heard them mentioned yet. \nI defy anybody in this Chamber, including the managers, to justify \nasking the President of the United States to defend against a reference \nfrom one page of a brief to another in order to tell the charges that \nhe has been accused of.\n  If you read his grand jury testimony, you see he addressed a number \nof issues that he addressed in the Jones deposition. He clarified. He \nelaborated. He told the truth in the grand jury. Not once was he ever \nasked by the independent counsel and all his lawyers there who had been \npursuing this investigation for 7 months when they had him in the grand \njury--not once did they ask him this simple question: Is everything you \ntestified to in the Jones deposition true? Or, go down the list and \nsay: Is what you testified to on page 6, or page 8, or page 87 true?\n  And when they got through with that deposition, 4 hours, professional \nprosecutors, and they went back and spent from August 18 to September \n9, when they sent their referral up, looking back, using a fine-tooth \ncomb on that transcript, and they went back and said--where are the \nviolations? Even they don't say that there is some sort of wholesale \nimportation of the Jones deposition into the grand jury. And, yet, not \nthe House but the Judiciary Committee majority report and the managers, \nwith that big, vacant, empty spot in the middle, the rejection of \narticle II by the House of Representatives, would have you believe \nthat, indeed, what the independent counsel's office didn't believe \nhappened and didn't force to make happen, did happen. And they are \nasking you to remove the President from office on that kind of logic.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senators Shelby and Snowe to the \nHouse managers.\n\n       There has been much debate regarding the nature of the \n     offenses that fit within the definition of ``high crimes and \n     misdemeanors.'' When employing this phrase in the \n     Constitution, the Framers relied on precedents supplied by \n     Colonial and English common law to provide context and \n     meaning. Please explain whether or not the offenses charged \n     in the two Articles fit within the types of impeachable \n     offenses contemplated by the Framers as they interpreted \n     Colonial and English common law precedent.\n\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the Senate, I \nwill be happy to respond to this question because it is a question that \ngoes to the heart of the matter that is before us.\n  On Saturday I made a presentation which focused on the history of the \nimpeachment process in Great Britain and the way in which that serves \nas a backdrop for the work of the framers. I would like to refer you, \nagain, to a document to which I made reference during the course of the \nproceedings on Saturday. This is a document which has also been \nreferred to repeatedly by counsel for the President. It is the report \nprepared by the staff of the impeachment inquiry in the case of \nPresident Nixon entitled ``Constitutional Grounds for Presidential \nImpeachment.''\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\n  I believe that in that report they grapple with the very issue that \nyou have now raised. And in characterizing the background of \nimpeachment and characterizing the things that the framers focused on \nboth in the course of the Constitutional Convention and in the \nratification debates and also--it goes a little beyond your question--\nthe course of impeachment proceedings over the last 200 years here in \nthe House of Representatives and in the Senate, they came to this \nconclusion, and this is what they said. They said:\n\n       The emphasis has been on the significant effects of the \n     conduct--undermining the integrity of office, disregard of \n     constitutional duties and oath of office, arrogation of \n     power, abuse of the governmental process, adverse impact on \n     the system of government.\n\n  They went on to say: ``Impeachment was evolved by Parliament to cope \nwith both the inadequacy of criminal standards''--and one of the issues \nthat they were concerned with was whether there had to be a criminal \nviolation in order for there to be a high crime or misdemeanor, and \nthey concluded, I believe rightly, that there need not be a criminal \noffense, but they said, ``Impeachment was evolved by Parliament to cope \nwith both the inadequacy of criminal standards and the impotence of \ncourts to deal with the conduct of great public figures.''\n  They concluded, then, by saying, ``Because impeachment of a President \nis a grave step for the nation''--which all of us in this Chamber \nconcede--``it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously \nincompatible with either the constitutional form and principles of our \ngovernment or the proper performance of constitutional duties of the \nPresidential office.''\n  That is the standard which they set forth, which I believe \nencapsulates the whole history of the experience of the English \nParliament, as well as the discussions in the Constitutional Convention \nand the ratification debates as well as anything I have seen.\n  Let me point out that this was a product of the staff of the Rodino \ncommittee. This is not something that the House managers here today \nhave come up with to support our case; it is there as part of the \nrecord.\n  Let me refer to another part of the--that particular report, which I \nthink gets to the essence of the matter here. They said, ``Each of the \nthirteen American impeachments''--of course, there have been more \nimpeachments since the time this was written--``involved charges of \nmisconduct incompatible with the official position of the officeholder. \nThis conduct falls into three broad categories.''\n  I think that this is a very sensible division of the types of conduct \nthat may fall--the types of conduct that constitute high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.\n\n       (1) exceeding the constitutional bounds of the powers of \n     the office in derogation of the powers of another branch of \n     government; (2) behaving in a manner grossly incompatible \n     with the proper function and purpose of the office; and (3) \n     employing the power of the office for an improper purpose or \n     for personal gain.\n\n  I would submit to you, in conclusion, that what we have before the \nSenate in this case is conduct that clearly falls within the scope of \ncategory 2, which I just read, which I will repeat--``behaving in a \nmanner grossly incompatible with the proper function and purpose of the \noffice''--for the very reasons I explained a few moments ago. When the \nPresident of the United States, who has taken an oath of office to \nsupport and defend the Constitution, who has a constitutional duty to \ntake care that the laws be faithfully executed, engages in a calculated \ncourse of criminal conduct, he has, in the most direct, immediate, and \nculpable manner, violated his oath of office, breached his duty under \nthe Constitution, and for that reason has behaved in a way that is \ngrossly incompatible with the proper function and role of the high \noffice to which he has been entrusted--which has been entrusted to him \nby the people of the United States.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question from Senator Bingaman to White House \ncounsel:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the Managers in their response to the \n     previous question?\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, let me make a couple \nof points, if I might. The question that was put to the managers \nstarted by asking what we can learn from looking back into English \nroots of impeachment and how that might bear on the decisions that you \nface in the coming days.\n  I will not, in any sense, hold myself out as a scholar or at least \nenough of one to be able to answer the question with any specificity, \nbut I do know enough about the parliamentary form of government and its \nexperience with impeachment to know that a couple of lessons can be \ndrawn from it.\n  First, that impeachment was a developing tool over the course of the \n14th, 15th, 16th and 17th centuries as a weapon in the battle between \nthe Parliament and the Crown. It was one of the ways--indeed, one of \nthe very few ways--the Parliament could reach out and remove the King's \nministers or the Queen's ministers, and that was really where the \nbattleground was.\n  Even in that setting, when it was an avowed political tool, history, \nI think, will tell us that Parliament did ask itself, Was the conduct \nof the minister at issue--whoever that minister might be--so subversive \nof the constitutional form of government that removal of the minister, \nor in some cases even more severe sanctions, was necessary?\n  If you transport that into the experience of the framers, it does two \nthings, I believe: One, it tells you what the framers knew of the \nseriousness of the offenses that had to be addressed through \nimpeachment and what the need for impeachment was as the ultimate \nsolution to the ultimate problem.\n  But it also tells you very clearly that the framers did not want to \nbring that English experience in wholesale because they recognized it \nfor what it was, which was, indeed, a weapon in the battle between the \nParliament and the Crown, and the government that they had created \nneeded balance among the legislature and the executive and the judicial \nbranch. The use of impeachment, as it was reflected over the four or \nfive centuries that had been developed, was not consistent with what \nthese framers were creating. And so they very carefully chose, and the \ndebates reflect that, to limit the scope of impeachment and to use it \nas they viewed it: only as a matter of constitutional last resort.\n  In doing so, they foretold, I think, the positions staked out both by \nthe majority and the minority at the time of Watergate. And let me \npause here just for a moment to say that I will not go into detail \nrespecting the conduct engaged in by former President Nixon, except to \nsay and suggest to you that it is so far distant from anything that has \nbeen charged here that it doesn't belong in the same sentence, \nparagraph, or certainly article.\n  But if you look at what came out of the House Judiciary Committee in \n1974, I agree entirely with the theme of the majority staff report at \nthe time, as did the minority. Their theme was the theme that I hope I \nhave sounded, probably too often, over the last few days. And I am \ngoing to read to you again--I apologize to you--something I read to you \nearlier, which is the minority view on the meaning of impeachment:\n\n       It is our judgment, based upon this constitutional history, \n     that the framers of the United States Constitution intended \n     that the President should be removable but by the legislative \n     branch only for serious misconduct dangerous to the system of \n     Government established by this Constitution. Absent the \n     element of danger to the State, we believe the delegates \n     to the Federal Convention of 1787--\n\n  I will skip over a little language here--\n\n     struck the balance in favor of stability in the executive \n     branch.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Grassley, Smith of New Hampshire, Bunning \nand Craig ask the House managers:\n\n       In your presentation, you made the case that the Senate \n     should call witnesses. In light of the White House's response \n     to this argument, do you still hold this position? Please \n     elaborate.\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice and Senators, the House \ndefinitely holds to the position that we should call witnesses. But I \nthink the issue here is what has been related to us in anything we have \nheard in the past few days by the White House counsel that would say we \ndon't need them, or I think just the contrary, what have we heard that \nsays we are more likely to need them, or you are more likely to need \nthem. First of all, I would like to\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\npoint out to you that the White House counsel is trying to have it both \nways.\n  They have been arguing to you on a lot of technicalities of the law, \nthe criminal law, for the last few days, and that is understandable.\n  As I said to you a few days ago, I think this is a two-stage process. \nWe, the managers, do. You have to determine if the President committed \ncrimes, and if he did, should he be removed from office: two separate \nquestions. They have argued to you that you should use the standard, \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, which is a criminal standard, and I might \nadd that standard is only for facts, it is not for whether you remove; \nit isn't to determine law.\n  You wear the hat as finders of fact as well as the judges, finders of \nthe law, and so forth. But if you choose to use that standard, you need \nto know, A, that it doesn't mean it excludes any doubt. You probably \nneed to hear a jury instruction, which we can provide at some \nreasonable point for you, about how a Federal court would charge a jury \nabout that.\n  But the point I am making is that they have claimed that, and they \nclaim there is a lack of specificity in the charges. We are not in \ncourt in the sense of a real trial here. We don't have to be specific \nlike that. The whole history of the articles of impeachment that have \ncome over here in the past on judges have never gotten down into the \ntechnical specificity of a courtroom and been thrown out because they \nwere not exactly right.\n  My point is they have gone and built up a whole case about we ought \nto follow these rules and have a criminal proceeding and judge the \ncrimes on that basis, and yet they have said you wouldn't have \nwitnesses or we shouldn't call witnesses.\n  In any criminal trial, you are going to call witnesses; you need to \njudge their credibility. I want to walk through what else they have \nsaid to you in the last couple of days that makes that point very clear \nwith regard to testimony, with regard to judging who you believe or who \nyou don't believe and how important that is.\n  First of all, let's just take a few glimpses, but as we do this, \nremember the big picture is the scheme the President has engaged in. \nThe whole basis for our discussion here today in each of these two \narticles of impeachment involves the questions of the President trying \nto thwart the Jones court will, trying to hide evidence from the court \nand planning not to tell the truth in that deposition in January. \nWhether that is over here on a perjury count or not is irrelevant. It \nis critical to this case for both obstruction of justice and perjury \nthat you accept and understand, as I think clearly you do from \nlistening to all of this, that the President lied many times in that \ndeposition in the Jones case because he didn't want them to get the \nfacts, the true facts of his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.\n\n  Well, in that process of looking at that, he needed Monica, if you \nrecall, to file a false affidavit. He needed to obscure the fact that \nthere were gifts there. He needed to obscure the trail that led to him \nin any detailed relationship with her.\n  So let's take, for example, the gift-exchange discussion counsel had \nout here a couple of days ago with us. They were pointing out to you--\nthe White House counsel--that on December 28, that Monica Lewinsky, in \nher grand jury testimony, testified that the President said to her--\nwith respect to what she should do about those gifts, and she raised \ngiving them to maybe Betty Currie--I don't know or let me think about \nthat.\n  The counsel said, well, let's go back and look at 10 different times \nwhere she said about that subject all kinds of different ways. I submit \nto you that her grand jury testimony, after she got the immunity to \ntestify, is clearly the most credible. We presented that to you, and \nthat is what the President said.\n  It is significant what he said, because that is part of your chain \nyou have to lead down the road to figure out whether or not he had the \nrequisite intent to go and influence the outcome of what was done with \nthe gifts.\n  The reality of this is that when you look at it, you have to question \nher testimony; you have to question her believability. You ought to \nbring her out here. She should be brought out here, if they are going \nto challenge her like this, and give an opportunity for us to examine \nher on both sides and determine what is her best testimony about that, \nif that is important to you, and apparently it is to White House \ncounsel.\n  The same thing is true of the questions with regard to Ms. Currie and \nthe phone call dealing with the question of coming over to get the \ngifts. There White House counsel is saying, in essence, Ms. Lewinsky is \nnot telling the truth; Ms. Currie is. If you don't have them here to \nlisten to, who are you going to believe? I suspect if Ms. Lewinsky came \nout here, that 1-minute phone conversation, which was not part of the \nStarr referral--we discovered that subsequent to that--would be \nsomething she could comment on and explain, and maybe Ms. Currie could, \ntoo. But we do not have that. And they made a big to-do over that in \nthe last couple days.\n  Last, but not least, what I put up on the chart here is dealing with \nthis affidavit. Now, this affidavit is very important. It is a central \npart of the obstruction of justice. It is the very first obstruction of \njustice and the question of truthfulness. And who you believe in this \npattern is very, very important.\n  The White House counsel have been arguing the last few days that, \nindeed, with regard to the cover stories, that there was no discussion \nof cover stories in a timely way during the December 17 phone \nconversation when the President suggested Monica Lewinsky file an \naffidavit, and that the cover story idea somehow isn't tied into the \nissue of putting into her head that she should tell a lie.\n  Well, I call your attention to what I read to you the other day. It \nis up here on this board. And I refer it back to you on the chart. This \nis one of the charts where she testified before the grand jury--Monica \nLewinsky did:\n\n       At some point in the conversation, and I don't know if it \n     was before or after the subject of the affidavit came up--\n\n  I don't know if it was before or after, but it was during that \nconversation on December 17 when the affidavit did come up--\n\n       he sort of said, ``You know, you can always say you were \n     coming to see Betty or that you were bringing me letters.'' \n     Which I understood was really a reminder of things that we \n     had discussed before.\n\n  And she went on to say the famous quote: ``And I knew exactly what he \nmeant [by this].''\n  And if you remember--I read that to you the other day--she also said: \n``It was the pattern of the relationship, to sort of conceal it.''\n  I am not going to put the other board up here, but in the same \ncontext they have been saying, with respect to this affidavit issue \nagain, ``No one asked me to lie.'' Remember that was repeated over and \nover and over again. And I, again, point out to you that you need to \nbring her in here, I think, based on what they are saying and arguing, \nto find out for yourself if she is going to corroborate this.\n  She said in the grand jury testimony:\n\n       For me, the best way to explain how I feel what happened \n     was, you know, no one asked or encouraged me to lie, but no \n     one discouraged me either.\n\n  And she went on to say: ``And by him not calling me and saying \nthat''--that she shouldn't lie; I didn't read the whole paragraph--``I \nknew what [he] meant.''\n  ``Did you understand all along that he would deny the relationship \nalso?''\n  She says: ``Mm-hmmm. Yes.''\n  The question: ``And when you say you understood what it meant when he \ndidn't say, `Oh, you know, you must tell the truth,' what did you \nunderstand that to mean?''\n\n  She says: ``That--that--as we had on every other occasion and every \nother instance of this relationship, we would deny it.''\n  If you believe her, then the President is not telling the truth. The \naffidavit clearly is something he was trying to get her to file \nfalsely. It makes sense that he would, because he relied on it in the \ndeposition. He patterned it after the cover stories in the affidavit--\nwhat he had to say--the lies he told about the relationship. It makes \ncommon sense to me.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. McCollum, I think you have answered the \nquestion.\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Thank you very much.\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\n  My point is, you ought to bring the witnesses.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Bryan to the White House \ncounsel:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question, focusing on the need for witnesses and the \n     time likely required to prepare for and conduct discovery?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, the first question to ask \nabout the need to call witnesses is, What would the witnesses add? That \nhas not been described. What you have heard are vague expressions of \ncredibility and hope. You have not heard specifically what these \nwitnesses would add. And the answer to that is, they would add nothing \nto what is not already there.\n  Yesterday, I held up the five volumes of testimony, thousands and \nthousands of pages. You have it before you. Now, those five volumes \nrepresent 8 or 9 months of activity by the independent counsel. The \nindependent counsel called many, many, many witnesses, many, many, many \ntimes. They proceeded with no limitation on their budget, on their \nresources. They turned things upside down. And they repeatedly--I think \nabusively--but they repeatedly called witnesses--like Ms. Currie, Mr. \nJordan, Ms. Lewinsky--back to the grand jury for repeated interviews. \nIt is all right there. And the managers have really told you nothing \nthat could be added to this record.\n  Second, they have not made a representation about what the witnesses \nwould really say that is different. And the reason they have not is \nthat they themselves don't know. They themselves have done no \ninvestigation. They don't know what these witnesses would say. They are \nhoping that maybe something will turn up.\n  Now, what they have done, they have taken those five volumes, and \nmore, from the independent counsel. And I am reminded of the old bureau \nthat many newspapers had called ``Rewrite.'' That was not a bureau \nwhich did independent reporting. When an editor read something that was \nincomprehensible, he or she would say, ``Get me Rewrite.'' So what the \nHouse has done is gotten ``Rewrite'' to write up its own report. They \ncannot tell you--they can tell you what they hope --they cannot make a \nrepresentation or a proffer to you about what any witnesses would say.\n  Now, their third, and really their only argument, is the credibility \nargument--got to see these witnesses. Well, in point of fact, in the \nreal world, when you have witnesses, their stories often differ in some \nways. They differ not because anybody is lying; they differ only \nbecause people don't always have precisely the same recollection of \nthings. Now, that doesn't mean that looking at them will add anything \nother than getting for you the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th account of what \nsome witnesses said.\n\n  For example, in our trial brief, we quote--and Mr. McCollum referred \nto this--at pages 66 to 67, 11 accounts that Ms. Lewinsky has given on \nthe gift exchange. Now, I do not think you are going to learn anything \nfrom a 12th account. And by the way, with respect to the question of, \nwell, she might have testified differently after she got immunity, 9 \nout of 11 of these accounts were given, as you will see from the dates \nand the testimony, after she got immunity. Calling witnesses will add \nnothing to the record now before you. All the major witnesses have \ntestified, and their testimony is right there.\n  Now, in response to the question of how long it will take, I must \ntell you, we have never had a chance to call witnesses ourselves, to \nexamine them, to cross-examine them, to subpoena documentary evidence--\nat no point in this process. It would be malpractice for any lawyer to \ntry even a small civil case, let alone represent the President of the \nUnited States when the issue is his removal from office, without an \nadequate opportunity for discovery.\n  And I think if they are going to begin calling witnesses, and going \noutside the record, which we have right now--I think the record is \ncomplete; and we are dealing with it as best we can without having had \nan ability ourselves to subpoena people and cross-examine them and \ndepose them--but I think you are looking realistically at a process of \nmany months to have a fair discovery process.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Chafee. It is to the \nHouse managers:\n\n       The White House defense team makes a lot out of Monica \n     Lewinsky's statement that she delivered the presents to Betty \n     Currie around 2:00 or 2:30 and about the fact that the phone \n     call came from Betty Currie at 3:32. Isn't it reasonable to \n     assume that Ms. Currie meant that she delivered the presents \n     to Ms. Currie in the afternoon?\n\n  If the President was unconcerned about the presents, as he said in \nhis grand jury testimony, why didn't he simply tell Ms. Lewinsky not to \nworry about it?\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Let me just broadly review the whole gift issue and the discrepancy \nin the testimony.\n  First of all, I want to go back to Mr. Ruff's presentation during the \nlast 3 days.\n  He argued that I unfairly characterized Betty Currie as having a \nfuzzy memory whenever she was unclear. And she was clear that it was \nher memory that Monica Lewinsky called to initiate the retrieval of the \ngifts. And of course that is in conflict with the testimony of Monica \nLewinsky.\n  Further, they argue that Monica Lewinsky's time sequence as to when \nshe went to pick up the gifts, when Betty Currie went to pick up the \ngifts, destroys her credibility. Her time sequence does not fit. Let's \nlook at her testimony on this particular point. This is what Betty \nCurrie has testified to, and this is exhibit H-A in your folder on my \npresentation; exhibit A. These are statements of Betty Currie in her \ndeposition testimony about when she picked up the gifts.\n  Now the first one is her testimony on January 27, 1998. She was asked \nwhen she picked up the gifts, and she said, ``Sometime in the last 6 \nmonths;''\n  Now, in May she was asked when she picked up the gifts, and she said, \n``A couple of weeks'' [after the December 28 meeting]; in the May 6 \ntestimony, it was after the 28th meeting; and then in her last \ntestimony, July 22, in the ``fall maybe.''\n  That is Betty Currie's testimony. Contrast that to that of Monica \nLewinsky.\n  This is her recollection as to when Betty Currie came to pick up the \ngifts. You will see that she has testified in her proffer of February \n1, ``Later that afternoon''; July 27, she said Currie called ``several \nhours after leaving the White House;'' ``about 2 o'clock''; ``Later in \nthe day''; and August 6, called ``several hours'' after Lewinsky left \nthe White House. Her memory is fairly good about this.\n  The question is, the cell phone call, which really corroborates what \nMonica Lewinsky said, that it was Betty Currie who called to retrieve \nthe gifts, and said the President said, ``You have something for me,'' \nor something to that effect. That came about 3:30. The cell phone \nrecord was retrieved after Monica Lewinsky's testimony.\n  Now, does this destroy her credibility, particularly in contrast to \nthat of Betty Currie? I think it reflects that you are trying to \nremember--you remember that it was a call specifically from Betty \nCurrie to retrieve the gifts. At the time, she said it was in the \nafternoon. I think it corroborates her because she has never had an \nopportunity to look at the cell phone record--neither has Betty \nCurrie--to refresh her recollection and trigger it and see what that \nproduces.\n  Now, that is on the gift issue.\n  I think they say, well, what would it add to call witnesses? How are \nyou going to determine the truthfulness of this issue? Juries across \nthe country do it by calling witnesses.\n  Now in this particular case, it should be noted that all other \ntestimony of Betty Currie--I think her last one was about July 27 \nbefore the grand jury--all of it preceded the testimony of William \nJefferson Clinton which was in August before the grand jury. The point \nis, because of the rush, the push, the independent counsel didn't call \nanybody back to the grand jury to re-question them after the \ninformation received from William Jefferson Clinton.\n  So there are a lot of unanswered questions, perhaps, that were \ngenerated by his testimony. The 1-minute call was raised: How in the \nworld could this be expressed in 1 minute--the conversation that Betty \nCurrie called to\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\nretrieve the gifts? If you look at Monica Lewinsky's description of \nthat call--excuse me, let me read from her grand jury transcript. She \nwas asked about the call, and her answer was,\n\n       What I was reminded a little bit, jumping back to the July \n     14th incident where I was supposed to call back Betty the \n     next day, but not getting into the details with her that this \n     was along the same lines.\n\n  Question to Monica Lewinsky:\n\n       Did you feel any need to explain to her what was going to \n     happen?\n\n  Her answer:\n\n       No.\n\n  In other words, this was a cell phone call. It was a cryptic call. It \nwas about retrieving gifts that were under subpoena. It was a short \nconversation. It doesn't take a minute to say, ``The President \nindicated you had something for me''--Monica knows what she is talking \nabout--``Come over,'' and that is the end of the conversation--\ncertainly would not take 1 minute.\n  So all of the evidence is consistent with Monica's testimony.\n  But let's look at the big picture on the gifts. The evidence was \nconcealed under the bed. It was evidence that was concealed in a civil \nrights case; secondly, it was under subpoena; thirdly, the President \nknew it was under subpoena; and fourthly, Monica Lewinsky's testimony \nindicates that it was, the call from Betty Currie, at the direction of \nthe President--and I am arguing there, a little; please understand \nthat--which initiated the retrieval of the evidence that was under \nsubpoena.\n  That is the big picture on this. I believe we have made our case on \nthat, and I believe it is strong, and I think it also justified the \nhearing of the testimony to resolve the remaining conflict.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is to the President's counsel from Senators \nLeahy, Schumer, and Wyden:\n\n       Notwithstanding the previous response by the House manager, \n     does not the evidence show:\n       (a) Ms. Lewinsky's testimony; it was her idea to give the \n     gifts to Betty Currie?\n       (b) the President's testimony; that he never told Betty \n     Currie to retrieve the gifts from Ms. Lewinsky?\n       (c) Betty Currie's testimony; that it was Ms. Lewinsky, not \n     the President, who asked her to pick up the gifts? And,\n       (d) the fact that the President gave Ms. Lewinsky \n     additional gifts on the very morning that he is alleged to \n     have asked for them back?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I am not sure I managed to \ncapture all four subpoints of that question but I will do my best.\n  It is interesting that the managers now suggest that the great \ndiscovery of the 3:32 phone call that was so much the heart and soul of \nMr. Schippers' presentation and ultimately of theirs is really just a \nslight glitch in the timetable.\n  Yes, it is perfectly possible, I suppose, that Ms. Lewinsky could \nhave just missed by an hour and a half, but she did say, three times, \nonce under oath, and twice to the FBI, which is almost the same, that \nit was 2 o'clock, not 3:30.\n  So if you are going to ask, consistency, good memory, as Ms. Lewinsky \nis supposed to have on this matter, she was consistent, but you have to \nask, if it really happened at 2 o'clock as she recalled, what is the \nmeaning of the 3:32 call?\n  Putting aside that dispute, the question itself reflects the essence \nof our position on this. First of all, there are only two people \npresent at the moment in which, theoretically, the managers would have \nthat the President urged Betty Currie to go off and pick up the gifts. \nThe President of the United States and Betty Currie, they both \ntestified, flatly, that such a conversation did not occur. Do the \nmanagers really anticipate if Ms. Currie were brought into the well of \nthe Senate and looked straight in the eye by one of the prosecutors on \nthis team, she would say, ``You got me, I had it wrong. The President \nreally did tell me to do something but I have testified \nstraightforwardly and honestly''?\n  He didn't say, as my colleague Mr. Kendall indicated--that is wish \nand hope, and it has no basis in the allegation.\n  And of course the managers have thought up a good excuse for why it \nis that the President is giving Ms. Lewinsky more gifts on the very day \nwhen he is conspiring with her to hide them: That somehow it is a \ngesture, a message being sent, that because of these gifts she is \nstill--she is someone who is being roped into a conspiracy of silence.\n  Aside from the fact that there is not one single, not one single, \niota of evidence to support that wishful thinking, is it really likely, \neven given the managers' perception of this matter, that by giving Ms. \nLewinsky the bear that my brief but important colleague Senator Bumpers \nreferred to yesterday, and a pin of the New York skyline, and a couple \nof other things, including a Radio City Music Hall scarf--I may have \nmissed some--that some great message was being sent to Ms. Lewinsky, \nthat this collection of ``valuable'' items was a message to keep the \nfaith, stay inside a conspiracy? I don't think so.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, may I inquire about the time that has \nbeen used on each side?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. I will ask the Parliamentarian.\n  The counsel for the White House has consumed 57 minutes. The counsel \nfor the managers have consumed 54 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we have a question at the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers, \nproposed by Senators Snowe, Ashcroft, Enzi, Burns, Smith of New \nHampshire, and Craig:\n\n       At the end of the Jones deposition, Judge Wright admonished \n     the parties that, ``This case is subject to a protective \n     order regarding all discovery, and all parties present, \n     including the witness, are not to say anything whatsoever \n     about the questions they were asked, the substance of the \n     deposition . . . any details, and this is extremely important \n     to this court.'' Within hours of Judge Wright's admonition to \n     all parties not to discuss details of the deposition, didn't \n     the President telephone Betty Currie to ask her to make a \n     rare Sunday visit to the Oval Office?\n\n  Before answering, the Chair wishes to make a correction in response \nto the inquiry from the majority leader. The time used by the House \nmanagers is 64 minutes, rather than 54 minutes.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. I trust that doesn't mean I have to sit down, Mr. \nChief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. It is not retroactive.\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Maybe I should quit while I am ahead.\n  I thank the Senators for their question. That is absolutely true, and \nwe know that because Betty Currie testified to that. She said it was \nvery rare to receive a phone call from the President to ask her to come \ndown to the White House on Sunday. A day after the President testified \nin a deposition, when he was specifically admonished by the judge that \nhe was not to discuss the deposition, he was not to detail it with \nanybody, he was not to go into any of those factors, the President \ncalled Betty Currie down to the White House and he made some specific \nstatements to her. He said to her:\n\n       I was never really alone with Monica, right?\n       You were always there when Monica was there, right?\n       Monica came on to me and I never touched her, right?\n       She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.\n\n  When the President was asked 8 months later:\n\n       Why did you call Betty Currie down to the White House and \n     pose not questions, but statements to her?\n\n  When he was asked why he called Betty Currie down to the White House \nand said that to her, this is how the President responded:\n\n       I was trying to figure out what the facts were. I was \n     trying to remember.\n\n  That is patently false because in August when the President \ntestified, embarrassment was no longer on the table. The President was \nadmitting that he had, as he called it, an improper relationship with \nMs. Lewinsky. So why did he call Betty Currie down there? He called her \ndown there that day after the deposition, in violation of the judge's \norder, because throughout his deposition he kept referring to Betty \nCurrie as the fountain of information. If you read the deposition \ntestimony, you see the President reiterating over and over, ``Monica \ncame to see Betty,'' and, ``You would have to ask Betty.'' He made \ninnumerable references to Betty Currie.\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\n  That was his invitation to the Jones lawyers to depose Betty Currie, \nand we know from Mr. Manager Hutchinson's presentation earlier that \nthat is what happened. Betty Currie ended up with a subpoena from the \nJones lawyers, and the President could not waste any time; he had to \nmake sure, with discovery closing, that he got to Betty Currie right \naway, to make sure that the story was straight.\n  How can one possibly say that he was posing the statements to Betty \nCurrie to remember, when the President knew that in fact he was alone \nwith Monica, that Betty wasn't always there with him when Monica was in \nthe Oval Office with him? She would not be able to tell him that Monica \ncame on to him and not the other way around. This is patently \nludicrous. There is no reasonable explanation.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, if I have a minute left, I would like to yield to \nMr. Manager Hutchinson.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you. Just a quick point on that, \nbecause there was a question raised that the testimony of Betty Currie \nin that circumstance was that she, I believe, did not feel pressured. \nThe President's counsel makes a big issue of that, as if this is a \nfatal defect. It is not a fatal defect.\n  In fact, it is really irrelevant because the issue is witness \ntampering, obstruction of justice. The question is the President's \nintent, not how Betty Currie felt under that circumstance. She can \ncharacterize what she wishes. To me, it is an example like, if you as a \nlawmaker are presented a bribe of $100,000 to cast your vote in a \nparticular way, you might not be tempted in the slightest. You might \nsay, ``Go your own way.'' But it is still attempted bribery, attempted \nobstruction of justice. So that is a critical question. This is one \nelement of obstruction of justice where each element has been met. The \nproof is clear, without any question of a doubt, as well as the rest of \nit.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question to White House counsel from \nSenator Kennedy:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me start by \nactually responding briefly to the question that was asked, which is \nwhether in fact the President violated the gag order. I think it is \nimportant that we be very direct and candid on this so the record is \nclear.\n  There is no question that a gag order was issued, that it had been in \nexistence for some 3 months, and it applied to the parties and lawyers. \nIt is important, I think, to understand the purpose for which it was \nentered.\n  During the months of litigation in the Jones case, we have seen a \nveritable flood of leakage out of the deposition, all of which was \nadverse to the President. The judge made very clear that her concerns \nwere revelations to the press.\n  I think it is fair to say that even if one might argue that the \nPresident talking to his secretary on the day after a deposition was \nsomehow talking to a person that he should not after his deposition, I \nsuggest that any person covered by--certainly a party covered by a gag \norder, particularly the President of the United States, is free to \nspeak with those from whom he needs assistance in the preparation of \nhis defense. That, of course, is at least in part what the President \nhas said here.\n  But let me be very clear that, to the extent President overstepped \nhis bounds in terms of this gag order, that is a matter of concern that \nthe judge could take up, or the parties could take up. And as far as I \nknow--probably because their sense of shame would not permit it--the \nparties on the other side of the Jones case have never suggested that \nthis was a problem. Indeed, it was not a problem until we heard about \nit recently in this Chamber.\n  More specifically, with respect to the substance of Mr. Manager \nRogan's response, and Manager Hutchinson's response, my colleague, Ms. \nMills, told you what the essential human dynamic was that was going on \nwith the President, who had just gone through a deposition in which his \nworst fears were being realized--his life, in terms of his relations \nwith his family, was beginning to unravel. He could see it coming. He \ncould see the press coming at him. They were already on the Internet. \nThere was no question in his mind that his worst fears of public \ndisclosure were about to be realized.\n\n  Put yourselves in a comparably traumatic human situation and ask \nwhether you wouldn't reach out to have this kind of conversation with \nthe one person you knew who was the most familiar with the facts that \nMonica Lewinsky had, indeed, been in and out of the White House, \nexchanged gifts, and done all the other things that Betty knew about, \neven though she didn't know about the primary extent of their \nrelationship. But ask yourself also whether, in fact, under any \ncircumstances, either on the 18th of January when the first \nconversation occurred, or on the 20th of January when we believe the \nsecond conversation occurred, if there is really any reason to believe \nthat the President had somehow invited Jones lawyers to make Betty \nCurrie a witness, because, as my colleague, Ms. Mills, put it most \nsharply and most clearly, the last thing in the world the President of \nthe United States wanted to do was to invite anybody to depose or have \ntestify the one woman who knew that, indeed, there had been gifts \nexchanged, and visits, and letters. It simply doesn't make sense.\n  Lastly, let me, I suppose, just ask as the question has been put to \nyou on a couple of occasions, what is it that would come from calling \nwitnesses in the case? Ms. Currie has testified not just once, but a \nmultiple of occasions about the events, no new facts had come out, and \nthe only thing that you would hear would be a repetition of the bottom-\nline assessment. I could have said wrong when he said right and I was \nunder no pressure whatsoever.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senators Gramm of Texas and Smith of \nNew Hampshire to White House counsel:\n\n       If you said that our oath to impartial justice required us \n     to allow the President to have a handful of witnesses to \n     defend himself, don't you believe that all 100 Senators would \n     say ``yes''? How can we do impartial justice by turning \n     around and denying the House that same right?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Senators, the answer to that question, I think, is really very \nstraightforward and easy and the fog of some of the discussion which \nhas been had on the subject over the last days and weeks ought not to \nget in the way of this.\n  The House of Representatives, at least as they are described by the \nmanagers they sent to you--I don't know how to put this gently--\nviolated their constitutional responsibility in the handling of this \nmatter. They characterized themselves as nothing more than a grand \njury, nothing more than a screening device between the allegations \ntransported to them by the independent counsel, and the ultimate vote a \nmonth and 3 days ago. They felt, as they have reiterated constantly \nduring that process, that they knew everything they needed to know not \nto make the judgment; that it was, you know, worth sending on to the \nSenate for them to think about. But they knew everything they needed to \nknow, as you heard them say so eloquently and so forcefully here, to \nremove the President of the United States from office. Now they are \nsaying to you, ``Well, maybe not. There really isn't enough here to \nmake that important critical judgment.''\n  So having abandoned--not to put it too sharply--what I view and I \nthink most would view as their obligation to do the right \nconstitutional thing a month ago, they turn to us and say, ``Well, \nprotect our managers rights to just add a little bit and see if we can \nmake it, and then we will turn to you and see if you want to call \nwitnesses in response.''\n\n  Senators, I really think they should have done it right the first \ntime. And they have told you--not back then, but they have told you \nnow--that they have done it right, because otherwise they wouldn't, as \na matter of their responsibility, be able to stand in the Well of this \nSenate and urge you to remove the President of the United States. How \ncould they make that recommendation if they had any uncertainty? If \nthey didn't believe what was\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\nin those five volumes was sufficient under the day, they couldn't. They \ncouldn't.\n  Our rights are these for the President of the United States: He is \nentitled to ask you whether when the House of Representatives voted to \nimpeach him they had enough evidence to make one of the most serious \nconstitutional judgments that is entrusted to them. And it can't be \nthat because they didn't do it right then, that you and we are now \nasked to extend this process just so that maybe if they go to the right \nperson and ask the right question, or find the right document something \nwill emerge that translates those five volumes into something that \nreally is a constitutional basis for the removal of the President.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senator Feingold to the House \nmanagers.\n\n       In light of the allegations in the articles of impeachment \n     that the President is guilty of providing ``perjurious'' \n     statements to a grand jury and has ``obstructed . . . the \n     administration of justice,'' is the appropriate burden of \n     proof for these particular articles ``beyond the reasonable \n     doubt,'' as it would be in an ordinary criminal proceeding? \n     Should a Senator vote to convict the President based on his \n     allegedly committing these Federal statutory crimes if each \n     of the elements of the crimes have not been proven beyond a \n     reasonable doubt?\n\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And I would say to \nMr. Ruff I violated no oath nor the Constitution, and I think the House \nmanagers, in fact, followed the Constitution when we served the \narticles of impeachment. And I also note, for historical note as well, \nMr. Ruff, you know that in the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson, the \nHouse didn't even hold a single hearing.\n  So I just want to be very up front and fair here.\n  With regard to the question that was asked by the gentleman, the \nConstitution does not discuss the standard of proof for impeachment \ntrials. It simply states that the Senate shall have the power to try \nall impeachments. Because the Constitution is silent on the matter, it \nis appropriate to look at past practice of the Senate.\n  Historically, the Senate has never set a standard of proof for \nimpeachment trials. In the final analysis to the question, one which \nhistorically has been answered by individual Senators guided by your \nindividual conscience. Now, you will note that earlier one of the White \nHouse counsel stood up--and they like to talk to you about criminal \nstatutes and cite that it requires the proof beyond a reasonable doubt. \nThat is not so. This argument has been rejected by the Senate \nhistorically.\n  For instance, in the impeachment trial of Judge Harry Claiborne, at \nthat time the counsel for Judge Claiborne moved to designate beyond a \nreasonable doubt as the standard of proof for conviction. The Senate \noverwhelmingly rejected the motion by a vote of 17 to 75. You rejected \nthat as a standard of proof.\n  In the floor debate on the motion, the House managers emphasized that \nthe Senate has historically allowed each Member to exercise his \npersonal judgment in these cases. And during the impeachment of Judge \nHastings, Senator Rudman, in response to a question about the \nhistorical practice regarding this standard of proof that there has \nbeen no specific standard, ``You are not going to find it. It is what \nis in the mind of every Senator, and I think it is what everybody \ndecides for themselves.''\n  The criminal standard of proof again is inappropriate for impeachment \ntrials. The result of conviction in an impeachment trial is removal \nfrom office, not punishment. As the House argued in the trial of Judge \nClaiborne, the reasonable doubt standard was designed to protect \ncriminal defendants who risked forfeitures of life, liberty, and \nproperty. This standard is inappropriate here because the Constitution \nlimits the consequences of a Senate impeachment trial to removal from \noffice and disqualification from holding office in the future, \nexplicitly preserving in the Constitution the option for a subsequent \ntrial in the courts.\n  In addition, the House argued in the Claiborne trial the criminal \nstandard is inappropriate because impeachment is, by its nature, a \nproceeding where the public interest weighs more heavily than the \ninterest of the individual. Again, the criminal standard of proof, \ni.e., beyond a reasonable doubt, is inappropriate in an impeachment \ntrial and, Senators, you are to be guided by your own conscience in \nyour decision.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The President's counsel are asked by Senators \nThompson, Snowe, Enzi, Frist, Craig, DeWine, and Hatch:\n\n       Four days after the President's Paula Jones testimony, \n     wherein he testified under oath about Ms. Lewinsky, why would \n     Dick Morris conduct a poll on whether the American people \n     would forgive the President for committing perjury and \n     obstruction of justice?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. I couldn't find any volunteers. (Laughter.)\n  You know, I think the honest answer has two pieces to it. I don't \nhave a clue, and it ultimately--although I know it rings all sorts of \nbells and the use of that name conjures up all sorts of images, and \nthat is why I am sure it finds its way into this process from the \nmanagers' side. But if you look at the record, other than the value \nthat may come to the managers of making reference to that \nconversation--and I have no idea whether the conversation ever occurred \nor not--it seems to me of absolutely no relevance whatsoever because, \nas far as I am able to represent to you, and if the conversation \noccurred, there is nothing in this record that suggests that it had any \nimpact on the conduct of the President or any other person. We know \nthat he did wrong. We know that he misled the American people when he \nsaid that he had not had relations with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  I am not sure what a conversation with Mr. Morris, if it occurred, or \na poll, if it was asked for, or what the motivation behind that poll \nmeans once you come to grips with the fact that the President of the \nUnited States was deceiving his family, his child, his wife, his \ncolleagues, and the American people in that period in January.\n  Beyond that puzzlement about relevance, other than the surmise that \nthere must be some dark linkage between the poll and some legal issue \nbefore you--and I haven't seen it--I am really otherwise unable to \nanswer your question.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Lieberman asks the House managers:\n\n       The House managers argue that the President should be \n     removed from office because of the inconsistency between his \n     actions and the President's duty to faithfully execute the \n     laws. Given that any criminal act would arguably be at odds \n     with the President's duty to execute the law, is it your \n     position that the President may be impeached and removed for \n     committing any criminal act, regardless of the type of crime \n     it is? If the President were convicted of driving while \n     intoxicated, would that be grounds for removal? What if he \n     were convicted of assault?\n\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Excellent question.\n  The answer is no, I would not want my President removed for any \ncriminal wrongdoing. I would want my President removed only when there \nwas a clear case that points to the right decision for the future of \nthe country. Just remember this. Our past is America's future in terms \nof the law. I would not want my President removed for trivial offenses, \nand that is the heart of the matter here.\n  I think I know why he took a poll. I think I know very well what he \nwas up to: That his political and legal interests were so paramount in \nhis mind, the law be damned and anybody who got in his way be damned.\n  Those are strong statements, but I think they are borne out by the \nfacts in this case, and that is what I would look for. I would look for \na violation of the law that is the dark side of politics. I would look \nfor something like Richard Nixon did. Richard Nixon lost faith with the \nAmerican electoral process. He believed his enemies justified being \ncheated; that when his people broke into the other side's office, when \nconfronted with that wrongdoing, he legitimized it. He didn't trust the \nAmerican people to get it right, and he went out in shame.\n  My belief is that this President did not trust the American legal \nsystem to vindicate his interest without cheating. My belief is that \nwhen he went back to his secretary, it is not reasonable that he was \ntrying to refresh his memory and get his thoughts together. My belief \nis that he tried to set up a scenario that was going to make a young \nlady pay a price if she ever decided to cooperate with the other side. \nI believe he did not need to refresh his memory whether or not Monica \nLewinsky wanted to have sex with him\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nand he couldn't. I don't believe he was refreshing his memory when he \nasked his secretary: I never touched her, did I?\n  I believe that you should only remove a President who, in a \ncalculated fashion, puts the legal and political interests of himself \nover the good of the Nation in a selfish way, that you only should \nremove a President who, after being begged by everybody in the country, \ndon't go into a grand jury and lie, and he in fact lied. Nothing \ntrivial should remove my President. We need to try this case, ladies \nand gentlemen, because you need to know who your President is.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to note that in the response to the previous \nquestion, question probably No. 28, that it was not filed by the \nmanagers; it was filed by a group of Senators.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. With that, I would ask unanimous consent that we take \nanother brief recess of 15 minutes.\n  There being no objection, at 4:18 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n4:40 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Chief Justice, I had \nindicated that we would probably go 5 hours today, which would take us \nto approximately 6 o'clock. But I think we would certainly go for at \nleast another hour or so, perhaps not quite all the way to 6 o'clock, \nbut we will talk to each other and look for a signal from the Chief \nJustice about exactly when we would end the day's proceedings.\n  At this point, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready for the next \nquestion. I believe the previous question came from Senator Lieberman; \ntherefore, I send the next question to the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Thompson and Snowe, \nto the House managers:\n\n       Do the managers wish to respond to the answer given by the \n     President's counsel with regard to the poll taken by Dick \n     Morris?\n\n  Mr. Manager BRYANT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Just before we recessed, there was a question directed to the \nPresident's defense attorneys regarding the Dick Morris poll. One of \nthe responses to it was that it was basically irrelevant. I think it is \none of the more important things that has occurred in this case, \nbecause--and I think it is very important--because we get a look inside \nthat window that is blocked for the most part throughout these \nproceedings. We really get an eye into the minds that are working here. \nNot only does it say volumes about a person who has to take a poll and \ndecide whether or not to tell the truth, it also provides a great deal \nof information toward the actual state of mind, the actual willfulness, \nthe actual intent of the actor in this case who has had the poll taken.\n  Let me just read briefly from the referral regarding this incident. \nIt talks about how Mr. Morris tells the President that this country has \na great capacity for forgiveness and we should consider tapping into \nit. The President responds, ``Well, what about that legal thing, you \nknow, the legal thing, you know, Starr and the perjury and all?'' And \nthey go on and have a discussion and decide to take a poll that night. \nNow this is January 21.\n  And in all fairness to the President, it is not clear from the record \nthat I have that he had had a conversation with Sidney Blumenthal and \nJohn Podesta that day, before this effort--the poll was taken, and the \nresults reported that same day, late that evening--or whether the \nconversation with Mr. Podesta and Mr. Blumenthal occurred afterwards. \nThose are the ones, in essence, where he questioned what went on, and \nalso with Mr. Blumenthal fairly well attempted to discredit Ms. \nLewinsky, too. And you will see how that may or may not tie in, again, \ndepending on the chronology. But certainly all those events happened \nthe same day.\n  Mr. Morris takes the poll and reports later that day, later that \nevening, the same evening, the 21st, the results of that, and basically \nsays the voters are willing to forgive the President for adultery but \nnot for the perjury or the obstruction of justice. And then according \nto Mr. Morris, the President answers, ``Well, we['ll] just have to win, \nthen.'' And later the next day the President has a followup \nconversation with Mr. Morris, in the evening, and says that he is \nconsidering holding a press conference to blast Monica Lewinsky out of \nthe water. But Mr. Morris urges caution. He says, ``Be careful.'' \nAccording to Mr. Morris, he warned the President not to be too hard on \nMs. Lewinsky because ``there's some slight chance that she may not be \ncooperating with Starr, and we don't want to alienate her by anything \nwe're going to put out.''\n\n  That is chilling. It truly is chilling that our chief law enforcement \nofficer, the person who sends our soldiers off as Commander in Chief, \nto possibly die, the person who appoints the Federal judges, nominates \nSupreme Court Justices, appoints U.S. attorneys around the country who \ntry 50,000 cases a year, has that mentality. And it goes to the state \nof mind here. And the willfulness and the intentions, from that point \nforward, certainly are reflected in the perjury and the efforts to \ncontinue the obstruction, the pattern, the overall pattern--not just \none little incident.\n  And I urge you, Senators, as you consider this, to consider it \ncarefully. And as I said in my opening remarks, do not isolate little \nfacts here and there and take the spins. But in every--every--alleged \nact, ask yourselves the two questions--whether it is the hiding of the \ngifts, the filing of the false affidavit, letting Bob Bennett use that \nfalse affidavit while sitting still, talking to Sidney Blumenthal and \nJohn Podesta about what did not really happen, the job search--ask \nthem, every one of those, What was the result, what was the result of \nthose actions?\n  I think in every case you will see that something occurs to block the \nPaula Jones case, the discovery of evidence, the receipt of truthful \ntestimony. And ask yourselves the second question: Who benefits from \nthat? And I will guarantee you every time, in every one of those \ninstances, it is the President who benefits, who derives the effect of \nthat. And he is either the luckiest man in the world because of this \nand having people willing to commit crimes for him or he is somewhere \nin the background orchestrating this.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senators Leahy, Harkin, Dorgan, and \nReid of Nevada, to the President's counsel:\n\n       In his opening remarks to the Senate, Manager McCollum \n     stated, ``I don't know what the witnesses will say, but I \n     assume if they are consistent, they'll say the same thing \n     that's in here,'' referring to the 60,000 page record \n     currently before the Senate. I see no reason to call \n     witnesses to provide redundant testimony.\n       Could you comment on Mr. McCollum's statement and clarify \n     also the timetable which might have to be considered for \n     discovery if witnesses are called?\n\n  Mr. Counsel KENDALL. Mr. Chief Justice, I think, as I said in an \nearlier question, that the answers the witnesses would provide are \nalready contained in the five volumes of testimony. As I am sure you \nare aware, when I say five volumes, that is not really five volumes, \nbecause on many of the pages the grand jury transcript is shrunk, \ncalled a miniscript, so you get 6 pages of testimony per page. Your \neyesight may fail you before you get through. The witness testimony is \nthere. I don't think calling the witnesses again will add anything to \nthat.\n  In terms of a discovery schedule, it is hard to say, because we have \nhad no opportunity to shape the record. We don't know what we will \nneed. We would need documents. We would need testimony. One deposition \ncould lead to another. I think we are talking a matter of a few months \nto finally get through it.\n  But I think the real question is, What questions are there that have \nnot been asked? I think if you ask that question, What questions are \nthere that have not been asked, you will find there are no questions. \nIn fact, there are questions that have been asked a number of times.\n  Now, Mr. Manager Hutchinson told you that, Well, the independent \ncounsel didn't have a chance to ask questions after the President's \ntestimony. Indeed he did. You will see that Ms. Lewinsky was examined \nafter the President testified, both in the grand jury and in FBI \ninterviews. I don't\n\n[[Page S887]]\n\nthink that witness interviews or further evidentiary proceedings will \nadd in any measurable way to the record before you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers by \nSenators Hatch, Thompson, DeWine, and Warner:\n\n       The unanimous consent agreement pending before the Senate \n     permits the filing of a motion to dismiss next week. What \n     legal standard should the Senate apply, and applying that \n     standard to this case, what specific acts of Presidential \n     misconduct would a Senator deem unworthy of impeachment by \n     voting for a motion to dismiss?\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the \nPresident wants all of the protections of the criminal trial beyond a \nreasonable doubt, standard of proof, strict pleadings, but yet deny us \nthe right to call any witnesses.\n  You know, in the House we did not call witnesses and there is a \nreason. There are several reasons for that. First of all, we were \noperating under time constraints which were self-imposed but I promised \nmy colleagues to finish it before the end of the year. I didn't want it \nto drag out. We had an election intervene, we had Christmas, but we \ndid--because we had 60,000 pages of sworn testimony, transcripts, \ndepositions, grand jury testimony, and we had a lower threshold.\n  The threshold in the House was for impeachment, which is to seek a \ntrial in the Senate. We could not try the case in the House. The \nConstitution gives the Senate the exclusive right to try the case. All \nwe could do was present evidence sufficient to convince our colleagues \nthat there ought to be a trial over here in the Senate. And we did \nthat.\n  But now that we are over here--by the way, we were roundly criticized \nfor not producing any witnesses. And I might add, Mr. Kendall has said \nrepeatedly they did not have a fair discovery process; they didn't have \nany witnesses and weren't permitted to cross-examine.\n  I want to tell you, repeatedly--repeatedly--I invited the President's \nlawyers, the staff of the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee: \nAny witnesses you want, call them; give me their name and we will bring \nthem in and you can cross-examine them to your heart's content.\n  No, they never did. Finally, they brought in some professors and Mr. \nRuff testified, Mr. Craig testified. But they didn't want, in fact, any \nwitnesses. That is the last thing they wanted. They had full \nopportunity to call them, and I really, really, bristle when they say, \n``You were unfair.'' We wanted to be fair. We tried to be fair because \nwe understand you need a two-thirds vote to remove the President. We \nneeded Democratic support. So far we had none. That is OK. Let the \nprocess play itself out. But we were fair.\n  And when Mr. Kendall says they had no opportunity, he means they \ndidn't avail themselves of an abundant opportunity to call witnesses.\n  Now, a motion in lieu of a trial should provide that all inferences, \nall fact, questions, be resolved in favor of the respondent, the House \nmanagers. I don't think that is going to happen. I think by dismissing \nthe articles of impeachment before you have a complete trial, you are \nsending a terrible message to the people of the country. You are \nsaying, I guess, perjury is OK, if it is about sex; obstruction is OK, \neven though it is an effort to deny a citizen her right to a fair \ntrial. You are going to say that even when judges have been impeached \nfor perjury--and, by the way, the different standards between judges \nand the President: This country can survive with a few bad judges, a \nfew corrupt judges; we can make it; but a corrupt President, survival \nis a little tougher there. So there is a difference, and the standard \nought to be better and more sensitive for the President because the \nPresident is such an important person.\n\n  Look, the consequences of cavalier treatment of our articles of \nimpeachment, your articles of impeachment: You throw out the window the \nfact that the President's lies and stonewalling have cost millions of \ndollars that could have been obviated. The damage to sexual harassment \nlaws--you think they are not going to be damaged? They are, seriously, \nmaking it more difficult to prosecute people in the military or \nelsewhere for perjury who lie under oath. Those are serious \nconsequences.\n  I know, oh, do I know, what an annoyance we are in the bosom of this \ngreat body, but we are a constitutional annoyance, and I remind you of \nthat fact.\n  Thank you.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Durbin to counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       Can you comment on Manager Hyde's contention that the \n     President was free to call witnesses before the House, but \n     that the House did not have the time to do so, or to call any \n     witnesses?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I think it is important to \nunderstand the reality of what is going on in the House. Most of you \nknow something of it by simply the virtue of press coverage. But let me \ntell you what it was like from the perspective of the President.\n  From the very first moment when we began to speak with \nrepresentatives of the Judiciary Committee--whether senior staff or the \nchairman, who is always gracious--the one thing we said was, ``Please \ntell us what we are charged with, please.'' And we went from Mr. \nSchippers' extensive opening discussion of 15 possible violations of \nlaw to an ever-shifting body.\n  It wasn't until I was within literally a few minutes of completing my \ntestimony on December 9 that we were ever honored with anything that \nlooked like a description of the violations that the President was \ncharged with, and those came in the form of hard draft articles of \nimpeachment.\n  I think, indeed, if you will all remember back--if any of you were \nwatching that day--I was actually given a draft copy of those articles \njust as I was completing my testimony, and then they were snatched back \nbecause it was premature for the President's counsel at 4:30 in the \nafternoon on December 9 to know what the President was charged with.\n  Now, one thing you generally like to know as a litigator in any \nforum, before you start thinking about producing exculpatory evidence, \nas we were asked to do, or thinking about calling witnesses, is to sort \nof know what you have to defend against. In any forum, whether it is \ncriminal or civil or legislative, the accused generally has that right.\n  Beyond that, as you all know--indeed, as Mr. Manager Hyde has \nindicated--we were operating on a very fast track. We asked, for \nexample, when the issue arose as to whether or not the staff of the \ncommittee would take depositions, whether we would be entitled to be \npresent, because we knew that none of them was on the calendar to be \ncalled in any open hearing, and we were denied that opportunity, \ntheoretically because under the policies of the committee it was not \nappropriate for the President's counsel to be present at the only \nopportunity that certain witnesses would ever have to testify under \noath.\n  It seems odd to me, when you come right down to it, that we should be \naccused of failing in our duty, with the burden on the House Judiciary \nCommittee to make its case and our right to respond, that the House, \nhaving determined never to call a witness who knew anything firsthand, \nwe should somehow be charged with having to fit into this discovery \nprocess. Discovery is very different, as all of you understand, from \ncalling a witness--whoever it may be--in public, before the full \nJudiciary Committee, and having the opportunity to examine. We were \nexcluded from whatever true discovery process might have been \ninvolved, and left only with this notion that, in the absence of any \nspecific charges, we were to call witnesses to defend ourselves. I \nsuggest to you that in any setting that we are used to, whether those \nof you who are litigators or those of you who are simple observers of \nthe justice system, that is a very long process, indeed.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Nickles to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Which of the President's statements not already discussed \n     today do you believe to be of particular importance to the \n     perjury charge?\n\n  Mr. Manager ROGAN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I thank the Senator \nfor the question. I will keep one eye on the clock and stay within the \n5-minute rule, so obviously I won't be able to\n\n[[Page S888]]\n\ngive a comprehensive list of that which we submit to the Senate is \nperjurious. Let me try to get through at least one or two.\n  One example that I invite the Senate's attention to is the answers \nthe President gave in the grand jury about his attorney using Monica \nLewinsky's false affidavit. Bear in mind, again, the predicate facts \nfor this. Judge Susan Webber Wright, in the deposition, had ordered the \nPresident to answer questions relating to whether he ever had sexual \nrelationships with subordinate female employees in the workplace as \nGovernor or as President, because that is fair game in any sexual \nharassment suit. Victims of harassment in the workplace are entitled to \ndiscover that information.\n  The President was able to get Monica Lewinsky to file a false \naffidavit in the Jones deposition. And when that affidavit was in hand \nand filed, as soon as the attorney for Paula Jones asked the first \nquestion about Monica Lewinsky, the President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, \nput forth that affidavit and objected to the attorneys even asking the \nquestion. He said, ``There is no good-faith belief that this question \nshould be asked because of the affidavit.'' And the President did \nabsolutely nothing to correct the record.\n  When this came up in the grand jury, the President was asked about \nthe affidavit and the statement that Mr. Bennett made to Judge Wright \nthat ``there was no sex of any kind, in any manner, shape or form.'' \nAnd the attorney, Mr. Bittman, at the grand jury, referred to that and \nsaid to the President, ``That statement is a completely false \nstatement,'' and asked the President to explain. This was the \nPresident's answer:\n\n       It depends on what the meaning of the word ``is'' is. If \n     the--if he--if ``is'' means is and never has been, that is \n     not--that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a \n     completely true statement.\n\n  Then the President went on to say:\n\n       I was not paying a great deal of attention to this \n     exchange. I was focusing on my own testimony.\n\n  Now, rather than simply give a truthful and complete answer to the \ngrand jury in their criminal investigation, the President gave a \nbifurcated answer that essentially invited the grand jury to accept one \nof two explanations.\n  Explanation No. 1: I wasn't paying attention to my attorney when he \nsaid that. I was busy thinking of other things.\n  Or, if you don't like that explanation: I was paying such specific \nattention to what my attorney was saying that I focused on the tense of \nwhat the word ``is'' meant--as if to suggest when Mr. Bennett said that \nthere is no sex of any kind, he meant there was no sex that day because \nhe was there being deposed before Judge Wright. Under either scenario, \nthe President absolutely failed in his obligation to provide the grand \njury conducting a criminal investigation into possible obstruction in \nthe Paula Jones case--he failed in his obligation to tell the truth, \nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\n  You have seen the evidence just from the initial presentation. No. 1, \nwhen the President said he wasn't paying attention, that was negated by \nwatching the videotape. The President was paying very close attention. \nWhy was he paying such close attention? Because the fate of his \nPresidency hung on the answer to that question. This is the most \nimportant question in the President's political life. Is he going to \nhave to disclose information that he thought would help destroy his \nPresidency?\n  You don't even have to accept the representation from the videotape \nto know the President testified falsely, because Mr. Bennett did us the \nfavor of not asking us simply to rely on watching the President pay \nattention to the testimony. Mr. Bennett then read the President the \nportion of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit in which she denied having a sexual \nrelationship with the President, and he asked the President if Ms. \nLewinsky's statement was true and accurate. The President said, ``That \nis absolutely true.''\n  Now, on August 6, Monica Lewinsky, incidentally, testified before the \ngrand jury, and she didn't play these games with the grand jury, like \n``it all depends what `is' means,'' or ``I wasn't paying attention.'' \nShe was asked a straightforward question:\n\n       Paragraph 8 of the affidavit says, ``I have never had a \n     sexual relationship with the President.'' Is that true?\n\n  Answer by Monica Lewinsky:\n\n       No.\n\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I see my time has expired. I will be happy to \ninvite additional questions relating to additional specific examples.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is to the President's counsel from Senator \nSchumer and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska:\n\n       Isn't it true that the alleged perjurious statements have \n     changed in number and substance since the OIC first delivered \n     its referral to the House, and that the referral, Mr. \n     Schippers' presentation before the House, the majority \n     report, the trial brief, and the managers' statements before \n     this body contain different allegations of what constitutes \n     the alleged perjurious statements?\n\n  Mr. Counsel CRAIG. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The answer to that \nquestion is, yes. They were changing right up until the time we met, \nthe very first day of this trial when Mr. Manager Rogan made his \npresentation. What he said when he described perjurious statements \nalleged against the President was different from what was appearing in \nthe trial brief before. And that was the end of a long period of time \nwhere every time we heard what the allegations were, at least when it \ncame to the issue of perjury, they changed.\n  There were allegations added; there were allegations subtracted. Two \nof the allegations that Mr. Schippers presented when he made his \nstatement to the Judiciary Committee were withdrawn. So it was a \nprocess where we never had a chance to sit down, as you should in a \nvery serious and fair and evenhanded exercise, and focus on what \nprecisely it was that the President said in the grand jury that was \nperjurious.\n  Now, as to the specifics of the allegation that we have been \ndiscussing just now, when I first opened this discussion, I said it is \nvery important to look at the record. Do not allow anyone to \nmisrepresent the record because you are setting up the President's \nstatement and saying that is perjurious, when the President's statement \nmay well be something very different in the record.\n  Now, when Mr. Rogan first made his argument on this issue, he \nmisrepresented the record as to what the President said in this case. I \ntried to correct him about what the President actually said. He never \nclaimed, at the moment these questions were being asked back and forth, \nthat he thought about the current tense. Even as I was speaking, Mr. \nRogan was out talking to the television cameras, saying precisely the \nsame thing. Now we have this same misrepresentation the third time.\n  I will say it one more time. He answered the question. He wasn't \nfocusing on it. He answered that four times the same way. It was not a \nbifurcated answer; it was one answer. He was not paying attention at \nthat particular moment. It moved very quickly; the moment was passed \nand they were into the judge talking and debating with the lawyers. \nThat was his answer. There was no other answer.\n  Then, at the grand jury some 7 months later, he was read that \nstatement by the special prosecutor. The question was, ``And this \nstatement was false, isn't that true?'' The answer the President gave \nwas that, well, in fact, it depends on the meaning of the word ``is.''\n  He didn't claim that that was what he was thinking at the time in the \nJones deposition. He said very clearly, ``I never even focused on that \nissue until I read it in this transcript in preparation for this \ntestimony.'' It is on page 512, Mr. Rogan. ``I never focused on that \nissue until I read it in this transcript in preparation for this \ntestimony.'' There was not a bifurcated answer. He answered directly. \nHe wasn't focusing on it.\n  That is a problem we have had throughout this case when it comes to \nperjury the allegation. It was a problem we had with the earlier one. \nIf you don't have the specific statement quoted, it is impossible to \ndefend it. It is unfair.\n  Thank you, very much.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question from Senator Lott to the House \nmanagers:\n\n       Do you wish to respond to the answers just given by the \n     President's counsel?\n\n  Mr. Counsel ROGAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I am not sure if I wish to \nrespond or I feel the need to respond. But in either event I will take \nadvantage of the\n\n[[Page S889]]\n\nopportunity. I thank the Senator for posing the question.\n  Try as they might, the facts are clear. The President, in his August \ndeposition, attempted to justify away, attempted to explain away his \nperjurious conduct on January 17 when he was deposed. And I am not \ngoing to stand and quibble with Mr. Craig over this beyond what was \nalready noted.\n  What I prefer to respond to is the bigger question that the White \nHouse attorneys have raised on a number of occasions--the idea that the \nPresident has been treated unfairly because he hasn't had sufficient \nnotice as to what the allegations are against him.\n  Contemplate that for just one moment. Because, were that to be true, \nthe President of the United States would have to be not a human. He \nwould be an ostrich with his neck so far down in the sand--that which \nevery schoolchild now in America knows, that which every person in \nAmerica with a television or a radio or Internet access knows, and is \nobvious to everybody which they claim is not obvious to the President.\n  When the President of the United States testified at the deposition \nand before the grand jury--that brought us into late August of 1998, \nabout a month after that--the Office of Independent Counsel filed a \nreport. The binder was about 445 pages. The written document was a \nlittle more than 200 pages. But within the four corners of that report \nare all of the allegations, are all of the facts, and all of the \ncircumstances that were forwarded to the House of Representatives for \nreview. The House Judiciary Committee, specifically at the request of \nthe White House and at the request of our Democrat caucus, did not go \nbeyond the four corners of Judge Starr's report. Not only did the \nPresident have the benefit of Judge Starr's report, he also has the \nbenefit of the written report from the House Judiciary Committee--same \nfacts, same circumstances, nothing changed.\n  And, by the time we came here to the Senate to try this case, the \nPresident had the benefit of the resolution passed by this body that \nsaid at the initial presentations ``we will not go beyond the record \nalready established''--the record that was established in the Office of \nIndependent Counsel report, in the committee's report, and in our \nhearings. And for a party to be aggrieved, as the White House counsel \nsuggests, to have been given no notice, it is amazing to me how within \nminutes of Judge Starr's report being filed they had already filed a \nresponse. And I believe there were two supplemental responses within 48 \nor 72 hours. They have always beaten us to the punch on the response. \nThey have an army of lawyers here able to stand up on a moment's notice \nand respond. And I just do not understand how they can make the case \nfairly that this is all now a product of a surprise; that they have not \nbeen given a proper opportunity to review the facts. They have seen \nthese facts since Judge Starr submitted his report to Congress some 5 \nmonths ago. The facts haven't changed. The circumstances haven't \nchanged. The quotations haven't changed. The transcripts haven't \nchanged. Nothing has changed except their attempt to wiggle out from \nunder the truth.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senators Boxer, Schumer and \nKohl to the President's counsel:\n\n       To the best of your knowledge, has the United States \n     Department of Justice ever brought a perjury prosecution \n     where the alleged perjury was inferred from the direction in \n     which the defendant was looking?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, the answer is, not to my \nknowledge. I will not go farther than that because somebody in the army \nof people on the other side might dodge one up, but I doubt it very \nmuch.\n  I think, if I may impose on the kindness of the authors of that last \nquestion, I will take just a moment to comment briefly on Mr. Manager \nRogan's rejoinder to our response to whatever-- particularly because \nMr. Manager Rogan has been a judge, prosecutor, and others have as \nwell, it does seem mildly odd to me that the answer to the question \nyour charges aren't known or are vague is, look at that pile. You will \nfind them right in there. You fellows, you guys did a good job \nresponding to what you could. So you must be perfectly well prepared to \ndefend against whatever charges we bring. I don't think there is a \njudge anywhere in the United States, from the highest court or the \nlowest court, who would accept either explanation from a prosecutor.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers by \nSenators Hatch and Burns:\n\n       The President's lawyers cite in their brief Professor \n     Michael Gerhardt for the proposition that for an act to be \n     impeachable there must be a nexus between the misconduct of \n     an impeachable official and the latter's official duties. But \n     isn't it true that Professor Gerhardt also stated that \n     impeachment may lie for conduct unrelated to official duties \n     if such conduct is outrageous and harms the reputation of the \n     office?\n\n  And this citation is to the testimony of Mr. Gerhardt.\n\n       Would the House managers care to respond to this?\n\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I do \nappreciate the opportunity to respond to this point. I think this is a \nvery important point.\n  I have a great deal of respect for Professor Gerhardt. He has said a \nnumber of different things on this subject. But the point in the \nquestion is directly on point.\n  I would also like to quote something else that Professor Gerhardt has \nsaid that I made reference to without specifically naming him as the \nsource in this statement which I gave to the Senate on Saturday.\n  He said in a Law Review article, which he wrote a few years back:\n\n       There are certain statutory crimes that if committed by \n     public officials reflect such lapses of judgments with such \n     disregard for the welfare of the state, and such lack of \n     respect for the law and the office held that the occupants \n     may be impeached and removed for lacking the minimal level of \n     integrity and judgment sufficient to discharge the \n     responsibilities of office.\n\n  I believe that what Professor Gerhardt makes reference to there is \nexactly what we have before the Senate in this case. What we have \nbefore the Senate in this case is a case where the President of the \nUnited States has engaged in a course of conduct involving violations \nof the criminal law. By doing so, he has evidenced a lack of respect \nfor the law, that demonstrates a lack of the minimal level of integrity \nthat we are entitled to expect of the Chief Executive of the United \nStates, of the person who, under our system, is given the preeminent \nresponsibility to take care that the laws will be faithfully executed.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Dodd to the counsel \nfor the President:\n\n       Given the election of a President of the United States is \n     the most important and solemn political act in which we as \n     citizens engage, how much weight should the Senate give to \n     the fact that conviction and removal by the Senate of the \n     President would undo that decision?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. That question, of course, goes right to the heart \nof what the framers were thinking, and the standards that I suggest \nevery sensible analyst of this problem has arrived at, whether they \nmight be called supporters or opponents of the President. There is one \ncritical issue that everyone has to address, which is that removal and \nundoing the will of the people.\n  Mr. Manager Graham acknowledged that that's what we were all about \nhere, whether we should undo an election. But if you go back to the \nvery basic debates of the framers in 1787, and you recall both Mr. \nManager Canady and I talked about the moment in time in which it was \nsuggested by Mr. Mason that perhaps the scope of the standard for \nimpeachment could be broadened, and the response made then and clearly \nthe principle underlying everything that the framers spoke about in \n1787 was: We cure almost all our problems with an elected official \nthrough the electoral process.\n  And even if you look at what President Ford had to say 29 years ago \non the subject, which I also cited to you as he spoke about the \ndifference between judges and Presidents, he said for the Senate to \nremove--the House to impeach and the Senate to remove the President or \nVice President as opposed to a judge in midterm would require proof of \nthe most serious offenses, and we know that those most serious \noffenses, the only ones the framers contemplated as a basis for \noverturning the will of the people, were those that, as the minority \nsaid in 1974 in its report on the subject, were a danger to the state--\na danger to the state. That is all that can justify overturning the \nvoice of the people.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is from Senator Lott. It is \naddressed to the House managers:\n\n       Didn't the framers of the Constitution understand in 1787 \n     that the conviction and removal from office of a President \n     would, under the system they devised, reverse the result of a \n     national election by elevating, not a President's Vice \n     Presidential running mate, as we would do today, but the \n     person who had received the second highest number of \n     electoral votes?\n\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, the statement has been made with \nsome fervor that if the President were removed upon a finding of \nconviction of the articles or an article of impeachment, it would \nreverse a national election. I just respectfully say that is not true. \nThe election is provided for in the Constitution and so is impeachment. \nThey are processes of equal constitutional validity. And should the \nSenate remove the President, Bob Dole will not become President, Jack \nKemp will not become Vice President, but Mr. Gore will move up to be \nPresident, and the same party, the same programs, I dare say, will \ncontinue. It will not reverse an election; it will fulfill a \nconstitutional process that our Founding Fathers were wise enough to \nprovide for.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Edwards asks the House managers:\n\n       Are there any statements contained in the exhibits used \n     during the managers' presentations or omissions from those \n     exhibits that you believe, in the interest of fairness or \n     justice, should be corrected at this time? If so, please do \n     so now.\n\n  Mr. Manager BUYER. Mr. Chief Justice, with regard to our own \nexhibits?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Perhaps I should ask Senator Edwards.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, with regard to their exhibits.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, I would be happy to take \nadvantage of the 5 minutes, but I have talked to the other managers and \nwe are not aware of any corrections that need to be made on any of our \nexhibits we have offered to the Senate.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would simply ask whether or not that answer was in fact \nfully responsive to the question. I believe the question also asked \nwhether or not there were any omissions.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian advises me this is a \nnondebatable period and the inquiry is out of order, and I so rule.\n  This is from Senator Roberts. It is directed to the House managers.\n\n       Given the fact that the White House characterizes the \n     assistance that Monica Lewinsky received as ``routine,'' does \n     the record reflect that any other White House interns other \n     than Monica Lewinsky received the same level of job \n     assistance from Vernon Jordan, John Podesta, Betty Currie, \n     and then-Ambassador Richardson?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice, if I might, as far as we \nknow as House managers, in the record the only comments about assisting \nanybody else other than Monica Lewinsky, of any nature, were made in \ntestimony by Vernon Jordan. He did assist other people. But I don't \nbelieve there is anything, to the best of our knowledge and \nrecollection--of course, we have a lot of paperwork here--that he \nreferred to assisting another intern or anyone in a like position. And \ncertainly there was no indication that the kind of intensity of that \nassistance occurred in the kind of manner in which the proceedings did \nwith developing her job opportunities, that is, somebody in this direct \ninvolvement with the President, or certainly nobody with a close \nrelationship and interest on the part of the President. There certainly \nwas nothing in the record to show that, and that is, of course, central \nto this entire case as far as the job search part of this obstruction \nof justice is concerned.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I had directed that question, sir, to the White House \ncounsel. It was my intent to direct it to White House counsel. I do not \nknow what the proper procedure would be at this time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there any objection to the White House counsel \nanswering the question at this time?\n  Without objection, the White House counsel may answer.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. This may be a moment \nworth noting in the proceedings because in essence I think we are in \nagreement with Mr. Manager McCollum.\n  I would perhaps only do this, and that is, to note with some greater \nemphasis Mr. Jordan's testimony, which we will be glad to highlight if \nwe have another opportunity here, that indeed he has regularly and \nfrequently assisted young people, and not-so-young people, in finding \njobs.\n  Again, I couldn't tell you whether any of them had been an intern at \nany time. I would only note that, of course, Ms. Lewinsky was not an \nintern at the time Mr. Jordan was helping her, but rather was an \nemployee of the Pentagon.\n  But beyond that, and perhaps with somewhat greater emphasis on Mr. \nJordan's emphasis on behalf of young people in the city, I am in \nessential agreement with Manager McCollum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question from Senators Dodd and Levin to \nthe House managers:\n\n       On page 11 of House committee report accompanying H. Res. \n     611, the report states that Judge Susan Webber Wright issued \n     her order ``on the morning of December 11th.'' Will the \n     managers now acknowledge that the report was factually \n     incorrect? Yes or no?\n\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. If I look back \nat the facts of this--of course, I have explained earlier today that \nthe action on the 11th was initiated or triggered by the witness list \nthat came in on December 5, that the President knew about it at the \nlatest on December 6.\n  On the 11th, Judge Wright entered an order in that case which allowed \nthe Jones lawyers an opportunity to ask questions about the prior \nrelationships with other Federal employees or State employees.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. Chief Justice, as one of the authors of the question, a \nyes or no answer was requested and I object to the answer.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair has not tried to police the \nresponsiveness of the answers to the questions so I am going to \noverrule that objection.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. I am not trying to be evasive at all to the \nSenator, but I did want to lay the groundwork for this and also to get \nmy thoughts so that I would be as accurate as possible.\n  The order that Judge Wright entered was on December 11. I do not know \nthe precise time. I believe it was in the afternoon that it was \nentered, and it was followed by the telephone call with the \nparticipants. So I believe that it was entered in the afternoon of the \n11th, and not in the morning of the 11th.\n  And, of course, that was not in my presentation. My presentation \nreferred to the order being entered on December 11, and that the action \non the 11th, of course, was triggered by the witness list on December \n5.\n  I think that completely answers that question. If there is some \nother--I would be happy to respond to anything more specific on that \nissue.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers \nfrom Senators Domenici, Frist, McCain and Warner.\n\n       What is the historical significance and legal import of \n     taking an oath for performance in public office? What is the \n     historical significance and legal import of taking an oath to \n     tell the truth in a legal proceeding? Please discuss whether \n     oath-taking in such circumstances is a public matter.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the \ntaking of an oath is a formalization, a solemnization of truth. You \ncall upon God to witness to the truth of what you are saying. In the \nlong march of civilization, the oath has taken the place of trial by \nfire, trial by combat, trial by ordeal. It says, in the most sober way: \nYou can trust me. You can believe in me. It is verbal honesty. Our \nlegal system depends on it and our justice system depends on it. The \noath underscores our humanity. The oath is an aspect of our sacred \nhonor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is from Senator Kerry of Massachusetts to the \ncounsel for the President:\n\n       Is it fair to say that the articles and manager \n     presentations stress the Jones perjury allegations rejected \n     by the House, because they cannot credibly, on the law, \n     satisfy the\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n     elements and argue perjury in the grand jury investigation?\n\n  Mr. Manager RUFF. Mr. Chief Justice, I am a little bit troubled at \nanswering that question, not because I don't feel strongly about what \nthe answer is but I do not want to suggest in any way that the \nmotivation of the managers is less than professional and appropriate. \nBut I do think that, indeed, they know, as they think through the proof \nthat they have or that they even might ever contemplate, that the \nPresident of the United States, when he began his grand jury testimony \nby making the most painful admission a human being could ever make, and \nthereafter did his best--albeit in the face of tough and probing and \nrepetitive questioning for 4 hours--did his best to tell the truth.\n  That they had a very difficult, indeed virtually impossible, task to \npersuade any dispassionate trier of fact and law that he had \nintentionally given false testimony, and you can see that evidenced, I \nthink most clearly, if you look at some of the first allegations made \nas to what constitutes perjury--things like the use of the words ``on \ncertain occasions'' or ``occasionally'' to describe a battle over \nwhether 11 or 20 or 17 fit within that description. It does seem fair \nto say that they would not be fighting those battles in this Chamber if \nthey had any real confidence in their cause on article I, and thus they \ndo seek, for whatever tactical or other purpose, to try to bring in \nthose things which so many of their colleagues rejected out of hand in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. This question is directed to the House managers \nfrom Senators Hatch, Thompson and DeWine:\n\n       In her presentation to the Senate, Ms. Mills emphasized \n     that Ms. Lewinsky testified on ten different times about the \n     subject of gifts. Did she ever testify that the President \n     told her that she must turn over the gifts because that is \n     what the law requires?\n\n  Mr. Manager McCOLLUM. Mr. Chief Justice, in response to that question \nthe answer is no, she did not. As a matter of fact, that was and is the \ncentral point on the part of the gift question. At no time, she says, \ndid the President instruct her to turn those gifts over. I think that \nis a telling point. In fact, it is a telling point throughout the \nentire process of the scheme and all the things that happened and why \nyou have to follow, in my judgment, Senators, the issue of this whole \nprocess through the scheme that was devised at the beginning, all the \nway to the end.\n  The President was going to ultimately lie to conceal from that case, \nthat court in the Jones case, the truth of his relationship with Monica \nLewinsky and, therefore, he had to set it up for the affidavit, the \ngifts, et cetera. At no point in time, she says in her testimony, did \nhe ever ask her to come clean. Until the time the affidavit was \ndiscussed, on the night of December 17, he never suggested she tell the \ntruth there. If you remember we put that up here several times to you. \nEven though he may not have directly told her to lie, he certainly gave \nher every indication, she said, from the standpoint of the background \nthat they had had before and what he said that night about the cover \nstories.\n  And with regard to the gifts, the same thing is true. She gave him an \nopportunity on the day of December 28. Whether there are 10 statements \nor however many there might be--and they say there are 10; I trust the \njudgment of the White House counsel--there were 10 different \nstatements, the most significant of which, of course, is the grand jury \ntestimony she gave on the subject of what happened that day when she \ndiscussed the gifts with the President because that is when her \nrecollection had been best refreshed. She had been over it a lot of \ntimes. She had had much preparation for that, and I submit to you that \nbarring bringing her in, which we of course would suggest you do, and \nlet us ask her to confirm all of this again, you must assume the \nlogical thing to do is to assume the grand jury testimony, the most \nperfected testimony you have, is the most accurate and most reliable, \nand on that occasion particularly she emphasizes the fact that with \nregard to the gifts there certainly was no request by the President \nthat she reveal those gifts.\n  Now, of course he says he did. He says he did later. But that is \nabsolutely contradicted by her testimony.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Reid of Nevada sends this question for \nWhite House counsel:\n\n       Would you please comment on any of the legal or factual \n     assertions made by the managers in their response to the \n     previous question?\n\n  Ms. Counsel MILLS. There is, obviously, a conflict in the testimony \nbetween the President, who said he directed Ms. Lewinsky to turn over \nwhatever she had, and Ms. Lewinsky's statements. I would just like to \nread to you, given the House managers' reference that we must credit \nher grand jury testimony, the version of her grand jury testimony, \nwhich you all will no doubt remember it as one of the ones I read to \nyou that was never presented by the House managers, and that is on \nAugust 20, 1998, after the President had testified:\n\n       It was December 28th. I was there to get my Christmas gifts \n     from him, and we spent about 5 minutes or so, not very long, \n     talking about the case. And I said, ``Well, do you think''--\n     and at one point I said, ``Well, do you think I should?'' And \n     I don't think I said, ``Get rid of, but do you think I should \n     put away, give to Betty or someone the gifts''--and he--I \n     don't remember his response. I think it was something like \n     ``I don't know'' or hmm or there was really no response.\n\n  On that same day when she was asked that same question, if it is her \ngrand jury testimony that is to be addressed, she also said:\n\n       A Juror. Now, did you bring up Betty's name or did the \n     President bring up Betty's name?\n       The Witness. I think I brought it up. The President \n     wouldn't have brought up Betty's name because he didn't--he \n     didn't really discuss it.\n\n  All of those are in her grand jury testimony. So her grand jury \ntestimony is the testimony that states he might not have given any \nresponse. So, to the extent the House managers' theory is that ``Let me \nthink about it'' leads to obstruction of justice, her grand jury \ntestimony does not state that.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators Specter, Helms, Abraham, Ashcroft, and \nStevens direct this question to the President's counsel:\n\n       President Clinton testified before the grand jury that he \n     was merely trying to ``refresh'' his memory when he made \n     these statements to Betty Currie. How can someone ``refresh'' \n     their recollection by making statements they know are false?\n\n  Ms. Counsel MILLS. I think one of the things I tried to address in \naddressing what the President's testimony was with respect to his \nconversation with Ms. Currie was obviously he was understandably \nconcerned about the media attention that he knew was impending. And in \nparticular, as he walked through the questions, he was thinking about \nhis own thoughts and seeking, as I think I talked about, concurrence or \ninput or some type of reaction from Ms. Currie.\n  I think in making those statements, he was asking questions to see \nwhat her understanding was based on some of the questions that had been \nposed to him by the Jones lawyers, because some of them were so off \nbase. And so he was asking from Ms. Currie essentially what her \nperception was, what her thoughts were.\n  I think as you walk through each one of those questions, he was \nexpressing what his own thoughts and feelings were with regard to this \nand was seeking some concurrence or affirmation from her. I think he \nwas agitated. I think he was concerned. He knew what was going to \nhappen, and I think that is why he posed the question in the way that \nhe did.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. A question from Senator Bayh to counsel for the \nPresident:\n\n       Can you comment on the importance of ``proportionality'' to \n     the rule of law?\n\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. How much time do we have? Thank you, Senator.\n  I think proportionality, in all its many guises, is an issue that has \ngiven us some pause, going well back into the investigative phase of \nthis matter, and I think many who have watched and who have made their \nlives and careers as professional prosecutors, indeed many who have \nbeen criminal defense lawyers or just plain sensible citizens watching, \nhave asked whether the resources and the energy and the time devoted to \nthis matter and the manner in which it has been treated at every stage \nbefore it ever got to the House of Representatives does, in fact, \nreflect an appropriate assessment of the conduct being investigated and \nthe seriousness\n\n[[Page S892]]\n\nof the conduct, which is not ever to suggest that we condone perjury or \nobstruction of justice.\n  We all recognize, if those offenses have been committed, they are \nworth pursuing. But one only need look at the testimony and the \nprofessional prosecutors who testified before the Judiciary Committee \nto get a sense of what the world of professional prosecutors would do \nfaced with these kinds of allegations in this kind of setting, and that \nreally is the key: How many prosecutors would ever reach into the \nmiddle of an ongoing civil litigation and bring these kinds of charges?\n  The proportionality, obviously, has other implications and certainly \ngoes right to the heart of the role played by this body. That is, what \nis the proportional response to whatever you think of the President as \na man, whatever you think of his conduct. Even if you should conclude--\nalthough we do not believe you should--that he violated the law in some \nrespect, what is the constitutionally proportional response to your \njudgment. And there you go right back to the essence of what the \nframers were talking about, which is responding with the ultimate \nsanction only when the ultimate problem is posed to you.\n  I suggest, as I have on too many occasions, I fear, that if that is \nthe proportionality question you are asking--and all must at some point \nask that question--the answer has to be clear, that no one ever thought \nin 1787 and, I suggest to you, in the intervening 212 years that it \nwould be a proportional response to the conduct alleged here to remove \na President.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we have reached a point where \nwe can take a break. I think we have had responses to approximately 50 \nquestions today. Now we will have a chance to assess, on all sides, \nwhat additional questions might be needed to be asked tomorrow.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to develop and \nimplement a comprehensive program for fish screens and passage devices; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n      water diversion protection and fisheries enhancement program\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today \nwill help the people of the Pacific Northwest address one of the most \nimportant natural resource issues in the region: the restoration of our \nmajestic salmon runs. This bill will lend a much-needed hand to \nOregonians and other Northwesterners who have been working together to \nfind common sense solutions to preserve this precious natural resource.\n  As many people know, any effort to recover these salmon runs must be \nboth creative and comprehensive, due to the complex nature of the \nsalmon life cycle. Salmon are hatched in fresh water, migrate down \nstreams and rivers to the sea to grow and mature, and then return to \nthe streams of their birth to spawn. This complex life cycle exposes \nthe fish to many hazards which threaten their survival. If we are to \nachieve our goal of restoring salmon runs to healthy levels, we must \nidentify and address the various causes of salmon mortality.\n  One of the hazards facing salmon and other fish is the diversion of \nwater from streams and rivers to irrigate agricultural crops. Migrating \njuvenile fish, including endangered salmon and bull trout, are killed \nwhen they are diverted from rivers and streams along with water used \nfor irrigation.\n  The common-sense solution to this pervasive problem is to safely \nscreen the points of water diversion: to allow water through while \nkeeping fish out. Despite existing State and Federal programs to assist \nwith the installation of fish screens, unscreened diversions continue \nto be a significant problem for endangered fish in the Pacific \nNorthwest.\n  My home state of Oregon has identified fish mortality caused by water \ndiversions as a priority problem. One of Oregon's primary goals \nrelating to salmon restoration is to encourage the installation of fish \nscreens and passage devices for water diversions on streams and rivers. \nOregon has developed a cooperative program to assist in screening \nsmaller diversions used on family farms. However, the State cannot \nafford to provide similar assistance for larger sized diversions. \nThat's where the Federal government can help.\n  This bill gives the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers new authority to \nhelp irrigators make their water systems safer for fish. Participation \nby irrigators in the program will be voluntary and will require a \nsharing of the cost.\n  I believe this legislation will be very effective because irrigators \nfrom Oregon and the other Northwest states have told me they want to \nmake their water systems more fish-friendly, but\n\n[[Page S896]]\n\nthey need help to do so. This bill will give them the help they need \nand will greatly benefit the current efforts of local irrigation \ndistricts and watershed councils to conserve and protect our fish runs.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is cosponsored by Senator Gordon \nSmith and has support from all the Northwest irrigation groups and \nliterally dozens of Northwest and national conservation and sport \nfishing groups, including National Audubon Society, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Oregon Trout, Trout Unlimited, American Rivers, \nPacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, and Northwest \nSportfishing Industries Association.\n  Despite our best efforts to restore these salmon runs, they continue \nto decline year after year. We need a fresh approach to this problem--\none that involves the participation of the local folks who are affected \nby conservation efforts. This bill takes that approach.\n  Of course, a fish screen program alone is not the missing clue to \nsolve our salmon problem. But this program, along with others like the \nClean Water bill I introduced last session with Senator Burns are \npieces of the complete puzzle.\n  Ultimately, it will take the integrated efforts of all interests in \nour region to recover our salmon successfully. State, Tribal and local \ngovernments, local watershed councils, private landowners and the \nFederal government will all need to work together. Initiatives like \nthis fish screen bill will help forge the partnerships upon which \nsuccessful salmon recovery will be based. I urge your support for this \nlegislation, so that the people of the Pacific Northwest can continue \ntheir important work to restore this precious natural resource.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 295. A bill to amend part S of title I of the Omnibus Crime \nControl and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the use of certain \namounts for assistance to jail-based substance treatment programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              jail-based substance abuse treatment program\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation \namending the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program, known as R-\nSAT, to enable jurisdictions below the state level to realize greater \nbenefits from the program. The R-SAT program allows the Attorney \nGeneral to make grants for the establishment of treatment programs \nwithin local correctional facilities, but only a few jurisdictions have \nbeen able to take advantage of these grants.\n  The legislation I am offering today will solve this problem by \nestablishing a separate Jail-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, \nor J-SAT. Under this new program, states will be explicitly authorized \nto devote up to ten percent of the funds they receive under R-SAT to \nqualifying J-SAT programs.\n  This legislation will provide matching funds to jail-based treatment \nprograms that meet several criteria. First, the program must be at \nleast three months in length. This is the minimum amount of time for a \ntreatment program to have the desired effect. To qualify for funding, a \nprogram must also have been in existence for at least two years. This \ncriterion is intended to ensure that jurisdictions which have already \ndemonstrated a commitment to treatment programs at the local level \nreceive first priority for funding. It also ensures that scarce \ntreatment resources are allocated to programs with a demonstrable track \nrecord of success. The third criterion for programs seeking J-SAT \nfunding is that the treatment regimen must include regular drug \ntesting. This is necessary to ensure that some objective measure of the \nprogram's success is available. Grant recipients are also encouraged to \nprovide the widest range of aftercare services possible, including job \ntraining, education and self-help programs. These steps are necessary \nto leverage the resources devoted to solving the problem of substance \nabuse, and to give individuals involved in treatment the best possible \nchance for successful rehabilitation.\n  I am offering this legislation because substance abuse and problems \narising from it are putting a severe strain on the resources of local \njurisdictions throughout the nation. This is not a minor problem. The \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy indicates that approximately \nthree-fourths of prison inmates--and over half of those in jails or on \nprobation--are substance abusers, yet only a small percentage of \ninmates participate in treatment programs while they are incarcerated. \nThe time during which drug-using offenders are in custody or under \npost-release correctional supervision presents a unique opportunity to \nreduce drug use and crime through effective drug testing and treatment \nprograms.\n  Research indicates that programs like J-SAT can help to reduce the \nstrain on our communities by cutting drug use in half; by reducing \nother criminal activity like shoplifting, assault, and drug sales by up \nto 80 percent; and by reducing arrests for all crimes by up to 64 \npercent.\n  I would also note that jail-based treatment programs are cost \neffective. In 1994, the American Correctional Association estimated the \nannual cost of incarceration at $18,330. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy states that treatment while in prison and under post-\nincarceration supervision can reduce recidivism by roughly 50 percent. \nThus, for every $1,800 the government invests in treatment, it saves \nmore than $9,000. Former Assistant Health Secretary Philip Lee has \nestimated that every dollar invested in treatment can save $7 in \nsocietal and medical costs.\n  For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support the Jail-Based \nSubstance Abuse Treatment legislation I am introducing today. I also \nask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 295\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for continuation of the Federal research \ninvestment in a fiscally sustainable way, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                federal research investment act of 1999\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would elevate Congress' commitment to technological \ninnovation and long-term economic growth. The Federal Research \nInvestment Act specifically targets federally-funded, civilian research \nand development (R), while establishing greater accountability \nmechanisms for both Congress and the White House. The bill would \nbolster the aggregate amount of federal funding for R over an 11-year \nperiod. Although this legislation passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent last year, the rush to finish the 1999 federal budget kept it \nfrom reaching the floor of the House of Representatives and the \nPresident's desk.\n  Senator Rockefeller, my partner in this endeavor, and I are not \ndiscouraged. We believe that we laid a solid foundation to build on by \ngetting this legislation through the Senate last year. Now, we intend \nto persistently advocate for increased funding levels for basic R \nuntil they are realized. This legislation is the product of numerous \nhearings, caucus events, forums, and meetings with scientists and \nscholars from across the country. We have been working closely together \non this legislation and feel that now, more than ever, Congress must \nadvocate for greater R funding to preserve the future economic \nprosperity of our nation.\n  Innovation is a key element of economic growth in the United States. \nEconomists widely agree that more than 50 percent of our economic \ngrowth is directly linked to technological innovation. It is the \nprinciple driving force behind our long-term growth and our rising \nstandard of living. Technology contributes to economic growth through \nthe creation of new jobs, new goods and services, new capital and even \nnew industries.\n  The Federal Government plays a critical role in driving the \ninnovation process in the United States. The majority of the Federal \nGovernment's basic R is directed toward critical missions to serve \nthe public interest in areas including health, environmental pollution \ncontrol, space exploration,\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nand national defense. Federal funds support nearly 60 percent of the \nnation's basic research, with a similar share performed in colleges and \nuniversities. Congressional support reflects a consensus that although \nbasic research is the foundation for many innovations, the rate of \nreturn to society generated by investments in R is significantly \nlarger than the benefits that can be captured by the performing \ninstitution.\n  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) received the largest dollar \nincrease in history in the fiscal year (FY) 1999 federal budget. The \nagency received a record 14.1 percent increase in its R budget, \nnearly $2 billion. Due to steady increases every year, the NIH R \nbudget is now 28 percent larger in inflationary-adjusted terms than it \nwas in FY 1994.\n  NIH's overwhelming support by Congress reflects a growing popular \nmovement both in the Senate and House to double funding for NIH over \nthe next five years. Many of my colleagues, eager to fund the \nbiotechnology that enables our citizens to live longer, more healthy \nlives, are embracing this crusade. I believe, however, many of them are \nmissing the critical link that exists between the breakthrough advances \nwe are experiencing today and what has enabled them to occur. The \nfunding surge of R in the sciences in the 1960's created a wealth of \nresearch opportunities for scientists throughout the nation. Since that \ntime though, funding has declined steadily with no hint of a reversal \nof that downward trend. If we are to dedicate ourselves to advancement \nof biotechnology and all the benefits that it will afford, we must \nsupport it with solid funding for the basic sciences. One truly depends \nupon the other. And that critical link, I believe, has been lost in the \nrevolution of health care policy.\n  Fiscal constraints due to recent efforts to balance the federal \nbudget threaten the U.S. R infrastructure. This is due to both a \nlong-term problem of the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending of \ndiscretionary funding that must be allocated across an increasing range \nof programs. Now, for the first time in nearly three decades, the \nFederal Government has attained a budget surplus of $70 billion in \n1998. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office estimates a budget \nsurplus of approximately $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. As \nCongress debates how to allocate surplus funds, serious consideration \nmust be given to federal research and development investment.\n  As a result of the current monetary environment in Congress and the \ndesire to utilize the surplus prudently, I am confident that investing \nin basic R, and in turn the technological innovation of the future, \nis a proper use of the federal taxpayers dollars. Furthermore, the \nincreased funding called for in this legislation is coupled with a \njudicious strategy for federal investment and strong accountability \nmechanisms to help guide the Administration and Congress. Nothing less \nis acceptable.\n  Mr. President, despite its modest share of total U.S. R funding, \nthe Federal Government continues to play a vital role in the nation's \nR enterprise. With dramatic decreases in U.S. defense R spending in \nthe post Cold-War era, devoting attention to civilian basic research is \nmore critical now than ever before. This pivotal need for a resurgence \nin basic R investments is evident when we further consider our \nnation's increased dependency on technology and the global competition \nthat threatens our sustained leadership position. R drives the \ninnovation process, which in turn drives the U.S. economy. Now is not \nthe time to turn our backs on the nation's future prosperity.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator \nFrist and other distinguished colleagues in introducing the Federal \nResearch Investment Act. This legislation will set a long-term vision \nfor federal funding of research and development programs so that the \nUnited States can continue to be the world leader in high-tech \nindustries.\n  One only needs to look as far as the front page of the newspaper to \nsee the effect of high-technology on our country. New drugs are \nbecoming available for fighting cancer; new communication hardware is \nallowing more people to connect to the internet; and advances in fuel-\ncell technology are leading to low-emission, high-efficiency \nalternative fuel vehicles. In fact, seventy percent of all patent \napplications cite non-profit or federally-funded research as a core \ncomponent to the innovation being patented. People are living longer, \nwith a higher quality of life, in a better economy due to processes, \nprocedures, and equipment which are based on federally-funded research.\n  What I am afraid of is that many people are not aware that these \nproducts do not simply appear out of nowhere. They are the result of a \nbasis of knowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by \nfederal funding. American companies pull from this knowledge base in \norder to develop the latest high-tech products which you and I read \nabout in the paper and see on our store shelves every day.\n  I view this knowledge base as a bank. The U.S. government puts in \nmodest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific \nresearch. The payback comes from the economic growth which is produced \nas this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies.\n  In fact, a large part of the current rosy economic situation is due \nto our dominant high-tech industries. High-tech companies are currently \nresponsible for one-third of our economic output and half of our \neconomic growth. However, if we are to continue at this pace, we need \nto support the fundamental, pre-competitive research critical to these \nindustries, at the necessary levels, and in a stable manner from year \nto year, and we need to do so now.\n  In the last session of the 105th Congress Senators Frist, Bingaman, \nDomenici, Gramm, Breaux, Burns, and I introduced S. 2217, the Federal \nResearch Investment Act, and previous to that Senators Domenici and \nBingaman, introduced S. 1305, the National Research Investment Act. \nBoth S. 1305 and S. 2217 have been extremely successful in galvanizing \nmembers of the scientific and engineering community to pull together \nand work constructively towards a common ideal. In addition, it has \nbrought together the co-sponsors of these bills and moved them forward \nas a group with their original idea. S. 2217 passed without dissent in \nthe Senate at the end of last session, and gained 36 co-sponsors--18 \nDemocrats and 18 Republicans. Our aim, in re-introducing the Federal \nResearch Investment Act, is to now take the next step in this process, \nbringing to fruition the goals of our bill.\n  The Federal Research Investment Act is a long-term vision for federal \nR funding. It creates legislative language which stresses the \nimportance of R funding to the strength of our nation's innovation \ninfrastructure. It also sets out guidelines for Congress to use in \nprioritizing funding decisions.\n  Just three years ago, federal science funding was in a serious \ndecline and fewer than half a dozen members of Congress gave it any \nattention, but now as a significant consequence of both S. 1305 and S. \n2217 the trend, at least in the last two years, seems to have reversed \nand a universal spirit of cooperation for strong R funding is \ndeveloping on all fronts. In the last two years the science budget has \nincreased above inflation. In particular, for Fiscal Year 1999, an \nunprecedented 10% increase in civilian R funding was appropriated. \nYet, we appear to be in a crisis situation once again due to unexpected \nbudgetary constraints resulting from last year's appropriations. Thus, \nwe need to continue our fight to implement the R budgetary guidelines \nin our bill. This uncertainty in the level of R funding from year to \nyear can be as detrimental to the health of the scientific enterprise \nas a lack of adequate funding levels. It will be a sad day for our \nnation, and its future economic prosperity, if we manage to lose what \nprogress we have made to date.\n  Based on a careful review and analysis of our past history, our bill \nauthorizes an annual funding increase of 5.5%, starting in the year \n2000 and going through 2010, for federally-funded, civilian, R \nprograms. This would increase federal R spending to 2.6% of total, \noverall budget by 2010, a near doubling in R funding from 1998 \nlevels. In order to make sure that these increases are fully \nincorporated into budgetary process we request that the President \ninclude these increases in his annual budget request to Congress.\n  We are currently in an economic upturn. This continues to be a \nperfect\n\n[[Page S899]]\n\ntime to increase funding for R so that we can continue this growth. I \nhave faith that, as long as the economic situation allows it, my \nthoughtful and wise colleagues will support increasing R funding to \nthe levels that we have laid out in this bill. However, I am also a \nrealist. I realize that the economy may not always remain as strong as \nit is right now. That is why we have introduced a funding firewall. \nWithout this firewall I am seriously concerned that history will repeat \nitself. In the past, R funding is one of the first things that has \nbeen cut during times of crisis. This is the wrong approach. I believe \nthat cutting R funding levels below a bare minimum level causes \nserious, long-term harm to the R infrastructure in the United States. \nOur firewall would not allow this to happen. It is not meant as a goal, \nit is meant as a bare minimum which should only be implemented in the \nleanest of years.\n  Many, if not most, recent `quantum leaps' in knowledge have occurred \nat the interface between traditional disciplines of research. \nTherefore, we legislatively mandate that this funding increase must be \nmacroscopically balanced, so that there is not preferential growth of \none agency, program or field of study at the expense of other, equally \nqualified and deserving agencies. One of the original reasons that I \nstarted to get involved with technology issues such as EPSCoR and \nEPSCoT, was because I believe that technology should be shared by \neveryone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in \nBoston. Therefore, this bill should not be seen as a means of promoting \nelitist science but as a mechanism for allowing for diversity in our \nnational innovation infrastructure.\n  Finally, so that we are able to assure other Members of Congress and \nthe general public that this money authorized by this Act would be well \nspent, we have included accountability measures which will assure that \nthere is no waste of federal money on out-dated, or ill-conceived \nprojects. This bill puts into place a system of accountability for each \naffected agency. Our bill institutes a study by the National Academy of \nSciences to determine how to effectively measure the progress of R \nbased agencies and then have them institute performance measures based \non these metrics. This will allow increases in funding without concerns \nover wasteful spending being generated.\n  In conclusion, with the help of Senators Gramm, Lieberman, Domenici, \nand Bingaman, Senator Frist and I have put together a long-term vision \nfor federal R funding which we hope will instigate real increases in \nfederal funding for research and development. Federally-funded research \nhas been, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic \nsuccess. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic \nprosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at \nadequate levels in a consistent long-term manner. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I'm pleased to see the Federal \nResearch Investment Act introduced in the 106th Congress. This bill is \none that I've supported throughout its history, because it addresses \nthe health of our nation's science and technology base.\n  Our science and technology base is vital to the nation's future. Any \nnumber of studies have confirmed its importance. As one excellent \nexample, the National Innovation Summit, organized by MIT last March \nwith the Council on Competitiveness, confirmed that the integrity of \nthat base is one of the cornerstones to our future economic prosperity. \nAt that Summit, many of the nation's top CEOs emphasized that the \nnation's climate for innovation is a major determinant of our ability \nto maintain and advance our high standard of living and strong economy.\n  Advanced technologies are responsible for driving half of our \neconomic growth since World War II, and that growth has developed our \neconomy into the envy of the world. We need to continually refresh our \nstock of new products and processes that enable good jobs for our \ncitizens in the face of increasing global challenges to all our \nprincipal industries.\n  This bill emphasizes a broad range of research targets, from \nfundamental and frontier exploration, through pre-competitive \nengineering research. This emphasis on a spectrum of research maturity \nis absolutely critical. The nation is not well served by a focus on so-\ncalled ``basic'' research that can open new fields, but then leave \nthose fields without resources to develop new ideas to a pre-\ncompetitive stage applicable to future commercial products and \nprocesses.\n  The new bill addresses a spectrum of research fields with its \nemphasis on expanding S funding in many agencies. We need technical \nadvances in many fields simultaneously. In more and more cases, the \nbest new ideas are not flowing from explorations in a single narrow \nfield, but instead are coming from inter-disciplinary studies that \nbring experts from diverse fields together for fruitful collaboration. \nThis is especially evident in medical and health fields, where \ncombinations of medical science with many other specialities are \ncritical to the latest health care advances.\n  This new bill has additional features that were critical components \nof last year's S. 2217. It proposes to utilize the National Academy of \nScience in developing approaches to evaluation of program and project \nperformance. This should lead to better understanding of how Government \nPerformance Results Act goals and scientific programs can be best \ncoordinated. The new role for the National Academy can help define \ncriteria to guide decisions on continued and future funding. The bill \nalso sets up procedures to use these evaluations to terminate federal \nprograms that are not performing at acceptable levels.\n  The new bill incorporates a set of well-developed principles for \nfederal funding of science and technology. These principles were \ndeveloped by our Senate Science and Technology Caucus. Those \nprinciples, when carefully applied, can lead to better choices among \nthe many opportunities for federal S funding. The new bill also \nincorporates recommendations for independent merit-based review of \nfederal S programs, which should further strengthen them.\n  Many aspects of the Federal Research Investment Act support and \ncompliment key points in the study released by Representative Vern \nEhlers last year. His study, ``Unlocking our Future,'' will serve as an \nimportant focal point for continuing discussions on the critical goal \nof strengthening our nation's science and technology base.\n  This Federal Research Investment Act continues the goals expressed in \nS. 1305 last year. That was followed by S. 2217 that proposed a more \nrealistic time scale for achieving this expanded support, added GPRA \nperformance goals, and included language that recognized the importance \nof the budgets caps. This new bill is very similar to S. 2217.\n  The new Federal Research Investment Act builds and improves on the \ngoals of the previous bills. With this act, we will build stronger \nfederal Science and Technology programs that will underpin our nation's \nability to compete effectively in the global marketplace of the 21st \ncentury.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 297. A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to authorize \nmembers of the uniformed services to participate in the Thrift Savings \nPlan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN (TSP) LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to increase the retirement benefits for military personnel \nby allowing them to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).\n  Many of us are concerned about the current state of readiness in our \nmilitary forces, and rightly so. In the last decade, the number of \nAmericans wearing their nation's uniform has decreased precipitously \nalong with the funding that pays for their weapons, aircraft, ships, \nwages, housing, and benefits. Tragically, as the defense budget \nwithers, our military's operational tempo soars. Overseas deployments \nhave steadily increased in number, scope, and duration. Our troops are \nworking harder than ever and yet, we have failed to support them. In \naddition to inadequately funding much needed weapons modernization, we \nhave kept their wages low and slowly eroded their benefits. As we make \nit less and less attractive to serve, we\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nwill not be able to recruit high quality people and those that now \nserve will continue to leave. Recruiting and retention are the backbone \nof our military services. Without either there is no readiness. Our \nservice men and women are being stretched to the breaking point, and \nthey are voting with their feet. We must act now.\n  Senior Pentagon officials have determined that retirement benefits \nare a key consideration in the decision to pursue a military career and \ntherefore are critical to the retention of our best people. Because of \nreduced retirement benefits--commonly referred to as ``Redux''--an \nincreasing number of mid-career personnel are deciding to leave the \nmilitary. In recent testimony to the Senate, General Henry Shelton, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that ``that is why, among \na number of pressing needs, reforming military retirement and military \npay remains the Joint Chiefs' highest priority.''\n  The bill I am introducing today is simple and straightforward. It \nshores up the military retirement system by allowing military personnel \nto supplement direct benefits through participation in the Thrift \nSaving Plan (TSP). This legislation will provide ALL military personnel \na retirement benefit that is available to federal employees and all of \nus in the Senate and our staffs. Furthermore, the inherent flexibility \nof TSP will give military personnel and their families greater control \nover their retirement benefits. For these reasons, this legislation is \na priority for the leadership in the Senate.\n  Specifically, my bill will allow members of the armed services to \ncontribute up to 5 percent of basic pay in a tax-deferred individual \naccount where the funds are held in trust and invested and can later be \nwithdrawn at retirement. As an additional incentive for a military \ncareer, personnel will be qualified to contribute up to 10 percent of \ntheir basic pay after 10 years of service. As is the case with the \nFederal Employee Retirement System (FERS), the government would provide \nup to 5 percent to match the individual's contribution.\n  So often we marvel over our high-tech weapons systems and we forget \nthat they are useless without highly skilled and professional Americans \nto operate them. If the services continue to hemorrhage qualified \npeople at current rates, there will be a reckoning the magnitude of \nwhich we are not prepared to endure. We must take action now to slow \nthe exodus of qualified personnel from the military. I believe that \nthis bill will be a powerful tool to assist the services in retaining \npersonnel, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \nU.S.C. 431 et seq.) to clarify that donations of hard and soft money by \nforeign nationals are prohibited; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n             prohibition of donations by foreign nationals\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nlegislation that I am introducing which is intended to prevent foreign \nnationals from making financial contributions to federal elections.\n  Last October, in the trial of Charlie Trie, Judge Paul L. Friedman \nruled that the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) does not prohibit \nforeigners from making campaign donations to political parties or \nCongressional Campaign Committees. The holding of this case is based on \nan extremely narrow reading of the language of the FECA. Judge Friedman \nruled that because the FECA specifically prohibits foreign nationals \nfrom making direct contributions to the campaigns of candidates for \nfederal office but does not specifically prohibit donations, or ``soft \nmoney'' expenditures to the parties, such donations are not prohibited \nby the FECA. While we can argue the merits of this decision and \nquestion whether it merely tracks the letter rather than the entire \nspirit of the FECA, it is quite clear that this ruling opens up our \nsystem of federal elections to the possibility of foreign influence.\n  My bill clarifies the law by amending the FECA to prohibit donations \nby foreign nationals to ``a national committee of a political party or \na Senatorial or Congressional Campaign Committee of a national \npolitical party for any purpose.'' This new provision along with the \nexisting prohibition of direct contributions by foreign nationals, will \nprovide the Federal Election Commission with the ability to prosecute \nthose who illegally attempt to influence federal elections. Ultimately, \nmy bill will get us closer to achieving the desired effect originally \ncontemplated by the FECA--ensuring that federal campaigns are free of \nforeign money.\n  Mr. President, regardless of any member's views concerning the \ndirection that campaign finance reform should take, I believe that \namending the FECA to prohibit foreign influence in federal campaigns \nrequires swift action.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 299. A bill to elevate the position of Director of the Indian \nHealth Service within the Department of Health and Human Services to \nAssistant Secretary for Indian Health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\n           assistant secretary for indian health act of 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will establish the Director of the Indian Health Service within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services as an Assistant Secretary \nfor Indian Health. My colleagues, Senators Inouye and Conrad, are \njoining me in this effort as original co-sponsors. I am pleased to note \nthat Congressman Nethercutt from Washington introduced companion \nlegislation on the House side.\n  Last year, we came very close to successful passage of this same \nbill, but the legislative clock expired. It is our hope that we can \nmove this legislation forward expeditiously this year as this bill \nenjoys widespread support from Indian tribes nationwide and the \nAdministration.\n  The history of this legislation spans back several years. Every year, \nthe Congress deliberates on how best to raise the standard of health \ncare for all Americans. Yet, in nearly every debate, the health care \nneeds of Indian people are either marginalized or ignored. The need for \nthis legislation arose out of the continuing frustration expressed by \nthe tribes that their health concerns were not adequately addressed \nunder the existing administrative policy and budgetary processes.\n  As the primary health care delivery system, the Indian Health Service \nis the principal advocate for Indian health care needs, both on the \nreservation level and for urban populations. More than 1.3 million \nIndian people are served every year by the IHS. At its current \ncapacity, the IHS estimates that it can only meet 62 percent of tribal \nhealth care needs. The IHS will continue to be challenged by a growing \nIndian population as well as an increasing disparity between the health \nstatus of Indian people as compared to other Americans. Thousands of \nIndian people continue to suffer from the worst imaginable health care \nconditions in Indian country--from diabetes to cancer to infant \nmortality. In nearly every category, the health status of Native \nAmericans falls far below the national standard.\n  The purpose of this bill can be simplified to three primary needs. \nIndian people desire a stronger leadership and policy role within the \nprimary health care agency, the Department of Health and Human \nServices. The Assistant Secretary for Indian Health will ensure that \ncritical policy and budgetary decisions will be made with the full \ninvolvement and consultation of not only the Indian Health Service, but \nalso the direct involvement of the Tribal governments.\n  Second, the enactment of this legislation is consistent with the \nunique government-to-government relationship between federally \nrecognized Indian tribes and the federal government. This legislation \nis long overdue in bringing focus and national attention to the health \ncare status of Indian people and fulfilling the federal trust \nresponsibility toward Indian tribes.\n  Finally, passage of this legislation is critical as the Congress is \nset to deliberate several pieces of Indian health policy. \nReauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and \ndevelopment of legislation to permanently extend tribal self-governance \nauthority to tribes will be vital components of Indian health care in \nthe future. Implementation of this bill is intended to support the \nlong-standing policies of Indian self-determination and tribal self-\ngovernance and assist Indian tribes who are making positive strides in \nproviding direct health care to their own communities.\n  At this critical time, the IHS is in dire need of a senior policy \nofficial who is knowledgeable about the programs administered by the \nIHS and who can provide the leadership for the health care needs of \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. We continue to pursue passage of \nthis legislation as many believe that the priority of Indian health \nissues within the Department should be raised to the highest levels \nwithin our federal government.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure prompt passage of this legislation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text and section-by-section analysis of this bill \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve access and choice of patients to quality, \naffordable health care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                   Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate \nRepublican Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. Joining me in this effort are \n49 of my colleagues who recognize the importance of ensuring that all \nAmericans are able to not only receive the care they have been \npromised, but also the highest quality of care available. The \nfoundation of this proposal is to address some of the very real \nconcerns that patients have about their health care needs and to \nprovide significant opportunities for all consumers in choosing their \ndoctors and health plans.\n  We know that many Americans have believed they were denied coverage \nthat their plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some \nindividuals fear that their health care plans will not give them access \nto specialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think \ntheir health care plans care more about cost than they do about \nquality.\n  Last January, the Majority Leader asked me to put together a group of \ncolleagues to address the issue of health care quality. For over eight \nmonths, Senators Frist, Collins, Hagel, Roth, Jeffords, Coats, \nSantorum, and Gramm worked tirelessly to put together a responsible, \ncredible package that would preserve what is best about our nation's \nhealth care while at the same time determine ways to improve upon--\nwithout stifling--the quality of care our nation delivers. We set out \nto rationally examine the issues and develop reasonable solutions \nwithout injuring patient access to affordable, high quality care.\n  This was no easy task. We spent month after month talking to experts \nwho understand the difficulty and complexity of our system. We met with \nrepresentatives from all aspects of the industry including the Mayo \nClinic, the Henry Ford Health Systems, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Hospital Association, the National Committee \nfor Quality Assurance, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of \nHealthcare Organizations, Corporate Medical Directors, Commissioners \nfrom the President's Quality Commission, Purchasers, Families USA, the \nEmployee Benefit Research Institute, and many others.\n  After many, many months of dissecting serious questions about our \nsystem, we determined that there were indeed some areas in which we \ncould improve patient access and quality.\n  Together, we have written an innovative plan that will answer the \nproblems that exist in the industry, while at the same time preserving \naffordability, which is of utmost importance. After all, Mr. President, \nI think you agree that if someone loses their health insurance because \na politician playing doctor drives prices to an unaffordable level, you \nhave hardly given them more rights or better quality health care.\n  We are proud of what we have been able to accomplish. For the first \ntime, patients can choose to be unencum- bered in their relationship \nwith their doctor. They will be able to choose their own doctor and get \nthe middle man out of the way. There will be no corporate bureaucrat, \nno government bureaucrat and no lawyer standing between a patient and \ntheir doctor. In addition our legislation does what no other bill has \ndone. It provides the patient with more choice in their health plans.\n  Mr. President the bill we introduce today:\n  Protects consumers in employer-sponsored plans that are exempt from \nstate regulation. People enrolled in such plans will have the right to:\n  Choose their doctors. Our bill contains both ``point-of-service'' and \n``continuity of care'' requirements that will enhance consumer choice.\n  See their ob-gyns and pediatricians without referral. Guarantees \nparents and families peace of mind by giving patients direct access to \npediatricians and ob-gyns without prior referral from a ``gatekeeper.''\n  Have a ``prudent layperson'' standard applied to their claims for \nemergency care. Our bill will require health plans to cover--without \nprior authorization--emergency care that a ``prudent layperson'' would \nconsider medically necessary.\n  Communicate openly with their doctors without ``gag'' clauses.\n  Holds health plans accountable for their decisions.\n  Extends to enrollees in ERISA health plans and their doctors the \nright to appeal adverse coverage decisions to a physician who was not \ninvolved in the initial coverage determination.\n  Allows enrollees to appeal adverse coverage determinations to \nindependent medical experts who have no affiliation with the health \nplan. Determinations by these experts will be binding on the health \nplan.\n  Requires health plans to disclose to enrollees consumer information, \nincluding what's covered, what's not, how much they'll have to pay in \ndeductibles and coinsurance, and how to appeal adverse coverage \ndecisions to independent medical experts.\n  Guarantees consumers access to their medical records.\n  Requires health care providers, health plans, employers, health and \nlife insurers, and schools and universities to permit an individual to \ninspect, copy and amend his or her own medical information.\n  Requires health care providers, health plans, health oversight \nagencies, public health authorities, employers, health and life \ninsurers, health researchers, law enforcement officials, and schools \nand universities to establish appropriate safeguards to protect the \nconfidentiality, security, accuracy and integrity of protected health \ninformation and notify enrollees of these safeguards.\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\n  Protects patients from genetic discrimination in health insurance. \nProhibits health plans from collecting or using predictive genetic \ninformation about a patient to deny health insurance coverage or set \npremium rates.\n  Promotes quality improvement by supporting research to give patients \nand physicians better information regarding quality.\n  Establishes the Agency for Health- care Quality Research (AHQR), \nwhose purpose is to foster overall improvement in healthcare quality \nand bridge the gap between what we know and what we do in healthcare \ntoday. The Agency is built on the platform of the current Agency for \nHealth Care Policy and Research, but is refocused and enhanced to \nbecome the hub and driving force of federal efforts to improve the \nquality of healthcare in all practice environments--not just managed \ncare.\n  The role of the Agency is not to mandate a national definition of \nquality, but to support the science necessary to provide information to \npatients regarding the quality of the care they receive, to allow \nphysicians to compare their quality outcomes with their peers, and to \nenable employers and individuals to be prudent purchasers based on \nquality.\n  Makes health insurance more accessible and affordable by:\n  Allowing self-employed people to deduct the full amount of their \nhealth care premiums.\n  Making medical savings accounts available to everyone.\n  Reforming flexibility spending accounts to let consumers save for \nfuture health care costs.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a comprehensive bill of rights that will \nbenefit all Americans, and I am proud to join with so many of my \ncolleagues in introducing it. This legislation is built around several \nbasic principles which distinguishes it from other proposals.\n  First and foremost, it recognizes that regulation adds costs and not \nvalue. The legislation places a priority on ensuring that we will not \nincrease the number of uninsured or make health care unaffordable \nthrough excessive regulation.\n  Second, our legislation rightly places patients ahead of trial \nlawyers. The inclusion of a strong, internal and external appeals \nprovision holds HMOs accountable, while guaranteeing that patients get \nthe care they need when they need it.\n  Third, our legislation protects the historic and traditional role of \nstates to regulate private health insurance. States are best equipped \nto determine the needs of their citizens. Our legislation ensures that \nthe Federal Government and HCFA will not be empowered to expand their \nreach into the private market. The creation of new federal \nbureaucracies will only serve to stagnate and destroy what is best \nabout our health care system.\n  Finally, our legislation places a high priority on choice. Unlike \nevery other proposal our bill will give every American the right to \nfire their HMO. Every patient will have their choice of doctor and \nhealth plan.\n  Our bill empowers an independent medical expert to order an insurance \ncompany to pay for medically necessary care so that patients suffer no \nharm. Theirs allows professional trial lawyers to sue health plans \nafter harm is done.\n  Mr. President, when my insurance company tells me that they won't \ncover a service for my family, I want the ability to appeal that \ndecision to a doctor who doesn't work for my insurance company. And I \nwant that appeal handled promptly, so that my family receives the \nbenefit. That is what our bill requires.\n  Other bills create new ways for trial lawyers to make money. \nAccording to a June 1998 study by Multinational Business Services, the \nDemocrats' bill would create 56 new Federal causes of action--56 new \nreasons to sue people in Federal court.\n  That's fine for trial lawyers, but it doesn't do much for patients. \nPatients want their claim disputes handled promptly and fairly. \nAccording to a study by the General Accounting Office, it takes an \naverage 25 months--more than two years--to resolve a malpractice suit. \nOne case that the GAO studied took 11 years to resolve! I'm sure the \nlawyers who handled that case did quite well for themselves. But what \nabout the patient?\n  Under our bill, patients can appeal directly to an outside medical \nexpert for a prompt review of their claim--without having to incur any \nlegal expenses. In medical malpractice litigation, patients receive an \naverage of only 43 cents of every dollar awarded. The rest goes to \nlawyers and court fees.\n  Our bill assures that health care dollars are used to serve patients. \nIt does not divert dollars away from patients and into the pockets of \ntrial lawyers.\n  Mr. President, another big difference between our bill and others \nproposed is that their bill takes a ``big government'' approach to \nhealth reform.\n  Our bill relies on State Insurance Commissioners to protect those \nAmericans who are enrolled in state-regulated plans. We protect the \nunprotected by providing new federal safeguards to the 48 million \nAmericans who are enrolled in plans that the states are not permitted \nto regulate.\n  Another problem: Some bills impose a risky and complicated scheme \nthat relies on federal bureaucrats at the Health Care Financing \nAdministration (HCFA) to enforce patients' rights in states that do not \nconform to the federal mandates in their bill.\n  HCFA is the agency that oversees the federal Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms. Last year, in the Balanced Budget Act, Congress created new \nconsumer protections for Medicare beneficiaries--a ``Patients' Bill of \nRights'' for the 38.5 million senior citizens and disabled Americans \nwho rely on Medicare for their health care.\n  We asked HCFA to protect those rights. How have they done? I regret \nto say, Mr. President, that they have not done very well at all.\n  On July 16, 1998, a GAO witness testified before the Ways and Means \nCommittee on how well HCFA was doing in implementing the Balanced \nBudget Act and enforcing the Medicare patients' bill of rights. \nAccording to GAO, HCFA has ``missed 25 percent of the implementation \ndeadlines, including the quality-of-care medical review process for \nskilled nursing facilities. It is clear that HCFA will continue to miss \nimplementation deadlines as it attempts to balance the resource demands \ngenerated by the Balanced Budget Act with other competing objectives.''\n  Mr. President, I won't detail all of the ways that HCFA has failed--\nthe fact that it is delaying implementation of a prostate screening \nprogram to which Medicare beneficiaries are entitled, the fact that it \nhas failed to establish a quality-of-care medical review process for \nskilled nursing facilities, the fact that it is far behind schedule in \ndeveloping a new payment system for home health services. The list goes \non and on.\n  But let me focus on one failure that is especially relevant. All of \nus agree that people have the right to information about their health \nplans. When they have the choice of more than one plan, accurate \ninformation that compares the plans is critical.\n  Last year, Congress allocated $95 million to HCFA to develop an \ninformation and education program for Medicare beneficiaries. This \nmoney was to be used for publishing and mailing handbooks containing \ncomparative plan information to seniors, establishing a tool-free \nnumber and Internet website, and sponsoring health information fairs.\n  Well, there haven't been any information fairs and the toll-free \nnumber isn't operational. They do have a website, but they've decided \nto mail comparative information handbooks only to seniors in 5 states: \nWashington, Oregon, Ohio, Florida and Arizona. So for the pricey sum of \n$95 million, only about 5.5 million seniors will receive important \ninformation about their health plans, leaving 32.5 million seniors \nwithout these handbooks. At that rate, HCFA would need more than $1 \nbillion each year just for handbooks.\n  Mr. President, if this agency is struggling to protect the rights of \n38.5 million Medicare beneficiaries, how can we ask it to protect the \nrights of up to as many as 100 million people enrolled in private \nhealth plans?\n  We believe that consumer protections are too important to entrust to \na cumbersome and inefficient federal government. State governments have \nlong been in the business of insurance regulation and the federal \ngovernment should not usurp their role.\n  One just has to look at HCFAs record on the Health Insurance and \nPortability and Accountability Act\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n(HIPAA). This Act gave HCFA enforcement authority in states that do not \nmeet federal health standards. But how has HCFA done in the enforcement \nof HIPAA? A GAO report analyzing HCFA's success states that HCFA has \ndone very little in this area. HCFA's activities, to date, have been \n``limited primarily to responding to consumer queries and complaints \nand providing guidance'' to carriers in 4 of the 5 states that are not \nin compliance.\n  The GAO report goes on to say that even HCFA admits ``the agency has \nthus far pursued a ``Band Aid'' or minimalist approach to regulating \nHIPAA. The failure to fully address this regulatory responsibility is \ndue to the fact that HCFA lacks the ``appropriate experience'' in the \nregulating of the private health insurance market.\n  The federal government should protect those who are enrolled in plans \nthat are exempt from state regulation and those enrolled in the \nprograms it runs, like Medicare and Medicaid. The federal government \nshould start protecting the rights of senior citizens under Medicare, \ninstead of meddling in areas where it doesn't belong.\n  Mr. President, our bill is a truly comprehensive bill of rights for \npatients, providing new consumer protections for the 48 million \nAmericans who are unprotected by state law, giving the 124 million \nAmericans enrolled in employer-sponsored plans new rights to appeal \nadverse coverage decisions, protecting the civil rights of consumers to \ngain access to their medical records, protecting consumers against \ndiscrimination based on genetic tests, promoting quality improvement, \nestablishing a new women's health initiative, and giving millions of \nAmericans access to affordable health insurance through medical savings \naccounts.\n  The doctor-patient relationship is one of the most important in \npeople's lives. Our legislation preserves and protects that \nrelationship, while taking many common-sense steps forward to affirm \nand expand quality and access.\n  I look forward to a deliberative, thoughtful process this year on \nexamining the complex issues addressed in our Patients Bill of Rights \nPLUS. Last year, the debate surrounding this legislation was extremely \npoliticized and resulted in a partisan standoff. That was unfortunate.\n  I am hopeful that the Committees will work this year to examine these \nissues completely and substantively. Health care costs are rising \neveryday, Mr. President. We must balance the need to protect patients \nwith the need to make health care accessible. The Committees will need \nto examine the current trends in the market place and evaluate any \nlegislation on all fronts, not just political rhetoric. Health care is \njust too important to politicize.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These are:\n       1. Consumer protection standards for self-funded plans.\n       2. Appeals standards for all group health plans.\n       3. Access to and confidentiality of medical information.\n       4. Ban on the use of genetic information for all plans.\n       5. New quality focus and expended research activities for \n     the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research.\n       6. Improved access to health insurance coverage by allowing \n     full deduction of health insurance for the self-employed and \n     expansion of MSAs.\n       The following summarizes the key aspects of the bill:\n       1. Consumer protection standards for self-funded plans: \n     Since States are responsible for regulating insured health \n     plans, the bill provides that the following standards would \n     apply only to self-funded plans governed by ERISA.\n       Emergency Care: Plans would be required to use the \n     ``prudent layperson'' standard for providing initial \n     emergency screening exams and ``additional emergency \n     services'' determined necessary by a ``prudent emergency \n     medical professional.''\n       Mandatory Point of Service: Plans that offer network-only \n     plans would be required to offer enrollees the option to \n     purchase point-of-service coverage. Small employers with 50 \n     or fewer workers would be exempt. Also exempt would be group \n     plans that offer a choice of two or more health insurance \n     options or two or more options with significantly different \n     providers. Plans could charge higher premiums and cost \n     sharing for the POS option.\n       OB-GYN/Pediatricians: Health plans would be required to \n     allow direct access to obstetricians/gynecologist and \n     pediatricians without referrals.\n       Continuity of Care: Plans who terminate or non renew \n     providers from their networks would be required to notify \n     enrollees and allow continued use of the provider (at the \n     same payment and cost-sharing rates) for up to 90 days if: \n     the enrollee is receiving institutional care, is in the \n     second (or late) trimester of pregnancy, or is terminally \n     ill.\n       Gag Rules: Plans would be prohibited from including ``gag \n     rules'' in providers' contracts.\n       Comparative Information: Plans would be required to provide \n     a wide range of information about health insurance options, \n     such as descriptions of the networks, premium and cost-\n     sharing information. Quality outcomes data and information is \n     not mandated.\n       Effective Dates: The new rules would become effective for \n     group plan years beginning on or after January 1 of the \n     second calendar year following the date of enactment. In \n     other words, the effective date would be January, 2001, \n     assuming enactment in 1999.\n       2. Grievance and Appeals: Plans would be required to have \n     written grievance procedures and have both an internal and \n     external appeals procedure. Grievances would not be \n     appealable.\n       Prior Authorization: Routine requests would need to be \n     completed within 30 days, and expedited requests for care \n     that could jeopardize enrollee's health would have to be \n     handled within 72 hours.\n       Qualification of Doctors for Internal Appeals: Appeals for \n     coverage determinations based on lack of medical necessity or \n     experimental treatment must be by a doctor ``with appropriate \n     expertise in field of medicine involved'' who was not \n     involved in the initial decision.\n       External Appeals: Enrollees and providers could appeal to \n     independent medical reviewers for amounts above a significant \n     financial threshold for issues based on medical necessity or \n     for services that involve an experimental treatment where the \n     enrollees' life is in jeopardy. External reviews could \n     include those licensed by the State or under Federal contract \n     for this purpose, a teaching hospital, or entities meeting \n     specific criteria. External review is binding on plans and \n     issuers.\n       3. Patient medical records: Plans, providers, schools, and \n     others would be required to:\n       Permit enrollees to inspect and copy their own medical \n     records, except when such information could endanger a \n     person's physical safety.\n       Disclose their confidentiality practices and to establish \n     appropriate safeguards for patient information.\n       Civil money penalties would be imposed for violations.\n       4. Genetic Information: All plans--self-funded and insured \n     group plans, as well as individual plans--would be prohibited \n     from denying coverage, or adjusting premiums or contribution \n     amounts based on ``predictive genetic information.'' The term \n     ``predictive genetic information'' includes individual's \n     genetic tests, genetic tests of family members, or \n     information about family medical history.\n       5. Refocusing AHCPR on Quality Improvement: The bill would \n     refocus AHCPR (and rename it the Agency for Healthcare \n     Quality Research) to encourage overall improvement of quality \n     in the nation's health care systems. The new agency would \n     facilitate support of state-of-the-art information systems, \n     support of primary care research, technology assessment and \n     coordination of the Federal Government's own quality \n     improvement efforts.\n       6. Improved Access to Health Insurance: The bill includes \n     three provisions to improve access:\n       Allows full deduction of health insurance for self-employed \n     individuals.\n       Gives individuals the ability to carry forward up to $500 \n     in their flexible spending accounts from one year to the next \n     or to be deposited into an IRA, and MSA, or a 401(k) plan.\n       Lifts the caps for MSAs and would allow all individuals, \n     including Federal employees, the option to purchase these \n     plans.\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my \ncolleagues in introducing this Patients' Bill of Rights, which is the \nproduct of more than a year's worth of intensive work and negotiations \nby the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force on which I serve.\n  This comprehensive legislation has three major purposes. First, it \nwill protect patients' rights and hold HMOs accountable for providing \nthe care they have promised. Second, it will expand consumer choice and \naccess to affordable care. And third, it will improve health care \nquality and outcomes.\n  Mr. President, there is a growing unease across our country about \nchanges in how we receive our health care. People worry that if they or \ntheir loved ones become seriously ill, their HMO will deny them \ncoverage and force them to accept either inadequate care or financial \nruin--or perhaps both.\n  They feel that vital decisions affecting their lives will be made, \nnot by a supportive family doctor, but by an unfeeling bureaucracy. The \nAmerican people, known for taking charge of their destiny, feel \nincreasingly powerless about their health care. Our bill will ensure \nthat medical decisions remain in the hands of patients and physicians, \nnot HMO accountants and trial lawyers.\n  All of us agree that medically-necessary patient care should not be \nsacrificed to the bottom line. However, according to a 1997 study by \nLewin, every one percent increase in health care premiums results in as \nmany as 400,000 uninsured Americans. I have therefore been alarmed by \nreports that American businesses everywhere--from large multinational \ncorporations to the corner store--are facing huge hikes in health \ninsurance premiums in 1999, ranging from about 8 percent on average, to \n20 percent or more. This is a remarkable contrast to the last few \nyears, when premiums rose less than 2 or 3 percent, if at all.\n  We are engaged in an extremely delicate balancing act as we attempt \nto respond to concerns about quality, without resorting to unduly \nburdensome federal controls and mandates that will further drive up \ncosts, causing thousands of Americans to lose their coverage and \npushing health insurance further out of reach for many uninsured \nAmericans.\n  Our Patients' Bill of Rights does not pre-empt, but rather builds \nupon the good work that states have done in the area of patients' \nrights and protections. Congress agreed that states should have primary \nresponsibility for the regulation of health insurance when it passed \nthe McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945. And, as someone who has overseen a \nBureau of Insurance in state government, I think state regulators have \ndone a good job of responding to the needs and concerns of their \ncitizens. For instance, at my last count, 44 states had passed laws \nprohibiting ``gag clauses'' that restrict communications between \npatients and their doctors, and the remaining six had bills pending in \ntheir legislatures. States acted without any mandate or prod from \nWashington to protect consumers.\n  Moreover, one size does not fit all, and what may be appropriate for \none state may not be necessary in another. Florida, for instance, \nprovides for direct access to a dermatologist, which is understandable, \ngiven the high rate of skin cancer in that state. But in a state like \nMaine this may not be so important.\n  So why does Congress need to act? The answer is that federal law \nprohibits states from regulating the self-funded, employer-sponsored \nhealth plans that cover 48 million Americans.\n  Our bill extends many of the same rights and protections to these \nindividuals and their families that Americans\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nin state-regulated plans already enjoy. For the first time, they will \nbe guaranteed the right to talk freely and openly with their doctors \nabout their treatment options without being subject to ``gag clauses'' \nthat limit communications. They will be guaranteed coverage for \nemergency room care that a ``prudent layperson'' would consider \nmedically necessary without prior authorization from their health plan. \nThey will be able to see their OB-GYN or pediatrician without a \nreferral from their plan's ``gatekeeper,'' and they will have the \noption of seeing a doctor who is not a part of their HMO's network. \nThey will also have some assurance of continuity of care if their \nhealth plan terminates its contract with their doctor or hospital.\n  Moreover, all patients will be given the right to review their \nmedical records and will have added protections to ensure that this \ninformation will be kept confidential. Finally, insurers will be \nprohibited from collecting or using predictive genetic information \nabout a patient to deny coverage or set premium rates.\n  Mr. President, the states are way ahead of the federal government in \nthe area of insurance reform, and the State of Maine has already \nenacted many of these same consumer rights and protections--a ban on \ngag clauses, a prudent layperson definition for emergency care, and \ndirect access to OB/GYNs. Our bill would extend these and other rights \nto the nearly 220,000 Maine citizens in health plans that are not \nsubject to state regulation and who currently do not enjoy these \nprotections.\n  A key provision of our bill would give all 125 million Americans in \nemployer-sponsored plans assurance that they will get the care that \nthey need, when they need it. This includes 535,735 people in Maine who \nare in fully-insured ERISA plans. For the first time, these individuals \nwill be entitled to clear and complete information about their health \nplan--about what it does and does not cover, about any cost-sharing \nrequirements, and about the plan's providers. Helping patients \nunderstand their coverage before they need to use it will help to avoid \ncoverage disputes later.\n  The goal of any patient protection legislation should be to solve \ndisputes about coverage up from, when the care is needed. Not months, \nor even years later, in a court room.\n  Our bill would accomplish this goal by creating both an internal and \nexternal review process. First, patients or doctors who are unhappy \nwith an HMO's decision could appeal it internally through a review \nconducted by individuals with ``appropriate expertise'' who were not \ninvolved in the initial decision. Moreover, this review would have to \nbe conducted by a physician if the coverage denial is based on a \ndetermination that the service is not medically necessary or is an \nexperimental treatment. Patients could expect results from this review \nwithin 30 days, or 72 hours in cases when delay poses a serious risk to \nthe patient's life or health.\n  Patients turned down by this internal review would then have the \nright to a free, external review by medical experts who are completely \nindependent of their health plan. This review must be completed within \nthirty days--and even faster in a medical emergency or when delay would \nbe detrimental to the patient's health. Moreover, the decision of these \noutside reviewers is binding on the health plan, but not on the \npatient. If the patient is not satisfied, they retain the right to sue \nin federal or state court for attorneys' fees, court costs, the value \nof the benefit and injunctive relief.\n  Our bill differs from the Democrats' bill in a fundamental respect: \nit places treatment decisions in the hands of doctors, not lawyers. If \nyour HMO denies you treatment that your doctor believes is medically \nnecessary, you should not have to resort to a costly and lengthy court \nbattle to get the care you need. After all, doesn't it make more sense \nto put medical care in the hands of doctors, not lawyers? You should \nnot have a resort to hiring a lawyer and filing an expensive lawsuit to \nget the treatment. You just can't sue your way to quality health care.\n  The purpose of our bill is to solve problems up-front when the care \nis needed, not months or even years later after the harm has occurred. \nAccording to the GAO, it takes an average of 33 months to resolve \nmalpractice cases. One case in the study took 11 years. This does \nabsolutely nothing to ensure a patient's right to timely and \nappropriate care. Moreover, patients only receive 43 cents out of every \ndollar awarded in malpractice cases. The rest winds up in the pockets \nof the trial lawyers and administrators of the court and insurance \nsystems.\n  Finally, more lawsuits are certain to mean higher health care costs. \nAccording to the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick, increased lawsuits \ncould drive up premiums as much as 8.6 percent, forcing businesses to \npay $94.1 billion ($1,284 per worker) in extra premiums over five \nyears. Close to two million Americans could lose their health insurance \nnext year as increased costs force many employers to eliminate coverage \naltogether, or to pass on higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs to \nemployees who can't afford them.\n  Last fall I met with a group of Maine employers who expressed their \nserious concerns about the Democrats' proposal to expand liability for \nhealth plans and employers. The Assistant Director for Human Resources \nat Bowdoin College talked about how moving to a self-funded, ERISA plan \nenabled them to continue to offer affordable coverage to Bowdoin \nemployees when premiums for their fully-insured plan skyrocketed in the \nlate 1980s. Since they self-funded, they have actually been able to \nlower premiums for their employees, while at the same time, enhance \ntheir benefit designs with such features as well-baby care, free annual \nphysicals, and prescription drug cards with low copayments. They told \nme that the Democrats' proposal to expand liability seriously \njeopardizes their ability to offer affordable coverage for their \nemployees. Similar concerns were expressed by the Maine Municipal \nAssociation, L.L. Bean, Bath Iron Works, and others.\n  Mr. President, our bill also contains important provisions to improve \nhealth care quality and outcomes for all Americans.\n  For example, I am particularly pleased that our bill contains the \nproposal introduced by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, that \nprohibits insurers from discriminating on the basis of predictive \ngenetic information.\n  Genetic testing holds tremendous promise for individuals who have a \ngenetic predisposition to beat cancer and other diseases and conditions \nwith a genetic link. However, this promise is significantly threatened \nwhen insurance companies use the results of such testing to deny or \nlimit coverage to consumers on the basis of genetic information. In \naddition to the potentially devastating consequences of being denied \nhealth insurance on the basis of genetic information, the fear of \ndiscrimination may discourage individuals who might benefit from having \nthis information from ever getting tested.\n  And finally, our bill will make health insurance more affordable by \nallowing self-employed individuals to deduct the full amount of their \nhealth care premiums beginning not in 2003, as in current law, but next \nyear.\n  Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health insurance costs \nbetween the self-employed and those working for large businesses is a \nmatter of basic equity, and it will also help to reduce the number of \nuninsured, but working, Americans. It will make health insurance more \naffordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are self-employed. They \ninclude our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our electricians, our \nplumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores that dot \ncommunities throughout the state.\n  Mr. President, I believe that our plan strikes the right balance as \nwe effectively address concerns about quality and choice without \nresorting to unduly burdensome federal controls and mandates that would \nfurther drive up costs and cause some Americans to lose their health \ninsurance altogether. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \ncosponsoring this proposal.\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to voice my support for the \nbill we are introducing today and to urge my colleagues to pass a \nstrong Patients' Bill of Rights this year. Our Patients' Bill of Rights \nis a good bill that will improve the quality of health care for \npatients in this country.\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\n  We have the benefit of starting off in a new Congress. The partisan \nrhetoric of elections is behind us. Today, we are here to convey our \ngenuine interest to pass managed care reform this year as well as to \nprovide the necessary building blocks to improve health care quality.\n  Not much attention was given in last year's debate to the many areas \nof agreement between the Republican and Democratic proposals. It is my \nhope that we can work together this year in a deliberative, thoughtful \nmanner to pass bipartisan legislation. For example, there is bipartisan \nsupport to enact strong patient protection standards including coverage \nfor emergency screening exams and services; allowing continuity of care \nso that patients may keep their physician, even if he or she is dropped \nfrom the plan, during a terminal illness, institutional care or \npregnancy; and to prohibit plans from including gag clauses in their \ncontracts. There is also strong consensus that we must require health \nplans to provide comparative information about their plans and to hold \nplans accountable for their decisions by allowing patients to appeal \ncoverage denials to an independent medical expert, including expedited \nreviews, and receive a timely response.\n  In addition, I am pleased that many provisions that are in the Senate \nRepublican bill also have received bipartisan support. Our bill last \nyear included the ``Women's Health Research and Prevention \nAmendments,'' which I also introduced as S. 1722, that passed the \nSenate unanimously at the end of last year. These programs provide a \nbroad spectrum of activities to improve the quality of women's health; \nincluding research, prevention, treatment, education and data \ncollection.\n  We must remember that the central focus of this debate--the genesis \nfor the entire debate--is to embark on a national discussion of how we \ncan truly improve real quality of care for patients. Our bill this year \nwill again contain two measures which have broad bipartisan support and \nwill greatly improve the quality of health care in this country.\n  Title III of our bill prohibits genetic discrimination against \nindividuals in health insurance. Prohibiting genetic discrimination \ntranslates into a patient's right to quality care. Genuine quality care \nmeans that patients and practitioners have the very best information \navailable to them when they make health care decisions. Patients should \nnot be afraid to benefit from new genetic technologies, or share \npersonal information that has immense potential to improve care and \nsave lives. This is not a political or partisan issue. Our 49 \nRepublican cosponsors last year, several of our Democratic colleagues, \nand President Clinton all support enacting legislation to prohibit \ngenetic discrimination.\n  Title IV of our bill refocuses the Agency for Health Care Policy and \nResearch to support our federal efforts to improve health care quality \nthrough a vigorous research agenda. I also introduced this proposal as \na stand alone bill (S. 2208) last year which had broad bipartisan \nsupport. Our goal is to enhance the agency to become the driving force \nof our federal efforts to support the science necessary to provide \npatients with information about the quality of care they receive and to \nprovide physicians with research data to improve health care outcomes \nfor their patients.\n  There is no question Congress will need to revisit some issues in the \nmanaged care debate. However, we will work deliberatively and in a \nbipartisan manner through our committee work this year to pass \ncomprehensive legislation because we all share the ultimate goal of \nimproving health care quality for patients.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to begin by commending \nSenator Nickles and all of the members who participated in putting the \nlegislation together. I think it is solid legislation that will result \nin a greatly improved health care system for Americans, and I am proud \nto be a co-sponsor of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.''\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, with its jurisdiction of private health insurance and public \nhealth programs, I anticipate that the Committee will have an active \nhealth care agenda during the 106th Congress. In fact, on January 20th, \nthe Committee held a hearing on health plan information requirements \nand internal and external appeals rights. And, this hearing builds on \nthe foundation of fourteen related hearings that my Committee held \nduring the 105th Congress.\n  People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get \ntheir health care. The ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus'' requires full \ninformation disclosure by an employer about the health plans he or she \noffers to employees. Patients also need to know how adverse decisions \nby the plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an \nindependent medical reviewer.\n  The limited set of standards under the Employee Retirement and Income \nSecurity Act (ERISA) may have worked well for the simple payment of \nhealth insurance claims under the fee-for-service system in 1974. \nToday, however, our system is much more complex, and there are many \ntypes of decisions being made--from routine reimbursements to pre-\nauthorizations for hospital stays. And it is in the context of these \nchanges, particularly the evolution of managed care, that ERISA needs \nto be amended in order to give participants and beneficiaries the right \nto appeal adverse coverage or medical necessity decisions to an \nindependent medical expert.\n  The provision of our bill giving consumers a new right of an external \ngrievance and appeals process is one of which I am particularly proud, \nsince it is the cornerstone of S. 1712, the Health Care QUEST Act, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Lieberman during the last Congress. \nUnder the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus,'' enrollees will get timely \ndecisions about what will be covered. Furthermore, if an individual \ndisagrees with the plan's decision, that individual may appeal the \ndecision to an independent, external reviewer. The reviewer's decision \nwill be binding on the health plan. However, the patient maintains his \nor her current rights to go to court.\n  As the Health and Education Committee works on health care quality \nlegislation, I will keep in mind three goals. First, to give families \nthe protections they want and need. Second, to ensure that medical \ndecisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients. \nAnd, finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low so that it \ndisplaces no one from getting health care coverage.\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope \nthe ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus'' we have introduced today will be \nenacted and signed into law by the President.\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today, Senate Republicans are \nresponding to America's number one health care concern: the high cost \nof health insurance and medical care. By granting all Americans access \nto tax-free medical savings accounts; by allowing self-employed \nAmericans to deduct 100 percent of the cost of their health insurance \npremiums; and by allowing workers with flexible savings accounts to \nkeep some of the money in those accounts, our ``Patients' Bill of \nRights--Plus'' will tear down the barriers that government has put in \nthe way of affordable health coverage and care.\n  Our proposal stands in stark contrast to those offered by others in \nCongress. With millions of Americans unable to afford insurance because \nof the unfairness of the federal tax code, some members of Congress \nwant to force consumers to buy government-prescribed benefits--\nincluding many that are giveaways to special interests--even if it \ncauses millions more to lose their health coverage.\n  While other so-called ``patients' rights'' bills contain nothing but \nexpensive mandates, hidden taxes and costly lawsuits, our bill will \ndeliver quality health insurance to millions of Americans. Our bill \nwill make a down payment on serious health care reform that puts \npatients first--not doctors, not lawyers, not insurance companies, and \ncertainly not government bureaucrats.\n  Rather than support a patients' bill of rights minus access, I urge \nmy colleagues to take a step forward by making health insurance \naccessible instead of taking a step backward by making it more \nexpensive.\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to support and co-\nsponsor patient protection legislation. There is noting more important \nthan protecting the patient-doctor relationship and guaranteeing our \ncitizens the right to choose their own doctor. It is important to make \nsure patients have the information they need to make decisions about \ntheir health care and make sure doctors, not accountants or lawyers, \ndecide which medical services are needed.\n  Under Senator Nickles' Patients' Bill of Rights Act, no health plan \nwill be beyond the scope of federal or state patient safeguards. The \nbill will expand access to doctors, incuding guaranteed access to \nobstetrical and gynecological care and pediatric care, and require \nmanaged care plans to offer patients the option to receive care outside \na plan's network of doctors.\n  In addition, health plans would have to provide patients with \ninformation on covered services, cost-sharing requirements, payment \nrestrictions for services from out-of-network providers, rules for out-\nof-area coverage, preauthorization requirements and procedures, and \nrules for grievence and appeals filings. Health plans would be required \nto have both an internal appeal and external third-party review if \ncoverage for any service is denied. Plans would also be required to \nsafeguard patients' medical information or face civil penalties.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights Act will also make it easier for many \nAmericans to afford health care. Over 3 million self-employed \nindividuals and their families will benefit from increasing the tax \ndeductibility of health insurance to 100 percent, the same deduction \nmost companies take for their employees. This bill also gives every \nAmerican the right to have medical savings accounts (MSAs) and puts \nMSAs on an equal tax treatment footing with standard health care \ninsurance. These flexible savings plans allow you to save money for \nhealth expenses tax-free as long as you have a high-deductible health \ninsurance plan. MSAs are currently only available for employees in \ncompanies with 50 or fewer employees.\n  In this era of managed care, patients need a Bill of Rights to make \nsure they get quality health care and not a plan that will lead to \nhigher costs and greater numbers of uninsured. I am happy to co-sponsor \nthis important legislation.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nrecently introduced Republican Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I would like to begin by making an observation about the impact of \nany potential changes to the managed care system.\n  I would submit that whether a decision relating to healthcare is made \nby business or the government, the results will always have \nconsequences on the those actually utilizing the system. Let me put \nthat another way, we must always proceed with what the impact of any \nchanges will mean to families and beneficiaries.\n  Thus, when decisions are made, they must be thought out and done so \nin a responsible manner. And I believe the Republican Patients' Bill of \nRights does just that by: holding HMO's accountable, increasing access, \nimproving quality and, expanding choice.\n  At the same time we must work to ensure that: costs are not \nunnecessarily increased, more Americans are not forced into the ranks \nof the uninsured and, additional layers of bureaucracy are not placed \nbetween patients and their doctors.\n  Let me take just a moment to talk about the state of health care in \nNew Mexico.\n  Health care is close to a $5 billion a year industry in New Mexico. \nAlmost 3,000 physicians practice in the state and overall the industry \nemploys close to 52,000 New Mexicans. Over 600,000 New Mexicans are \nenrolled in managed care plans.\n  With this in mind, I would like to make several points about New \nMexico as a whole, that are relevant to any debate relating to managed \ncare: 78% of New Mexico businesses have 10 or fewer employees and 96% \nof all businesses have 50 or fewer employees. New Mexico ranks 40th in \nthe nation in terms of the number of people uninsured, a full 25% of \nthe population.\n  The preceding merely emphasizes a point that we must take into \nconsideration and that is the potential impact upon a state and its \npeople.\n  I think everyone would agree that the managed care system is not \nperfect and we have all heard one or another of those so called HMO \nhorror stories. As a result, there is now a debate going on here and \naround the country about the need for HMO/Managed Care reform.\n  I also want to take a moment to point out that New Mexico is already \nat the forefront of HMO/Managed Care Reform.\n  New Mexico has already implemented many of the so called ``patient \nprotections'' like: no gag clauses; a prudent layperson standard for \nemergency care; direct access to an OB/GYN; choice of providers; access \nto prescription drugs; confidentiality of medical records and; a \ngrievance and appeals procedure.\n  I think it is important to stop and make a point that I believe is \nextremely important in light of the large number of small employers and \nhigh rate of uninsured not only in New Mexico, but the rest of the \ncountry. For every 1% increase in premium costs, 400,000 individuals \nwill lose their health insurance coverage.\n  That is an extremely sobering thought when one realizes that small \nemployers often have the most difficult time providing insurance for \ntheir employees because of the already high cost.\n  The Republican bill simply addresses Americans' concerns that their \nrights be assured in health care coverage, in addition to increasing \naccess to care, improving quality of care, and expanding choice.\n  However, there is one thing the Bill will not do, create a new right \nto go into the courts and sue managed care companies for unlimited \ndamages. I believe that we on this side of the aisle have adopted a \nsense about health care and it says: lawyers and lawsuits do not \ndeliver health care. Rather, lawyers and lawsuits generally make health \ncare cost more.\n  I also think that it is very important to note that under the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) a participant or \nbeneficiary can already sue a managed care company. Let me repeat that, \nthe right to sue a HMO is already available.\n  Now why would we want to create even more lawsuits, when for years we \nhave been attempting to enact tort reform.\n  I know many New Mexicans share in the fears expressed by many \nAmericans about the availability and quality of their health care. That \nis why I support the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights because it \nwill ensure that patients receive: more affordable care and more \nchoices; greater access to more and better information about health \nplans, benefits and the doctors that provide their care; and the \nadvantages of a system that holds health plans accountable for medical \ndecisions through a strong internal and external appeals process.\n  The Bill reforms the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, \nrenaming it the Agency for Healthcare Quality Research (AHQR). It will \nmake annual reports on the state of quality and cost of America's \nhealth care, support primary care research in underserved rural and \nurban areas, provide technology assessment, and coordinate federal \nquality improvement efforts.\n  Furthermore, the Bill includes a provision that will prohibit \ninsurance plans from using predictive genetic information to deny \ncoverage or to set premium rates.\n  Finally, the Bill would provide relief to those New Mexicans and \nAmericans who are self-employed by allowing them to deduct 100% of \ntheir health insurance costs. More than 25 million people live in \nfamilies headed by a self-employed individual (5.1 million of whom are \ncurrently uninsured).\n  In closing, I believe that the key to improving our healthcare system \nand to improving our HMO/Managed Care System is to work together.\n  As I have said, we must find a solution that would most benefit not \nonly New Mexicans, but everyone across our country. However, at the \nsame time we must remember that our decisions cannot affect these same \npeople in an adverse manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\n  S. 301. A bill to amend title 39, United States Code, relating to \nmailability, false representations, civil penalties, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   HONESTY IN SWEEPSTAKES ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Honesty in \nSweepstakes Act of 1999. This bill addresses one of the most troubling \nand persistent consumer abuse issues we face today: highly deceptive, \nand all too often financially damaging, sweepstakes and other mass mail \npromotions.\n  Our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers are clearly being \ntaken advantage of, and in some cases seriously financially harmed, by \nintentionally misleading sweepstakes promotions. Thousands of \nnationwide victims are being deliberately misled into believing that \nthey have just won or are likely to win a sweepstakes when in fact they \nhave neither won nor are in fact likely to win such a prize.\n  Each year American consumers also receive hundreds of millions of \ncashier's check look-alikes that deceptively masquerade as real \ncashier's checks while actually being worthless. These ploys unfairly \nprey upon some people's hopes and dreams.\n  Over the years sweepstakes have become increasingly sophisticated and \ndeceptive. While these promotional tactics may be technically legal \nthey are designed to skirt the intentions and outer limits of the law. \nThese deceptive tactics run counter to core American values of honesty \nand forthrightness. There is abundant evidence, including the deceptive \nsweepstakes and other promotions each of us receives in our mailboxes \non a regular basis, that current laws aimed at stopping these deceptive \npromotions simply are not working. Something needs to be done.\n  This bill addresses these deceptive sweepstakes and cashier's checks \nlook-alikes by requiring up-front, clear and easy to read Honesty in \nSweepstakes disclosures that will help protect consumers by \ncounterbalancing false promises and deception. While honest and \nstraight-forward sweepstakes promoters have nothing to fear from this \nbill, those promotions that revert to false and deceptive tactics will \nfeel the heat.\n  The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999 is a refined version of my \noriginal legislation, S. 2141, that I introduced during the 105th \nCongress. The bill I am introducing today incorporates valuable input I \nreceived during a Senate hearing on S.2141 and from productive \ndiscussions and negotiations involving key interested parties. Included \namong those who have made valuable contributions are: my Senate \ncolleagues; the U.S. Postal Service; the General Accounting Office; \nAttorneys General from several states including Colorado, Florida, \nMichigan and New York; the American Association of Retired Persons; the \nConsumer Federation of America; the National Consumers League; the \nDirect Marketing Association; the Magazine Publishers of America and \nother industry representatives and experts. I want to thank them for \ntheir contributions to the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999.\n  The AARP has informed me that ``Research has shown that older \nAmericans may be particularly vulnerable to techniques used by \nsweepstakes companies. At times they end up purchasing products that \nthey do not want in the hopes of improving their chances of winning. \nAdditionally, it has been shown that participation in these sweepstakes \ncan lead to a rise in the number of telemarketing calls a person \nreceives as well as an increase in mailed solicitations.''\n  The Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1999 will go a long way toward \nprotecting our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers from \nmisleading and deceptive sweepstakes promotions. The most vulnerable \nconsumers among us deserve this protection. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill and a letter from the AARP be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: AARP thanks you for drawing \n     attention to the problem of deceptive and misleading \n     sweepstakes solicitations by introducing the ``Honesty in \n     Sweepstakes Act of 1999.'' Research has shown that older \n     Americans may be particularly vulnerable to techniques used \n     by sweepstakes companies. At times they end up purchasing \n     products that they do not want in the hopes of improving \n     their chances of winning. Additionally, it has been shown \n     that participation in these sweepstakes can lead to a rise in \n     the number of telemarketing calls a person receives as well \n     as an increase in mailed solicitations.\n       AARP appreciates your efforts on behalf of consumers to \n     eradicate the practice of fraudulent sweepstakes mailings \n     through the introduction of the ``Honesty in Sweepstakes Act \n     of 1999.'' We look forward to working with you and other \n     Members on a bi-partisan basis to address this issue in the \n     106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Horace B.

INSTITUTIONAL PROCESS IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Helms, and Mr. Coverdell) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n[[Page S925]]\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 3\n\n       Whereas, in 1991 at Santiago, Chile, the Organization of \n     American States (OAS) approved Resolution 1080 to deter \n     irregular interruptions of the democratic political \n     institutional process within countries having democratically \n     elected governments;\n       Whereas the OAS invoked Resolution 1080 (1991) and called \n     for a meeting of the foreign ministers in 1991 to determine \n     appropriate actions in response to the coup d'etat against \n     Haiti's elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide;\n       Whereas the legacy of fiat and abuse of the Duvalier \n     dictatorship led the framers of the 1987 Haitian constitution \n     to provide for clear separation of powers;\n       Whereas the 1987 Haitian constitution permanently vests all \n     legislative authority in the National Assembly and does not \n     provide for rule by decree by the president;\n       Whereas on January 11, 1999, President Preval seized \n     dictatorial powers by effectively dissolving Haiti's \n     parliament and announcing he will rule by decree; and\n       Whereas this irregular interruption of the democratic \n     political institutional process requires immediate \n     international attention and action to bring about a return to \n     democracy in that country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the irregular interruption of the democratic \n     political institutional process and considers that \n     interruption to be a serious blow to democracy in Haiti and a \n     serious threat to democracy in the Caribbean region and the \n     Hemisphere;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Haiti forthwith to fully \n     restore the legitimate exercise of power by a democratically \n     elected National Assembly and to ensure full respect for \n     internationally recognized human rights;\n       (3) urges the Organization of American States (OAS) to send \n     a fact-finding mission headed by the Secretary General to \n     Haiti and, under Resolution 1080, to call a meeting of the \n     foreign ministers of the OAS member countries in order to \n     consider joint actions to bring about a return to democracy \n     in that country.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President of the United \n     States with the request that he further transmit such copy to \n     the Secretary General of the Organization of American States.\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today, it is with distress that I \nrise to submit and seek the Senate's approval on a concurrent \nresolution to express the deep concern of Congress over the \ndeteriorating situation in Haiti. My colleagues from Florida, Senator \nGraham; North Carolina, Senator Helms; and Georgia, Senator Coverdell \nhave joined me in co-sponsoring this important and timely resolution. \nThe Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Benjamin \nGilman and Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Committee, Porter \nGoss intend to introduce this same resolution in the House very soon.\n  Mr. President, twelve days ago, Haiti's drawn out crisis took a very \ntroubling turn when Haitian President Rene Preval announced that the \nHaitian National Assembly's term had expired and he would proceed to \ninstall a government by ``executive order.'' What he means, of course, \nis to ignore Haiti's parliament and rule by decree.\n  To understand the present situation, one must first comprehend the \nseries of events in the past year and a half which have led to this \nunfortunate circumstance. The seriously flawed April 6, 1997 elections, \nwhich attracted less than 5 percent of the Haitian electorate, provoked \nthe resignation in June 1997 of Prime Minister Rosney Smarth. For \ntwenty months, a political deadlock has existed between President \nPreval and the majority party in parliament over the contested April \nelections and recently over President Preval's nominee for Prime \nMinister, Jacques Edouard Alexis. The political crisis has virtually \nparalyzed the government and delayed millions of dollars in \ninternational aid to Haiti.\n  During this period, the President dispatched a series of high-level \nemissaries, including the Secretary of State and the First Lady, to \nhelp defuse the crisis. Former National Security Advisor Anthony Lake \nhas undertaken many missions to help mediate among the parties; most \nrecently in the days leading up to the January 11 announcement.\n  Only on December 16 did the Haitian Senate ratify Mr. Alexis' \ncredentials. On December 18, the Chamber of Deputies followed suit. \nNegotiations for the final approval of Mr. Alexis as Prime Minister, \nhowever, proved fruitless. President Preval and Mr. Alexis either \nfailed or refused to secure agreement on a cabinet that would allow the \nprime minister to present his program to parliament for a vote of \nconfidence.\n  This much is clear: Despite the extraordinary efforts of the \nAdministration's emissaries, President Preval refused to accept any \nsolution to this crisis that left Haiti's parliament in place. The \npresent moment in Haiti is fraught with danger. Micha Gaillard, a \nHaitian social democrat who was closely associated with the internal \nefforts to restore then President Aristide to power in the early 1990's \nfollowing the coup attempt against him wrote on January 16 that:\n\n       What is going on today, according to those who were there, \n     is the same as happened in the years 1963-64 when Francios \n     Duvalier was maneuvering to be proclaimed president-for-life. \n     [This] . . . formula has been reviewed and updated. Here it \n     is important that we . . . disavow and condemn far and wide \n     the means employed--usurpations of power, intimidation, \n     violence, and corruption--to subvert the functioning of all \n     the democratic institutions, which are the sole guarantee \n     against dictatorship.\n\n  The resolution I submit today puts the United States Congress on \nrecord that the irregular interruption of the democratic political \ninstitutional process in Haiti must, without further delay, be \naddressed through Organization of American States Resolution 1080.\n  In 1991 at Santiago, Chile, the Organization of American States \napproved Resolution 1080 specifically to deter irregular interruptions \nof the democratic political institutional process within countries \nhaving democratically elected governments. When invoked, a meeting of \nthe Permanent Council of the OAS and the foreign ministers of the OAS \nmember countries is in order to consider joint actions to bring about a \nreturn to democracy in that country.\n  Resolution 1080 has been invoked several times in the past decade. \nThe OAS invoked the resolution in 1991 to determine appropriate actions \nin response to the coup d'etat against Haiti's elected President \nAristide. It was also invoked in Guatemala in 1993 when Guatemala \nPresident Jorge Serrano dissolved the Parliament and the courts; in \nParaguay in 1996 when a Paraguayan general attempted a coup d'etat \nagainst Paraguayan President Wasmosy; and in 1992 in Peru after \nPresident Alberto Fujimori announced the dissolution of the Congress \nand the courts.\n  Mr. President, I have visited Haiti seven times in the past three \nyears. I am extremely concerned about the current situation there. Mr. \nPresident, I urge my colleagues to support and pass this important \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S924-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 29--DESIGNATING NATIONAL CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND \n                             EMPLOYEES WEEK\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself and Mr. Campbell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, the last Congress enacted legislation \nwhich protects our nation's vital underground infrastructure. Power \ncables, telephone lines, water mains and pipelines affect our daily \nlives, and it is essential that they are given the best protection \npossible. This legislation, based on S.1115, the Comprehensive One-Call \nNotification Act, does just that. It provides incentives for states to \nimprove their notification systems--systems which provide for accurate \nmarking of underground facilities, and systems which prevent damage \nduring excavation. This bill became law as part of the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21.\n  I am pleased to report that the response to the one-call legislation \nhas been extremely positive. The truely bipartisan spirit that \ncharacterized Congress' approach to the legislation has been carried \nover into the cooperative spirit of the participants in implementing \nthe bill.\n  The bill's first mandate convened a study on the best practices in \none-call notification. This study will be submitted to Congress in June \nof this year, and is being carried out by the Office of Pipeline Safety \n(OPS) of the Department of Transportation. I have received reports that \nOPS has fully involved those affected by the law in all phases of the \ndesign and implementation of the best practices. This has proven to be \nan excellent model for conducting a cooperative effort between the \npublic and private sectors. Mr. President, I am particularly pleased by \nthe leadership the excavation community has shown in working with one-\ncall center representatives, underground facility operators and others \ninterested in underground infrastructure protection by moving this \nstudy process forward.\n  This study is a bottom-up effort with emphasis on letting those with \nhands-on experience play leading roles. After a public meeting last \nAugust to bring together interested parties, the participants formed \nnine teams covering various aspects of underground infrastructure \nprotection: one-call center practices, excavation, mapping, locating \nand marketing, compliance, planning and design, reporting and \nevaluation, public education, and emerging technologies. The teams are \ncurrently gathering information, receiving and discussing any and all \ncomments, and will produce the first drafts of the chapters for the \nfinal report. Team meetings are completely open to interested members \nof the public. Infact, schedules and minutes are being published on the \nOPS web page, http://ops.dot.gov, under ``damage prevention.''\n  Mr. President, the affected parties have checked their differences at \nthe door, have worked together with openness and goodwill, have solved \na very important infrastructure problem, and, because there was real \nworld input, it will improve practices in the real world.\n  Looking ahead, the second phase of the bill calls for the Secretary \nof Transportation to offer grants to states which encourage \nimprovements in their states' one-call notification systems. I expect \nthe best practices study to significantly help devise criteria for \nawarding these grants. I hope the President's budget proposal funds \nthese grant activities from general revenues in full recognition of the \nbroad public benefit that accrues from effective underground \ninfrastructure protection.\n  Mr. President, the process moving forward within the Department of \nTransportation has enlightened federalism through a government-industry \npartnership. I congratulate the monitoring the additional steps in the \ninclusive process to implement the protection of our vital underground \ninfrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FAIRCHILD AFB KC-135 CREW\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on January 13th, a Fairchild based \nKC-135 crashed near Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. Today, Team \nFairchild and its many supporters gathered at the Spokane Opera House \nto grieve and to honor the memories of four members of the Washington \nAir National Guard who perished aboard the KC-135 in the service to our \ncountry.\n  I have had the pleasure of traveling to Fairchild Air Force Base on \nnumerous occasions and meeting with the fine men and women there. They \nprovide an indispensable part of our nation's defense and serve with \npride and professionalism. I know that this tragedy hits especially \nhard on that close-knit community, and so it is with a heavy heart that \nI join them in their grief.\n  The four who died in the crash were members of the Washington Air \nNational Guard 141st Air Refueling Wing, based at Fairchild Air Force \nBase near Spokane, Washington. Members of the 141st Air Refueling Wing \nwere in Germany for training purposes and were participating in a \nroutine NATO flight to refuel surveillance planes. The fallen men were \nall from Washington state, all family men, and all heroes.\n  Major David W. Fite, the pilot of the KC-135, was a resident of \nBellevue, Washington. He began his service in the Washington Air \nNational Guard in 1991. He is survived by his wife, a brother and his \nparents.\n  Captain Kenneth F. Thiele, co-pilot, was a resident of Spokane, \nWashington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since \nSeptember 1998. He is survived by his wife.\n  Major Matthew F. Laiho, navigator, was a resident of Spokane, \nWashington and served in the Washington Air National Guard since 1989. \nHe is survived by his wife, two children and his parents.\n  Technical Sergeant Richard D. Visintainer, boom operator, was also a \nresident of Spokane, Washington. His service in the Washington Air \nNational Guard began in 1972. He is survived by his former wife and \nchildren.\n  Colonel James Wynne, the Wing Commander, was quoted, ``The guard is \nsuch a close-knit extended family that this will certainly send a wave \nof grief throughout the unit. This is a tragic loss.'' Colonel Wynne is \nright. Fairchild grieves today, its spirit challenged by tragedy. I \nknow Team Fairchild will serve as a comfort to grieving families and \nfellow Air Force personnel.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the families of Major Fite, Captain \nThiele, Major Laiho and Sergeant Visintainer. Each will be missed. Each \nwill be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S926-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S926-S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AND EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the \nEducational Opportunities and Excellence Act of 1999. This legislation \nrepresents the Republican vision how we can improve educational \nopportunities for every American child.\n  Last year, Congressional Republicans passed an educational agenda to \nprovide every child in America with first-class learning opportunities \nin safe, secure schools, to give parents new choices and more decision-\nmaking power over their children's education, and to bring common-sense \nreforms to a myriad of redundant and antiquated federal education \nprograms. Unfortunately, the special interests in Washington were \nresistant to change and fought desperately against our reform efforts. \nThis is what happened:\n\n                   What We Proposed and What Happened\n\n       (1) A+ Accounts--President vetoed.\n       (2) Block Grants--Passed Senate, dropped in conference.\n       (3) Charter Schools--Signed into law.\n       (4) School Choice Pilot Program--President vetoed.\n       (5) Teacher Testing/Merit Pay--President vetoed.\n       (6) Reading Excellence--Signed into law.\n       (7)Teacher and Student Safety--President vetoed.\n       (8) Full Funding of IDEA--Increased Funding by over $500m.\n\n  Despite the fierce opposition of our opponents, we will continue our \nfight to bring the best education possible within the reach of every \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\nchild. Our mission is to ensure that our children are among the best \neducated in the world, and we will not be dissuaded from accomplishing \nthat goal by any amount of opposition.\n  Today, we are introducing the Educational Opportunities and \nExcellence Act of 1999 to build on the Successes of the 105th Congress, \nand to jump start the much needed debate on increasing the ability of \nour nation's children to obtain a quality education.\n  The Educational Opportunities and Excellence Act of 1999 is a broad \neffort to offer new reforms to K-12 education, and provide incentives \nfor families to save for higher education. It is made up of several \ntitles:\n  Title 1--the Education savings Account Act of 1999--Under this title, \nparents will have more control over their children's education through \nIRA-style savings accounts that allow parents to save money tax-free \nfor elementary and secondary education expenses. This legislation \nallows parents, grandparents, or scholarship sponsors to contribute up \nto $2,000 (post-tax dollars) a year per child for educational expenses \nwhile at public, private, religious or home schools--from kindergarten \nthrough high school. Last year, this proposal passed both the House and \nthe Senate, but was vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Title II--Dollars to the Classroom Act--consolidates over 30 separate \neducation programs and sends the money directly to state and local \nofficials to be used to improve educational achievement and learning. \nThe bill requires that 95% of federal education dollars are spent on \nclassroom activities, rather than Washington based bureaucracies.\n  Title III--Merit Act--provides for an incentive grant program for \nStates to establish and administer periodic teacher testing and merit \npay programs for elementary and secondary school teachers.\n  Title IV--Additional Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation--provides additional funding to states to meet the federal \nmandate under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Title V--K-12 Community Participation Act--amends the IRS code to \nallow for a tax credit for elementary and secondary school expenses and \nfor charitable contributions to organizations which provide scholarship \nto attend private schools. The maximum credit allow is up to $200 per \nperson in 1999; $150 in 2000; $200 in 2001; and $250 thereafter.\n  Title VI--Collegiate Learning and Student Savings--extends tax-free \ntreatment to all accumulations of interests and withdrawals from pre-\npaid college tuition plans.\n  With the Educational Opportunities and Excellence Act of 1999, we \nwant to lead the Congress in taking the first steps necessary to \nimprove educational opportunities dramatically for every American \nchild. Our agenda--parental control and involvement, dollars to the \nclassroom, state and local authority, and a return to basic academics--\nwill be fully embraced by parents, teachers and administrators, \ngovernors and mayors across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S926-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE AIR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, earlier this week, I joined the \nChairman and Ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation in introducing the Air Transportation \nImprovement Act. While I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, I am sorry that we are in the position of introducing a \nbill that should have been passed last year. Due to a number of \nunfortunate circumstances, including the unqualified mess at the end of \nthe 105th Congress where 8 out of the 13 appropriations bills had to be \nlumped into a single massive bill, the Congress failed to complete its \nduty to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and \nrelated programs in the regular order of doing business. As a result, \nthe FAA and important infrastructure programs such as the Airport \nImprovement Programs, were only extended until the end of March 1999. \nThus, we are forced to begin the new Congress by taking up last year's \nbusiness.\n  The FAA bill introduced yesterday needs to be one of the first \npriorities of this Congress. This is the case not only because of the \npressing deadline of the short term extension, but also because this \nlegislation contains some very important policy initiatives that will \ninject more airline competition and improve air service to small \ncommunities. While I support the general thrust of this legislation, I \nstill believe that we need to consider some adjustments to this \nlegislation. In particular, I believe that the Small Community Air \nService Development Program established under this legislation is too \nmodest in size to have much of an impact. Since the deregulation of the \nairline industry two decades ago, hundreds of small communities have \nexperienced service degradation and many have lost service altogether. \nVast geographic regions of our country have suffered unacceptable \ngeographic isolation as the airlines have withdrawn service in smaller \ncommunities. This trend needs the serious attention of the Congress and \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  Thanks to the bipartisan cooperation on this legislation among the \nleadership of the Senate Commerce Committee, we have developed the \nSmall Community Air Service Development Program which could go a long \nway to address the small community air service problems. However, the \nauthorization level proposed in the legislation introduced yesterday \ndoes not provide adequate enough resources for this demonstration \nprogram to make much of a difference. I hope that as the Commerce \nCommittee works on this bill that we will be able to increase the \nauthorization levels for this important new program.\n  I also realize that there is some serious controversy surrounding \nsome provisions in this bill. It is my hope that we will be able to \nreach some fair compromises over the contentious provisions and that \nthis bill will pass the Congress in very short order.\n  I want to commend Chairman McCain and Senator Hollings for their \nleadership on this legislation. I know that there is a strong desire on \nboth sides of the aisle to work on this legislation and pass it as soon \nas possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S927-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S927-S928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DAVID W. DENNIS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a much-\nloved and respected Hoosier statesman, David Worth Dennis, who passed \naway on January 6, 1999, at the age of 86. David Dennis represented the \neastern section of the State of Indiana in the United States House of \nRepresentatives from 1969 to 1975. He served with great courage and \ndistinction on the House Judiciary Committee during the difficult \nWatergate period.\n  David Dennis' commitment to public service began before and extended \nbeyond his three terms in the House of Representatives. After his \ngraduation from Earlham College and Harvard Law School, he began his \ncareer practicing law in Richmond, Indiana. He then served as the \nprosecuting attorney for Wayne County, Indiana, and then as a First \nLieutenant in the JAG Corps of the U.S. Army. He served in the Pacific \ntheater at the end of World War II. Shortly after he came home to \nIndiana in 1946, he won a seat in the Indiana General Assembly, where \nhe served a total of four terms.\n  I first met Dave during his service in the Indiana House of \nRepresentatives, and I frequently corresponded with him during his \nUnited States Congressional service. I was pushing the extension of the \n``New Federlism,'' in which states and cities obtained and exercised \nmore responsibility. I also was advocating general revenue sharing in \nwhich the federal government would send money to states and cities \nwithout strings attached in order that the discharge of these \nadditional responsibilities could be paid for. Dave was enthusiastic \nabout diminishing federal prerogatives, but somewhat less enthusiastic \nabout a distribution of federal revenues.\n  Our coming together on the campaign trail in 1974 led to enormous \nmutual respect. The Judiciary Committee was a battleground for efforts \nto impeach President Richard Nixon. Dave was a very loyal Republican \nbut, even more importantly, he was a scholarly and thoughtful \nlegislator who believed that insufficient evidence had been produced to \nvote for articles of impeachment in the Committee. As additional \nevidence withheld by President\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\nNixon became known, Dave became outspoken in his condemnation of the \ncover-up and in his demand that President Nixon should resign.\n  I was privileged to watch at close range a courageous public servant \nat work who, even in the midst of a partisan election campaign, was \nnever in doubt that he should speak the truth as he saw it and let the \nchips fall where they may.\n  Neither Dave nor I were successful in the 1974 campaign, but I looked \nforward throughout subsequent years to our meetings. We not only \nreminisced about battles of the past, we discussed the future with \nexpectations that great things could occur in our country through \nconstructive leadership.\n  David Dennis remained a leader after returning in 1975 to practice \nlaw in Richmond, Indiana. Still active in Republican politics, he \ncontinued his career as an attorney, where he was loved and respected \nby the Richmond community. He was known for his fairness and his \ndedication to the practice of law. Describing Dave's legal calling, a \nfriend quoted in the Richmond Palladium-Item summed up his dedication: \n``He understood it as a service to the community. In the same way, \nDavid Dennis saw politics as a profession, not a way to get ahead.'' \nDave was truly an advocate who loved the roles he played in both the \nlegislative and the judicial systems of our country.\n  I last saw David Dennis at a Republican dinner in Richmond during the \n1994 campaign. He was introduced and received a wonderful ovation from \nWayne County Republicans, who revered his service and were so grateful \nfor his continuing citizenship in the community he loved. I was able to \nkeep in touch with news of Dave through his son, William C. Dennis II, \nwho served as a remarkably energetic professor at my alma mater, \nDenison University.\n  In addition to his extensive public service, David Dennis is \nremembered by friends and family as an engaging storyteller and a \nskilled tennis player. Most of all, he is remembered as a loyal friend \nand loving husband and father.\n  My sympathy is with his children, Bill and Ellen, as well as with his \nfour grandchildren as they remember and celebrate the life of an \nexemplary Hoosier statesman. This standard bearer of a great Quaker \ntradition at Earlham College added something very special to Indiana \nPolitical life. We will miss his wisdom and grace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S927-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        AMERICAN WORKER LONG TERM CARE AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Tuesday of this week, Senator \nGrassley and I introduced S. 36, The American Worker Long Term Care \nAffordability Act of 1999, a bill creating a model long-term care \ninsurance program for federal employees. Today, I would like to comment \non a related long term care bill also introduced on Tuesday by Senator \nGrassley and myself. S. 35, The Long Term Care Affordability and \nAvailability Act of 1999, would give all Americans a tax deduction for \nthe premiums they pay for long term care insurance.\n  The cost of long term care has risen to astonishing levels in recent \nyears. In 1995, it averaged $37,000 per year. What this means is that a \nchronic illness requiring long term care can represent a financial \ncatastrophe for retired Americans and their families. A retired couple \nmight have a pension and basic health care, but the couple is not \nsecure in retirement so long as their financial resources can be \ndepleted by long term care bills.\n  Many Americans think Medicare covers the cost of long term care. In \nfact, it covers only the first 100 days of care following a hospital \nstay. Yet the average nursing home stay is 2.5 years.\n  Medicaid, unlike Medicare, does cover long term care--but only for \nbeneficiaries who use up their life savings and income first. Medicaid, \nafter all, is a program for the poor, and long term care beneficiaries \nmust become impoverished to qualify. Furthermore, beneficiaries who \nrely on Medicaid must use providers that are chosen for them--not \nproviders of their own choice. Even with these restrictions, Medicaid \ncurrently pays more than $30 billion per year for nursing home care.\n  The budgetary challenges provided by Medicare and Medicaid are on \ncourse to become ever more acute in coming years, as the baby boom \ngeneration ages. By 2030, as the number of people over 65 doubles, \nfully 32 states will have the demographics that Florida has today. The \nfastest growing segment of the population will be those over 85 with an \nexpected 143% increase by 2030. People over 85 are at least 5 times \nmore likely to reside in a nursing home than people who are 65. In real \nterms, nursing home expenditures are expected to quadruple in the next \nthree decades.\n  Mr. President, given the accelerating cost of long term care and the \ndemographic pressures on Medicare and Medicaid and other entitlement \nprograms, Congress started several years ago to provide incentives for \npeople to plan ahead for their own needs. The way most Americans plan \nahead for long term care is by purchasing long term care insurance. \nWith insurance, people can be confident that they won't have to \nimpoverish themselves to deal with a chronic illness. They won't have \nto fall back on the Medicaid program or family members.\n  In the Kennedy-Kassenbaum health reform legislation in 1996, Congress \npermitted the deduction of premiums on long term care insurance in the \nsame manner as health expenses. The trouble is that few people--other \nthan the self-employed--can deduct health expenses since the tax code \nallows only the portion of health expenses over 7.5% of income to be \ndeducted, and then only as an itemized deduction. Thus, a typical \nemployee planning ahead for retirement cannot purchase long term care \ninsurance on a tax deductible basis.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today would improve on Kennedy-Kassenbaum \nby allowing Americans to deduct long term care insurance premiums \nregardless of whether or not they are self-employed or whether they \nitemize deductions or have any other health expense. Effectively, the \nbill would put long term care insurance on a par with pensions. Just as \neveryone can save for a pension on a tax deductible basis, everyone \nshould be able to purchase long term care insurance in the same \nfashion.\n  A better deduction for long term care insurance premiums could also \nhelp us by encouraging younger Americans to purchase insurance now, \nwhen the coverage is readily affordable. For example, a quality long \nterm care insurance policy purchased at age forty, can cost less than \n$50 per month.\n  Mr. President, every person who is covered by long term care \ninsurance is one fewer potential Medicaid claimant. A recent study by \nthe American Council for Life Insurance indicates that long term care \ninsurance has the potential to reduce future out of pocket expenditures \non long term care by 40 percent and future Medicaid long term care \nexpenditures by more than 20%. In other words, long term care insurance \nhas the capacity both to protect seniors from financial catastrophe, \nand to help protect entitlement programs from long term insolvency.\n  Mr. President, I also want to applaud the President's long term care \ninitiative, which he announced two weeks ago. In proposing a tax credit \nfor individuals who provide long term care to dependents, President \nClinton also pledged to increase efforts to educate Americans about the \nimportance of long term care. Both of these proposals are consistent \nwith the legislative effort that Senator Grassley and I are \nundertaking, and I look forward to working with the White House on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S928-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S928-S929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BMC ANTHONY LAWRENCE PETIT AND THE SCOTCH CAP LIGHTHOUSE\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the five \nheros who perished in the Scotch Cap Lighthouse disaster of April 1, \n1946--five Coast Guardsmen who gave their lives so that others would \nsurvive. The lighthouse keeper was Chief Boatswain's Mate Anthony \nLawrence Petit. His crew included Fireman 1st Class Jack Colvin, Seaman \n1st Class Dewey Dykstra, Motor Machinist's Mate 2nd Class Leonard \nPickering, and Seaman 1st Class Paul James Ness.\n  Lighthouses will always have a place in our history. They have warned \nmariners of danger, their crews have rescued survivors in the worst \nconditions imaginable, and their brilliant lamps\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nhave comforted and reassured those who are bound homeward at last.\n  In 1903, Scotch Cap Light Station was the first light put in place on \nthe outside coast of Alaska. Located at the western end of Unimak \nIsland, approximately 425 miles southwest of Anchorage, the light marks \nthe entrance to Unimak Pass. Its only contact with the outside world \nwas--every three months or so--a visit from a buoytender bringing \nsupplies.\n  It was, and is, one of the most isolated places imaginable, \nespecially in the winter, and its hardships were legendary--one \nlighthouse keeper froze both his hands just trying to go from the \nlighthouse tower to his quarters during a blizzard. It was so hazardous \nthat no families were allowed, and in the early days, lighthouse \nkeepers were allowed a full year off for every three years they spent \non the island.\n  In 1940, the original building was replaced by a brand-new, \nreinforced-concrete structure built on a bluff near the shore, raising \nthe light to 90 feet over the ocean, and protected by a concrete sea \nwall. But it wasn't enough.\n  The disaster began early, on April l, 1946. At 1:30 a.m., the crew \nwoke to an earthquake lasting about 30 seconds, strong enough to knock \nthings off shelves. After the quake, the watchstander at a radio-\ndirection-finding (RDF) installation--built a little farther up the \nhill during World War II--radioed the lighthouse crew and was told \nthere was no major damage.\n  Then, just before two o'clock in the morning, a second quake hit. The \nsecond tremor was expected, but not the million-ton wall of water--a \ntsunami--that quickly followed it.\n  The RDF station logbook reported: Terrific roaring from ocean heard, \nfollowed immediately by terrific sea, top of which rose above cliff and \nstruck station, causing considerable damages.''\n  The watchstander again used his radio to contact the lighthouse. This \ntime, there was no reply. This time, he wrote in the logbook: Light \nextinguished and horn silent.''\n  The wave from the second earthquake is now estimated to have been \nover 100 feet high. It completely erased the concrete lighthouse, \nkilling the five crewmen instantly, and leaving only wreckage. The \nbodies of Chief Anthony Petit and his crew were gone. They washed \nashore again a few days later, identifiable only by their bridgework \nand jewelry.\n  Chief Anthony Lawrence Petit was just a man--an ordinary man--but his \nlife and death offer a glimpse at the thousands of ordinary men and \nwomen who join the Coast Guard and serve their fellow citizens in \nextraordinary ways. He was born and raised on Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula, in the town of Hancock, on a ship canal crossing the \nKeweenaw Peninsula. As a boy, he would have known the ships well, along \nwith the Coast Guard buoy tenders and lighthouses that kept them safe. \nPetit enlisted in the Coast Guard as a young man in 1926. He never \nmarried, and served faithfully in the Coast Guard for the next 20 \nyears. And we know that just before his final transfer to Scotch Cap, \nhe was quoted saying, ``I hope to serve at as many Coast Guard ships \nand stations as I can before I retire in ten years.'' We know that in \nthe end, he died doing the job he loved; keeping the light burning for \nthose in peril on the sea. And we know his life was not wasted, nor \nforgotten--and we celebrate the christening of the USCGC Anthony Petit \nthis 30th day of January, in the year of our Lord 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S928-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO RON AND BEVERLY GENDRON OF MANCHESTER ON THEIR RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

They are organizing a new social service \norganization in Laconia, New Hampshire. With the Gendrons' help, the \nOpen Arms Outreach Center of Laconia will be a ministry dedicated to \nproviding assistance to troubled families. Ronald and Beverly will work \nclosely with Laconia and State officials to offer housing and shelter \nin the Greater Laconia area.\n  Mr. President, the Gendrons have devoted their time and their hearts \nfor over ten years to serve the homeless and suffering in the Greater \nManchester Area. Ronald and Beverly served southern New Hampshire's \nneedy well.\n  I would like to extend my best wishes to them as they embark on their \nnew endeavor to assist in the lives of the needy in the Lakes Region of \nNew Hampshire.

Under the title, ``Wrecked Cars, On the Road Again,'' the \nPost writer detailed how easy it is for a person to unwittingly \npurchase a rebuilt salvage vehicle completely unaware of the car's \nprevious damage history.\n  At this time Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the January 8, 1999, article from The Washington Post.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 9, 1999]\n\n   Wrecked Cars, On the Road Again--Repaired U.S. Test Vehicles Pose \n                Safety Problems for Unsuspecting Owners\n\n                          (By Cindy Skrzycki)\n\n       The huge concrete barrier rolled down a track at 20 miles \n     an hour and smashed into the 1996 Mustang GT convertible. The \n     Mustang fishtailed, the windshield shattered and the side of \n     the car was heavily damaged.\n       This Mustang was essentially cannon fodder in a regular \n     series of safety tests conducted by the government--in this \n     case, to determine whether the fuel system would stay intact \n     in an accident. The car passed the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration test and, as usual, the Government \n     Services Administration sold it at an auction on July 2, \n     1997. Stamped at the bottom of the GSA's sales receipt: \n     ``Salvage Only--Not to be Titled for Highway Use (wrecked/\n     inoperable).''\n       So why did David Staber end up tooling around Cadott, Wis., \n     in the Mustang after paying $9,500 for it? And why did Daniel \n     Mencheski of Green Bay, Wis., sink $22,000 into a 1995 \n     Chevrolet Tahoe that had been rear-ended by a moving barrier \n     in another government test?\n       You have to go back to Arkansas, where investigators \n     believe a car salesman figured out how to doctor the bills of \n     sale from the GSA and pass the cars off as any other damaged \n     used car. In other words, cars sacrificed to the altar of \n     safety by the government are illegally finding their way back \n     to the street--where they constitute a safety hazard.\n       ``All of these cars have gone through some form of \n     destructive testing and have extensive to severe damage. \n     There's no assurance they could be repaired or meet safety \n     standards,'' said Philip Recht, deputy administrator of the \n     NHTSA, who called it ``the ultimate contradiction of our \n     mission and whole compliance program.''\n       It's a problem that happens all too often in the used car \n     business, in which unsuspecting buyers purchase cars with \n     ``washed'' titles that remove any warnings that the cars may \n     have been in accidents and sustained damages that would make \n     them junk in some states.\n       Bernard Brown, a Kansas City, Mo., lawyer who specializes \n     in car fraud, said there may be as many as a million vehicles \n     totaled, rebuilt and resold to unsuspecting consumers every \n     year.\n       The NHTSA case also highlights the patchwork of state laws \n     and requirements for obtaining a vehicle title that allow it \n     to be driven and considered safe.\n       ``We have handled cases of persons suffering severe \n     injuries in accidents caused by improperly rebuilt wrecks. We \n     have had experts examining large numbers of unsafe, rebuilt \n     wrecks. We have seen documentation on tens of thousands of \n     rebuilt, totaled\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\n     wrecks retitled by states with `clean titles' that show \n     nothing of the cars' salvage histories,'' Brown said.\n       Overall, since the inception of the crash-test program in \n     the 1970s, NHTSA has damaged 7,120 vehicles at four test \n     sites. No one has traced the history of all of those cars, \n     but there may be many more back in commerce, posing unknown \n     safety problems for their owners.\n       The agency alerted the Department of Transportation's \n     inspector general's office, which is handling the case.\n       Carfax Inc., a computerized vehicle-history service in \n     Fairfax, has been working with NHTSA to identify how many \n     cars and trucks are likely to have been fraudulently titled. \n     It reviewed the histories of 494 cars that NHTSA crashed from \n     1995 to 1998, coming up with the 25 that were repaired, \n     retitled, and sold to unsuspecting owners.\n       Carfax found another 67 that were retitled, but some of \n     those may be ``branded'' as salvage. That means they may be \n     driven in some states and, in others, they could be used only \n     for parts. Scott Fredericks, Carfax director of consumer \n     marketing, said it's likely that ``a goodly number [of the \n     67] are back on the road, which is a hazard to consumers.''\n       Legislation stipulates that funds from the GSA auction \n     sales be returned to NHTSA to help pay for more vehicles for \n     its crash-test programs, which cost $2.7 million in 1997. The \n     auctions raised about $290,000 in 1996 and nearly $570,000 in \n     1997.\n       In the case of the Mustang, the GSA sold it to Ben Still of \n     Century Auto Sales in Benton, Ark., who paid $5,037 by check. \n     Century Auto, in turn, sold the vehicle to a used car and \n     salvage dealer in Hortonville, Wis., with what appeared to be \n     a ``clean'' Arkansas title, according to documents acquired \n     by The Post. Still's name is on the GSA official receipt, \n     according to a copy obtained by the Post.\n       Investigators said the Wisconsin dealer then sold the car \n     for $9,500 to Staber, who took ownership on Nov. 6, 1997. The \n     Mustang had only 720 miles on the odometer.\n       Staber, who owns Cadott Auto Recyclers and buys as many as \n     500 damaged vehicles a year, said he spent another $8,000 to \n     repair and repaint the car, which retailed for about $28,500.\n       ``I know what I'm doing, but this one got me,'' said \n     Staber, who is suing the Wisconsin dealer from whom he bought \n     the car. ``I saw the title and I never suspected the fraud. I \n     don't like losing $18,000. I work too hard for my money.''\n       Mencheski's Tahoe also was bought from a GSA auction by the \n     same Arkansas dealer for $6,678, according to the receipt \n     from the auction sale. It then took a circuitous route \n     through northern Michigan before reaching Green Bay, Wis., \n     where Mencheski bought it.\n       The vehicle now sits in Mencheski's driveway without a \n     title and is undrivable. Mencheski said it will cost him $400 \n     a month in loan payments for the next six years; he borrowed \n     against his 401(k) retirement account to buy a used minivan \n     to replace the useless sport-utility vehicle.\n       He, too, is suing the dealers who handled the Tahoe before \n     he bought it.\n       ``I wanted one with a clean title,'' said Mencheski, who is \n     a lineman for Wisconsin Electric Power Co. ``It had less than \n     100 miles on it.''\n       Here's how the process worked: Over time, investigators \n     said, Century Auto made 13 purchases at GSA auctions. Century \n     Auto then sold three of those cars--Staber's Mustang, another \n     Mustang and Mencheski's Tahoe--to Michael Schmidt, president \n     of Schmidt's New London Auto Salvage Inc. in Hortonville. \n     Those transactions are documented in the official paper trail \n     that followed the cars from the auctions to titling in \n     Wisconsin.\n       ``Our investigation indicates Century Sales fraudulently \n     obtained an Arkansas clean title, number 9720521491, on July \n     24, 1997, by submitting a fictitious GSA purchaser's receipt \n     and authority to release property. The document submitted did \n     not have the language that was on the original document,'' \n     said a letter that the Wisconsin Department of Transportation \n     sent to Staber. Mencheski got a similar letter.\n       The warning on the bottom of the receipt saying the car was \n     for salvage only had been erased.\n       Investigators believe Century Auto made up ``new'' GSA \n     bills of sale, excluding the warning. At the bottom of those, \n     the company allegedly stated the make, model year, the \n     vehicle identification number and odometer reading. A few \n     signatures and dates also were altered, the receipts show.\n       Still did not return phone calls. His lawyer in Little Rock \n     had no comment.\n       What apparently happened next was that Still or his \n     associates took the ``clean'' sales receipts to get Arkansas \n     titles for the cars--and got them with no problem.\n       Roger Duren, of the Arkansas Office of Motor Vehicles, said \n     either the GSA bill of sale or another government form known \n     as ``Certificate to Obtain Title to Vehicle,'' which \n     transfers a vehicle from government ownership to the auction \n     buyer, is acceptable.\n       The title certificate is supposed to be stamped by GSA \n     ``Not to be Titled for Highway Use'' and would have been a \n     flag to state examiners. In the case of the Mustang, at \n     least, the form mistakenly did not carry that warning, GSA \n     officials said, and Still or his associates did not present \n     that form.\n       Still--in Arkansas--then told Schmidt he had three cars \n     with collision damage that were drivable, Schmidt said. Still \n     advised that they would go fast. He wanted the money in \n     advance, sight unseen. He promised clean Arkansas titles, \n     according to Schmidt.\n       ``As soon as we saw them, we knew they were crash-test \n     stuff,'' said Schmidt. But the titles didn't arrive until \n     Schmidt agreed to sign ``as is'' forms and accept the cars, \n     Schmidt said that when Still wouldn't take them back, he \n     decided to sell the Mustang and the Tahoe.\n       Schmidt sent the Mustang convertible to a salvage auction \n     in Appleton, Wis., and Staber was the high bidder. Schmidt \n     said he told Staber everything he knew about the Mustang. \n     ``At the time, I didn't know you couldn't drive a crash-test \n     car,'' he said.\n       The Tahoe was sold at a private salvage auction to a dealer \n     in Michigan, who took it to a repair shop in Green Bay owned \n     by Mencheski's brother-in-law. The brother-in-law thought the \n     Tahoe would be just the four-wheel-drive his sister and her \n     husband were looking for.\n       The other vehicle bought by Schmidt was a Mustang coupe, \n     which he sold for parts.\n       ``So, who should be at fault? I'm just the guy in the \n     middle,'' said Schmidt, who believes the blame lies with \n     ``the people who issue the titles.''\n       As for Still, investigators are looking at whether he \n     forged the signature of a federal official, altered a federal \n     document and gave false information to the Arkansas Office of \n     Motor Vehicles.\n       Staber and NHTSA learned about the Mustang's unlawful title \n     when Staber had transmission problems and took the Mustang to \n     Jim Carter Ford in Eau Claire, Wis. Ford Motor Co. checked \n     the vehicle identification number and found it was a NHTSA \n     test vehicle, which voided the warranty coverage, according \n     to documents from the investigation.\n       A month later, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation \n     told Staber he was driving a fraudulently titled government \n     test vehicle.\n       In the wake of the discovery, NHTSA has alerted consumers \n     on its World Wide Web site to vehicles that have been in the \n     crash-test program for the years 1996 through 1998.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In this case, the vehicle had been totaled as part of a \ngovernment crash test. After being demolished by the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the vehicle, which the Post \ncalled ``cannon fodder,'' was sold at an auto auction. It was then \nrebuilt and sold to a used car buyer in Wisconsin who had no way of \nknowing that he purchased a crash test car. Apparently, as the article \nsuggests, he is not alone. There may be thousands of government crashed \nvehicles that have been returned to the road for normal highway \ndriving. Think about that. Thousands of NHTSA crash-tested cars back on \nAmerica's roads and highways.\n  This consumer, like millions of other used-car purchasers across the \ncountry, fell victim to the fraudulent practice known as ``title \nwashing.'' In the Wisconsin case, a clean title was easily obtained \nbearing no indication of the vehicle's previous damage history. Since \nthe vehicle's checkered past was concealed, the buyer ended-up paying \nthousands of dollars for a structurally unsafe car that posed a threat \nnot only to his well-being, but to the safety of everyone with whom he \nshares the road.\n  Mr. President, during the last Congress, Senator Wendell Ford (D-\nKy.), and I co-authored The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Protection \nAct to begin closing the dangerous loopholes that allow unscrupulous \nrebuilders to take advantage of used car consumers. The Act would have \ndramatically improved public disclosure by requiring that totaled \nvehicles be designated ``salvage vehicles.'' It also required that \nrebuilt salvage vehicles be inspected to ensure that stolen parts were \nnot used in the repair. Additionally, ``rebuilt salvage vehicles'' \nwould have a decal permanently affixed to the driver's side door jamb. \nThe bill also contained a provision requiring all previous brands on a \nvehicle to be carried forward to each state retitling the vehicle.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the practice of selling rebuilt salvage \nvehicles as undamaged used cars costs consumers and the auto industry \nnearly $4 billion annually. It is estimated that every year, as many as \none million vehicles are ``totaled,'' rebuilt, and placed back into \nused car commerce. In some states, as many as 70 percent of all \n``totaled'' vehicles may return to the roads after being purchased by \nunsuspecting citizens. While most states require some type of \ndisclosure on a vehicle's title to indicate its history, the \nrequirements vary from state to state, and it is the resulting \nhodgepodge of conflicting state laws that allows dishonest rebuilders \nto obtain ``clean'' titles.\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\n  When a title has been laundered, all future purchasers are deprived \nof important information alerting them to potential problems with the \nvehicle. These later buyers may include private purchasers or \nautomobile dealers. Dealers typically purchase used vehicles from \nauctions and from their customers as trade-ins, and then sell them to \nused car consumers. In such cases, both parties are victims.\n  Congress acted on this problem by adopting legislation in 1992 \ndirecting the creation of a task force to examine the problems \nassociated with salvage vehicles. The task force included a diverse \ngroup of stakeholders who concluded that the lack of uniformity in \nstate laws allows unscrupulous rebuilders to easily wash titles and to \nsubsequently sell rebuilt vehicles as undamaged. It also noted that \nrebuilt vehicles could be a risk to the driving public. Among the task \nforce's recommendations was the development of federal legislation to \ncreate uniform definitions and procedures for titling salvage vehicles.\n  The National Salvage Motor Vehicle Protection Act was based largely \non the task force's recommendations. I do not want the recommendations \nof a federal task force to collect dust. All too often, Congress does \nnot follow through with the recommendations of commissions it creates. \nHere is one of those instances where Congress wants to implement them--\na majority of both chambers want to enact them. A widely diverse \nbipartisan group.\n  This much needed legislation received the formal support of 57 \nSenators, including the distinguished Minority Leader, Tom Daschle, \nSenator McCain, Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Harry Reid, and \nother colleagues from both sides of the aisle. It also garnered broad \nbipartisan support in the House of Representatives which approved \nsimilar title branding legislation by a vote of 333 to 72. Even though \nthis non-partisan consumer-friendly legislation was widely supported by \nboth chambers of Congress, it fell victim to a steady stream of \nmisrepresentation. Throughout the legislative process in both chambers, \na number of significant changes were made to address the concerns of \nstate attorneys general and consumer groups. Unfortunately, even after \nthese changes were adopted, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, a direct contributor to this national problem, opposed \nthis modest but important bill as a bargaining chip for its own agenda.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to reintroduce auto salvage \nlegislation during this session. I have given NHTSA the opportunity to \nreview and comment on the proposed bill. I welcome NHTSA's input and I \nam hopeful that the Administration will join with us, and the American \nAssociation of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the experts on titling \nmatters, to foster national uniform titling requirements.\n  It is time to put politics aside to protect the public from the \npractice of title washing and the greed of dishonest \nrebuilders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/22/senate-section/article/S929-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR SATURDAY, JANUARY 23, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
