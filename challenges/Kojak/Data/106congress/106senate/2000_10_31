Today the \nSenate will agree by unanimous consent to the continuing resolution \nthat funds the Government until tomorrow.\n  As a reminder, cloture was filed on the bankruptcy bill yesterday, \nand that vote will occur tomorrow morning possibly around 9:30 a.m. A \nvote on a continuing resolution will also take place during Wednesday's \nsession.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, the acting \nleader today, that, of course, we are very disappointed that the \ntremendous work done by all the participants, Republicans and \nDemocrats, Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Harkin--it was a \nbipartisan effort--yesterday morning we had an agreement on the very \nimportant Labor-HHS bill. As a result of the actions of the whip of the \nHouse, Tom DeLay, that bill fell through. It was a terrible \ndisappointment for everybody. We hope that there is a way to complete \naction on these bills. Each day that goes by, I become less encouraged, \nbut I hope that something can be worked out.\n  Yesterday, we had the makings of a very important compromise. I am \ndisappointed that it fell through.\n  Mr. President, we are going into, as has already been announced by \nSenator Grassley, 4 hours of morning business. On this side, we have 2 \nhours, or whatever part thereof remains from the brief statements of \nSenator Grassley and I. The time was basically set aside for Senator \nWellstone. He has another issue that he wants to speak about; namely, \nbankruptcy. But he graciously has consented to allowing Senators Boxer, \nBaucus, Dorgan, Durbin, and Harkin to have 5 minutes each during his \ntime.\n  I personally express my appreciation to the Senator from Minnesota \nfor allowing these Senators to speak. I again say that it is too bad we \nare not completing all of our work here today rather than figuring out \nsome way to get out of town in the next few days.\n  So I would ask unanimous consent that those people--Senators Boxer, \nBaucus, Dorgan, Durbin, and Harkin--be allowed 5 minutes each during \nthe time of morning business today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Mike Mansfield, Scoop Jackson, Richard \nRussell, Russell Long, Lyndon Johnson, Lloyd Bentsen, Bob Dole, John \nChafee, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who are these men? They were the \ngiants in the Senate in the quarter of a century before and after our \nbicentennial. They are the models to whom we all aspire. They are the \nmost recent generation of statesmen who helped lead our nation to the \ngreatness of today.\n  I was elected to the Senate 2 years after Pat Moynihan entered this \nbody. I have had the honor, the pleasure, and the privilege of serving \nwith Pat Moynihan for 22 years.\n  In fact, I have spent two-thirds of my adult life working with Pat \nMoynihan--watching this intellectual giant, listening to this scholar \nand visionary, learning from this teacher, this social critic, this \npolitical master.\n  Who is Pat Moynihan? University professor, diplomat, Cabinet \nSecretary, fighter of poverty, social analyst, distinguished and \nprolific author, defender of worker rights everywhere, U.S. Senator, \nmentor, humanist, citizen, friend.\n  Pat published his first book in 1963. ``Beyond the Melting Pot'' \nlooked at minority groups in New York City. Its conclusion was that the \nprevailing assumption at the time was wrong, that assumption being that \nminorities assimilated into the broader American culture.\n  Pat wrote his most recent book in 1998. ``Secrecy, the American \nExperience'' explained how secrecy in government deformed American \nvalues in the 20th century.\n  In between, he authored 16 other books--believe it or not; 16--on \nsubjects that included poverty, family, ethnicity, and social policy.\n  In 1963, with ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' Pat was at the cutting \nedge, as we were beginning to struggle more honestly with the problems \nof minority groups in this country. Thirty-five years later, with the \npublication of ``Secrecy, the American Experience,'' Pat is still at \nthe cutting edge.\n  We are struggling to transform our institutions away from a culture \nthat fought the cold war to a culture where the Internet thrives. \nOpenness and transparency are valued again, and information is \ndecentralized, distributed, and widely available.\n  During those intervening three and a half decades, Pat was always at \nthe cutting edge in forcing us to rethink our fundamental assumptions \nabout poverty, family, Social Security, ethnicity, and a wide range of \ndomestic and global issues.\n  One area where Pat has made an enormous contribution to bettering our \nsociety--and yet is little recognized for it--is public architecture. \nHe was one of the driving forces--in fact, the major driving force--to \nrenovate Pennsylvania Avenue, to complete the Navy Memorial, Pershing \nPark, the Ronald Reagan Building, the restoration of Union Station, and \nthe Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building.\n  We, and our descendants, who visit our Nation's capital will have our \nlives enriched because of Pat Moynihan's vision.\n  Let me conclude with a quotation from Pat. In 1976, he said: ``The \nsingle most exciting thing you encounter in government is competence, \nbecause it's so rare.'' I would change that to read: ``The single most \nexciting thing you encounter in government is greatness, because it's \nso rare.'' And that exciting thing, that exciting person, that \ngreatness, for me, has been Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  There is no higher calling than public service. Pat Moynihan has been \nits embodiment for half a century.\n  We will all miss you, Pat, miss you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to make sure that the time I use \nnow does not come out of the Democrat time. So it will come out of the \nRepublican time. And the Democrat time should be extended beyond 4 \no'clock by the amount of time I speak.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Kennedy and I introduced this bill in March of this \nyear. Representatives Sessions and Waxman introduced the companion bill \nin the House of Representatives in August. It is a strongly bipartisan \nbill. There are 77 Senate cosponsors and 139 House cosponsors. This \nbill will make life easier for working American parents caring for a \nchild with a severe disability.\n  Shortly after introducing this bill, I worked in a bipartisan way to \nsecure a budget reserve fund in the budget resolution. Subsequently, \nthe Senate Budget Committee convened a hearing on the bill. Then, in \nJuly, the President announced his support for the bill.\n  Logic would tell us that a bill with this kind of bipartisan support \nwould stand a good chance of being approved by the Congress. \nUnfortunately, this bill is not among the final, end-of-year \nlegislative packages. One likely explanation is that the families who \nwould be helped by this bill do not have the same kind of political \ninfluence and clout that other powerful interest groups have. Working \nparents are not a powerful voice in Washington, even though they have \nevery legitimate right to be a powerful voice in Washington.\n  Interestingly, today the bill was discussed on the House floor by a \nvery powerful Member of the House of Representatives. The distinguished \nHouse Member was under the impression that the Family Opportunity Act \nis primarily a Democratic bill. In fact, the Family Opportunity Act has \nbroad bipartisan support. In addition, it is based on strongly held \nRepublican principles.\n  The Family Opportunity Act is, No. 1, pro-family, No. 2, pro-work, \nNo. 3, pro-opportunity and, No. 4, pro-States rights.\n  Pro-family. When you are a parent, your main objective is to provide \nfor your child to the best of your ability. Right now, our Federal \nGovernment takes this goal and turns it upside down for parents of \nchildren with special health care needs. In the worst cases, parents \ngive up custody of their child with special health care needs or put \ntheir child in an out-of-home placement just to keep their child's \naccess to Medicaid-covered services.\n  Pro-work. Federal policies today force these parents to choose \nbetween work and their children's health care. That is a terrible \nchoice.\n  Many parents of children with disabilities refuse jobs, pay raises, \nand overtime just to preserve access to Medicaid for their child with \ndisabilities. Thousands of families across the country are caught in \nthis Catch-22.\n  Pro-opportunity. The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 was created to \nhelp parents have the opportunities they deserve. It does so by \nproviding parents the opportunity to work without the fear of harming \ntheir children. Allowing parents to break free from constraints that \nforce many of them to stay impoverished is a win-win. Parents who work \nare also taxpayers. That's good for the government and the economy. \nAnd, parents who work are better able to provide for their families. \nThat's good for children.\n  Pro-States rights. Governor Huckabee from Arkansas said it best at \nthe Senate Budget Committee hearing I chaired in July. He said:\n\n       The Family Opportunity Act encourages progress for the \n     family and places government on the side of the people where \n     it should be. No child and no family should be the victim of \n     a process which conspires against the very foundational \n     principles on which we have existed for over 200 years. This \n     Act will restore principled leadership from all of us as \n     leaders who rightly see our roles as servants of the \n     citizens, not the other way around.\n\n  I can't emphasize strongly enough how important a bill like the \nFamily Opportunity Act is to working families across America. Everybody \nwants to use their talents to the fullest potential, and every parent \nwants to provide as much as possible for his or her children. The \ngovernment shouldn't get in the way.\n  If this bill is allowed to die, that would be a missed opportunity of \nthe highest level. I urge my colleagues to reconsider its status.\n  Winston Churchill once said:\n\n       Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never--\n     in nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in \n     except to convictions of honor and good sense.\n\n  Legislation to help families help themselves make good sense.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, I thank Senator Grassley. I very much \nappreciate his effort, with Senator Kennedy. He does not give in, \nespecially when it is a matter of principle to him. I thank him for his \ngood work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11385-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11385-S11395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as of today, we are scheduled to have a \ncloture vote tomorrow. It is going to be on the bankruptcy conference \nreport. One would think that in the final days of this Congress--of \nthis Senate--we actually would be talking about debating and passing \nlegislation that would promote the economic security of families in our \ncountry.\n  We could focus on health security for families. We could focus on \nraising the minimum wage. We could focus on affordable child care. We \ncould focus on affordable housing. We could focus on reauthorizing the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Thank God people in the country \nare so focused on a good education for their children or their \ngrandchildren.\n  Instead, we are spending our final days debating an unjust and \nimbalanced bankruptcy bill which is entirely for the benefit of big \nbanks and the credit card companies. In one way, I am very sad to say \nthis piece of legislation is truly representative of the 106th \nCongress. It is an anti-consumer, giveaway-to-big-business bill, in a \nCongress which has been dominated by special interest legislation. And \nit is representative of the 106th Congress in another way, too: It \nrepresents distorted priorities. We could be doing so much to enhance \nand support ordinary citizens in our country. Instead, we now have this \nlegislation before us.\n  I want Senators to know, if they are watching, I will, as they come \nto the floor, interrupt my remarks so others can speak in opposition. \nWe have a lot of ground to cover. We intend to cover that ground \nbecause this piece of legislation deserves scrutiny. It should be held \nup to the light of day so citizens in this country can see what an ill-\nmade, mishandled attempt this piece of legislation is. Other Senators \nneed to understand what bad legislation this is, how terrible its \nimpact will be on America's most powerless families, and what a \ncomplete giveaway it is to banks, credit card companies, and other \npowerful interests.\n  This is a worse bill than the bill we voted on earlier in the Senate. \nIt is important for colleagues to understand that not only is this a \nworse piece of legislation, we had a provision in the bill that passed \nthe Senate--albeit a flawed bill--the Kohl amendment, which said that \nwhile we are punishing low- and moderate-income people, families that \nhave gone under because of bankruptcy, in 40 percent or 50 percent of \nthe cases because of medical bills, you certainly don't want to enable \nmillionaires to basically buy million-dollar homes in several States \nand in that way shield themselves from any liability. That provision \nwas taken out. That is reason enough for Senators to vote against this \nbill.\n  In addition, Senator Schumer had a provision that said, when people \nare breaking the law and blocking people from being able to go to \nfamily planning clinics, they should not be able to shield themselves \nfrom legal expenses and other expenses by not being held liable when it \ncomes to bankruptcy. The Schumer provision was taken out.\n  If that is not enough for Senators, the way in which the majority \nleader has advanced this bill makes a mockery out of the legislative \nprocess. If we love this institution and we believe in an open, public, \nand accountable legislative and political process, then I don't see how \nwe can support taking a State Department conference report--I call it \nthe ``invasion of the body snatchers''--completely gutting that so \nthere is not a word about the State Department any longer and, instead, \nputting in this bankruptcy bill, far worse than the bill passed by the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\n  I see Senator Durbin on the floor. I can conclude in 5 minutes, if he \nis here to speak on this.\n  I will summarize reasons for opposing this conference report and then \ncome back a little later on and develop each of these arguments.\n  First, the legislation rests on faulty premises. The bill addresses a \ncrisis that does not exist. Increased filings are being used as an \nexcuse to harshly restrict bankruptcy protection, but the filings have \nactually fallen sharply in the last 2 years. Additionally, the bill is \nbased on the myth that the stigma of bankruptcy has declined. Not true. \nI will develop that argument later on.\n  Second, abusive filers are a tiny minority. Bill proponents cite the \nneed to curb ``abusive filings'' as a reason to harshly restrict \nbankruptcy protection, but the American Bankruptcy Institute found that \nonly 3 percent of chapter 7 filers could have paid back more of their \ndebt. Even bill supporters acknowledge that, at most, 10 to 13 percent \nof the filers are abusive.\n  Third, the conference report falls heaviest on those who are most \nvulnerable. The harsh restrictions in this legislation will make \nbankruptcy less protective, more complicated, and expensive to file. \nThis will make it much more difficult for low- and moderate-income \ncitizens to have any protection. Unfortunately, the means tests and \nsafe harbor will not shield from the majority of these provisions and \nhave been written in such a way that they will capture many debtors who \ntruly have no ability to significantly pay off this debt and therefore \nwill be in servitude for the rest of their lives.\n  Fourth of all, the bankruptcy code is a critical safety net for \nAmerica's middle class. Low- and moderate-income families, especially \nsingle parent families, are those who are most in need to make a fresh \nstart--the fresh start provided by bankruptcy protection. The bill will \nmake it very difficult for these families to get out of crushing debt. \nAgain, in 40 percent of the cases, these are families who have gone \nunder because of a medical bill.\n  Fifth of all, the banking and credit card industry gets a free ride. \nThe bill as drafted gives a free ride to banks and credit card \ncompanies that deserve much of the claim for the bankruptcy filings in \nthe first place, and the lenders should not be rewarded for this \nreckless lending.\n  Sixth of all, this legislation actually might increase the number of \nbankruptcies and defaults. Several economists have suggested that \nrestricting access to bankruptcy protection will actually increase the \nnumber of filings and defaults because banks and these credit card \ncompanies will be even more willing to lend money to marginal \ncandidates.\n  Seventh of all, the conference report, again, is worse than the \nSenate bill. We had a very reasonable provision; It was the Kohl \namendment, which said, if you are going to go after women, and go after \nworking families, and go after low- and moderate-income people, and go \nafter families who are in debt because of a medical bill that is \nputting them under, then at least make sure you are not going to have \nwealthy Americans who are going to be able to go to several States and \nbuy homes worth millions of dollars and shield themselves from any \nliability. That provision is knocked out.\n  This is a worse bill than that passed in the Senate. The Schumer \namendment, again, said if people are blocking people from family \nplanning services, they have broken the law; they ought not to be able \nto shield expenses they incurred from liability when it comes to \nbankruptcy. The Schumer amendment was taken out.\n  Finally, I say this one more time. This is a larger issue than \nbankruptcy reform. It is a question of the fundamental integrity of the \nSenate as a legislative body. Not one provision of the original State \nDepartment authorization bill, aside from the bill number, remains part \nof this legislation. To replace in totality a piece of legislation with \na wholly new and unrelated bill in conference takes the Congress one \nstep closer to a virtual tricameral legislature--House, Senate, and \nconference committee. If you believe in the integrity of this \nlegislative process, and if you believe we all ought to be in a \nposition to be good legislators, you should vote against this cloture \nmotion on those grounds alone.\n  I conclude this way. Other colleagues are on the floor. I will \ndevelop these arguments later on. At one point in time, the argument \nwas suggested that only a tiny minority opposed this bill. Well, when I \nlook at the opposition of labor unions, and I look at the opposition of \nevery single consumer organization, and I look at the opposition from \nwomen and children's groups, and I look at the strong opposition from \nthe civil rights community and a good part of the religious community, \nand when I see letters signed by bankruptcy professors, the academic \ncommunity, judges, all the people who know this system well, who say \nthis piece of legislation is egregious--it is one sided: it is \nimbalanced; it is unjust; it is too harsh--I realize that this piece of \nlegislation should be stopped. I hope that tomorrow Senators, Democrats \nand Republicans, will oppose this on substantive grounds and also on \nthe basis of the way in which this has been done. The way in which this \nhas been done at the very end of this session is an affront to the \nintegrity of this process. No Senator should vote for cloture who \nbelieves in an open, honest process with real integrity.\n  Before I launch into my first point, Mr. President, I'd like to \nobserve that in July my friend from Iowa, the author of this bill, \nreferred to the opposition to this bill as the ``radical fringe.'' \nWell, I'm pretty proud of the company I'm keeping no matter now \ndismissive my colleague. Because you know what? The labor unions all \noppose this bill. The consumer groups all oppose this bill. The women \nand children's groups all oppose this bill. The civil rights groups all \noppose this bill and the many members of the religious community oppose \nthis bill. Indeed one of the broadest coalitions I have ever seen \nunited together opposes this so-called bankruptcy reform.\n  I would say to my colleagues, you can tell a lot about a person--or a \nbill--by who its friends are. But you can also tell a lot about a bill \nby who its enemies are. The radical fringe? I see millions of working \nfamilies who have nothing to gain and everything to lose under this \nlegislation.\n  Now, Mr. President, you have to give the proponents of this bill \ncredit for chutzpah: They still preach the urgent need for this \nlegislation despite the fact that nearly all the evidence points to the \ncontrary. In fact, in the months since the Senate passed bankruptcy \nreform, any pretense of necessity has evaporated. The number of \nbankruptcies has fallen steadily over the past year, charge offs on \ncredit card debt are down significantly and delinquencies have fallen \nto the lowest levels since 1995. Now proponents and opponents agree \nthat nearly all debtors resort to bankruptcy not to game the system but \nrather as a desperate measure of economic survival and that only a tiny \nminority of chapter 7 filers--as few as 3 percent--could afford any \ndebt repayment.\n  And I have to congratulate my friends on another point, because they \nhad almost convinced the Congress and the American public to view \nbankruptcy as a giant loophole for scam artists instead of a safety \nnet. A key part of this argument is the belief--wholly unsubstantiated \nas far as any objective observer call tell--that the high number of \nbankruptcies in the 1990's is a result of a decline in the stigma of \nbankruptcy. In fact, my friend from Iowa said in July that ``With high \nnumbers of bankruptcies occurring at a time when Americans are earning \nmore, the only logical conclusion is that some people are using \nbankruptcy as a way out.''\n  With all due respect, while that has been a common assertion on the \npart of the bill's proponents that's all it is: an assertion. Virtually \nnothing backs it up. Indeed it's an assertion that flies in the face of \nall evidence that bankruptcy remains a deeply embarrassing, difficult \nand humbling experience for the vast majority of the people who file. I \nthink my colleagues should actually talk to some folks who have filed \nfor bankruptcy. Ask them how it felt to tell their friends and family \nabout what they had to do, ask them how it felt to let down lenders to \nwhom they owed money. Ask them how they felt about telling their \nemployer.\n  In fact, it's a shame that when a group of my colleagues and I hosted \nsome of the debtors profiled in Time magazine expose of this \nlegislation--\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\n``Soaked by Congress''--the bill's proponents attacked the \ncredibility of the Time article but didn't bother to visit with Charles \nand Lisa Trapp, or Patricia Blake, or Diana Murray all who came to \nWashington to explain--from the perspective of people who have been \nthere--what it's like to file for bankruptcy and why they were driven \nby that extreme.\n\n  A review of the academic papers on bankruptcy suggests that the \nevidence for a decline in the stigma of bankruptcy is slim. This was \nthe conclusion of a September 2000 Congressional Budget Office report \nentitled ``Personal Bankruptcy: A Literature Review.'' In fact, CBO \nfound some objective evidence that argues that the stigma of bankruptcy \nis a strong deterrent to filing noting a study that showed that while \n18 percent of U.S. households could benefit from filing for bankruptcy, \nonly 0.7 percent did--suggesting that stigma might hold some back.\n  In the book, ``the Fragile Middle Class'' by Theresa Sullivan, \nElizabeth Warren and Jay Westerbrook--all academic bankruptcy experts--\nthe authors argue that the stigma remains:\n\n       Bankruptcy is, in many ways, where middle class values \n     crash into middle class fears. Bankruptcy debtors are \n     unlikely either to feel in charge of their destiny or to feel \n     confident about planning their future. Discharging debts that \n     were honestly incurred seems the antithesis of middle-class \n     morality. Public identification as a bankruptcy debtor is \n     embarrassing at best, devastating at worst. It is certainly \n     not respectable, even in a country with large numbers of \n     bankruptcies, to be bankrupt. Bankruptcy debtors have told us \n     of their efforts to conceal their bankruptcy. Arguments that \n     the stigma attached to bankruptcy has declined are typically \n     made by journalists who are unable to find any bankrupt \n     debtors willing to be interviewed for the record and by \n     prosperous economists who see bankruptcy as a great bargain.\n\n  Of course the stigma argument isn't new. As early as the 1920's then \nSolicitor General of the United States Thomas Thacher argued that \nAmericans were all too comfortable with filing for bankruptcy. Indeed, \nas David Moss notes in a 1999 American Bankruptcy Law Journal article, \nquote: ``those who today worry about declining stigma might be \nsurprised to learn that the stigma associated with bankruptcy had, \naccording to some observers, already disappeared by 1967.''\n  Of course there are other very logical explanations of why the filing \nrate in the 90's is quite high--they just aren't as convenient for the \nbig banks and credit card industry.\n  Mr. President, we know why people file for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is \nthe only solution for families who find their debt and the interest on \ntheir debt outstrips their income. The question is, why do families \nfind themselves in those circumstances? And when they do, what do we as \na society do to keep those families solvent. Or if we don't help them \nto remain solvent, how do we at least let them pick up the pieces, get \non with their lives, reenter productive society.\n  That's what this debate is about. That's exactly what's at stake in \nthis debate; the solvency of the middle class.\n  But, Mr. President, one not-so-small footnote that overshadows this \nwhole debate is the fact that the number of bankruptcy filings have \nbeen dropping like a stone for the past 2 years. My colleagues are \ndriving this heartless bill with talk of a bankruptcy ``crisis,'' a \ndramatic increase in the number of filings, but with all due respect \nthey are trying to scare us with yesterday's ghosts. A study released \non September 8 of last year by Professor Lawrence Ausubel of the \nUniversity of Maryland notes that the peak increase in bankruptcy \nfilings came and went in 1996. In fact, filings in 1998 were barely an \nincrease over 1997 and we now know that there were 112,000 fewer \nbankruptcies in 1999 that there were in 1998--a nearly 10 percent \ndecline. And the numbers so far have continued the sharp decline in \n2000.\n\n  We're being led to believe that it's the high number of bankrupts \nthat are driving this legislation. And do you know what? They are, but \nfor the wrong reasons. The credit card companies are counting on the \nUnited States Senate to overreact to the number of bankruptcies, they \nare counting on you to ignore their complicity in the huge debt burdens \non most American families, the financial services industry is counting \non the Congress to overlook the evidence that the bankruptcy crisis is \nself correcting. The problem may be abating, but they still want the \nfix to pad their profits. The high number of people filing for \nbankruptcy--most of whom have terrible circumstances that force them to \ndo so--are an excuse, not a justification.\n  Still, regardless of how many people file or why they file, my \ncolleagues continue to maintain that this bill is driven by necessity. \nTo do this they would track more debtors into chapter 13 instead of \nchapter 7 through the use of a means test. But again, their goal flies \nin the face of the evidence. First of all, we know through independent \nstudies of those who file for bankruptcy that only about 3 percent of \nall debtors who file for chapter 7 could afford to pay any of their \ndebts and that in 95 percent of chapter 7 filings there were no \nmeaningful assets to be liquidated to pay back creditors. This is in \nline with other evidence that nearly all debtors file for bankruptcy do \nso because of some sudden, drastic economic disruption which it often \ntakes years to recover from.\n  Bankruptcy does not occur in vacuum. We know that in the vast \nmajority of cases it is a drastic step taken by families in desperate \nfinancial circumstances and overburdened by debt. The main income \nearner may have lost his or her job. There may be sudden illness or a \nterrible accident requiring medical care. Certainly most Americans have \nfaced a time in their lives where they weren't sure where the next \nmortgage payment or credit card payment was going to come from, but \nsomehow they scrape by month to month. Still, such families are on the \nedge of a precipice and any new expense--a severely sick child, a car \nrepair bill--could send a family into financial ruin. Despite the \ncurrent economic expansion there are far too many working families in \nthis situation. That is the true story behind the high number of \nbankruptcy filings in recent years and I want to make clear to my \ncolleagues that the evidence shows that the very banks and credit card \ncompanies who are pushing this bill have a lot to do with why working \nfamilies are in this predicament today.\n  The bankruptcy system is supposed to allow a person to climb back up \nafter they've hit bottom, to have a fresh start. There is no point to \ncontinue to punish a person and a family once their resources are over \nmatched by debt. The bankruptcy system allows families to regroup, to \nfocus resources on essentials like their home, transportation and \nmeeting the needs of dependents. Sometimes the only way this can occur \nis to allow the debtor to be forgiven of some debt, and in most cases \nthis is debt that would never be repaid because of the debtor's \nfinancial circumstances.\n  The sponsors of this measure and the megabucks and credit card \ncompanies behind this bill don't like to focus on those situations. \nThey paint a picture of profligate abuse of the bankruptcy system by \nirresponsible debtors who could pay their debt but simply choose not \nto. Such people do take advantage of the system, there is no question. \nBut this bill casts a wider net and catches more than just the \nbankruptcy ``abusers.''\n  Again, a study done last year by the American Bankruptcy Institute \nfound that only 3 percent of debtors who file under chapter 7--where \ndebtors liquidate assets to repay some debt while the rest of the \ndebtor's unsecured debt is forgiven--would actually have been able to \npay more of their debt than they are required to under chapter 7. Even \nthe U.S. Justice Department found that the number of abusive claims was \nsomewhere between 3-13 percent. This means that the number of people \nfiling abusive bankruptcy claims is astonishingly low. But this \nlegislation seeks to channel many more debtors into chapter 13 \nbankruptcy--where the debtor enters a 3-5 year repayment plan and very \nlittle debt is forgiven. Yet in the pursuit of the few, this bill \nimposes onerous conditions, and ridiculous standards on all bankrupts \nalike. Additionally, under current law, 67 percent of the debtors in \nchapter 13 fail to complete their repayment plan often because they did \nnot get enough relief from loans, and because economic difficulties \ncontinued. So this legislation would take individuals, the majority of \nwhom desperately need a true fresh start, and\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\nforce them into a bankruptcy process which two-thirds of debtors \nalready fail to complete successfully. And my colleagues call this \nreform?\n  And yet when given the opportunity to target real, proven abuses by \nwealthy deadbeats and scofflaws, the sponsors took a pass. Again, Mr. \nPresident, the very small number of abusive filers are an excuse not a \njustification for this bill that falls most heavily on those most in \nneed of fresh start relief. This conference report does not match it's \nrhetoric.\n\n\n                   how the bill harms the vulnerable\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take some time to talk about the effect this \nbill will have on low- and middle-class debtors. Remember, nearly all \ndebtors file for bankruptcy are not wealthy scofflaws, but rather are \npeople in desperate economic circumstances who file as a last resort to \ntry and rebuild their finances, and, in many cases, end harassment by \ntheir creditors. And in particular I want to remind my colleagues of \nthe May 15, 2000, issue of Time magazine whose cover story on this so-\ncalled bankruptcy reform legislation was entitled ``Soaked by \nCongress.''\n  The article, written by reporters Dan Bartlett and Jim Steele, is a \ndetailed look at the true picture of who files for bankruptcy in \nAmerica. You will find it far different from the skewed version being \nused to justify this legislation. The article carefully documents how \nlow and middle income families--increasingly households headed by \nsingle women--will be denied the opportunity of a fresh start if this \npunitive legislation is enacted. As Brady Williamson, the chairman of \nthe National Bankruptcy Review Commission, notes in the article, the \nbankruptcy bill would condemn many working families to ``what \nessentially is a life term in debtor's prison.''\n  Now proponents of this legislation has tried to refute the Time \nmagazine article. Indeed during these final days of debate you will \nhear the bill's supporters claim that low and moderate income debtors \nwill be unaffected by this legislation. But colleagues, if you listen \ncarefully to their statements you will hear that they only claim that \nsuch debtors will not be affected by the bill's means tests. Not only \nis that claim demonstratably false--the means test and the safe harbor \nhave been written in a way that will capture many working families who \nare filing for chapter 7 relief in good faith--but it ignores the vast \nmajority of this legislation which will impose needless hurdles and \npunitive costs on all families who file for bankruptcy regardless of \ntheir income. Nor does the safe harbor apply to any of these \nprovisions.\n  Now, you might ask why the Congress has chosen to come down so hard \non ordinary working folk down on their luck. How is it that this bill \nis so skewed against their interest and in favor of big banks and \ncredit card companies? Well, maybe that's because these families don't \nhave million dollar lobbyists representing them before Congress. They \ndon't give hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money to the \nDemocratic and Republican parties. They don't spend their days hanging \noutside the Senate Chamber waiting to bend a members ear. Unfortunately \nit looks like the industry got to us first.\n\n  They may have lost a job, they may be struggling with a divorce, \nmaybe there are unexpected medical bills. But you know what? They're \nbusy trying to turn their lives around. And I think it's shameful that \nat the same time this story is unfolding for a million families across \nAmerica, Congress is poised to make it harder for them to turn it \naround. Who do we represent?\n  So Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes to explain exactly \nwhat the effects of this bill will be on real life debtors--the folks \nprofiled in the Time article. I hope the authors of the bill will come \nto the floor to debate on these points. There could be the opportunity \nfor some real discussion on an issue that has yet to be addressed by \nthe bill's supporters. Specifically, I challenge them to come to the \nfloor and explain to their colleagues how making bankruptcy relief \nharder and much more costly to achieve will benefit working families.\n\n\n                        Charles and Linda Trapp\n\n  Charles and Linda Trapp were forced into bankruptcy by medical \nproblems. Their daughter's medical treatment left them with medical \ndebts well over $100,000, as well as a number of credit card debts. \nBecause of her daughter's degenerative condition, Ms. Trapp had to \nleave her job as a letter carrier about 2 months before the bankruptcy \ncase was filed to manage her daughter's care. Before she left her job, \nthe family's annual income was about $83,000, or about $6,900 per \nmonth, so under the bill, close to that amount, about $6,200, the \naverage monthly income for the previous 6 months, would be deemed to be \ntheir current monthly income, even though their gross monthly income at \nthe time of filing was only $4,800. Based on this fictitious deemed \nincome, the Trapps would have been presumed to be abusing the \nBankruptcy Code, since their allowed expenses under the IRS guidelines \nand secured debt payments amounted to $5,339. The difference of about \n$850 per month would have been deemed available to pay unsecured debts \nand was over the $167 per month triggering a presumption of abuse. The \nTrapps would have had to submit detailed documentation to rebut this \npresumption, trying to show that their income should be adjusted \ndownward because of special circumstances and that there was no \nreasonable alternative to Ms. Trapp leaving her job.\n  Because their current monthly income, although fictitious, was over \nthe median income, the family would have been subject to motions for \nabuse filed by creditors, who might argue that Ms. Trapp should not \nhave left her job, and that the Trapps should have tried to pay their \ndebts in chapter 13. They also would not have been protected by the \nsafe harbor. The Trapps would have had to pay their attorney to defend \nsuch motions and if they could not have afforded the thousand dollars \nor more that this would have cost, their case would have been dismissed \nand they would have received no bankruptcy relief. If they prevailed on \nthe motion, it is very unlikely they could recover attorney's fees from \na creditor who brought the motion, since recovery of fees is permitted \nonly if the creditor's motion was frivolous and could not arguably be \nsupported by any reasonable interpretation of the law (a much weaker \nstandard than the original Senate bill). Because the means test is so \nvague and ambiguous, any creditor could argue that it was simply making \na good faith attempt to apply the means test, which after all created a \npresumption of abuse.\n\n  Of course, young Annelise Trapp's medical problems continue and are \nonly getting worse. Under current law, if the Trapps again amass \nmedical and other debts they can't pay, they could seek refuge in \nchapter 13, where they would be required to pay all that they could \nafford. Under the new bill, the Trapps could not file a chapter 13 case \nfor five years. Even then, their payments would be determined by the \nIRS expense standards and they would have to stay in their plan for 5 \nyears, rather than the 3 years required to current law. The time for \nfiling a new chapter 7 would also be increased by the bill from 6 years \nto 8 years.\n\n\n                              Lucy Garcia\n\n  Lucy Garcia was on the verge of eviction from her apartment when she \nwent to her bankruptcy attorney. As described in Time, after she \nseparated from her husband, it was difficult to make ends meet and she \nfell behind on her rent. When she filed her bankruptcy case, the \nautomatic stay prevented her eviction temporarily. In that time, she \nreceived her tax refund and was able to catch up in her rent and thus \nprevent the eviction. Under the bill now before the Senate, Ms. Garcia \nand her two children would have become homeless, because there would \nhave been no automatic stay of their eviction.\n  Depending on how the means test is interpreted (and there are \nnumerous ambiguities that will lead to widespread litigation that most \nconsumer debtors cannot afford), Ms. Garcia might not even be allowed \nto file a chapter 7 case under the bill. For food, clothing, \nhousekeeping supplies, personal care items and services, and \nmiscellaneous she would be allowed to spend $863 per month and she \nactually spends $1,191. The deemed surplus of $328 multiplied by 60 is \nmore than $6,000 and more than 25 percent of her debt and therefore her \ncase could be deemed an abuse of chapter 7.\n  The IRS budget used by the means test only allows $4.93 a day for \nfood per\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\nperson. No one could properly feed a child for $4.93, a day let alone \nan adult, especially in New York City where Ms. Garcia lives. The food \nbudget for three people like Lucy's family with gross income of $2,600 \na month is $444 per month according to the IRS website. The amount \nallowed for food for lower income families is even less, as low as \n$3.02 a day per person. under the bill, the trustees in all cases will \nbe required to use the means test even if the debtor's income is under \nthe national median as in this case. (Apparently, the credit industry \nis trying to confuse Senators by confusing two different sections of \nthe bill. Credit card lobbyists mislead by telling Senators the means \ntest does not apply if the income is below the median income in a case \nlike Ms. Garcia's. This is false. The language of the bill says \ncreditors cannot challenge cases if the income is below the median, but \nunder the section about trustee duties the trustee must apply the means \ntest whether the creditor challenges the case or not.)\n  Ms. Garcia barely had the money to pay her attorney when she filed \nher bankruptcy case. She still barely has enough to meet expenses. She \ncertainly would not have had the funds to defend against a motion filed \nunder the means test. She would not have been able to afford the \nadditional filing fees in the bill, combined with the additional \nattorney's fees that the bill will cause due to the substantial \nadditional paperwork requirements.\n  Because she did not have all of the bills she had received in the \nlast 90 days before bankruptcy, her attorney would have had to spend \nsignificant time trying to determine the addresses at which creditors \nmight ``wish to receive correspondence'' as required by the bill, \nand might not have been able to give notice to some creditors that \nwould be deemed ``effective'' under the bill. These creditors would \nthen be free to continue to harass Ms. Garcia even after she filed her \nbankruptcy petition.\n\n  Ms. Garcia would also have been required to give up her television in \nwhich Sears claimed a security interest, since there was no room in her \nbudget for payments to redeem (with payment of the retail value \nrequired by the bill) or reaffirm the debt. With two children, ages 6 \nand 9, loss of her television would have been a real hardship.\n\n\n                              allen smith\n\n  Allen Smith is a resident of Delaware, which has no homestead \nexemption. In other words, he cannot shield his home from his \ncreditors. Ironically, under this bill, wealthy scofflaws can shield \nmultimillion dollar mansions from their creditors with a little \nplanning, but not Mr. Smith. As a result when the tragic medical \nproblems described in the Time article befell his family, he could not \nfile a chapter 7 case without losing his home. Instead he filed a \nchapter 13 case, which required substantial payments in addition to his \nregular mortgage payments for him to save his home. Ultimately, after \nhis wife passed away and he himself was hospitalized he was unable to \nmake all these payments and his chapter 13 plan failed. Had Delaware \nhad a reasonable homestead exemption, and had Mr. Smith been able to \nsimply file a chapter 7 case to eliminate his other debts, he might \nhave been able to save his home.\n  Mr. Smith's financial deterioration was caused by unavoidable medical \nproblems. Before he thought about bankruptcy he went to consumer credit \ncounseling to try to deal with his debts. However, it appears that he \nwent to consumer credit counseling just over 180 days before the case \nwas filed, and he did not receive a briefing, so the new bill would \nhave required him to go again. This would have been very difficult, \nconsidering his medical problems. In fact, his attorney, demonstrating \ndedication to clients that sharply contrasts with the creditor \npropaganda picture of bankruptcy lawyers just out to make a buck, made \nseveral home visits to Mr. Smith and his wife, who was a double \namputee.\n  The new bill would also have required a great deal of additional time \nand expense for Mr. Smith and his attorney, through new paperwork \nrequirements and a requirement that he attend a credit education \ncourse. Such a course would have done nothing to prevent the enormous \nmedical problems suffered by Mr. Smith and his wife. He did not get in \nfinancial trouble through failure to manage his money. He is 73 years \nold and had never before had debt problems. The bill makes no \nexceptions for people who cannot attend the course due to exigent \ncircumstances, so Mr. Smith might never have been able to get any \nrelief in bankruptcy under the new law.\n  Under the new bill, Mr. Smith would also have had to give up his \ntelevision and VCR to Sears, which claimed a security interest in the \nitems. Under the bill, he would not be permitted to retain possession \nof these items in chapter 7 unless he reaffirms the debt or redeemed \nthe items. Sears may demand reaffirmation of its entire $3,000 debt \nunder the bill, and to redeem Mr. Smith would have to pay their retail \nvalue. After his wife died and her income was gone, Mr. Smith did not \nhave the money to pay these amounts to Sears. Since he is largely \nhomebound, loss of these items would have been devastating.\n  Sadly, Mr. Smith's medical problems continue. Under current law, if \nhe again amasses medical and other debts he can't pay, he could seek \nrefuge in chapter 13, where he would be required to pay all that he can \nafford. Under the new bill, Mr, Smith cannot file a chapter 13 case for \n5 years (until he is 78 years old). The time for filing a new chapter \n7 has also been increased, from 6 years to 8 years.\n\n\n                              maxean bowen\n\n  Maxean Bowen's case shows how every single bankruptcy debtor would be \nimpacted by the bill. She didn't have the money to pay her bankruptcy \nattorney and had to get it from relatives. With the increased costs for \npaperwork, obtaining tax records and taking a credit education course, \nit is not clear that Ms. Bowen would even have been able to afford \nbankruptcy relief. Her debt problems stemmed from a disability that \ncaused her to be unable to work at her job, reducing her income to $800 \nper month for herself and her 11-year-old daughter. Thus, her situation \nwas not a result of mismanaging her credit, and a credit education \ncourse would not have prevented it. Nonetheless, unless she could find \nthe money to pay for such a course, she could get no bankruptcy relief \nunder the bill.\n\n\n                       chapter 13 made unworkable\n\n  Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about cross purposes in \nthis bankruptcy measure because it highlights a fundamental reality \nabout this legislation: it has become larded up with special interest \nprovisions which not only hurt middle class consumers but also \ncompletely undermine the ostensible purpose of the legislation: to \ntrack more debtors into chapter 13 where they repay their creditors.\n  Now, again, to repeat what I've stated earlier, I think this is a \nquestionable premise to begin with. After all, under current law--where \ndebtors are allowed to choose which chapter of the code to file under--\n67 percent of the debtors in chapter 13 fail to complete their \nrepayment plan often because they did not get enough relief from loans, \nand because economic difficulties continued. So this legislation would \ntake individuals, the majority of whom desperately need a true ``fresh \nstar'', and force them into a bankruptcy process which \\2/3\\ of debtors \nalready fail to complete successfully. And this is what my colleagues \ncall reform.\n  But I say to my colleagues, this legislation will make chapter 13 \nunworkable for many more debtors and will likely reduce the number of \nchapter 13 cases. In fact, the U.S. Trustees have estimated that one \npiece of this bill alone--the restriction on ``cramdown'' will reduce \nthe number of chapter 13 cases by 20 percent.\n  How would this happen? Well, ``cramdown'' refers to how certain \nsecured debt--like an auto loan--is valued during bankruptcy. Remember, \nsecured debt is made up of loans that are attached to some physical \nproperty the lender can repossess, such as a car. Under current law, if \na debtors owes more on a car than it is worth, the amount she must \nrepay to keep her car is equal to the current value of the car not the \namount of the loan left unpaid. This is fair to the lender because it \nensures that the lender gets repaid the same amount that it would get \nif it repossessed and sold the vehicle. The rest of the loan doesn't \njust go away, but it gets classified as unsecured debt--like credit \ncard debt--which is less likely to be repaid.\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\n  But under this conference agreement, the debtor must pay back the \nfull value of the loan to keep her car. This will force debtors to pay \nmore debt in chapter 13 cases, will cause more chapter 13 debtors to \nlose their cars--and jeopardize their ability to get to their job. Does \nit make sense to make chapter 13 harder to complete if \\2/3\\ of the \ncases fail already? In addition, the ability to cramdown debt is one of \nthe major attractions of filing under chapter 13, so the effect of this \nprovision of the bill will be to discourage debtors from filing chapter \n13--the exact opposite of the supposed purpose of the bill.\n  But wait, the authors didn't stop there at making chapter 13 harder. \nThis bill will require many more debtors to file 5-year chapter 13 \nplans instead of 3-year plans. This extends the time in which debtors \nmust have steady income and increases the amount of debt they must \npay--significant and unworkable requirements for chapter 13 relief. \nThis conference report will also force chapter 13 debtors to abide by \nstrict IRS standards of ``disposable income'' which can disallow \nabnormally high housing or transportation costs.\n  Mr. President, all of these provisions will make chapter 13 less \nattractive and harder to complete. As I said, the U.S. Trustees believe \nthat the cramdown provisions alone will lower the number of chapter 13 \ncases by 20 percent. But the added impact of these other hurdles could \nwell make chapter 13 cases impossible to complete for many debtors. \nRemember, 67 percent already fail to complete such plans.\n  All of this raises a fundamental question for the supporters of this \nlegislation: If you want more debtors to pay more of their debt back, \nwhy are you making it harder for them to do so? The reality, Mr. \nPresident is that between the means test barring relief under chapter 7 \nand the new restrictions and burdens making chapter 13 less workable, \nthe legislation may well force thousands of debtors from gaining any \nrelief under either chapter of the code. Such debtors will find \nthemselves in bankruptcy purgatory--they will have to either lower \ntheir income (or borrow more money) so that they can qualify for \nchapter 7 or be denied a fresh start altogether and be left at the \nmercy of their creditors. Many such people might very well have filed \nchapter 13 cases under current law.\n  But don't just take my word for it colleagues. In a July 12 ``Dear \nColleague'' letter the author of the Senate bill admits that. The \nattachment to the letter states: ``the proposed bills will result in \nfewer chapter 13s.'' What does all of this add up to, Mr. President? \nExactly this: on one hand, you have the bill's supporters claiming that \nthis will cause more debtors to file under chapter 13 and result in \ngreater repayment of creditors, and on the other you have a letter from \nthe author of the legislation saying precisely the opposite.\n  I say to my colleagues, this cuts to the heart of this entire debate. \nI hope the banks and credit unions that have been tricked into \nsupporting this legislation ask some hard questions of their lobbyists \nhere in Washington: why are you asking me to support this bill when it \nwill result in fewer chapter 13 repayment plans that allow me to \ncollect what I'm rightfully owed? Indeed the chief economist of the \nCredit Union National Association, Bill Hampel, now believes that the \nproposed changes to the Bankruptcy Code will not result in increased \nloan recoveries for credit unions.\n  Where are the savings to consumers in this bill, Mr. President? \nSupporters are running around claiming billions in dollars will be \nsaved under this bill. Well, if fewer people are filing for chapter 13, \nand those that do file will be more likely to drop out, where are the \nsavings? I hope the sponsors come to the floor to answer this question.\n  I think there could be two answers Mr. President. The first answer is \nthat there will be no increased repayments under this bill. That there \nwill be no lowering of the cost of credit for consumers.\n  But the second answer is even more troubling, because I think the \ntruth is, Mr. President, that the only way this bill could result in \nincreased payments to creditors is that it will deny many debtors from \nfiling for bankruptcy altogether. Fresh starts will be too costly and \nprohibitively difficult for many under this bill so lives will be \nruined, wages will be garnished, homes will be lost, and cars will \nbe repossessed. I mean we all know there aren't many assets out there \nto be seized, but I guess the theory is that if you squeeze enough \nstones you will eventually get some blood. But the cost will be \nincreased misery, the cost will be more economic devastation for those \nwho are already devastated.\n\n\n            bankruptcy is a safety net for the middle class\n\n  The proponents of this bill argue that people file because they want \nto get out of their obligations, because they're untrustworthy, because \nthey're dishonest, because there is no stigma in filing for bankruptcy.\n  But any look at the data tells you otherwise. We know that in the \nvast majority of cases it is a drastic step taken by families in \ndesperate financial circumstances and overburdened by debt. The main \nincome earner may have lost his or her job. There may be sudden illness \nor a terrible accident requiring medical care.\n  Specifically we know that nearly half of all debtors report that high \nmedical costs forced them into bankruptcy--this is an especially \nserious problem for the elderly. But when you think about it, a medical \ncrisis can be a double financial whammy for any family. First there are \nthe high costs associated with treatment of serious health problem. \nCosts that may not be fully covered by insurance, and certainly the \nover 30 million Americans without health insurance are especially \nvulnerable. But a serious accident or illness may disable--at least for \na time--the primary wage earner in the household. Even if it isn't the \nperson who draws the income, a parent may have to take significant time \nto care for a sick or disabled child. Or a son or daughter may need to \ncare for an elderly parent. This means a loss in income. It means more \ndebt and the inability to pay that debt.\n  Are people overwhelmed with medical debt or sidelines by an illness, \ndeadbeats? This bill assumes they are. For example, it would force them \ninto credit counseling before they could file--as if a serious illness \nor disability is something that can be counseled away.\n  Women single filers are now the largest group in bankruptcy, and are \none third of all filers. They are also the fastest growing. Since 1981, \nthe number of women filing alone increased by more than 700 percent. A \nwoman single parent has a 500 percent greater likelihood of filing for \nbankruptcy than the population generally. Single women with children \noften earn far less than single men aside for the difficulties and \ncosts of raising children alone. Divorce is also a major factor in \nbankruptcy. Income drops, women, again, are especially hard hit. They \nmay not have worked prior to the divorce, and now have custody of the \nchildren.\n  Are single women with children deadbeats? This bill assumes they are. \nThe new nondischargeability of credit card debt will hit hard those \nwomen who use the cards to tide them over after a divorce until their \nincome stabilizes. And the safe harbor in the conference report which \nproponents argue will shield low and moderate income debtors from the \nmeans test will not benefit many single mothers who need help the most \nbecause it is based on the combined income of the debtor and the \ndebtor's spouse, even if they are separated, the spouse is not filing \nfor bankruptcy, and the spouse is providing no support for the debtor \nand her children. In other words, a single mother who is being deprived \nof needed support from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this \nbill, which will deem the full income of that spouse available to pay \ndebts for determination of whether the safe harbor and means test \napplies.\n  Mr. President, you will hear my colleagues talk about high \neconomic growth and low unemployment and wonder how so many people \ncould be in circumstances that would require them to file for \nbankruptcy. Well, the rosy statistics mask what has been modest real \nwage growth at the same time the debt burden on many families has \nskyrocketed. At it also masks what has been real pain as certain \nindustries and certain communities as the economies restructure. Even \ntemporary job loss may be enough to overwhelm a family that carries \nsignificant loans and often the reality is that a new job may be at\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\na lower wage level--making a previously manageable debt burden \nunworkable.\n\n  So what does this bill do to keep people who undergo these wrenching \nexperiences out of bankruptcy? Nothing. Zero. Tough luck. In stead, \nthis conference report just makes the fresh start of bankruptcy harder \nto achieve. But this doesn't change anyone circumstances, this doesn't \nchange the fact that these folks no longer earn enough to sustain their \ndebt. Mr. President, there is not one thing in this so called \nbankruptcy reform bill that would promote economic security in working \nfamilies. It is sham reform.\n  When you push the rhetoric aside, one thing becomes clear: The \nbankruptcy system is a critical safety net for working families in this \ncountry. It is a difficult demoralizing process, but for nearly all who \ndecided to file, it means the difference between a financial disaster \nbeing temporary or permanent. The repercussions of tearing that safety \nnet asunder will be tremendous, but the authors of the bill remain deaf \nto the chorus of protest and indignation that is beginning to swell as \nordinary Americans and Members of Congress begin to understand that \nbankrupt Americans are much like themselves--are exactly like \nthemselves--and that they are only one layoff, one medical bill, one \npredatory loan away from joining the ranks.\n  For the debtor and his family the benefit of bankruptcy--despite the \nembarrassment, despite the humiliation of acknowledging financial \nfailure--is obvious, to get out from crushing debt, to be able to once \nagain attempt to live within ones means, to concentrate ones income on \nclear priorities such as food, housing and transportation. But it is \nalso the fundamental principles of a just society to ensure that \nfinancial mistakes or unexpected circumstances do not mean banishment \nforever from productive society.\n  Mr. President, the fresh start that is under attack here in the \nSenate today is nothing less than a critical safety net that protects \nAmerica's working families. As Sullivan Warren and Westbrook put it in \n``The Fragile Middle Class'':\n\n       Bankruptcy is a handhold for middle class debtors on the \n     way down. These families have suffered economic dislocation, \n     but the ones that file for bankruptcy have not given up. They \n     have not uprooted their families and drifted from town to \n     town in search of work. They have not gone to the underground \n     economy, working for cash and saying off the books. Instead, \n     these are middle class people fighting to stay where they \n     are, trying to find a way to cope with their declining \n     economic fortunes. Most have come to realize that their \n     incomes will never be the same as they once were. As their \n     comments show, they realize they can live on $30,000 or \n     $20,000 or even $10,000. But they cannot do that and meet the \n     obligations that they ran up while they were making much \n     more. When put to a choice between paying credit card debt \n     and mortgage debt, between dealing with a dunning notice from \n     Sears and putting groceries on the table, they will go to the \n     bankruptcy courts, declare themselves failures, and save \n     their future income for their mortgage and their groceries.\n  I say to my colleagues, there may be many different standards that \ndifferent members have for bringing legislation to the floor of the \nUnited States Senate. We come from different backgrounds, we come from \ndifferent states, we have different philosophies about the role of \ngovernment in society. We have differing priorities. But for God's \nsake, there should be one principle that all of us can get behind and \nthat is that we should do no harm here in our work to America's working \nfamilies.\n  That's what at stake here. This is a debate about priorities. This is \na debate about what side you're on. This is a debate about who you \nstand with. Will you stand with the big banks and the credit card \ncompanies or will you stand with working families, with seniors, with \nsingle women with children, with African-Americans and Hispanics.\n  But I would say to my colleagues on the floor of the U.S. Senate \ntoday that this is not a debate about winners and losers. Because we \nall lose if we erode the middle class in this country. We all lose if \nwe take away some of the critical underpinnings that shore up our \nworking families. Sure, in the short run big banks and credit card \ncompanies may pad their profits, but in the long run our families will \nbe less secure, our entrepreneurs will become more risk adverse and \nless entrepreneurial.\n  How so? Well this is how a Georgia Congressman described the issue in \n1841:\n\n       Many of those who become a victim to the reverses are among \n     the most high-spirited and liberal-minded men of the \n     country--men who build up your cities, sustain your \n     benevolent institutions, open up new avenues to trade, and \n     pour into channels before unfilled the tide of capital.\n\n  Mr. President, this is still true today.\n  This isn't a debate about reducing the high number of bankruptcies. \nNo way will this legislation do that. Indeed, by rewarding the reckless \nlending that got us here in the first place we will see more consumers \nover burdened with debt.\n  No, this is a debate about punishing failure. Whether self inflicted \nor uncontrolled and unexpected. This is a debate about punishing \nfailure. And if there is one thing that this country has learned, \npunishing failure doesn't work. You need to correct mistakes, prevent \nabuse. But you also lead to lift people up when they've stumbled, not \nbeat them down.\n  Of course, what the Congress is poised to do here with this bill is \neven worse within the context of this Congress. This is a Congress that \nhas failed to address skyrocketing drug costs for seniors, this is a \nCongress that has failed to enact a Patients' Bill of Rights much less \ngive all Americans access to affordable health care. This is a Congress \nthat does not invest in education, that does not invest in affordable \nchild care. This is a Congress that has yet to raise the minimum wage.\n  But instead, we declare war on America's working families with this \nbill.\n  What is clear is that this bill will be the death of a thousand cuts \nfor all debtors regardless of whether the means test applies. There are \nnumerous provisions in the bankruptcy reform bill designed to raise the \ncost of bankruptcy, to delay its protection, to reduce the opportunity \nfor a fresh start. But rather than falling the heaviest on the supposed \nrash of wealthy abusers of the code, they will fall hardest on low- and \nmiddle-income families who desperately need the safety net of \nbankruptcy.\n\n\n                   lenders should be held responsible\n\n  You know, a lot of folks must be watching the progress of this \nbankruptcy bill over the course of this year with awe and envy. Can my \ncolleagues name one other bill that the leadership has worked so hard \nand with such determination to move by any and all means necessary? \nCertainly not an increase in the minimum wage. Certainly not a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for seniors, certainly not the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. On many \nissues, on most issues, this has been a do nothing Congress. But on so-\ncalled bankruptcy reform, the Senate and House leadership can't seem to \ndo enough.\n  One can only wonder what we could have accomplished for working \nfamilies if the leadership had the same determination on other issues.\n  Unfortunately those other issues did have the financial services \nindustry behind it. And you have to give them credit--no pun intended--\nover the past couple of years they have played the Congress like a \nviolin. And what do you know, here we are trying to ram through this \nbankruptcy bill in the 11th hour as the 106th Congress draws to a \nclose.\n  In reading the consumer credit industry's propaganda you'd think the \nstory of bankruptcy in America is one of large numbers of \nirresponsible, high income borrowers and their conniving attorney using \nthe law to take advantage of naive and overly trusting lenders.\n  As it turns out, that picture of debtors is almost completely \ninaccurate. The number of bankruptcies has fallen steadily over the \npast months, charge offs (defaults on credit cards) are down and \ndelinquencies have fallen to the lowest levels since 1995, and now all \nsides agree that nearly all debtors resort to bankruptcy not to game \nthe system but rather as a desperate measure of economic survival.\n  It also turns out that the innocence of lenders in the admittedly \nstill high numbers of bankruptcies has also been--to be charitable--\noverstated.\n  As high cost debt, credit cards, retail charge cards, and financing \nplans for consumer goods have skyrocketed in recent years, so have the \nnumber of bankruptcy filings. As the consumer credit industry has begun \nto aggressively court the poor and the vulnerable, bankruptcies have \nrisen. Credit\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\ncard companies brazenly dangle literally billions of card offers to \nhigh debt families every year. They encourage card holders to make low \npayments toward their card balances, guaranteeing that a few hundred \ndollars in clothing or food will take years to pay off. The lengths \nthat companies go to keep their customers in debt is ridiculous.\n  So Mr. President, in the interest of full disclosure--something that \nthe industry itself isn't very good at--I'd like my colleagues to be \naware of what the consumer credit industry is practicing even as it \npreaches the sermon of responsible borrowing. After all, debt involves \na borrower and a lender; poor choices or irresponsible behavior by \neither party can make the transaction go sour.\n  So how responsible has the industry been? Well I suppose that it \ndepends on how you look at it. On the one hand, consumer lending is \nterrifically profitable, with high-cost credit card lending the most \nprofitable of all (except perhaps for even higher costs credit like \npayday loans). So I guess by the standard of responsibility to the \nbottom line they've done a good job.\n  On the other hand if you define responsibility as promoting fiscal \nhealth among families, educating on judicious use of credit, ensuring \nthat borrowers do not go beyond their means, then it's hard to imagine \nhow the financial services industry could be bigger dead beats.\n\n  According to the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the amount of \nrevolving credit outstanding--that is, the amount of open-ended credit \n(like credit cards) being extended--increased seven times during 1980 \nand 1995. And between 1993 and 1997, during the sharpest increases in \nthe bankruptcy filings, the amount of credit card debt doubled. Doesn't \nsound like lenders were too concerned about the high number of \nbankruptcies--at least it didn't stop them from pushing high-cost \ncredit like Halloween candy.\n  Indeed, what do credit card companies do in response to ``danger \nsignals'' from a customer that they may be in over their head. \nAccording to ``The Fragile Middle Class,'' an in depth study of who \nfiles for bankruptcy and why, the company's reaction isn't what you'd \nthink.\n\n       Many credit card issuers respond to a customer who is \n     exceeding his or her credit limit by charging a fee--and \n     raising their credit limit. The practice of charging default \n     rates of interest, which often run into the 20 to 30 percent \n     range, makes customers who give the clearest signs of \n     trouble--missing payments--among the most profitable for the \n     issuers.\n\n  That may sound stupid to you and me colleagues, but it gets more \nbizarre: Banks actively solicit debtors for new credit after they file \nfor bankruptcy--this way, the company knows this customer will take on \ndebt, but will not be legally able to seek another bankruptcy discharge \nfor another 6 years.\n  As ``The Fragile Middle Class'' goes on to state:\n\n       [Many] attribute the sharp rise in consumer debt--and the \n     corresponding rise in consumer bankruptcy--to lowered credit \n     standards, with credit card issuers aggressively pursuing \n     families already carrying extraordinary debt burdens on \n     incomes too low to make more than minimum repayments. The \n     extraordinary profitability of consumer debt repaid over time \n     has attracted lenders to the increasingly high-risk-high-\n     profit business of consumer lending in a saturated market, \n     making the link between the rise in credit card debt and the \n     rise in consumer bankruptcy unmistakable.\n\n  So in other words colleagues, those folks who may have come into your \noffice this year or last year talking about how they needed protection \nfrom customers walked away from debts, who thought Congress should \nmandate credit counseling--to promote responsible money management--as \na requirement for seeking bankruptcy protection, who argued that reform \nof the bankruptcy code is needed because of decline in the stigma of \nbankruptcy have been pouring gasoline on the flames the whole time. Of \ncourse, in the end, if his bill passes, it's working families who get \nburned.\n  But guess what? It gets even worse, because the consumer finance \nindustry isn't just reckless in its lending habits, big name lenders \nall too often break or skirt the law in both marketing and collecting.\n  For example:\n  In June of this year the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \nreached a settlement with Providian Financial Corporation in which \nProvidian agreed to pay at least $300 million to its customers to \ncompensate them for using deceptive marketing tactics. Among these were \nbaiting customers with ``no annual fees'' but then charging an annual \nfee unless the customer accepted the $156 credit protection program \n(coverage which was itself deceptively marketed). The company also \nmisrepresented the savings their customers would get from transferring \naccount balances from another card.\n\n  In 1999, Sears, Roebuck & Co. paid $498 million in settlement damages \nand $60 million in fines for illegally coercing reaffirmations--\nagreements with borrowers to repay debt--from its cardholders. But \napparently this is just the cost of doing business: Bankruptcy judges \nin California, Vermont, and New York have claimed that Sears is still \nup to its old strong arm tactics, but is now using legal loopholes to \navoid disclosure. Now colleagues, Sears is a creditor in one third of \nall personal bankruptcies. And by the way, this legislation contains \nprovisions that would have protected Sears from paying back any monies \nthat customers were tricked into paying under these plans.\n  This July, North American Capital Corp., a subsidiary of GE, agreed \nto pay a $250,000 fine to settle charges brought by the Federal Trade \nCommission that the company had violated the Fair Debt Collection \nPractices Act by lying to and harassing customers during collections.\n  In October, 1998, the Department of Justice brought an antitrust suit \nagainst VISA and Mastercard, the two largest credit card associations, \ncharging them with illegal collusion that reduced competition and made \ncredit cards more expensive for borrowers.\n  Now Mr. President, this is just a few examples, I could go on and on. \nAt a minimum, these illegal and unscrupulous practices rob honest \ncreditors who play by the rules of repayment. And the cost to debtors \nand other creditors alike are tremendous.\n  But other practices aren't illegal, merely unsavory.\n  For example, credit card companies perpetuate high interest \nindebtedness by requiring low minimum payments and in some cases \ncanceling the cards of customers who pay off their balance every month. \nUsing a typical minimum monthly payment rate on a credit card, it would \ntake 34 years to pay off a $2,500 loan, and total payments would exceed \n300 percent of their original principal. A recent move by credit card \nindustries to make the minimum monthly payment only 2 percent of the \nbalance rather than 4 percent--further exacerbates the problems of some \nuneducated debtors.\n  Lenders routinely offer low ``teaser'' interest rates which expire in \nas little as 2 months and engage in ``risk-based'' pricing which allows \nthem to raise credit card interest rates based on credit changes \nunrelated to the borrower's account. Many credit card contracts now \ncontain binding arbitration clauses--buried in the fine print of \ncontracts which are often not even included with pre-approved card \noffers--that cut off the borrowers ability to seek redress in the \ncourts in the case of a dispute.\n  Even more ironic: at the same time that the consumer credit industry \nis pushing a bankruptcy bill that requires credit counseling for \ndebtors, the Consumer Federation of America found that many prominent \ncreditors have slashed the portion of debt repayments they shared with \ncredit counseling agencies--in some cases by more than half. This may \nforce some agencies to cut programs and serve fewer debtors. At the \nsame time, the industry has stopped the practice of eliminating or \nsignificantly reducing the interest rates charged on debts being \nrepaid with the help of a counseling agency making counseling less \nlikely to succeed.\n\n  Mr. President, let me repeat myself in case my colleagues somehow \nmissed the blatant hypocrisy of what's going on here: The big banks and \ncredit card companies are pushing to rig the system so that you cannot \nfile for bankruptcy unless you perform credit counseling at the same \ntime that they are jeopardizing the health the credit counseling \nindustry and making it significantly more costly for debtors.\n  That's pretty brazen, but as my colleagues will hear over and over in \nthis debate, this isn't just an industry that\n\n[[Page S11393]]\n\nwants to have it both ways, it wants to have it several different ways.\n  Of course these are mild abuses compared to predatory lending. \nSchemes such as payday loans, car title pawns, and home equity loan \nscams harm tens of thousands of more Americans on top of those shaken \ndown by the mainstream creditors. Such operators often target those on \nthe economic fringe like the working poor and the recently bankrupt. \nThey even claim to be performing a public service: providing loans to \nthe uncreditworthy. It just also happens to be obscenely profitable to \noverwhelm vulnerable borrowers with debt at usurious rates of interest. \nHey, who said good deeds don't get rewarded?\n  Reading this conference report makes it clear who has the clout in \nWashington. There is not one provision in this bill that holds the \nconsumer credit industry truly responsible for their lending habits. My \ncolleagues talk about the message they want to send to deadbeat \ndebtors, that bankruptcy will no longer be a free ride to a clean \nslate. Well what message does this bill send to the banks, and the \ncredit card companies? The message is clear: make risky loans, \ndiscourage savings, promote excess, and Congress will bail you out by \nletting you be more coercive in your collections, by putting barriers \nin between your customers and bankruptcy relief, and by ensuring that \nthe debtor will emerge from bankruptcy with his vassalage to you \nintact. This is in stark contrast to the numerous punitive provisions \nof the bill aimed at borrowers.\n  So Mr. President, the record is clear: lenders routinely discourage \nhealthy borrowing practices, encourage excessive indebtedness and \nimpose barriers to paying of debt all in the name of padding their \nprofits. It would be a bitter irony if Congress were to reward big \nbanks, credit card companies, retailers, and other lenders for their \nbad behavior, but that is exactly what passage of bankruptcy reform \nlegislation would do.\n  I would characterize the debate like this and make it very simple for \nmy colleagues. This is fundamentally a referendum on Congress's \npriorities and you simply need to ask yourself: whose side am I on? Am \nI on the side of working families who need a financial fresh start \nbecause they are overburdened with debt? Am I for preserving this \ncritical safety net for the middle class? Will I stand with the civil \nrights community, and religious community, and the women's community, \nand consumer groups and the labor unions who fight for ordinary \nAmericans and who oppose this bill?\n  Or will you stand with the credit card companies, and the big banks, \nand the auto lenders who desperately want this bill to pad their \nprofits? I hope the choice will be clear to colleagues.\n\n\n           MORE BANKRUPTCIES, NOT LESS, IS THE LIKELY RESULT\n\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of my statement I said the bankruptcy \n``crisis'' is over and it ended without Congress passing legislation. \nIronically, it probably ended because Congress didn't act. The \nbean counters in the consumer credit industry realized that all these \nbankruptcies weren't good for profits so they started lending less \nmoney, and they were more careful about who they lent money to. In \nfact, the overall consumer debt level actually declined in 1998, and \nguess what--fewer bankruptcies. And this trend has continued in 1999 \nand so far in 2000. But if this conference report become law, \nbankruptcy protection will be harshly rolled back. It will be even more \nprofitable to over burden folks with debt--and the banks and the credit \ncard companies will fall all over themselves trying to do it. but this \ntime America's working families will pay more of the price.\n\n  This argument isn't purely theoretical, history and empirical data \nback it up. I want to ready my colleagues a few passages from an \narticle published in the August 13, 1984 issue of Business week. This \narticle, entitled ``Consumer Lenders Love the New Bankruptcy Laws,'' \nwas written in the recent aftermath of Congress' last tightening of the \nbankruptcy code in 1984.\n  Here's how the article begins, quote:\n\n       It doesn't take much to get a laugh out of Finn Casperson \n     these days. Just ask him the outlook for Beneficial Corp. now \n     that the U.S. has a tough new bankruptcy law. `It looks a lot \n     rosier,' says the chairman of the consumer finance company, \n     punctuating the assessment with a hearty chuckle.\n\n  The article then explains what the banks and the credit card \nindustries got back in 1984:\n\n       But when someone seems to be abusing the revised law, a \n     judge can, on his or her own, throw a case out of chapter 7, \n     leaving the debtor to file under chapter 13. And in chapter \n     13, where an individual works out a repayment plan under \n     court supervision, lender now can get a court order assigning \n     all of a borrower's income for three years to repaying \n     debts--after allowance for food and other basic needs. Merely \n     empowering a judge to determine that a debtor is abusing the \n     bankruptcy courts was the change most responsive to the \n     lenders' contention that bankruptcy was being used by people \n     capable of meeting their obligations.\n\n  Does this sound familiar to colleagues? It should. These ``reforms,'' \nare substantially similar to what industry says are desperately needed \nnow--the means to curb abusive filings. That was exactly what Congress \ngave them in 1984. But the critical question is, how did lenders behave \nafter the 1984 ``strengthening'' of the bankruptcy code? That story \nwill help us answer the question: if we give them this new stricter, \nlopsided law in 2000, what will they do with it?\n  That 1984 Business Week article suggested what was to come:\n\n       Lenders say they will make more unsecured loans from now \n     on, trying to lure back the generally younger and lower-\n     income borrowers recently turned away.\n\n  But, Mr. President, that's exactly the problem. The consumer finance \nindustry went after these folks with a vengeance. Lenders felt so \nprotected by the new bankruptcy law that they eventually through \ncaution to the wind and began using the aggressive, borderline \ndeceptive and abusive, tactics that are now common in the industry.\n  And guess what, both bankruptcies and consumer debt levels exploded \nafter 1985. And some independent observers point the figure directly at \nthe 1984 reforms and the lending industry's foolhardy reaction. In a \n1999 Harvard Business School study entitled ``The Rise of Consumer \nBankruptcy: Evolution, Revolution, or Both?'' David Moss of the Harvard \nBusiness School and Gibbs Johnson, an attorney, lay out the case. The \nsay:\n\n       It is conceivable, therefore, that the procreditor reforms \n     of 1984 actually contributed to the growth of consumer \n     (bankruptcy) filings. This could have occurred if the reforms \n     exerted a larger impact in encouraging lenders to lend--and \n     to lend more deeply into the income distribution--than they \n     did in deterring borrowers from borrowing and filing.\n\n  Mark Zandi, in the January 1997 edition of ``The Regional Financial \nReview,'' writes:\n\n       While forcing more households into a chapter 13 filing \n     through an income test would raise the amount that lenders \n     would ultimately recover from bankrupt borrowers, it would \n     not significantly lower the net cost of bankruptcies. Tougher \n     bankruptcy laws will simply induce lenders to ease their \n     standards further.\n\n  Again, we know this is exactly what happened. Credit card companies \nsent out over 3.5 billion solicitations last year. They use aggressive \ntactics to sign up borrowers--and to keep you in debt once they get \nyou. And they also went after low income individuals--even though they \nmight be worse credit risks. Why? Because they are desperate for \ncredit, they are a captive audience and can be charged exorbitant \ninterest rates and fees. Despite the fact that there are hundreds of \ncredit card firms targeting low income borrowers, interest rates and \nterms on these cards have not been driven down by the supposed \ncompetition. For these borrowers, the market is failing. And firms who \naren't squeamish about using aggressive collection tactics have proved \nthat the poor, or those with bad credit--even though they might be less \ncredit worthy onpaper--can be kept to default rates as low as those for \nwealthier borrowers. This is because the poor are more vulnerable to \nintimidation and they are less likely to have legal defense against law \nsuits.\n  Mr. President, I ask you, could the Senate play a better joke on the \nAmerican people? The supposed bankruptcy ``crisis'' of the 1990's--\nwhich bill supporters say merits a harsh rollback of bankruptcy \nprotection for debtors--actually has its origins in the last time \nCongress ``reformed'' the bankruptcy code in favor of industry. I ask \nyou, why would we be so stupid again? It's like our parents used to \nsay: ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.''\n\n[[Page S11394]]\n\n                   worse than what the senate passed\n\n  Now Mr. President, not only does the majority leader want to ram \nthrough bankruptcy legislation on the State Department authorization \nconference report, which he has literally hijacked for that purpose, \nthere is no question that this is a significantly worse legislation \nthan what passed the Senate. In fact, there's no pretending that this \nis a bill designed to curb real abuse of the bankruptcy code.\n  Does this bill take on wealthy debtors who file frivolous claims and \nshield their assets in multimillion dollar mansions? No, it guts the \ncap on the homestead exemption adopted by the Senate. I ask my \ncolleagues who support this bill: how can you claim that this bill is \ndesigned to crack down on wealthy scofflaws without closing the massive \nhomestead loophole that exists in five states? And in a bill that falls \nso harshly on the backs of low and moderate income individuals?\n  I wonder how my colleagues who vote for this conference report will \nexplain this back home. How will they explain that they supported \nletting wealthy debtors shield their assets from creditors at the same \ntime they voted to end the practice under current law of stopping \neviction proceedings against tenants who are behind on rent who file \nfor bankruptcy? With one hand we gut tenants rights, with the other we \nshield wealthy homeowners.\n  Nor does this bill contain another amendment offered by Senator \nSchumer and adopted by the Senate that would prevent violators of the \nFair Access to Clinic Entrances Act--which protects women's health \nclinics--from using the bankruptcy system to walk away from their \npunishment. Again, I thought the sponsors of the measure wanted to \ncrack down on people who game the system. What could be a bigger misuse \nof the system then to use the bankruptcy code to get out of damages \nimposed because you committed an act of violence against a women's \nhealth clinic?\n  And yet the secret conferees on his bill simply walked away. They \nwalked away from a real opportunity to prohibit an abuse that all sides \nrecognize exists, but they also walked away from an opportunity to \nprotect women from harassment. They walked away from the opportunity to \nprotect women from violence.\n  So why shouldn't people be cynical about this process? Ever since \nbankruptcy reform was passed by the Senate this bill has gotten less \nbalanced, less fair, and more punitive--but only for low and moderate \nincome debtors. So again, I would say to my colleagues, this bill is a \nquestion of our priorities. Will we stand with wealthy dead beats or \nwill we take a stand to protect women seeking reproductive health \nservices from harassment?\n  But unfortunately, these were not the only areas where the shadow \nconferees beat a retreat from balance and fairness. For example:\n  Safe harbor dollar amounts--The Senate bill provided that the higher \nof state or national median income should be used for the safe harbor \nfrom the means test. The shadow conference uses state median income, \nwhich is a far lower number in many states. This is an important issue \nbecause debtors in high income/high expense areas of low-income states \nwill be very much disadvantaged.\n  Safe harbor treatment of women not receiving child support--The \nshadow conference has inserted the ``Hyde safe harbor'' which protects \nsome low income families from the arbitrary means test based on \nInternal Revenue Service expense standards. But this safe harbor will \nnot benefit many single mothers who need help the most because it is \nbased on the combined income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse, \neven if they are separated, the spouse is not filing for bankruptcy, \nand the husband is providing no support for the debtor and her \nchildren. In other words, a single mother who is being deprived of \nneeded support from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this bill, \nwhich will deem the full income of that spouse available to pay debts \nfor the safe harbor determination. This unfair treatment appears \nclearly intended, since the safe harbor from creditor motions elsewhere \nin the same section is worded differently, and does not take into \naccount the income of a separated nondebtor spouse, except to the \nextent support is actually being paid by that spouse.\n  Gutting the Durbin means test ``mini-screen''--The Senate bill \ncontained an amendment meant to give bankruptcy judges more flexibility \nin applying the means test for moderate income debtors. The provision \nwas changed in a way that turns the intent of this provision on its \nhead. Instead of creating more flexibility in the means test, it would \nmean much less flexibility.\n  Elimination of protections for family farmers and family fishermen--\nThe Senate bill enhanced bankruptcy protections for family farmers and \nadded protections for family fishermen. Senate negotiators have \nreportedly agreed to eliminate entirely the new protections for \nfishermen, as well as most of the new protections for family farmers.\n  Unrealistic valuation of property--Senate negotiations have \nreportedly agreed to a House provision that would change current rules \non property valuation. Under this provision, property would have to be \nvalued at retail value, without accounting for any of the costs of \nsale, despite the fact that resale at such value would be impossible.\n  Elimination of Byrd and Levin amendments on consumer credit--The \namendment to the Senate bill offered by Senator Byrd required that \nconsumer information be included in Internet credit card applications. \nThe Levin amendment prohibited certain finance charges on credit card \npayments made within the grace periods provided by creditors. Senate \nnegotiations have reportedly agreed to delete both of these important \namendments.\n  Unrealistic notice requiremnts--A provision from the House bill \nrequires that debtors use the address provided in pre-bankruptcy \ncommunications to provide any necessary notice to their creditors. \nUnder this provision, it would be impossible in many cases for debtors \nto know what address to use, since debtors often do not retain their \npre-bankruptcy communications.\n  Elimination of sanctions against creditors who file abusive motions--\nThe Senate bill contained sanctions against creditors who file motions \nclaiming ``abuse'' which are coercive or not substantially justified. \nThese sanctions would have been a key protection against overly \naggressive creditors for debtors in bankruptcy. Senate negotiators have \nreportedly agreed to eliminate these sanctions.\n  Filing of tax records--S. 625 required debtors to provide tax returns \nonly if requested by a party in interest. The shadow conference \nrequires the filing of tax records in every case.\n\n\n                           a terrible process\n\n  Mr. President, let me just say a few words about the process on this \nlegislation, which is terrible. The House and Senate Republicans have \ntaken a secretly negotiated bankruptcy bill and stuffed it into the \nState Department authorization bill in which not one provision of the \noriginal bill remains. Of course, State Department authorization is the \nlast of many targets. The majority leader has talked abut doing this on \nan appropriations bill, on a crop insurance bill, on the electronic \nsignatures bill, on the Violence Against Women Act. So desperate are we \nto serve the big banks and credit card companies that no bill has been \nsafe from this controversial baggage.\n  We are again making a mockery of scope of conference. We are \nabdicating our right to amend legislation. We are abdicating our right \nto debate legislation. And for what? Expediency. Convenience.\n  However, I'm not sure that we have ever been so brazen in the past. \nYes we have combined unrelated, extraneous measures into conference \nreports. Usually because the majority wishes to pass one bill using the \npopularity of another. Putting it into a conference report makes it \nprivileged. Putting it into a conference report makes it unamendable. \nSo they piggy back legislation. Fine. But Mr. President, this may be \nthe first time in the Senate's history where the majority has hollowed \nout a piece of legislation in conference--left nothing behind but the \nbill number--and inserted a completely unrelated measure.\n  I would challenge my colleagues walk into any high school civics \nclass room in America and explain this process. Explain this new way \nthat a bill becomes law. What the majority has essentially done is \nstarted down the road toward a virtual tricameral legislature--House, \nSenate, and conference\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\ncommittee. But at least the House and the Senate have the power under \nthe constitution to amend legislation passed by the other house--\nmeasures adopted by the all-powerful conference committee are not \namendable.\n\n  Is bankruptcy reform so important that we should weaken the integrity \nof the Senate itself? It is not. I would question whether any \nlegislation is that important, but to make such a blatant mockery of \nthe legislative process on a bill that is going to be vetoed anyway? \nThat is effectively dead? Just to make a political point? What have we \ncome to?\n  This is a game to the majority. The game is how to move legislation \nthrough the Senate with as little interference as possible from actual \nSenators.\n  Colleagues I want to remind you of what Senator Kennedy said 4 years \nago when the Senate voted to gut rule 28, the Senate rule limiting the \nscope of conference, that we are violating with this conference report. \nSpeaking very prophetically he said:\n\n       The rule that a conference committee cannot include \n     extraneous matter is central to the way that the Senate \n     conducts its business. When we send a bill to conference we \n     do so knowing that the conference committee's work is likely \n     to become law. Conference reports are privileged. Motions to \n     proceed to them cannot be debated, and such reports cannot be \n     amended. So conference committees are already very powerful. \n     But if conference committees are permitted to add completely \n     extraneous matters in conference, that is, if the point of \n     order against such conduct becomes a dead letter, conferees \n     will acquire unprecedented power. They will acquire the power \n     to legislate in a privileged, unreviewable fashion on \n     virtually any subject. They will be able to completely bypass \n     the deliberative process of the Senate. Mr. President, this \n     is a highly dangerous situation. It will make all of us \n     willing to send bills to conference and leave all of us \n     vulnerable to passage of controversial, extraneous \n     legislation any time a bill goes to conference. I hope the \n     Senate will not go down this road. Today the narrow issue is \n     the status of one corporation under the labor laws. But \n     tomorrow the issue might be civil rights, States' rights, \n     health care, education, or anything else. It might be a \n     matter much more sweeping than the labor law issue that is \n     before us today.\n\n  He was absolutely right, Mr. President. We are headed down that \nslippery slope he described. For the last three years we have handled \nappropriations in this manner. We've combined bills together, the text \nis written by a small group of Senators and Congressmen and these bills \nhave been presented to the Senate as an up or down proposition. And now \nwe're doing it with so-called bankruptcy reform.\n  Conference reports are privileged. It is very difficult for a \nminority in the Senate to stop a conference report as they can with \nother legislation. That's why these conference reports are being used \nin this way. And that's why the rules are supposed to restrict their \nscope.\n  Last year, Senator Daschle attempted to reinstate rule 28 on the \nSenate floor. He was voted down, and he spoke specifically about how we \nhave corrupted the legislative process in the Senate:\n\n       I wish this had been a one time event. Unfortunately, it \n     happens over and over and over. It is a complete emasculation \n     of the process that the Founding Fathers had set up. It has \n     nothing to do with the legislative process. ``If you were to \n     write a book on how a bill becomes a law, you would need \n     several volumes. In fact, if the consequences were not so \n     profound, some could say that you would need a comic book \n     because it is hilarious to look at the lengths we have \n     gone to thwart and undermine and, in an extraordinary way, \n     destroy a process that has worked so well for 220 years.\n\n  So where does it stop? As long as the majority want to avoid debate, \nas long as the majority wants to avoid amendments and as long as \nSenators will go along to get along we will find ourselves forced to \ncast up or down votes on legislation--a rubber stamp yes or no--with no \nability to actually legislate.\n  And each Senator who today votes for this conference report should \nknow: they may find themselves in the majority today, they may be OK \nwith letting this bill go because they are not offended by what it \ncontains, but be forewarned, the day will come when you will be on the \nother side of this tactic. Today it is bankruptcy reform, but someday \nyou will be the one protesting the inclusion of a provision that you \nbelieve is outrageous.\n  Regardless of the merits of bankruptcy reform, this is a terrible \nprocess. I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to send a message to \nthe leadership. Send a message that you want your rights as Senators \nback.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me end on this note. I think many in this \nbody believe that a society is judged by its treatment of its most \nvulnerable members. Well, by that standard this is an exceptionally \nrough bill in what has been a very rough Congress. All the consumer \ngroups oppose this bill, 31 organizations devoted to women and \nchildren's issues oppose this legislation.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a bad bill. It punishes the \nvulnerable and rewards the big banks and credit card companies for \ntheir own poor practices. And this legislation has only gotten worse in \nsham conference.\n  Earlier, Mr. President, I used the word ``injustice'' to describe \nthis bill--and that is exactly right. It will be bitter irony if \ncreditors are able to use a crisis--largely of their own making--to \nconvince Congress to decrease borrower's access to bankruptcy relief. I \nhope my colleagues reject this scheme and reject this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11395-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11395-S11398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           EMBASSY SECURITY AND BANKRUPTCY CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me begin by agreeing with the \nSenator from Minnesota. The measure before us is a work of injustice. \nIt works injustice on the Senate's procedures. And if it passes, it \nwill work injustice on millions of Americans struggling to cobble \ntogether a fresh start after financial hardship. And the measure is \nalso a clear example of the power of money in the legislative process. \nThat's an injustice too, because it puts the needs of the special \ninterests ahead of the needs of the American people.\n  Let us begin with the procedural injustice. If Senators allow \nbusiness to be done as is being attempted with this conference report, \nthen we might as well all just go home. Because conference committees \nwill be doing our jobs.\n  Unlike a normal conference report, this conference report includes \nabsolutely no legislation on the matters that the Senate sent to the \nconference committee--which, for the information of my colleagues and \nthe people watching, was a bill on embassy security and authorizations \nfor the Department of State, a terribly serious matter. That was not \nwhat came back--nothing like that. Instead this conference report \nbrings back to the Senate a complete bill entirely irrelevant to the \nbill sent to conference. What it brings back is a bankruptcy bill.\n  That is not the job of a conference committee. It is not the job of a \nconference committee to search out the legislative vineyards for \nwhatever issues appear ripe for decision. It is not the job of a \nconference committee to write legislation on matters not committed to \nit. The conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  The Constitution confers on the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives certain enumerated powers. Article I, Section 1, of the \nConstitution provides: ``All legislative powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \nSenate and House of Representatives.''\n  If the Senate so chooses, it may delegate some of its powers to a \ncommittee of its Members. But if those Members so delegated recognize \nno limits on their authority, then they have usurped nothing less than \nall the powers that the Constitution vests in the Senate itself. The \nconference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs a full Senate and a full House of Representatives in \nCongress assembled? The conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs amendments between the Houses on the bankruptcy bill? The \nconference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs the Senate to disagree to any House amendments or insist on \nany Senate amendments on the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee \nis doing our jobs.\n  Who needs the Senate to request a conference or agree to a conference \non the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs the Senate to consider any motions to instruct the \nconferees\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\non the bankruptcy bill? The conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs the Senate even to name conferees on the bankruptcy bill? \nThe embassy security conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs for Congress to address the increase in the minimum wage \nthat the Senate attached to the last bankruptcy bill? The conference \ncommittee is doing our jobs.\n\n  Who needs for Congress even to take up, consider, debate, and amend \nthis particular bankruptcy bill, which was introduced on October 11? \nThe conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs for the Senate to take any action whatsoever to grant this \nconference committee power to act on bankruptcy? The conference \ncommittee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs all the Senators who are not Members of the conference \ncommittee? Because the conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs for us to fly and drive in to Washington, sometimes from \nvast distances, from around the country? Because the conference \ncommittee is doing our jobs.\n  Who needs all these Senate offices and all the Senators' staff? A \nhandful of offices would do, four to be exact, because the conference \ncommittee is doing our jobs.\n  As one longtime observer of Senate procedures asked, who died and \nmade them king? Because the conference committee is doing our jobs.\n  The Senate used to have rules to prevent this sort of thing. Rule 28 \nof the Standing Rules of the Senate addresses conference committees. \nTwo of that rule's six paragraphs deal with the scope of conferences.\n  Paragraph 2 of Rule 28 states, in relevant part:\n\n       Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House. . . . If new matter is \n     inserted in the report . . ., a point of order may be made \n     against the report, and if the point of order is sustained, \n     the report is rejected or shall be recommitted to the \n     committee of conference if the House of Representatives has \n     not already acted thereon.\n\n  And then, paragraph 3 of Rule 28, dealing with complete substitutes, \nstates:\n\n       3(a) In any case in which a disagreement to an amendment in \n     the nature of a substitute has been referred to conferees, it \n     shall be in order for the conferees to report a substitute on \n     the same subject matter; but they may not include in the \n     report matter not committed to them by either House. They \n     may, however, include in their report in any such case matter \n     which is a germane modification of subjects in disagreement.\n       (b) In any case in which the conferees violate subparagraph \n     (a), the conference report shall be subject to a point of \n     order.\n\n  Then, Mr. President, on October 3, 1996, in what seemed like almost a \nwhim, the Senate cast aside this century-old Standing Rule, which I \njust read in part. To secure last-minute, end-of-session passage of a \nversion of the Federal Aviation Authorization Act that included an \nextraneous provision of special interest to the Federal Express \nCorporation, the Senate voted 56 to 39 to overturn the ruling of the \nChair and nullify the rule.\n  At that time, Senator Specter called it: ``a very, very serious \nperversion of Senate procedures.''\n  Mr. President, conference reports are privileged. Consequently, \nSenators cannot debate a motion to proceed to a conference report. \nSenators cannot employ a filibuster to block its consideration.\n  Conference reports are not amendable. If, as is often the case, and \nis the case here, the House has already acted on a conference report, \nmotions to recommit the conference report to the conference committee \nare not in order in the Senate.\n  Conference reports present the Senate with a take-it-or-leave-it \nproposition.\n  As I am sure my colleagues have observed, the Senate works at two \nspeeds: a deliberative speed and a get-down-to-business speed. The \nregular order under the Standing Rules of the Senate reflects the \ndeliberative speed. We see the getting-down-to-business speed in \nunanimous consent agreements, the budget process, and conference \nreports.\n  When Senators take up these get-down-to-business matters, they enter \ninto a kind of social contract. Senators agree to give up their normal \nrights under the rules to debate and amend, which are very important in \nthis institution. In exchange, through subject-matter limitations, \nthese procedures grant Senators some notice--and Senators have a right \nto some notice--of what they can expect.\n  As Senator Kennedy said in 1996:\n\n       ``We send a bill to conference . . . knowing that the \n     conference committee's work is likely to become law.\n\n  And until October 1996, the precedents governing conference \ncommittees prohibited them from bringing back any matter ``entirely \nirrelevant'' to what the Senate or House passed.\n  In October 1996, the Senate breached that compact. Now the process \ncan force Senators to live with restrictions on their rights to debate \nand amend conference reports without having even the slightest idea of \nthe reports' subject matter in advance. And the last-minute additions \nwill probably become law.\n  Mr. President, I think most would agree, this change is profoundly \nundemocratic. Conference committees are populated disproportionately by \nsenior Members and Members favored by the leadership. This conference, \nas a case in point, was signed off on for the Senate by just four men \nwho have been here an average of 22 years. Conference committees are \nfar less representative of the people than the Senate as a whole.\n  In conference, the majority need not work with the minority party at \nall. Under this majority, the majority often has not. On this bill, the \nmajority certainly has not.\n  Conference committees usually work in secret. Senate rules require no \nopen meetings. House practice has generally required one photo \nopportunity. Thereafter, in the eyes of the Senate's rules, Senators' \nsignatures on the conference report constitute their votes, and nothing \nfurther need be done in public.\n  Mr. President, we know that conference committees have long been the \ngraveyards of amendments. Senator Russell Long used to quip, ``Why \nfight an amendment on the floor if you can drop it in conference?'' And \nthat appears to be what has happened to the minimum wage increase that \nthe Senate attached to the last bankruptcy bill, and to many other \namendments, including some that I proposed, that made the bill somewhat \nmore palatable to the Senate.\n\n  And today we see a conference committee becoming the delivery room \nfor a brand new piece of legislation. Like Athena from Zeus's head, a \nnew law is springing whole from the conference committee without floor \nconsideration, debate, or amendment.\n  Today, the chickens are coming home to roost. This majority, in its \ncontinuing crusade to snuff out any opportunity for the minority to \ndebate and amend, now carries this monstrous conference report \nprecedent to its logical extreme.\n  As I said in my statement on the Military Construction Appropriations \nbill on May 18, this majority has time after time flouted or changed \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate to ratchet down the rights of the \nminority. This majority has thus shown a disturbing willingness to cast \naside long-held precedents to serve immediate policy ends. Minority \nparty rights have suffered as a result.\n  Mr. President, four Senators do not constitute the Senate. Yet absent \nSenate rules to restrain them, small groups of Senators meeting \nsecretly in conference committees can arrogate much--if not most--of \nthe Senate's power.\n  If the Senate allows the kind of legislation-writing by conference \ncommittee that has taken place here, then Senators will have done \nnothing less than surrender their jobs. They will have surrendered \ntheir authority and responsibilities to the very few who happen to be \nin whatever conference committee is meeting on any given day.\n  If we allow this practice, we will have perpetrated, in my view, and \nI don't think this is an exaggeration, one of the greatest abdications \nof responsibility in the history of the Senate.\n  Let us be clear about why this is happening. When the Senate \nconsidered the last bankruptcy bill, in November of 1999, Senator \nKennedy offered an amendment to provide working Americans a much-needed \nincrease in the minimum wage. The Republican caucus added 112 pages of \ntax breaks, costing $103 billion, most of which would have gone to the \ntop fifth of the income distribution.\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\n  The Senate could have sent a bill on bankruptcy and the minimum wage \nto conference with the House. But the Constitution requires that \nrevenue measures originate in the House. So the plain effect of the \nRepublican tax break amendment was to kill the bankruptcy bill and also \nto kill the minimum wage increase.\n  And now, the majority seeks to take the remains of that dead \nbankruptcy bill from the graveyard, and stitch it together with \nmaterial from completely different entities that they have found in \nvarious legislative dissecting rooms. The result is a not a modern \nPrometheus, but a monster, artificial and hideous.\n  Now why did the majority engage in this extremely unusual procedure? \nWhy seek a conference committee that could be used to work its will in \nsecret and bring to the floor a new bill that will be voted on up or \ndown with no amendments? Was it to bring forward a bill that is crucial \nto our national security? No. Are the experts in the field clamoring \nfor it? No.\n  I have talked to bankruptcy judges, bankruptcy trustees, \npractitioners representing both creditors and debtors, law professors \nwho specialize in this area, and they all strongly oppose this bill. \nNo, the clamor is coming from another quarter. The special interests. \nThe interests that want this bill so desperately that they have pushed \nthe Majority to use this most unusual, almost unprecedented procedure, \nare the big banks and the credit card companies. They want this reform \nbill because it is skewed toward their interests. This is a bill \nwritten by and for the credit card companies. That's why all the \nnonpartisan experts on bankruptcy law oppose it.\n  So why is it before the Senate today? Mr. President, for over a year \nnow, I have been Calling the Bankroll on the Senate floor, to inform my \ncolleagues of the campaign contributions, particularly soft money \ncontributions, that have been given by interests that would benefit \nfrom or that oppose legislation that we are considering here in the \nSenate. I have often stated that these contributors set the agenda on \nthis floor. And this bill, I'm afraid, is a poster child for the \ninfluence of money on the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, Common Cause put out a report this spring showing the \nstunning amount of money that the credit industry has contributed to \nmembers of Congress and the political parties in recent years. $7.5 \nmillion in 1999 alone, and $23.4 million in just the last three years. \nOne company that has been particularly generous is the MBNA \nCorporation, one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the country. \nIn 1998, MBNA gave a $200,000 soft money contribution to the Republican \nSenatorial Committee on the very day that the House passed the \nconference report and sent it to the Senate--not terribly subtle.\n  In December 1999, MBNA gave its first large soft money contribution \never to the Democratic party--it gave $150,000 to the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee on December 22, 1999, Mr. President, \nright in the middle of Senate floor consideration of the bankruptcy \nbill. And just a few months ago, on June 30, 2000, Alfred Lerner, \nChairman and CEO of MBNA--one person, one individual--gave $250,000 in \nsoft money to the RNC.\n  Mr. President, the following figures are from the Center for \nResponsive Politics, through the first 15 months of the election cycle, \nand in some cases include contributions given later in the election \ncycle. MBNA and its affiliates and executives gave a total of $710,000 \nin soft money to the parties. Visa and its executives gave more than \n$268,000 in soft money to the parties during the period. Mastercard \ngave nearly $46,000.\n  Finance and credit card companies gave $5.4 million in soft money, \nPAC and individual hard money contributions in the first 15 months of \nthe 2000 election cycle. When you add that to the $14.6 million that \nthe commercial banks gave, you have, Mr. President, in the midst of all \nthese other special interests, one of the most powerful lobbying forces \nin public policy today. And you just might have the answer, in fact you \ndo have the answer, to the question, ``why is this bill before the \nSenate today?''\n  Some in this body say that the public doesn't care about campaign \nfinance reform Mr. President. But I would be willing to bet that if you \ntook a public opinion poll and asked the question whether the Senate \nshould use extraordinary procedural means to send a campaign finance \nbill that would ban soft money to the President instead of this \nbankruptcy bill, the answer would be an overwhelming ``Yes.''\n\n  After all, the House passed the Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform \nbill last year by an overwhelming margin. And the President would sign \nthat bill. All that is needed for campaign finance reform to become law \nis Senate approval, and a majority of Senators supports this bill.\n  On the other hand, the President has said repeatedly that he will \nveto this bankruptcy bill. So even if this procedural gambit is \nsuccessful, the bill won't become law.\n  But the campaign finance reform bill doesn't have millions of dollars \nin campaign contributions behind it, the same way this bankruptcy bill \ndoes. So the majority persists, the majority persists in trying to \nforce this bill through the Congress in the waning days of the session. \nAnd it may get its way. But it will not pass this bill into law.\n  Mr. President, this bill has millions of dollars of soft money \ncontributions behind it. And I'm sure that the donors of those \ncontributions believe they are doing the right thing for their \ncompanies by giving them. But it is very interesting that the leaders \nof major corporations, whose money drives this soft money system, are \nincreasingly uncomfortable with it. In a poll of top business \nexecutives from the 1,000 largest companies in the United States, \nreleased last Wednesday by the Committee for Economic Development, 79 \npercent of the respondents said they believe the campaign finance \nsystem in this country is broken and needs to be reformed. Sixty \npercent of respondents agree that soft money should be banned.\n  So even among those interests that benefit from the soft money \nsystem, there is strong support for ending it. And the reason for that, \nI believe, is two-fold. First, America's businesses and business people \nare tired of being hit up for money. Year after year, these credit card \ncompanies have been sending money to the parties and Members of \nCongress hoping for some return, and I think they are tired of it.\n  Second, Mr. President, business leaders in this country are coming to \nrealize how bad this system looks to the public, how poorly it reflects \non the legislative and political process. The word is out, for example, \nabout this bankruptcy bill. It is not necessary, it goes too far, it's \nunfair and imbalanced. Newspapers have editorialized against it; law \nprofessors have written op-ed pieces about what's wrong with it; news \nmagazines have done exposes of the money behind it. The monied \ninterests have succeeded in getting the bill back to the floor, and \nthey may get it through the Congress. But if it passes, the bill and \nthis body will not have the respect of the American people or the \npress. That's why America's business leaders want reform of the system \nMr. President, because they know very well it taints all of us, even \nthe legislation that they so desperately want the Congress to pass.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to look about this Senate \nChamber and examine its form. Since January 4, 1859, this Senate has \ndone business in this open room, ringed all around by galleries for the \npeople. To the west, behind me, are the public visitors' galleries. To \nthe north, behind the Presiding Officer, are the wooden desks of the \npress, who report our proceedings to the Nation.\n\n  The Senate began holding sessions open to the public more than 206 \nyears ago, on February 20, 1794. The Senate opened galleries for the \npublic in December 1795. The first radio broadcast from the Senate \nChamber took place in March of 1929.\n  Some Senate hearings appeared on television as early as 1947. Many \ncredit ABC's live coverage of the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1953 with \nhelping to turn the tide against McCarthyism. Twenty years later, \nanother generation learned about democracy as Senator Sam Ervin \npresided over the Watergate hearings in 1973.\n  The Senate began radio broadcasts of floor debate in 1978 with the \ndebate on the Panama Canal Treaty. The House began televising its floor \nproceedings in 1979. The Senate opened its proceedings to television on \na trial basis\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nin May 1986. And since June 2, 1986, C-Span has carried our debates to \nviewers throughout the Nation.\n  We conduct ourselves in the open like this because the Senate best \nserves the Nation when it conducts its business on this Senate floor, \nopen to the public view. It is here, on this Senate floor, that each of \nthis Nation's several states is represented. And it is here, in their \ndebate and votes on amendments and measures, that Senators become \naccountable to the people for what they do.\n  The Senate is distinctive for the amount of work that it used to do \non the Senate floor. In contrast to the House of Representatives, where \nmore work is done in committee, the Senate used to do more work on the \nfloor.\n  The majority today diminishes the Senate floor in favor of the \nbackroom conference committee, chosen to address these issues by none \nbut themselves, accountable to none but themselves, and open to \nobservation by none but themselves.\n  The proceedings of the Senate floor are open to view because, as \nJustice Louis Brandeis wrote, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of \ndisinfectants.''\n  William Jennings Bryan put it this way: ``The government being the \npeople's business, it necessarily follows that its operations should be \nat all times open to the public view. Publicity is therefore as \nessential to honest administration as freedom of speech is to \nrepresentative government.''\n  It is a legal maxim that ``Truth fears nothing but concealment.'' And \nit follows as night follows day that concealment is the enemy of truth.\n  As Justice Brandeis also wrote, ``Secrecy necessarily breeds \nsuspicion.'' How will the public gain confidence in the work of the \nSenate if the public cannot see its operations?\n  Morley Safer once said that ``All censorship is designed to protect \nthe policy from the public.'' If the majority had confidence in its \npolicy, would it not do its business in the light of day?\n  As Senator Margaret Chase Smith said on this Senate floor on \nSeptember 21, 1961, ``I fear that the American people are ahead of \ntheir leaders in realism and courage--but behind them in knowledge of \nthe facts because the facts have not been given to them.''\n\n  In another context, Senator Robert Taft said on this Senate floor on \nJanuary 5, 1951:\n\n       The result of the general practice of secrecy has been to \n     deprive the Senate and the Congress of the substance of the \n     powers conferred on them by the Constitution.\n\n  And as Senator Kennedy, our distinguished colleague, warned in 1996:\n\n       This . . . is a vote about whether this body is going to be \n     governed by a neutral set of rules that protect the rights of \n     all Members, and by extension, the rights of all Americans. \n     If the rules of the Senate can be twisted and broken and \n     overridden to achieve a momentary legislative goal, we will \n     have diminished the institution itself.\n\n  And that, in the end, is what has happened here. Four Senators who \nhad the good fortune to be named to confer on an embassy security bill \nhave taken it upon themselves to conduct the business and exercise the \npowers that the Constitution vested in the Senate and the Congress.\n  In 1973, the nuclear physicist Edward Teller said, ``Secrecy, once \naccepted, becomes an addiction.'' Mr. President, my fear is that this \nmajority will simply continue down this path of snuffing out minority \nrights, creating one legislative Frankenstein after another.\n  Senator Kennedy warned in 1996: ``It will make all of us less willing \nto send bills to conference . . . .'' My fear is that we can no longer \ntrust any conference committee.\n  On this Halloween, I fear for what legislative creatures will walk \nabroad as long as this majority holds power. I, for one, will stand \nguard against them and fight them. In defense of the Senate, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me, Senator Wellstone, and others, and oppose this \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope every Democrat or staff member \nheard the words of Senator Feingold. His words will be memorable in \nterms of the record of the Senate. They are prophetic for now and in \nthe future. I thank the Senator for the power of his presentation, for \nthe power of his words.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois how much time he thinks he will need.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before beginning, I say to the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, two of our colleagues, Senator Dorgan and Senator \nHarkin, have asked for 10 minutes each, I think Senator Harkin first. I \ndo not know if the Senator wants to make that part of his unanimous \nconsent request at this time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I did tell Senator Harkin I would grant him some time. \nI want to allow some time for myself to speak in opposition to this as \nwell. Let me see how things go.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11398-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11398-S11401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, you can expect the Halloween thing to be \npart of most of our speeches on the floor today regardless of the issue \nat stake. It is Halloween, and children of all ages will be dressing up \nin their favorite costume and ringing doorbells yelling: Trick or \ntreat.\n  Our Halloween tradition that we enjoyed as kids, and even as adults, \ndates back to Celtic practices, when on this day witches and other evil \nspirits were believed to roam the Earth, playing tricks to mark the \nseason of diminishing sunlight.\n  The 106th Congress is waning. Our legislative days will soon be \ncoming to an end, and we will be ending the legislative term with a \ncruel legislative trick: a bankruptcy conference report masquerading as \na State Department authorization bill. You know Congress is close to \nadjournment when slick procedural maneuvers are used to bring a one-\nsided work product to the Senate floor.\n  The majority found a shell conference report, they basically held a \nmeeting without an official conference committee, struck the contents \nof the original bill, and plugged in the bankruptcy bill that we have \nbefore us today. Rather than negotiate with Democrats directly or work \nto produce a bipartisan bill that the President might support, they \nwent back to their old tactic: Take it or leave it; this is the \nRepublican version; this is the version supported by business. Take it \nor leave it.\n  When I hear all the claims in the Presidential campaign about \nbipartisanship, I shake my head when I look at the Republican \nleadership in the Senate and the House which continuously stops the \nDemocrats from participating. If we are going to have bipartisanship, \nshouldn't we have it on a bill as important as bankruptcy reform?\n\n  Let me say from the outset, I support bankruptcy reform. Two years \nago, I was on the Judiciary Committee and the subcommittee with \njurisdiction over this issue. Senator Grassley and I spent countless \nhours with our staffs trying to come up with meaningful and fair \nbankruptcy reform.\n  We had a good bill. Ninety-seven Members of the Senate voted for it. \nI thought that was a pretty good endorsement of a bipartisan effort, \nbut it has gone downhill consistently ever since.\n  That bill was then trapped in a conference committee that was totally \nRepublican, no Democrats allowed. They brought back a work product that \nwas the byproduct, I guess, of the best wishes of the credit industry. \nIt had no balance to it whatsoever. Frankly, it was defeated. Then we \nturned around--I guess it wasn't called; it would have been defeated by \nPresidential veto.\n  Then over the next 2 years, others worked on this issue, and I hoped \nwe would return to a bipartisan approach. It did not happen. So for all \nof the calls for bipartisanship by the Republican side of the aisle, \nwhen it comes to conference committees, no Democrats are allowed. \nRepublicans said: Take it or leave it. In this case, we should \ndefinitely leave it.\n  The bankruptcy code is a complex piece of law. When I was debating \nthis in earlier years, I marveled at the fact that I was considered to \nbe one of the spokesmen on the issue of bankruptcy.\n  What is my experience in bankruptcy? Thirty years ago I took a\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\nbankruptcy course in law school, and 20 years ago I was a trustee in a \nbankruptcy in Springfield, IL. That is the sum and substance of my \nexperience in bankruptcy, and I turned out to be one of the more \nexperienced people at the table on the issue, one I had to relearn the \ncomplexities of in a short period of time.\n  A constant theme has guided me through this debate, and that is: Yes, \nthere are people who go to bankruptcy court and file, abusing the \nsystem, gaming the system, trying to avoid their responsibility to pay \ntheir just debts. I believe that is the case, and if this law is \ndirected at those people, I am for it.\n  Secondly, I believe there are abuses on the other side as well. I do \nnot need to tell the others who are gathered and those following this \ndebate how many credit card solicitations you receive at home. Quite a \nfew, I bet. I will go through some statistics in a few minutes about \nthe volume of credit card solicitations.\n  I have a godson in Springfield, IL, Neil Houlihan. He is now 7 or 8 \nyears old. He got his first credit card solicitation at the age of 6. \nThis is a bright young man, but I do not believe that at the age of 6, \nwhen you are learning to ride a bicycle, you should have a credit card \nin your back pocket. Obviously, MasterCard did and sent Neil his \nsolicitation.\n  They have sent solicitations to children, people in prison, and \nfamily pets. Everyone gets one. Every time you go home at night, you \nsort through all the offers to give you a new credit card. In a way, it \nis flattering; you feel empowered: You get to make that decision. In \nanother way, the credit card industry would have us carry as many \npieces of plastic in our pocket as possible, with little or no concern \nas to whether we can handle the debt.\n\n  What I believe--and I hope others agree with me--is we should not \nration credit in America nor should we ration information about credit \nin America. We ought to know, as individuals, what the terms of these \ncredit card agreements are, what the traps are that you can hardly read \nwith a magnifying glass on the back of your statement. We have a right \nto know what we are getting into. If it is a caveat-emptor situation, \nit is not fair. Consumers have a right to know.\n  The democratization of credit in America has made this a better place \nto live. I understand the fact that not too many years ago, if a woman \nwas a waitress in a restaurant, the likelihood that she could get a \ncredit card was next to zero. Today she could qualify for one. That is \na good development.\n  We have to look at the abuse of solicitation of credit cards and what \nit leads to. The credit card industry wants us to close down the \nloopholes in the bankruptcy code, but they do not want us to look at \nthe loopholes in their own system. When I explain the details, my \ncolleagues will understand.\n  They say this is a reflection on the moral decadence of America; that \nso many people are filing for bankruptcy. I assume those who abuse the \nsystem may be morally decadent. Let someone else be the judge of it. At \nleast it raises that issue.\n  I asked the credit card industry: Do you have a moral responsibility? \nAre you meeting your moral responsibility? When you flood people who \nare not creditworthy with solicitations for more credit cards, are you \nmeeting your responsibility? When you put ATMs at casinos, are you \nmeeting your responsibility? When you go to football games and \nbasketball games at the college level on up and say, We can give you a \nbeautiful sweatshirt that shows the University of Illinois symbol if \nyou, as a student, will sign up for a credit card, are you meeting your \nmoral responsibility?\n  When the dean at Indiana University says the No. 1 reason kids drop \nout of school is credit card debt--they have so much debt accumulated, \nthey have to go to work and try to pay some of it off--are you meeting \nyour moral responsibility?\n  This field of morality can be a little tricky, but this credit card \nindustry does not believe they have a special responsibility in this \ndebate. I think they are wrong.\n  In 1999, there were 3.5 billion credit card solicitations mailed to \nAmerican households. Let me tell you why that is interesting. There are \n78 million creditworthy households in America and 3.5 billion credit \ncard solicitations. Do you ever wonder why your mailbox is full of \nthese solicitations? They are, frankly, coming at you in every \ndirection, and it is not just through the mails; it is in magazines; it \nis on television; it is everywhere you turn. They try to lure you into \nsigning up for another credit card with very few questions asked.\n  These 3.5 billion credit card solicitations, frankly, do not tell you \nall you need to know about the obligations you are incurring.\n  I continue to believe, as I did when this debate got started, when we \npassed a strong disclosure provision, that consumers were entitled to \nknow some very basic things.\n  This is one of the things I suggested but which the credit card \nindustry rejected. It is just this simple. I think they ought to say, \nin every credit card statement: If you make the minimum monthly payment \nrequired, it will take you X number of months to pay off the balance. \nWhen you have paid it off, this is how much you will have paid in \ninterest and how much you will have paid in principal.\n  That is not a tough thing to calculate; it is not a radical \nsuggestion; it is disclosure, so that someone who looks at a credit \ncard debt--let's say they want to pay the 2 percent monthly minimum on \n$1,295.28--is told, as part of routine disclosure, it will take them 93 \nmonths--that is more than 7 years--to pay off the balance. And when it \nis all over, their payments will have come to $2,418, almost twice the \noriginal balance.\n  The credit card industry said that is an outrageous disclosure that \nthey would disclose this to people to whom they send monthly \nstatements. At first they said it was not technologically possible. \nThat is laughable, in this world of computers, that they could not tell \nyou that basic information. They do not want to tell you that because \nthey understand, as long as people are paying that minimum monthly \npayment, they are going to be trapped forever in paying more and more \ninterest.\n  There are times when people cannot pay more than the minimum monthly \nbalance. That is a decision--a conscious decision--consumers should \nmake. But I think the credit card industry owes it to people across \nAmerica to tell them the terms of what they are getting into. Frankly, \nthey have resisted that all along.\n  It is my understanding that a lot of the language we have put in here \nabout credit card disclosure, and even saw in the Senate bill, has \nbasically been eliminated. It is my understanding that it has been \nweakened in many respects.\n  The Republican leadership brings this bill to the floor and permits \nbanks with less than $250 million in assets--and that, incidentally, is \nover 80 percent of the banks in America--to have the Federal Reserve \nprovide its customers with a toll free number to review their credit \ncard balances for the next 2 years. So instead of telling you on a \nmonthly statement, with all the information they pile in--all the \ncirculars, all the advertising--they are going to give you an 800 \nnumber and say: You can call here, and maybe they will answer your \nquestion as to how much you are ultimately going to have to pay. You \nknow that isn't going to happen. The credit card industry knows it is \nnot going to happen. That is as far as they want to go.\n  Let me tell you about another thing that is amazing. It is called the \nhomestead exemption. Did you know, in most States now, if you file for \nbankruptcy, you are allowed to claim as an exemption--in other words, \nprotected from the bankruptcy court and your creditors--your homestead, \nyour home? But every State has a different standard about how much you \nare allowed to exempt.\n  My colleague, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, basically said we ought to \nget right of this because fat cats go out and buy magnificent homes and \nmansions and ranches and farms and call them their homes, plow \neverything they have into them, and then say to their creditors they \nhave nothing to put on the table.\n\n  We had instances where the Commissioner of Baseball many years ago--\none of the former Commissioners of Baseball--managed to protect a \nmansion in\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nFlorida because he bought it in time before he filed for bankruptcy. We \nhad a lot of well-known actors and actresses who turned around and did \nthe same thing in southern California.\n  The average person does not have that benefit. Many States do not \nallow much more than a modest exemption for the homestead. We said, \nunder Senator Kohl's amendment, that we would create a $100,000 \nnationwide cap on homestead exemptions. I think it makes sense. But, \nfrankly, it did not survive. Now, under this bill that is before us, if \nyou have owned property for more than 2 years, then there is virtually \nno limitation. It is up to the States to decide again. I think that is \na mistake. This is a departure.\n  The other area is clinic violence. This gets to a point that is worth \nspeaking to. Senator Schumer of New York brought this point forward. If \nsomeone is engaged in violence at an abortion clinic--and it has \nhappened; we have seen it happen--and they are found to be responsible \nin a court of law for their wrongdoing, and they are held responsible \nfor damages to be paid, in many cases all they need to do is file for \nbankruptcy, and they are virtually discharged of all responsibility on \nthat debt.\n  I think that is wrong. By a vote of 80-17 the Senate agreed with me. \nBut Senator Schumer's amendment did not survive this conference, and it \nis not going to be considered. As a result, we find a situation where \nthose who are guilty of clinic violence, people such as Randal Terry \nand Flip Benham, have usurped our clinic protection laws by feigning \nbankruptcy.\n  Did you know, even student loans are not dischargeable under \nbankruptcy under chapter 13? Yet these folks have been engaged in \nviolent activity, found guilty by a jury of their peers, and use this \nbankruptcy code as a shield.\n  I tried to add some provisions in the Senate bill that gave the \nbankruptcy judges more flexibility in applying a means test for \nmoderate-income debtors. It was stricken from the bill.\n  Who actually files for bankruptcy? It is interesting to see. You \nmight think that it is the high rollers, but it turns out to be some of \nthe poorest people in America. The average income of people filing for \nbankruptcy over the last 20 years continues to go down. That income, at \nthis point, is below $25,000 a year for the people who are filing for \nbankruptcy.\n  Why do people file for bankruptcy? Some of them may have calculated \nhow they can come out ahead by doing it. But look at what happens in \nmost cases. Older Americans are less likely to end up in bankruptcy \nthan younger Americans, but when they do file, 40 percent of them give \nmedical debt as the reason for filing. Elizabeth Warren of Harvard \ntells us, overall, 46 percent of the people filing for bankruptcy do so \nbecause of medical debt.\n  We spent a lot of time on the Senate floor talking about hospital \nbills and prescription drug bills. When people become so overwhelmed by \na catastrophic illness, they end up in bankruptcy court.\n  Both men and women are more likely to declare bankruptcy following \ndivorce. That is the second instance in people's lives, divorces. They, \nof course, end up with a situation where people have to file because \nthey can't make ends meet. The spouse who has the responsibility of \nraising the children may find herself in bankruptcy court.\n\n  The way this bill is written, there is not adequate protection for \nthose women. That is why most women's groups, as well as consumer \ngroups, oppose this bill as written.\n  Of course, unemployed workers who lose their jobs; that is the third \ninstance that drives people into bankruptcy court.\n  So you find over and over again that the catastrophic events of a \nlifetime force people into bankruptcy court. Most of them do not go \nthere because they want to. They are forced into that situation. This \nbill does not help them, does not protect them. Basically, it provides \nmore power for the creditors and less power for the debtors who find \nthemselves in these awful circumstances.\n  An interesting thing has occurred since this debate started 3 or 4 \nyears ago. There was a lot of complaints about the number of bankruptcy \nfilings going up in America in a time of prosperity. That was true. It \nis a strange thing, but people get overconfident and they get too far \nin debt, and they can't get out or they run into one of the three \ncatastrophes that I mentioned. But something has happened.\n  In the first 37 weeks of this year, 861,846 people filed for \nbankruptcy. That is a lot of people. But basically the number of \nbankruptcy filings is on a decline. According to a study by the \nUniversity of Maryland's Department of Economics, ``Remarkably, there \nhave been 138,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in the current year to \ndate than during the corresponding period of 1998, a cumulative decline \nof greater than 15 percent in the per capita bankruptcy rate.'' So that \nsays to us, the explosive growth of bankruptcies has turned around. I \ncannot tell you exactly why, but that was one of the reasons why we \neven started discussing this bill.\n  It was told to us by the White House and the chief of staff of the \nPresident, John Podesta, the President will veto this bill as written. \nI hope he does. I hope those who support meaningful bankruptcy reform, \nbalanced bankruptcy reform, will realize we cannot go through this \nprocess on a slam dunk, take it or leave it; Republicans will meet and \ndecide--and Democrats will be left out--and pass a bill of this \nsignificance.\n  The groups that oppose this include not only the AFL-CIO, \nrepresenting working men and women across America, but also NARAL, the \nNational Partnership for Women and Children, the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, the Religious Action Center, the Consumers Union--\nvirtually every one of them--75 law professors from across the country \nwho have tried to take an objective look at this bill, even groups from \nmy own home State of Illinois. The Bankruptcy Center, which over the \npast 3 years has filed over 6,000 bankruptcies on behalf of their \nclients, has written me with their concerns about the bankruptcy bill.\n  So it comes down to this. We have a lopsided bill, perpetrated as \npart of a political process around here that is becoming too common, \nwhere they take a bill that has nothing to do with bankruptcy and shove \nthe contents into it. And the Republicans dictate what will be in it \nand do not even invite the Democrats to participate in the discussion, \nbring it to the floor and say: Take it or leave it.\n  The credit industry that wants this bill refuses to concede the most \nbasic concessions to us when it comes to the disclosures they would \nmake on credit card solicitations and the monthly statements on the \nbill so that consumers can make a rational choice about how much credit \nthey can handle. They basically have told us: This is it; take it or \nleave it.\n  I think we should leave it. It is time for us as a Nation to say, \nyes, we can reform bankruptcy but do it in a balanced fashion.\n  I salute my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, for his \nleadership. I hope colleagues on both sides of the aisle will think \ntwice and join me in voting against cloture. This bill needs further \ndebate, the debate it did not have in conference committee. I hope we \ncan come up with a better work product.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 1 minute because our leader \nis on the floor.\n  I thank Senator Durbin. I only heard part of what he said but the \nconclusion especially. I will build on what he said, except I won't do \nit as well.\n  Whatever Senators think about the content of this bill--and there is \nmuch to question--it is a much worse bill than the bill passed by the \nSenate before. Senator Durbin has more credibility on this because he \nworked on the original bankruptcy bill and was responsible for much of \nits content which was much better than what we have seen in recent \ndays. This is a mockery of the legislative process. Any minority, any \nSenator, anyone who loves this institution, can't continue to let \npeople in the majority take a conference report, gut it, and put in a \nwhole different bill, and then bring it here and jam it down \neverybody's throats. I certainly hope Senators who care about this \nlegislative process, and who care about the rights of the minority and\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nabout a public process with some accountability, will at least vote \nagainst cloture. I think that is almost as important an issue as the \ncontent, in terms of the future of this body. I am not being \nmelodramatic about it.

Mr. President, I will use my leader time to depart from \nthe ongoing colloquy with regard to the cloture vote on the bankruptcy \nbill to talk about the status of negotiations on the Labor and \nEducation bill that has been the subject of a good deal of discussion \nover the last several days.\n  I think the headlines give us the current state of affairs with \nregard to the bill probably as succinctly as any headline can. The \nWashington Post, from a front page story above the fold this morning, \nsimply stated the fact: ``Budget Deal is Torpedoed by House GOP. Move \nby leadership angers negotiators on both sides.'' That was the \nWashington Post.\n  The Los Angeles Times said it as well in their headline: ``GOP \nLeaders Scuttle Deal in Budget Battle.'' They go on to describe exactly \nwhat happened in the budget battle on education over the course of the \nlast several days.\n  The Washington Times had virtually the same headline, which simply \nread: ``House Leaders Spike Deal On Budget.''\n  The only word missing in most of these is the word ``education.'' \nBecause that is what the budget was about, the fight was about what \nkind of a commitment to education we ought to be making in this new \nfiscal year, now well underway. This is the last day of October. Of \ncourse, the fiscal year began on the first day of October. While the \nheadlines didn't say it, this is what they were talking about.\n  We had a bipartisan plan that was worked out over the last several \ndays with great effort on the part of Chairman Stevens and Chairman \nYoung, certainly on the part of Senator Byrd, Senator Harkin, \nCongressman Obey. They worked until 2:30 Monday morning to craft what \narguably could have been the single most important investment we will \nmake in education in any fiscal year in the history of the United \nStates. That is quite a profound and dramatic statement. I don't think \nit is hyperbole because we were prepared to invest more in education, \nmore in smaller classes, more in qualified teachers, more in modern \nschool buildings, more in afterschool programs, with a far better \naccountability program, with increased Pell grants, with more \ninvestment for children with disabilities and those preparing to go to \ncollege than we have ever made in a commitment to education in our \nNation's history. That was what was on the table.\n  Of course, as we negotiated these very complicated and controversial \nprovisions dealing not only with education but whether or not we can \nprotect worker safety, all of those issues had to be considered very \ncarefully. It was only with the admonition of all the leaders to give \nand to try to find a way to resolve our differences that we were able \nultimately to close the deal, resolve the differences, and move forward \nwith every expectation that the Senate and House would then be in a \nposition to vote on this historic achievement as early as Tuesday \nafternoon.\n  That is what happened.\n   So instead, today we are debating cloture on the bankruptcy \nconference report when we could have had an incredible opportunity to \nput the pieces together to give children real hope, to give school \ndistricts all over this country for the first time the confidence they \nneed that they can address the myriad of problems they are facing in \neducation today; to say, yes, we are going to commit, as we have over \nthe last couple years, to ensure we have the resources to reduce class \nsize and to hire those teachers and to break through, finally, on \nschool modernization and school construction. We could have addressed \nthe need for 6,000 new schools with the modernization plan that was on \nthe table when the collapse occurred.\n  I come to the floor dismayed, disheartened, and extraordinarily \ndisappointed that this had to happen, that the House leaders, House \nRepublican leaders, spiked a deal that could have created this historic \nachievement.\n\n  What do we tell the schoolteachers? What do we tell the students? \nWhat do we tell all of those people waiting patiently and expectantly, \nwho are hoping we could put partisanship aside and do what we came here \nto do. Forget the rhetoric, forget the conflicts, forget all the things \nwe were supposed to forget in bringing this accomplishment about.\n  I don't know where we go from here, but this is part of a pattern. It \nisn't just education. There is an array of other issues. And perhaps \nthis is an appropriate day to remind my colleagues of, once again, the \nGOP legislative graveyard. We can put up, perhaps, another tombstone \ntoday.\n  I think we can still revive this. Somehow I think there is still a \npossibility that we can do this. I don't know if it will happen this \nweek--I don't know when it will happen--but I can't believe we are \ngoing to turn away from having accomplished what we could have \naccomplished with all of this.\n  Everybody understands that we may not have another chance. I am not \nprepared to put education into the legislative graveyard Republicans \nhave created. But there isn't much chance we are going to deal with pay \nequity this year. There is no chance we are going to deal with campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Let us make absolutely certain that when we come back early next \nyear, we enact the Patients' Bill of Rights. That is a tombstone for \nthe 106th Congress. Hate crimes, judicial nominations, the Medicare \ndrug benefit, gun safety: all are tombstones to inaction. All are a \nrecognition of the failure of this Congress to come to grips with the \nreal problems our country is facing, a realization that now there is \nnot much we can do anything about, except to rededicate ourselves to \nensure that we will never let this Congress again take up issues of \nthis import and leave them buried in the legislative graveyard.\n  Let us hope that we can revive school modernization and smaller class \nsize. Let us hope that somehow, in the interest of doing what is \nright--we recognize how close we were Monday night, we recognize how \nimportant it is that we not give up, we recognize how critical it is \nthat something as important as education will not be relegated to this \nlegislative graveyard, or any other. Let us hope that in the interest \nof our children, in the interest of recognizing the importance of \nbipartisan achievement in this Congress, that we will do what is right, \nthat we will take these headlines and turn them around and change them \ninto headlines such as ``GOP Leaders And Democratic Leaders Agree on \nBudget Deal,'' or ``Democratic Leaders And Republican Leaders Agree To \nHistoric Education Achievement''; with editorials that would say to the \neffect that, at long last, we have given children hope all over this \ncountry and we have given schools the opportunity to reduce their class \nsize and improve educational quality without exception.\n  That is still within our grasp. I must say, the tragedy of all \ntragedies would be, somehow in the name of partisanship and in the name \nof whatever competition some may feel with the administration on this \nor any other issue, that we fail to do what is right; we fail to make a \ncommitment that we know we can; and that we end up building more \nmonuments to the lack of progress and real commitment to the issues \nabout which people care most.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor with the expectation that we can \novercome the obstacles that remain and we truly can make a difference \non education in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I listened to my colleagues today--Senator \nFeingold, Senator Durbin, Senator Wellstone, and now the Democratic\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nleader, Senator Daschle--talk about a number of different issues. I \nwant to take a moment to discuss my disappointment, as we near the end \nof this legislative session, with what this Congress could have \naccomplished, what we could have done for the American people, and what \nwe left undone.\n  I note that in this Presidential campaign Governor George W. Bush \ntalks about his desire to come to Washington, DC, to serve in the White \nHouse, and end the partisan bickering. As he says, he wants to ``end \nall of the partisan bickering.'' Well, it takes two to bicker and it \ntakes two parties to bicker in a partisan way.\n  We have almost, on occasion, had debate break out in the Senate on \nsome very important issues. But we never quite had that happen this \nyear because we can't get to an aggressive, robust debate on the things \nthat really matter.\n  My colleagues talked about the bankruptcy bill. How did they do the \nconference on the bankruptcy bill? One party goes into a room, shuts \nthe door, handpicks their members, and writes it by themselves. It is \nhard to have bickering, and it is hard to be partisan when one party is \ndoing the work behind a closed door and saying to the other party: Here \nit is; like it or leave it.\n  The tradition of debate in this country is the sound of real \ndemocracy. The sounds of democracy results from bringing people from \nall around America into our centers of discussion and debate. From all \nof those areas of the country--from a different set of interests and \nconcerns, from the hills and the valleys and the mountains and the \nplains and different groups of people--we have ideas developed and \nnurtured and then debated.\n  Someone once said: When everyone in the room is thinking the same \nthing, nobody is thinking very much.\n  We have people here who kind of like the notion that you must think \nthe same thing. Apparently, Governor Bush thinks we must all kind of \nthink the same thing; we ought to stop all this disagreement.\n  Disagreement is the engine of democracy. Debate is the engine by \nwhich we decide what kinds of policies to implement and what course \nthis country takes in the future. The issues on which we never quite \nhad the aggressive, robust debate that we should have had in this \nCongress include education. Do you know that for the first time in \ndecades this Congress didn't reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act? We didn't pass it. Why? Because it was feared that when \nthe bill was brought to the floor, people would actually offer \namendments. Then we would have to debate amendments and vote on \namendments. God forbid a debate should break out in the Senate. So the \nbill was pulled after a short debate. So we let the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act lapse. It just didn't get done.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is another issue. We had sort of a mini \ndebate here in the Senate on that because it was judged that there \nwasn't enough time to allow a robust debate. The Patients' Bill of \nRights was not considered significant enough to allow a very robust \ndebate on the different positions of the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nThese, of course, are not just abstract discussions. The issue of \nwhether we need a Patients' Bill of Rights is a very significant issue \nfor a lot of American people who are not only battling cancer, but also \nhaving to battle their HMO or insurance company to pay for needed \nmedical treatment.\n\n  I have shown my colleagues many times during discussions on the floor \nof the Senate a picture of Ethan Bedrick. He was born with horrible \ndifficulties. He was judged by his HMO to only have a 50-percent chance \nof being able to walk by age 5, which means that his HMO said a 50-\npercent chance of being able to walk by age 5 was ``insignificant.'' \nTherefore, they withheld payment for the rehabilitative therapy that \nEthan Bedrick needed.\n  An isolated story? No, it goes on in this country all too often, day \nafter day. I have told story after story on the Senate floor about it. \nWe weren't able to get a final vote on this issue. We should have had a \nvote on the issue of a Patients' Bill of Rights toward the end of the \nSenate session because we would have had a tie vote, and the Vice \nPresident would have sat in that Chair and broken the tie. The Senate \nwould have passed a real Patients' Bill of Rights if given the \nopportunity to vote again.\n  Do you know why we weren't able to do that? Because those who run \nthis place didn't want a debate to break out. So they managed the \nSenate in a way that blocked any amendment from being offered. Since \nSeptember 22 until October 31, not one Member of the Senate on this \nside of the aisle was allowed to offer one amendment on the floor of \nthe Senate that was not approved by the majority leader. That is why a \nreal debate didn't break out on the issue of the Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  The issue of fiscal policy is important in this country because we \nare now in the longest economic expansion in our country's history, and \nhow to continue it is something we would want to have an aggressive, \nrobust debate on. The majority party said: Well, all of this economic \nexpansion is just all accidental. It didn't really result from anything \nanyone did.\n  Well, of course, that is not true. We passed a new economic plan in \nthis country in 1993.\n  In 1993, we had the largest deficit in the history of this country. \nThis country was headed in the wrong direction, and a new \nAdministration, President Clinton and Vice President Gore, said let's \nchange that; we have a new plan. It was controversial. It was so \ncontroversial it passed by one vote in the House and one vote in the \nSenate. Not one Republican voted for it.\n  They stood on the floor and said: If you pass this, you will throw \nthis country into a depression, and you are going to cost this country \njobs, and you will just crater this country's economy.\n  Well, we passed it and guess what happened? The longest economic \nexpansion in our country's history. Unemployment is down, inflation is \ndown, home ownership is up, personal income is up, welfare rolls are \ndown, crime is down, every single aspect of life in this country is \nbetter because of what we did in 1993.\n  Now comes George W. Bush and the Republican Party saying: Do you know \nwhat we need to do now? We expect budget surpluses in the next 10 \nyears. We need to take a trillion and a half dollars and use it for tax \ncuts. Let's lock those tax cuts into law right now.\n  Well, a number of groups have provided some very interesting analyses \nof this plan. Do you know what the threat is? Providing substantial tax \ncuts, the bulk of which will go to the top 1 percent, will put us right \nback in the deficit ditch we were in 8 years ago.\n  Don't take it from me. The risks of this kind of fiscal policy were \ndescribed last week by the American Academy of Actuaries, which is one \nof the most respected nonpartisan organizations of financial and \nstatistical experts. Their report says the Bush plan would probably \nsignal a return to Federal budget deficits around 2015.\n\n  I encourage anybody to read their analysis. This is an independent, \nnonpartisan, respected group that says this tax cut proposal doesn't \nadd up at all; it doesn't add up.\n  One of the questions is, Do we want to jeopardize the economic \nexpansion that has been going on in this country, the progress we have \nmade in this country, an economic plan that turned this country around? \nDo we want to jeopardize that with a fiscal policy that doesn't make \nany sense, that will put us back into the same deficits? Or what about \nhaving a debate on the question of Governor Bush's proposal of taking \n$1 trillion out of the Social Security surplus and using it for private \nSocial Security accounts for younger workers?\n  This is what Governor Bush said about that:\n\n       . . . and one of my promises is going to be Social Security \n     reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollars out of \n     that $2.4 trillion surplus.\n\n  I don't know whether Governor Bush knows this, but the trillion he is \ntalking about is already pledged. The reason we talked earlier about \nputting Social Security surpluses in a lockbox is we need them. The \nlargest group of babies ever born in this country will retire in the \nnext 10, 15, and 20 years. We are saving to meet their retirement \nneeds. That is the $1 trillion. You cannot use it twice. It has been \nsaved to meet the needs of the Baby Boomers, which is what it was \ndesigned for, or you can take it away and use it for private accounts \nfor younger workers,\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nwhich is what Governor Bush suggests. If that is the case, you will \nshort change Social Security by $1 trillion. You can't count $1 \ntrillion twice.\n  I simply make the point that on the issue of fiscal policy, we should \nhave had a real debate on the floor of this Senate on fiscal policy. \nWhen Governor Bush and others say they don't like the partisan \nbickering, I don't suppose anybody likes it in those terms. I like \nrobust, aggressive debate. I think that is the sound of democracy in \nthis country.\n  When people say they have plans to take $1 trillion out of Social \nSecurity, I say let's debate that. When they say let's have tax cuts \nthat go to the upper income people and I think that will put the \ncountry back in a deficit ditch once again, I say let's debate that. \nWhen they say we don't have time to reauthorize the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act because somehow it is not important enough, I \nsay that ought to be the subject of aggressive debate in the Senate.\n  Let's not shy away from debate. Let's understand what good, \naggressive, honest debate does for this democracy, and let's have a few \ndebates from time to time on things that really matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was going to speak about the bankruptcy \nbill and how bad it is for working families, especially the elderly, \nand talk about how most of the people who are getting into bankruptcy \nsituations are families who have unusually high medical bills. That is \ntrue in my State of Iowa, and many of these are elderly people. I will \ntalk about that as we go along.\n  However, I have to take a few minutes today to follow up on what our \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, just spoke about a few minutes ago. \nThat is the status of the most important bill we have to pass, the \neducation bill.\n  One day has passed since Republican and Democratic negotiators came \nto agreement on the health and education appropriations bill for this \nyear. As I said on the floor yesterday, the agreement we reached was a \nproduct of long and difficult bipartisan negotiations. Senator Stevens, \nSenator Byrd, Senator Specter, and I, along with Congressmen Bill \nYoung, Dave Obey, and John Porter, worked for months to craft this \nagreement. We worked past 1:30 yesterday morning to hammer out the last \nremaining differences. As I said yesterday, as with any honorable \ncompromise, both sides gave and got. At times, the negotiations got a \nlittle heated, but both sides hung in there.\n  In the end, we came up with a good compromise. Chairman Stevens and \nChairman Young led these final negotiations. They have been charged by \ntheir leadership to come to closure so we can conclude our business and \npass the bill. That is exactly what they did.\n  Less than 12 hours after we reached an agreement and our staffs were \nbusily writing the final conference report, a faction within the House \nRepublican leadership, led by Congressman DeLay and Congressman Armey, \ndecided to renege on our bipartisan compromise. As I said yesterday, I \nhope, in the interests of our children and our country, they will \nreconsider and let the bill go forward.\n  None of us is happy with everything in this bill. That is what \nbipartisan compromise is all about. Overall, passing this bill is in \nour Nation's best interests.\n  Right now, I will mention a few more details of the agreement we \nreached to demonstrate to my colleagues and the American people why it \nis so important. There is a 16-percent increase overall in education; \nclass-size reduction, 35 percent more. That means 12,000 new teachers \nwill be hired across America this next year.\n  There is a provision I have been working on for 8 years called school \nmodernization. There is $1 billion included for school modernization, \nthe first time we have ever had it. If the Iowa experience is any \nstandard--and I think it will be--this should generate somewhere \nbetween $7 and $9 billion in needed school repairs around the country.\n  Individuals with disability education grants go from $4.9 billion to \n$6.9 billion, a 40-percent increase, the largest in history, to help \nour local school districts educate our kids with special needs; also, \n$250 million in funds to increase accountability and to turn around \nfailing schools. That is almost double what it was before. We had the \nlargest increase ever in Pell grants, to make college affordable to \nworking families. In this bill, 70,000 more kids will be able to get \nHead Start, bringing the total in our Head Start Program to 950,000 \nkids.\n  There is money in there for youth training and youth opportunity \ngrants; a 66-percent increase in money for child care; community health \ncenters, up $150 million to $1.2 billion, meaning 1.5 million more \npatients can be served next year; the important low-income heating and \nenergy assistance program, $300 million more; Breast and cervical \ncancer screening, so that women can get the needed preventive health \ncare they need, an $18 million increase; NIH, a $1.7 billion increase, \nthe largest in our Nation's history. Afterschool care is almost double; \nit means 850,000 children will be served by afterschool programs. Also \nin the health end, 9,600 more research projects, one of which could \nbring major medical breakthroughs in cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's \ndisease, or Parkinson's disease. That is what is in this bill. Forty-\ntwo thousand more women would be screened for breast and cervical \ncancer. That is cost effective and saves lives.\n  There are a lot of things in this bill that are too important to be \ndestroyed by last-minute partisan politics. As I said, nothing is \nperfect. The conference agreement has a number of items about which I \nhave concern. For example, at the insistence of Republicans, an \nimportant regulation protecting workers from workplace injuries such as \ncarpal tunnel syndrome was delayed yet again. We have delayed these \nworker protections for 3 years now, and last year's conference report \ncontained explicit language that they would not be delayed any \nfurther. Yet as part of the give and take of the final negotiations, \nlanguage was included to delay implementing this regulation until June \n1.\n\n  Each year over 600,000 American workers suffer disabling, work-\nrelated muskoloskeletal disorders, like carpal tunnel syndrome and back \ninjuries. Employers spend $15 to 20 billion a year just for workers \ncompensation related to these injuries. The estimated annual total cost \nto workers and the Nation due to ergonomics is a high as $60 billion, \naccording to the Department of Labor. So this is a major problem.\n  This proposal was initiated under Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole in \nthe Bush administration 9 years ago. This is not a partisan issue. It \nis a worker protection issue plain and simple.\n  Apparently, that is not good enough for Mr. DeLay. He wants to kill \nthis important worker protection outright. I do not see how we can face \nthe 600,000 people who are injured each year and say, ``No, your health \nand your safety just aren't important enough to be protected.'' How can \nyou say, with a straight face that protecting these workers from \nserious injury is a ``special interest provision.\n  So I again urge the House Republican leadership to reconsider their \ndecision to kill this important bill. We had a good, honest bipartisan \nagreement. Nobody loved every part of it, but it was decided upon \nhonorably and in good-faith.\n  This is what the American people want and need. They want us to work \ntogether in good faith and to come up with a product that is in their \nbest interest. A lot of sweat and debate and compromise went into doing \njust that. It is late, but it is not too late to bring back our \nagreement.\n  I am confident we would have more than enough votes in the House and \nSenate to pass it. And I have personally been assured by President \nClinton that he would sign it as it come out of committee.\n  We ought to do what is right.\n  I just learned a few minutes ago that there is a possibility we are \ngoing to renege on the agreement that we reached in conference; that \nthe language we adopted there is now being changed to reflect original \nlanguage that we conferees talked about, fought over, discussed, \nchanged, modified over a period of about--over a period of a couple of \nmonths but finally, Sunday night, over a period of about 2 or 3 hours. \nWe finally reached language with which everyone agreed. I am now being \ntold that language is being thrown out. It is being thrown out and\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nwe are going back to the initial language that was the source of the \ncontention.\n  If that is so then, indeed, we have reached a very bad situation in \nthis Congress. If this is what happens, what it means is when we go to \nconference with the House and we come up with our compromises and we \nshake hands on it, we sign our names to it, if you happen to be in the \nmajority, and you want to change it, then tough luck; it means \nabsolutely nothing. We operate on our word around here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Our word is our bond. When you can't trust people to keep \ntheir word, this institution goes downhill. I am afraid that is what is \nhappening now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Senator \nHarkin for his presentation. Let me thank other Senators who have \nspoken, both about what has happened to the Labor, Health and Human \nServices appropriations bill and also about this bankruptcy bill. I say \nto my colleague from Iowa, to tell you the truth, this is part of the \nsame pattern. He is talking about abuse of the legislative process, \ntalking about a complete breakdown of bipartisanship, a complete \nbreakdown of trust. That is exactly what you have here when you have a \nState Department bill, a conference report that is completely gutted, \nnot a word in there any longer about it, the only thing left is the \nnumber, and then what is put in, instead, is a bankruptcy bill. \nDemocrats were not consulted at all, in an effort to jam it through. \nThat is the same principle.\n  I would think and hope every member of the minority party who cares \nabout our rights, who cares about an open legislative process, who \ncares about integrity of the political process, would vote against \ncloture tomorrow because my colleague is talking about the same \nprocess.\n  It might sound very much like an inside thing to people who are \nfollowing this. I know everything is focused on the election. But \nhonest to God, American people, it is not. When these kinds of \ndecisions can be made by a few people with no sunlight, no scrutiny, no \nexposure, you have a real abuse of the process. What can happen is that \nusually the people who are hurt are the little people.\n  Let me tell you, the people who are involved in this kind of process, \nthe behind-the-doors process, sticking stuff in in conference \ncommittees, gutting conference reports, are folks who are well heeled, \nwho have the lobbyists who know how to work this process for them. But \nthe people who get hurt are not involved at all. That is what I want to \ntalk about. I want to talk about the way in which this conference \nreport, this bankruptcy bill harms the most vulnerable citizens in this \ncountry, people who find themselves in desperate economic \ncircumstances.\n\n  Please remember, Senators, 50 percent of the people who file for \nchapter 7 do it because of a medical bill that puts them under. Please \nremember: There but for the grace of God go I.\n  You can be as frugal as possible. You can be prudent. You can try to \nmanage your family finances. And then you can have a medical bill that \ncan put your family under. It took my family, my parents, 20 years to \npay off a medical bill of years ago. Many people cannot do that. They \nfind themselves in a horrible situation and then as a last resort, in \norder to rebuild their finances and sometimes just stop the harassment \nby creditors, in order to get back on their feet, people file for \nbankruptcy. That is what this piece of legislation is all about--making \nit impossible for people who, through no fault of their own, find \nthemselves in terrible financial circumstances, unable to rebuild their \nlives and instead wind up essentially in debt slavery for the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  I think one of the things that has helped us in this debate--because \nI am confident Senators now see some of the harshness in this \nlegislation--was a May 15, 2000, issue of Time magazine. The cover \nstory was entitled ``Soaked By Congress.'' It deals with this \nbankruptcy bill.\n  Although, frankly, not as harsh a version--it was a better version \nthat Time magazine talked about--this article was written by reporters \nDon Bartlett and Jim Steele, who have, I think, won a Pulitzer for \ntheir work. They do great investigative research. It is a detailed look \nat the true picture of who files for bankruptcy in America.\n  You will find a far different picture in this Time magazine than the \nskewed version that has been used to justify this mean-spirited and \nharsh legislation. This article carefully documents how low- and \nmiddle-income families, increasingly headed by a single person, usually \na woman, are denied the opportunity of a fresh start if this punitive \nlegislation is passed. I hope Senators will vote against cloture.\n  As Brady Williams, who is chairman of the National Bankruptcy Reform \nCommission, notes in the article, the bankruptcy bill would condemn \nworking families:\n\n       . . . to what essentially is a life term in a debtors \n     prison.\n\n  Proponents of this legislation have tried to refute the Time magazine \narticle. Indeed, during these final days of debate you will hear the \nbill's supporters claim that low- and moderate-income debtors will be \nunaffected by this legislation. Colleagues, if you listen closely to \ntheir statements, you will hear that they only claim that such debtors \nwill not be affected by the bill's means test. Not only is that claim \ndemonstrably false, the means test and the safe harbor have been \nwritten in a way that will capture many working families who are filing \nchapter 7 relief in good faith, but it ignores the vast majority of the \nlegislation which still imposes needless hurdles and punitive costs on \nall families filing for bankruptcy, regardless of their income. Nor \ndoes the safe harbor apply to any of these provisions.\n  You might ask, why has the Congress chosen to be so hard on ordinary \nfolks down on their luck? How is it that this bill is so skewed against \ntheir interests and in favor of big banks and credit card companies? My \ncolleague, Senator Feingold from Wisconsin, spoke to that. It is \nbecause these families do not have the million-dollar lobbyists \nrepresenting them before Congress.\n  They do not give hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money to \nthe Democratic and the Republican Parties. They do not spend their days \nhanging outside the Senate Chamber waiting to bend a Member's ear. \nUnfortunately, it looks as if the industry got to us first. \nUnfortunately, that is what this is all about.\n  The proponents of this bill argue that people file because they want \nto get out of their obligations, because they are untrustworthy, \nbecause they are dishonest, because there is no stigma in filing for \nbankruptcy, but any look at the data tells us otherwise.\n  In the vast majority of cases--again, 50 percent of the cases--it is \na medical bill that has put people under or the main income earner has \nlost his or her job. There is a sudden illness, a major injury, major \nmedical expenses, someone has lost their job, there has been a divorce, \nand what we are saying to these people is: We make it impossible for \nyou to rebuild your lives. But when it comes to the lenders and the \ncredit card companies, oh, it is a very different story.\n  In the interest of full disclosure, something that the industry is \nnot very good at, I want my colleagues to be aware of what the credit \ncard industry is practicing, even as it preaches its sermon of \nresponsible borrowing. After all, debt involves a borrower but also a \nlender. Poor choices or irresponsible behavior by either party can make \nthe transaction go sour. So how responsible has the industry been?\n  I suppose it depends on how you look at it. On the one hand, consumer \nlending is terrifically profitable, with high credit card cost lending, \nthe most profitable of all, except for maybe the higher cost credit \nsuch as payday loans. I guess by the standard of responsibility to the \nbottom line, this credit card industry has done a great job.\n  On the other hand, if you define responsibility by promoting fiscal \nhealth among families, educating on the judicious use of credit, \nensuring that borrowers do not go beyond their means, then it is hard \nto imagine how the financial services industry could be bigger \ndeadbeats.\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\n  According to the Comptroller of the Currency, the amount of revolving \ncredit outstanding, the amount of open-ended credit by credit cards \nbeing extended increased seven times during 1980 and 1995 and between \n1993 and 1997. During the sharpest increase in bankruptcy filings, the \namount of credit card debt doubled. It does not sound as if lenders \nwere too concerned about the high number of bankruptcies. At least it \ndid not stop them from pushing credit cards like Halloween candy.\n  All of us know it: Our children are the ones who are solicited; our \ngrandchildren are the ones who are solicited. It is unbelievable. This \nindustry feels no responsibility, it feels no accountability, and in \nthis one-sided, unjust piece of legislation, there is absolutely no \nstandard they are asked to live up to.\n  I again say to my colleagues that the case has been made that we have \npeople in the country who are abusing the system, but I have not seen \nany report that has reported higher than 13 percent, and the American \nBankruptcy Institute says 3 percent. So much for that argument.\n  Then we have an argument that somehow these are people who feel no \nstigma, feel no shame. I have talked to colleagues--I cannot believe \nit--and they say: Paul, my gosh, shouldn't people manage their \nfinancial affairs, and if they don't, shouldn't they be held \naccountable? Yes. Pass a piece of legislation that does that, but do \nnot pass a piece of legislation that says to a family which is in \ndifficult, horrible financial circumstances, through no fault of its \nown, because of a major medical illness or because someone has lost \ntheir job or because there is a divorce, do not make it impossible for \nthem to file chapter 7 and then unable to make it through chapter 13 \nand then essentially live a life of constant debt servitude, a life \nbasically full of debt with no opportunity to rebuild lives.\n\n  We are stripping away the major safety net, not just for the poor but \nfor middle-class people as well. That is why so much of the religious \ncommunity opposes this. That is why so many women and children \norganizations oppose it. That is why every consumer organization \nopposes it. That is why the civil rights community is opposed to it.\n  The argument is then made that this is a reform piece of legislation. \nHow can it be a reform bill when it is so one sided? How can it be a \nreform bill when it is so punitive? How can it be a reform bill when, \nin the name of going after abuse--only a tiny percentage of the \npopulation--it casts such a broad net and will make it so difficult for \nso many families, especially middle-income, low- and moderate-income \nfamilies headed by women to rebuild their lives? And how can it be \ncalled ``reform'' when it is so one sided and does nothing whatsoever \nto call this credit card industry and these lending institutions to \naccountability?\n  This legislation is unfortunately perfectly representative of an \nimbalance of power in America where some people--and I see the Chair is \nnow looking at me. I appreciate that because he extends that courtesy \nto all of us. I never mean my arguments personally, especially of \ncolleagues I trust at a personal level. In an institutional way, some \npeople march on Washington every day. They are so well connected. They \nhave the lobbyists. They have the money. They make the arguments. They \nhave the prestige. They have the status. And that is what happened \nhere.\n  Up until this Time magazine expose, there were so many stereotypes \nand a lot of information about this legislation that was not accurate. \nAs it turns out, it is imbalanced; it is unfair; it is unjust; it is \ntoo harsh, too punitive, and it is not right. This piece of legislation \nshould not go forward tomorrow. I have tried to make arguments to \ndefend this proposition, and other Senators have as well.\n  What Senator Feingold said is true. In a lot of ways, \ninstitutionally, not one on one, this is also an example of an industry \nthat has poured a tremendous amount of money into elections, an \nindustry which has tremendous financial clout. What in the world is \nsomeone to do when her family or his family is going under because of a \nmedical illness? Fifty percent of bankruptcy cases are filed as a \nresult of that, and we are going to make it impossible for these people \nto rebuild their lives?\n  What is someone to do when the low- and moderate-income earners do \nnot have this clout and do not have these connections? What are single-\nparent homes to do, almost always headed by a woman?\n  We should pass a bankruptcy reform bill, but this does not represent \nreform.\n  One final thing, and I doubt whether I am going to get any Republican \nsupport, but I wish I would. I am not making a payback argument, and if \nI end up behaving differently, then call me a hypocrite, but this is no \nway to legislate.\n  In the Senate, minority rights count. You should not be able to take \na conference report and then--it is not even a question of putting a \nprovision in, I say to the Chair, that is unrelated to the conference \nreport. In this case, it is a State Department conference report, \ncompletely gutted--invasion of the body snatchers--not a word left \nabout the State Department. The only thing left is a bill number. Now \nit is bankruptcy sent over here. The minority was not even consulted. \nSenators should vote against cloture for that reason alone because the \nminority one day is the majority the next and vice versa, and we should \nrespect each other's rights.\n  Someone can say to me: Senator Wellstone, you hypocrite. When you \nwere in the majority, you did exactly the same thing; you, Paul \nWellstone, were involved. I do not know of this having been done. I \ncannot remember. I certainly never did it; never would.\n\n  I appeal to my colleagues on the basis of fairness. You might not \nagree with me on the substantive arguments--although this bankruptcy \nbill is now worse than it was before; and I went over two provisions \nthat have been taken out--but you might agree with me just in terms of \nthe rights of a legislator and the way in which this process ought to \nwork.\n  This is an affront to this legislative process. This makes a mockery \nof this legislative process. This is a reform issue. You wonder why \npeople are so disillusioned and turned off about politics in the \ncountry? Here is one good reason why. People do not quite understand \nhow a State Department bill all of a sudden becomes a bankruptcy bill, \nwith a whole new set of provisions put in unrelated to the original \nbill. And then an effort is made to jam it through here. People do not \nget that.\n  It might be clever, I say to the majority leader and others, but it \ndoes not meet the test of representative democracy. It does not meet \nthe test of the Senate as a great institution. It does not meet the \ntest of what this legislative process should be all about. It does not \nmeet the test of how we can become good legislators and good Senators. \nFor that reason, I hope colleagues will vote against cloture.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11405-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11405-S11409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate now proceed to the consideration of the conference \nreport to accompany S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     2796), ``to provide for the conservation and development of \n     water and related resources, to authorize the Secretary of \n     the Army to construct various projects for improvements to \n     rivers and harbors of the United States, and for other \n     purposes,'' having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the House and agree to the same with an \n     amendment signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 19, 2000.)\n\n\n                  Export of Water from the Great Lakes\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act \naddresses many of the water resource needs of our nation. But it also \nincludes a provision relating to the export of water from the Great \nLakes which needs some clarification. Would the distinguished chairman \nand ranking member be willing to join Senator Abraham and myself to \nclarify a few points about this language?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. president, I would be pleased to offer information \nabout this provision to my colleagues.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am also pleased to discuss this \nprovision.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, we need to make it clear that the phrase ``and \nimplementation'' in the findings of subsection(a) does not constitute a \n``pre-approval'' of standards which are being developed by the \nGovernors of the Great Lakes States. Would the chairman and ranking \nmember concur that it is not the intent of this provision to grant pre-\napproval to standards which we have not seen?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I would concur; it is not the intention \nof the conferees that this provision be interpreted as granting pre-\napproval to standards which have not yet been developed and which \nCongress has not reviewed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I echo the chairman's sentiment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the chairman and ranking member also concur that it \nis not the intent of this provision to pre-empt the need for future \nappropriate congressional actions in this area?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would concur. This language should not be interpreted \nas pre-empting the authority of Congress to approve or disapprove an \ninterstate compact, international agreement, or other such mechanisms \nof implementation which properly fall under congressional authority. it \nis simply the intent of the conferees to encourage the States to \npromptly take such actions to implement these standards as fall within \ntheir authority for management of the water resources of their \nrespective states and within the authority vested in them by the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986 for making decisions regarding \ndiversions of Great Lakes water.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I concur with the ranking member's \ninterpretation.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. On a second matter, this language uses the phrase \n``resource improvement'' as one principle in encouraging the states to \ndevelop a common conservation standard. This phrase is intended to \nembody the concept of improvement of the quality of the natural \nresource, not the development of the resource. Is that the \nunderstanding of the chairman and ranking member?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes, as use din this section, the term \nresource improvement is intended to convey the concept of an \nimprovement to the natural resource. The alternative interpretation \nwould not be consistent with the parallel directive that the standard \nembody the principles of water conservation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I concur with this interpretation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I also wish to thank my colleague from Michigan for \njoining in the effort to clarify the intent of this provision. I still \nhave reservations as to whether this provision represents the best \napproach to addressing the issue of water diversion and export which \nfaces the Great Lakes region today, but these clarifications of the \nintent of the provision relieve some of my concern.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the chairman, ranking member, and my colleague \nfrom Michigan. Mr. President, Senator Levin has been a leader in the \neffort to protect the Great Lakes on a wide variety of fronts. Clearly \ntoday's work will not completely guarantee the protection of this great \nresource, but I believe it is a big step in the right direction. I want \nto thank Senator Levin for his help in this matter, particularly for \nhis work to eliminate the likelihood of unintended consequences from \nthis legislation. I look forward to working with him in the future as \nwe fight to protect this great resource.\n\n\n         the ten- and fifteen-mile bayous flood control project\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as we complete work on the Water \nResources Development Act (WRDA) of 2000, I would like to bring the \nSenate's attention to a project that is very important to a group of my \nconstituents in Arkansas: the Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou project. The \nTen and Fifteen Mile Bayou project would provide flood control to a \npoor, rural area in the Mississippi Delta that is oftentimes overlooked \nwhile other projects in more affluent, urban areas move forward. The \nDelta's small farming communities and poor minorities are the \nconstituencies most affected by the constant flooding that this project \nseeks to prevent. It is vitally important to the future of this Delta \nregion to alleviate these flooding concerns.\n  I have worked with the St. Francis Levee Board on this important \nproject since my days in the House of Representatives. Unfortunately, \nthe resources of this community are extremely limited and they are \nunable to meet the cost share requirements of any federal program. Can \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana please explain section 204 of \nthe current WRDA bill dealing with ``the ability to pay'' provision? \nSpecifically, I am interested in hearing how this provision might help \nprojects, like Ten and Fifteen Mile Bayou, that are needed but simply \ncan not meet the cost share requirements.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate your concern about flooding in the Saint \nFrances River Basin and your frustration with efforts to address this \nsituation. Many communities across the nation simply do not have the \nfinancial ability to provide the cost share for Corps studies and \nprojects. Because of this, Congress added an ``Ability to Pay'' \nprovision to the Water Resources Development Act in 1986. This \nprovision, which establishes procedures for reducing the non-federal \nshare of water resource development project costs for distressed \ncommunities, has been amended several times subsequently. These \nprocedures, which are set by the Corps through regulation, take into \nconsideration local economic and financial conditions.\n  This year, the administration's Water Resources Development Act \nlegislative proposal contained an update to the Ability to Pay \nprovision which included expanding its applicability to feasibility \nstudies and additional project types. The Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee further expanded the project types eligible and this \namendment to the Ability to Pay provision is contained in the \nConference Report.\n  Our intention is that these changes will result in the Ability to Pay \nprovision being used more frequently by the Corps and providing greater \nrelief to communities that cannot meet ``standard'' Corps cost-share \nrequirements. While I am not familiar enough with specifics of the Ten \nand Fifteen Mile Bayou project to judge the application of the Ability \nto Pay provision, I would encourage the Corps to pay particular \nattention to the applicability of the provision to this flood control \nproject.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I also appreciate the financial hardships \nfaced by communities in West Memphis as well as in many other areas of \nthe country. I also expect that the amendments to the Ability to Pay \nprovision contained in this Conference Reports will increase the Corps' \nuse of this provision and, thereby, the relief provided to communities \nwith financial hardships.\n  In addition, it is important for Congress to monitor the \nimplementation of the Ability of Pay provision. To accomplish this, the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am the \nchairman and Senator Baucus is the ranking member, will hold oversight \nhearings next year on the Corps' historical and current performance as \nit relates to the application of Ability to Pay provisions of the Water \nResource Development Act.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank my colleagues for their comments and I look \nforward to working with them on this important matter.\n\n\n                        programmatic regulations\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nFlorida to clarify one section of the Water Resources Development Act \nof 2000. Section 2(h)(3)(C)(ii) includes language from the House \nclarifying the applicability of programmatic regulations.\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nOne of the most important elements of the formula for success which \nbrings us to the floor of the Senate with this conference report today \nis the open process used by the Corps of Engineers to develop consensus \npositions on a course of action. I want to clarify my colleague's views \non the language in this section. Do you believe that this language will \nlimit the public's ability to participate and comment on the \ndevelopment of project implementation reports, project cooperation \nagreements, operating manuals, and any other documents relating to the \ndevelopment, implementation, and management of individual features of \nthe Plan?\n  Mr. MACK. This language is not intended to affect the public's \nability to participate and comment on the development of project \nimplementation reports, project cooperation agreements, operating \nmanuals, and any other documents relating to the development, \nimplementation, and management of individual features of the plan. In \naddition, this language is not intended to expand any one federal \nagency's authority. I share your view that the Corps' open process is \none of the most important aspects in building the consensus which makes \nthis Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan strong.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Members of the 106th Congress, thank you \nfor this opportunity to stand before you today as a proud Member of \nthis body. We are on the verge of passing historic, comprehensive \nlegislation to restore America's Everglades.\n  This is a dream I have had since early childhood when I lived on the \nedge of the Everglades in a coral rock house. I witnessed the \nmanipulation of the Everglades from a serene, river of grass into a \nfunnel built for human purposes.\n  Over the decades, I joined other Floridians in finding that moment of \ntruth--the moment when we realized that our actions were destroying \nthis ecosystem which is the very heart of Florida. I was proud to start \nthe ``Save Our Everglades'' program in Florida during my tenure as \nGovernor.\n  I thank everyone who took that giant leap with me in 1983 to begin to \ndo what appeared to be impossible--to make the Everglades look more \nlike it had in 1900 than it did in 1983 by the year 2000.\n  We have taken several first steps.\n  In 1992 the Kissimmee River restoration project demonstrated that we \ncan, in fact, restore portions of a damaged ecosystem.\n  In 1996 the critical projects authorization allowed us to begin on \nprojects with an immediate benefit to the environment. That same year, \nwe began the ``restudy'' of America's Everglades.\n  I offer my thanks again to the people of Florida who toiled endlessly \nto produce the consensus document, the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan which is the basis for the legislation we will pass \ntoday.\n  Names like Colonel Joe Miller, Dick Pettigrew, Stu Appelbaum, and Tom \nTeets and will ring in Florida's history as people who sacrificed \npersonal gain for the future of this project, people who built \nconsensus where none could even be visualized, and people whose \nexpertise built the very foundation of our plan to restore the \nEverglades.\n  Today, we are ending one chapter and beginning another in the history \nof America's Everglades.\n  We are officially ending the chain of events that we began in 1948 \nwith the authorization of the Central and Southern Florida Flood \nControl Project which, according to the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociation, brought the parks and preserves of the Everglades to a \nprominent spot on the list of the 10 most endangered in the country.\n  We are beginning the chapter of restoration.\n  After 17 years of bipartisan progress in the context of a strong \nFederal-State partnership, we are seeing the dream that many of us \nshared in 1983 become reality.\n  I want to speak for a moment about this unprecedented Federal-State \npartnership. I often compare this unique partnership to a marriage.\n  If both partners respect each other, and pledge to work through any \nchallenges together, the marriage will be strong and successful. Today, \nwe are again celebrating the strength of that marriage.\n  This legislation contains several provisions born out of the respect \nthat sustains this marriage.\n  It offers assurances to both the Federal and State governments on the \nuse and distribution of water in the Everglades ecosystem.\n  It requires that the State government pay half the costs of \nconstruction.\n  It requires that the Federal Government pay half of the costs of \noperations and maintenance. Everglades restoration can't work unless \nthe executive branch, Congress, and State government move forward hand-\nin-hand. The legislation before us today accomplishes this goal.\n  With the vote we are about to take--to pass the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2000--we are truly making history.\n  We will be one step closer to restoring the damage done when \nhumankind had the arrogance to second-guess nature.\n  With this project we are doing nothing less than turning back time, \nreturning this dying place to the wild splendor of its past and in \ndoing so, ensuring its future.\n  If we accomplish the historic goal of restoring America's Everglades \nthen today will be one our children and grandchildren will remember.\n  They will look back on this as the day that our generation had the \ncourage and the foresight to make a commitment to restoring one of \nAmerica's richest national treasures.\n  In the words of President Lyndon B. Johnson:\n\n       If future generations are to remember us with gratitude \n     rather than contempt, we must leave them more than the \n     miracles of technology. We must leave them a glimpse of the \n     world as it was in the beginning, not just after we got \n     through with it.\n\n  Today is the day we will make the choice to leave a glimpse of \nAmerica's Everglades as they were when we first found them for future \ngenerations--an undisturbed river of grass, unmatched in serenity and \nbeauty.\n  Mr. BAUCUS, Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Smith in supporting \nthe conference report on S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act \nof 2000.\n  This conference report authorizes projects for flood control, \nnavigation, shore protection, environmental restoration, water supply \nstorage, and recreation. The bill also modifies existing projects and \ndirects the Corps to study other proposed projects. All projects in \nthis bill have the support of a local sponsor who is willing to share \nthe cost of the project.\n  Even a brief review of the projects demonstrates the importance of \npassing this conference report.\n  A number of the projects are needed to protect our shorelines, along \noceans, lakes, and rivers.\n  Several of the navigation projects will ensure that our ports remain \ncompetitive in the increasingly global marketplace.\n  Furthermore, the studies authorized in the bill will help us make \ninformed decisions about the future use and management of our water \nresources.\n  Let me mention two projects that are very important for my state of \nMontana.\n  First, the authorization for design and construction of a fish \nhatchery at Fort Peck. This fish hatchery will make good on a long \nawaited promise of the Fort Peck project; namely, more recreational and \neconomic opportunities for the folks in eastern Montana.\n  Fort Peck Lake is one of the greatest resources in our state. It not \nonly plays a major role in power production and water supply, but it is \nan increasingly important center for recreation. People from around the \nstate--as well as from around the world--come to Fort Peak for our \nannual walleye tournaments.\n  The local community really puts a lot of effort into these \ntournaments. And they've put a lot of effort into the Fort Peck \nhatchery. Communities across eastern Montana have raised funds for the \nmatching share of the project's feasibility study.\n  And the state legislature has contributed as well. It passed a \nspecial warm water fishery stamp to help provide additional financial \nsupport for the hatchery.\n  The fish hatchery will help to ensure the continued development of \nopportunities at Fort Peck Lake. And it will also represent a major \nsource of jobs and economic development for this part of the state.\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\n  I would also like to point out the bill's provision relating to the \nexchange of cabin sites leased by private individuals on federal land \nat Fort Peck Lake.\n  The lake is surrounded by the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife \nRefuge. Yet, there are many private in holdings in the refuge.\n  This provision will allow the cabin leases to be exchanged for other \nprivate land within the refuge that has higher value for fish, \nwildlife, and recreation. By consolidating management of the refuge \nlands, the provision will reduce costs to the Corps associated with \nmanaging these cabin sites. It will also enhance public access to the \nrefuge.\n  This exchange is modeled on a similar project near Helena, Montana, \nwhich Congress authorized in 1998. It represents a win-win-win for the \npublic, the wildlife, and the cabin site owners.\n  Mr. President, let me further mention a truly landmark provision in \nthis conference report. In addition to the usual project authorizations \ncontained in a water resource development act, this report represents \nCongress with a historic opportunity. Title VI of this report contains \nthe Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.\n  Restoration of the Everglades has been many years in the making. In \nthe 1970s, the State of Florida became concerned that the previously \nauthorized Central and South Florida project was doing too good a job \nat draining the swampy areas of the state. In fact, it was draining the \nlife out of the Everglades.\n  Our colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, who was then Governor \nGraham, began the effort to restore the Everglades by establishing the \n``Save Our Everglades'' program. And Senator Graham has worked \ntirelessly to achieve restoration ever since. The comprehensive plan to \nrestore this invaluable ecosystem that is contained in the conference \nreport before us is the culmination of his work.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Smith, for his unwavering commitment to \nmaking this Water Resource Development Act a reality. Further, I would \nlike to thank him for the personal investment he made in keeping this \nconference report focused on projects central to the mission of the \nCorps.\n  I know he was under tremendous pressure to open this report up to any \nnumber of inappropriate provisions, but he remained steadfast in his \nopposition and he should be commended for this. So, too, should his \nstaff. They worked tirelessly to craft a Water Resources Development \nAct of which they can be proud.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Jo-Ellen Darcy and Peter Washburn of \nmy staff for their dedication to this legislation. A tremendous amount \nof work goes into a Water Resources Development Act. So, I particularly \nacknowledge and commend the effort that Jo-Ellen and Peter devoted to \nmaking this conference report such a success.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, at this time, I ask \nunanimous consent that the conference report be adopted, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthis measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of \ncomments on the legislation that we just adopted. This has been a long \ntime coming. It is a culmination of some--actually, the Everglades \nportion of this legislation took a year of work. We had a hearing in \nJanuary at the Everglades. This is a very exciting time for those of us \nwho have worked on this. I want to briefly give a quick overview of \nthat and recognize a few people who have been involved.\n  This is a good bill. I am proud that we passed it. It is fiscally \nresponsible. It recognizes our obligation to preserve one of the most \nimportant and endangered ecosystems in the Nation, if not the world: \nAmerica's Everglades.\n  I thank the Senate conferees--Senators Warner, Voinovich, Baucus, and \nGraham--for their hard work and dedication.\n  I thank Chairman Shuster and the House conferees for their \ncooperation as well.\n  I am proud of this bill. This is not a bill that includes numerous \nunnecessary projects. The committee established some tough criteria, \nand we stuck to those criteria.\n  I am proud that the conference agreement on WRDA 2000 does not \ncontain any environmental infrastructure projects. As those who \nrequested such projects know, the committee has a longstanding \nopposition to including environmental infrastructure projects in WRDA.\n  Unlike what has happened in the past, the Senate conferees were able \nto hold firm, and the House accepted our position, for which we are \ngrateful.\n  These types of projects, in my view, should be funded through the \nState revolving loan funds and not by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  From the time this WRDA process began, the committee received \nrequests to authorize more than 300 new projects. By holding firm to \nour criteria--the conference report to WRDA--we were able to authorize \n30 new projects, 57 new feasibility studies, and a number of other \nproject-related provisions.\n  As I said before, Senator Baucus and I are committed to examining \nnext year the infrastructure issue, and other issues, relating to the \noperation and management of the Corps. This will include hearings on \nthe Corps reform.\n  Let me talk specifically for a moment on the Everglades. There is an \nimportant element that separates this WRDA bill from all others and is \nwhat makes it so historic.\n  This bill includes our landmark Everglades bill, S. 2797, the \nRestoring the Everglades, an American Legacy Act. It has been clearly \ndemonstrated that the Everglades are in great peril. Without acting \nnow, we could lose what is left of the Everglades in this generation. \nBut Congress is prepared to move forward and make good on a problem the \nFederal Government greatly contributed to causing.\n  It has been clearly demonstrated that the Everglades is a Federal \nresponsibility. Lands owned or managed by the Federal Government--four \nnational parks and 16 national wildlife refuges--compromise half of the \nremaining Everglades and will receive the benefits of restoration.\n  The State of Florida has stepped up to the plate thanks to Gov. Jeb \nBush and his legislature in Florida, on a bipartisan basis.\n  The Everglades portion of WRDA has broad bipartisan support. Every \nmajor constituency involved in Everglades restoration supports our \nbill. These bipartisan and wide-ranging supporters include the Clinton \nadministration, Florida Governor Jeb Bush, the Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida; industry groups, including Florida Citrus Mutual; Florida Farm \nBureau, the American Water Works Association; Florida Chamber of \nCommerce; Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, Southeast Florida \nUtility Council, Gulf Citrus Growers Association, Florida Sugar Cane \nLeague, Florida Water Environmental Utility Council, Sugar Cane Growers \nCooperative of Florida, Florida Fertilizer and Agri-chemical \nAssociation; and many environmental groups. To name just a \nfew: National Audubon, National Wildlife Federation, World Wildlife \nFund, Center for Marine Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife, National \nParks Conservation Association, the Everglades Foundation, the \nEverglades Trust, Audubon of Florida, 1000 Friends of Florida, Natural \nResources Defense Council, Environmental Defense, and the Sierra Club. \nIt is pretty unusual to bring the support of that many people on a \nmajor environmental bill to the Senate. I am proud to do it.\n\n  The Everglades bill is a great model for environmental policy \ndevelopment. It is cooperative. It is not prescriptive. It is \nbipartisan, and it is flexible and adaptive. We can change things. If \nwe don't like what is going on, if something isn't working, we pull \nback and try something new. It establishes a partnership between the \nFederal Government and the State and many other private groups as well.\n  Our colleagues in the House suggested improvements to the Everglades \npiece, and we made those. While it didn't always look promising, we \nwill see this bill become law before we go home, in the very near \nfuture, when the House passes it and the President signs it.\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\n  Last June, Bruce Babbitt called this ``the most important \nenvironmental legislation in a generation.'' I agree. It took a lot of \ncourage to work this through. This passed the Senate 85-1. It has broad \nsupport. And it will pass overwhelmingly in the House very shortly.\n  It is almost dangerous to mention anyone because once you mention \none, you are sure to omit some very important contributors. So with \napologies to anybody I miss, I thank the late Senator John Chafee \nbecause he started this committee's efforts on the Everglades. I went \nto Florida in January. I told the folks in Florida this would be my \nhighest priority and there wouldn't be much difference between John \nChafee and Bob Smith on saving the Everglades. I kept my word.\n  I thank the Senate conferees: subcommittee Chairman George Voinovich, \nSenator John Warner, ranking member Senator Max Baucus, Senator Bob \nGraham from Florida.\n  I also thank Senator Connie Mack and Governor Jeb Bush of Florida for \ntheir unrelenting efforts on the Everglades. Time and again we talked \nwith them. We kept working with them throughout.\n  From the administration, Carol Browner has been very helpful \nthroughout this affair.\n  I thank Mary Doyle and Peter Umhofer, Department of Interior; Joe \nWestphal, Michael Davis, and Jim Smythe from the Department of the \nArmy; Gary Guzy from EPA; Stu Applebaum, Larry Prather, Gary Campbell \nand many others from the Corps of Engineers; and Bill Leary from CEQ.\n  From the State of Florida, I thank David Struhs, Leslie Palmer, and \nErnie Barnett from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection; \nKathy Copeland from the South Florida Water Management District.\n  I thank the Senate legislative counsel: Janine Johnson, Darcy \nTomasallo, and Tim Trushel.\n  I thank the following staff members: from Senator Graham's staff, \nCatharine Cyr Ranson and Kasey Gillette; Senator Mack's staff, C.K. \nLee; Senator Voinovich's staff, Ellen Stein and Rich Worthington; \nSenator Warner's staff, Ann Loomis; Senator Baucus' staff, Tom Sliter, \nJo-Ellen Darcy, Peter Washburn, and Mike Evans; and my staff, Dave \nConover, Ann Klee, Angie Giancarlo, Chelsea Henderson Maxwell, \nStephanie Daigle, Tom Gibson, and Jeff Miles.\n  It was a great bipartisan effort. In spite of many roadblocks over \nthe past several months, we were able to work this bill through in a \nbipartisan manner. I am truly grateful to everyone on both sides of the \naisle for their tremendous support through a very difficult effort. \nThere were literally hundreds of projects that the staff had to pore \nthrough, and we did it.\n  When we look back on our careers, when we leave here and look back \nand say, What did I accomplish? I think we will be very proud of the \nvote to save the Everglades. I guarantee it. It will be right up there \nat the top. Once those Everglades are safe, we can say, when the time \ncame to stand up and make a difference, we did.\n  When I became chairman, I promised to make the Everglades my highest \npriority. I did. I also said we needed to look forward to the next \ngeneration, rather than the next election, in environmental policy.\n  We are now poised to send the President a conference report on WRDA \nthat has the support of every major south Florida stakeholder, the \nState of Florida, and the administration. Restoration of the Everglades \nis not a partisan issue. We proved it. The effort has been bipartisan \nfrom the start.\n  I congratulate my colleagues for daring to take the risk to support \nthis noble effort to save a national treasure. We need to view our \nefforts as our legacy to future generations, and this will be this \nSenate's legacy to future generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11409-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11409-S11413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 4 years ago, a theme in the election \nwas, ``It's the economy, stupid.'' Well, that is true in this election, \nbut there is something a little different: ``It's the energy crisis, \nstupid.''\n  The Vice President would have us think the economy is the issue that \nwill get him elected President, that he and President Clinton came up \nwith a plan to tax gasoline and Social Security benefits, and once he \ncast the tie-breaking vote to increase your taxes and my taxes, \ninterest rates came down, the stock market went up, and the economy \nprospered.\n  The Vice President and the Democrats conveniently ignore the fact \nthat the economy had already begun posting strong growth before \nClinton-Gore took office. That may sound like old hat, but the \nPresident's budget plans never once mentioned a balanced budget as a \npolicy goal at that time. Instead, those budget plans predicted annual \ndeficits of $200 billion a year well into the future.\n  As my colleagues and good friends Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, \nand others pointed out last night, the credit for our booming economy \nought to be given to a couple of people. Specifically, one is Dr. Alan \nGreenspan and the Federal Reserve, for a sound fiscal policy that \nprevented the onset of inflation. As we know, Greenspan has been around \na long time.\n  Further, a Republican Congress deserves some credit for putting \ncontrols on Federal spending and turning the deficit into a surplus.\n  I will not spend a lot of time today on that subject because I rise \nto talk about energy. I want to talk about the reality that the \nadministration has no energy policy. The energy policy in this country, \nfor what it is worth, is dictated by America's environmental community. \nThey accept no responsibility for the reality that we are short of \nenergy and becoming more and more dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  As we look at our economic prosperity over the past few years, there \nis a growing concern that it might be coming to an end, partially for \nlack of a sound national energy policy. Look at the American consumers \nout there. They are finding themselves under the shadow, if you will, \nof a failed energy policy. We have crude oil prices which are remaining \nsolidly at $30 plus a barrel but, remember, it was March of 1999 when \nit was $10 a barrel.\n  The administration blames ``Big Oil.'' They use the word \n``profiteering.'' Well, is the implication then, in March of 1999, that \n``Big Oil'' was giving us a gift of some kind, selling it to us at $10 \na barrel or was it supply and demand? Who sets the price of oil? Is it \nExxon? Is it British Petroleum? Is it Phillips? It certainly is not. We \nall know that.\n  It is from where we import the oil. It is Saudi Arabia. It is \nVenezuela. It is Mexico. They are setting the price of oil. Why? \nBecause we are approximately 58 percent dependent on imported oil. We \nare addicted to oil. We don't produce enough, so we pay the going \nprice. If we don't pay it, somebody else will.\n  Why has it gone up? The general economy of the world has gone up; \nJapan has recovered; Asia, more demand. We are a society that runs on \nenergy. All our communications, our expansion, our e-mail, computers, \nall are dependent on energy.\n  So American consumers are finding themselves in the shadow of a \nfailed energy policy, with crude oil prices at $30 plus a barrel--they \nhave been up as high as $37 a barrel--and gasoline prices averaging \nwell above $1.50 a gallon for most of the year. In some areas, they \nhave gone up to nearly $2 a gallon.\n  The sleeper here is natural gas. Americans haven't awakened yet to \nthe reality that natural gas prices have more than doubled. Ten months \nago, they were at $2.16 per thousand cubic feet of gas. Deliveries in \nNovember of this year, just beginning tomorrow, were at one time in the \narea of $5.30 to $5.40. I would remind my colleagues that 50 percent of \nthe homes in this country heat on natural gas.\n  U.S. consumers have dealt with electricity price spikes and supply \ndisruptions. All you have to do is go to San Diego, California; you \nwill get a flavor for what is happening. You can't get a permit to put \nin a new generating plant. Consumers are facing brownouts as a \nconsequence and prices are going up. People are closing their \nbusinesses. They cannot pay, in many cases, the rates that are being \ncharged in that particular area of California.\n  Heating oil inventories--which we are concerned about, particularly \nin\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nthe Northeast, where there is such dependence on heating oil--are at \nthe lowest level in decades. In fact, when the President proposed the \nsale of SPR--30 million barrels from the SPR reserve in Louisiana--and \nthen initiated an action to order the transfer of that crude oil into \nrefineries, we suddenly found that we had another problem--we didn't \nhave refining capacity; they were operating at about 96-percent \ncapacity. We took this additional oil out of SPR and we found out we \ncould not refine it without displacing other imported oil.\n  This was testimony in the House and Senate. In the hearing I chaired \nas Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, testimony \nindicated there would be, out of the 30 million barrels, about 3 to 5 \nmillion barrels of distillate. We asked the Under Secretary of Energy: \nHow much heating oil are you going to get out of 3 to 5 million barrels \nof distillate? Frankly, he didn't know.\n  There was another hearing going on in the House, and witnesses from \nthe same Department of Energy indicated there would be approximately \n250,000 barrels. A 1-day supply of heating oil in the Northeast is \nabout a million barrels. So it is somewhere between a half day's supply \nand 2 to 3 days' supply. This was all a result of the falderal \nassociated with the release of the SPR.\n  The objective of the SPR release was to increase the heating oil \nsupply in the Northeast Corridor. Did it occur? It clearly did not. Was \nthere manipulation of price? To some extent. It was $37 and it dropped \ndown to $33, or thereabouts, on that announcement. But it clearly \ndidn't increase the supply of heating oil, and that was the objective. \nCurrently, I am told the price of crude oil is $33.75 a barrel, but \nlet's remember from where we started--$37 per barrel.\n  The nice thing about what the OPEC nations have done is they have \ngradually assimilated a price increase so it doesn't hurt so bad. \nRemember, it was $10 a year ago. Then it got up to $17, $18, $19, and \nthen up to $22. At $22, OPEC advised us they were going to put in a \nfloor and a ceiling. The ceiling was $28; the floor was $22. That \nworked so well they moved it up beyond $28. Now they are in the low \nthirties. Well, the sky is the limit.\n  The point is that the administration has no energy policy. Now, how \nlong has it been going on? We point fingers here, and it is easy to do, \nparticularly in a political season. But we really don't have a \nstrategy. We need a strategy because the cost of increasing energy, the \nshortage of energy, and the increased dependence on imports is a \ncompromise of our national security.\n  Moving from national security back to the economy, economists now \nbelieve the increased energy prices could very well lead to a slowdown \nin consumer spending. Consumers are likely to cut back in other areas \nto offset the higher prices they are paying for gasoline, electricity, \nhome heating oil, or natural gas.\n  Recently, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated rising energy costs \nwould push up the cost of consumer goods. Why? Delivery costs are \nassociated with movement of these goods to market. We are seeing that \nas a reality. Wholesale prices, in September, increased nine-tenths of \n1 percent, led mainly by a 3.7-percent increase in energy costs. Where \nI come from that is called inflation. You don't need an economic degree \nto see it; the math is simple. Higher natural gas prices, plus higher \noil prices, plus higher gasoline and fuel oil prices, plus higher \nelectric prices, equals renewed increasing inflation. We haven't poked \nthat tiger in the ribs for a long time, but we are poking him now and \nhe is waiting. Somebody called him a ``sleeping dragon'' who has been \nsitting around for the better part of a decade. As we poke him in the \nribs with higher energy prices, we are going to face reality, which is \nan impact on the economy both here and in countries around the world.\n\n  A significant number of Fortune 500 companies have reported third \nquarter earnings under expectations, largely due to the increased \nenergy costs. Have you taken an airplane ride lately? You can't figure \nout the fares, whether you fly Saturday before 2 o'clock or Thursday \nafter 5 o'clock; but there is a surcharge included in your fare. If you \nwant a Washington, DC, taxi, there is a surcharge. There is a sticker \nin the cab that says the fares are up 50 cents or so because of the \ncost of gas. Every business is facing these costs. Fuel costs put the \nbrakes on truckers' profits. Furniture manufacturers have cut earnings \nprojections. We have seen truckers come into Washington and drive \ntrucks across the lawn, and they were talking about the high price of \ndiesel fuel. They say high gas prices are restraining shoppers from \nbuying furniture and other big-ticket items.\n  Well, many analysts predict high oil prices could reduce U.S. \neconomic growth by as much as 2 percent this year. What does that mean? \nOver the next five years, that would mean a loss in the GDP of about \n$165 billion a year, and about 5.5 million fewer jobs. We face an \nincreasing balance of payments from our ever-increasing reliance on \nforeign oil. That is a balance of payments deficit.\n  Our trade deficit hit an all-time record in July of this year, pushed \nby the cost of imported oil. One-third of our trade deficit is the cost \nof imported oil. We also face the prospect of, frankly, an unreliable \nelectric supply, weakening the backbone of the new economy.\n  Most people don't realize that high tech means high electric usage, \nmore computers, more e-mail, more taxes. From where will it come? Add \nthese together and you have the makings of an economic slowdown, \nmeltdown--call it what you like. The economic engine, which is \nresponsible for the incredible prosperity of the past decade, can begin \nto slow down and is beginning to slow down. Nobody really wants to face \nup to that because times have been good, but everything changes and \nnothing stands still.\n  What has been the response of the administration? Well, the \nadministration, of course, wants to take credit for the economic growth \nof the past few years, but they try to duck the responsibility for the \nimpending energy crisis that threatens to bring this period of \nprosperity to an end. The administration has consistently restricted \nour energy supply and forced higher energy prices on consumers. They \nhave specifically opposed domestic oil exploration and production. We \nhave 17 percent less domestic oil production--less production--since \nPresident Clinton and Vice President Gore took office.\n  We have had 136,000 oil and 57,000 gas wells close in this country \nsince 1992. We have tremendous coal reserves in this country, but the \nadministration is opposed to the use of that coal. We haven't built a \nnew coal fired plant since the mid-1990s. EPA permits make it \nabsolutely uneconomic. You can't get permits. The nuclear industry, \nwhich is about 20 percent of the power generated in this country, is \nchoking on its own waste.\n  We are one vote short in this body of overriding a Presidential veto. \nEvery Member who voted against it should remember that. You have a \nresponsibility. If you don't get your electric power from nuclear, from \nwhere are you going to get it? You better have an answer because when \nconstituents have a brownout, they are going to ask why.\n  There is a court of appeals liability case associated with the \nnuclear industry where the court said that the Federal Government made \na contractual commitment to take the waste in 1998. The Federal \nGovernment chose to ignore that liability to the taxpayers of somewhere \nin the area of $40 billion to $80 billion. Nobody bats an eye here. \nWhat is the sanctity of a contract? I know it means something to the \noccupant of the chair and to me. The court said the Government should \nkeep its word, but the Government simply ignores it. Somebody else is \ngoing to have to take care of it on another watch.\n\n  They also threaten to tear down hydroelectric dams out West. There is \na tradeoff. Tear down those dams, and we don't have navigation on those \nrivers. Where do we put the barge traffic? We put the traffic back on \nthe highways. What is the implication of that? You can move an awful \nlot of material on barges. If you move that same material on highways, \nyou are going to create traffic problems, pollution problems, and so \nforth.\n  We ignored electric reliability and supply concerns with the \nbrownouts in San Diego. We have had no new generation of transmission \nfacilities, yet the consumer market has grown. The Vice\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nPresident has said he will even go further to restrict new oil and gas \nexploration and production. In Rye, NH, on October 21, 1999, Vice \nPresident Gore made the following statement:\n\n       I will make sure that there is no new oil leasing off the \n     coast of California and Florida and then I will go much \n     further. I will do everything in my power to make sure that \n     there is no new drilling off these sensitive areas, even in \n     areas already leased by previous administrations.\n\n  That doesn't sound very good, when most of our oil is coming from the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  On energy, there is a clear distinction between the two sides. The \ndifference between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush could not be \nmore clear. The Bush proposal is $7.1 billion over 10 years; the Gore \nproposal is 10 times that amount, some $80 to $125 billion. The Vice \nPresident has said he has an energy plan that focuses not only on \nincreasing the supply but also working on the consumption side.\n  The facts show the Vice President doesn't necessarily practice what \nhe preaches. The Vice President wants to raise prices and limit supply \nof fossil energy which makes up over 80 percent of our energy needs. By \ndiscouraging domestic production, the Clinton-Gore administration has \nforced us to be more dependent on foreign oil, placing our Nation's \nsecurity at risk. All we have to do is witness the growing influence of \nIraq, Saddam Hussein, and the Middle East as a result of our increasing \ndependence on foreign oil. How can we be an honest broker in the Middle \nEast peace process when we are beholden to Israel's sworn enemy, Saddam \nHussein, to keep our citizens warm this winter?\n  We currently import 600,000 barrels a day from Iraq. The Vice \nPresident's only answer is to give solar, wind, and biomass energy \ntechnologies that are not widely available or affordable. We have \nexpended $6 billion in a combination of grants and subsidies for \nalternative energy. I am all for these alternative energies, but they \nstill consist of less than 4 percent of our energy. It is \nincomprehensible to me that we would fail to recognize that we have to \nrely on our conventional sources--oil, natural gas, hydroelectric, and \nnuclear. The Vice President seems to have forgotten these basic sources \nof energy. As a matter of fact, we need a mix of all of the above.\n  In contrast, Governor Bush would put together a comprehensive energy \npolicy for America that uses the fuels of today to get the technologies \nof tomorrow. The energy policy would contain three major components: \nFirst, increased domestic production of oil and natural gas to meet \ntoday's consumer demands for energy; second, increased use of \nalternative fuels and renewable energy to help us transition into the \ntechnologies of tomorrow; third, improve energy efficiency to save \nAmerican consumers money and reduce emissions of air pollutants and \ngreenhouse gases. Governor Bush would encourage new domestic oil and \ngas exploration right here at home. He has said: The only way to become \nless dependent on foreign sources of crude oil is to explore here at \nhome.\n  Just opening the ANWR Coastal Plain in my State increases domestic \nproduction capability by better than a million barrels a day, more than \ntwice the amount we currently import from Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \nwas in the Christian Science Monitor on October 18 of this year. They \ndid a poll on the issue of whether or not ANWR should be open.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 18, 2000]\n\n                    Public Wants SUVs To Guzzle Less\n\n                            (By John Dillin)\n\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       Americans, by a 2-to-1 margin, say that with gasoline \n     prices up, they favor government action that would force \n     automakers to boost the gas mileage of the wildly popular \n     sport utility vehicles. Congress has firmly resisted attempts \n     to boost mileage requirements for SUVs.\n       Growing public pressure to boost fuel requirements for SUVs \n     comes as something of a surprise. For more than a decade, the \n     vehicles have been family favorites for hauling everything \n     from plywood from Home Depot to camping gear on holiday \n     outings.\n       The federal government cooperated with this sleight of hand \n     by classifying minivans and SUVs as ``trucks,'' even though \n     they were being used primarily as passenger vehicles. Since \n     the standard for trucks was only 20.7 miles per gallon, that \n     overall requirement was easier for manufacturers to meet.\n                                  ____\n\n       A majority of adults say they'd be willing to drive a more \n     fuel-efficient vehicle to conserve energy. But many also \n     support drilling in Alaskan wildlife refuge.\n       The United States could soon get tough on those big, gas-\n     hungry SUVs.\n       Americans, by a 2-to-1 margin, say that with gasoline \n     prices up, they favor government action that would force \n     automakers to boost the gas mileage of the wildly popular \n     sport utility vehicles. Congress has firmly resisted attempts \n     to boost mileage requirements for SUVs.\n       With petroleum imports rising, voters also say they now \n     support opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska \n     for oil and gas exploration. Throwing open ANWR to oil \n     drillers is a sensitive issue in this year's presidential \n     race. Republican George W. Bush is for it. Democrat Al Gore \n     is against it.\n       The newest Christian Science Monitor/TIPP poll explored a \n     broad range of energy issues with a cross-section of 803 \n     likely voters in the US.\n       The survey probed the public's willingness to use mass \n     transit and to buy smaller cars to save energy. It looked at \n     who is to blame for rising prices. And it tested the \n     willingness of Americans to use military power to keep oil \n     resources flowing in times of crises.\n       There were some sharp differences--often along party \n     lines--in the Monitor/TIPP poll, as well as broad agreements.\n       Some of the findings:\n       Voters agree that the primary culprits in higher prices for \n     energy are the members of the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries (OPEC). Big oil companies and government \n     policy makers also bear a heavy responsibility, voters say.\n       By nearly a 3-to-1 margin, voters say that US friends such \n     as oil-rich Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are not doing enough to \n     keep energy prices down.\n       The No. 1 priority for dealing with US energy needs should \n     be the development of new technologies, voters say. New \n     technologies are more important than either boosting US oil \n     production or conservation.\n       Growing public pressure to boost fuel requirements for SUVs \n     comes as something of a surprise. For more than a decade, the \n     vehicles have been family favorites for hauling everything \n     from plywood from Home Depot to camping gear on holiday \n     outings.\n       But the hefty vehicles drink lots of fuel. The mighty \n     Lincoln Navigator that tips the scales at 5,746 pounds, for \n     example, gets just 12 miles per gallon in the city, 17 on the \n     highway, with its 5.4-liter V8 engine.\n       The more-popular Chevy Blazer--a mere two tons of steel, \n     rubber, and plastic--gets just 15 miles per gallon in the \n     city, 18 on the highway.\n       Under federal rules, automobiles from each manufacturer are \n     required to get an overall average of 27.5 miles per gallon--\n     twice what cars got in 1974. But as carmakers have downsized \n     and lightened their vehicles to meet this standard, consumers \n     who wanted more size and power switched to minivans and SUVs.\n       The federal government cooperated with this sleight of hand \n     by classifying minivans and SUVs as ``trucks,'' even though \n     they were being used primarily as passenger vehicles. Since \n     the standard for trucks was only 20.7 miles per gallon, that \n     overall requirement was easier for manufacturers to meet.\n       The impact on America's gasoline usage, however, was \n     significant. Average vehicle performance in the US has fallen \n     steadily from a high 26.2 m.p.g. in 1987 to only 24.6 m.p.g. \n     in 1998. Today's shortages and higher gas prices are one \n     result.\n       On this issue--as on several energy issues--there are often \n     differences of opinion among voters.\n       A college history professor in California, one of those \n     surveyed in this poll, says she is sympathetic with those who \n     buy the larger vehicles.\n       ``It's not really fair to criticize SUV owners,'' she says. \n     ``I don't care what anybody's driving as long as they're not \n     driving over me. . . . Sometimes people need a larger car for \n     extenuating circumstances.''\n       While 63 percent of likely voters in this poll favored \n     boosting the mileage requirement for SUVs, 29 percent \n     disagreed.\n       Sentiment to boost mileage requirements was highest among \n     liberals (77 percent favor higher mileage rules), Democrats \n     (74 percent) and those between the ages of 55 and 64 (75 \n     percent). Support for changing the law was weakest among \n     conservatives (only 54 percent favor a change), younger \n     Americans (59 percent), and Republicans (52 percent).\n       Another surprise was the solid support (54 percent to 38 \n     percent) for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. ANWR's coastal plain could hold as much oil as \n     Alaska's highly productive Prudhoe Bay.\n       Yet the refuge also shelters polar and grizzly bears, \n     caribous, wolves, and many other species in one of the most \n     pristine areas in the US.\n       Raghavan, Mayur, president of TIPP, a unit of TechnoMetrica \n     Market Intelligence, conducted the poll for the Monitor. Mr. \n     Mayur says divisions are sharp on this issue:\n       ``To drill or not to drill the Arctic refuge is the same as \n     asking are you a Bush supporter or a Gore supporter.''\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\n       Other poll responses:\n       Who is responsible? The public points the finger primarily \n     at OPEC (34 percent), but oil companies (28 percent), and the \n     government's energy policies (21 percent) also shoulder the \n     blame for rising prices.\n       A sales representative in Conyers, Ga., says higher prices \n     should have been foreseen with a growing economy, and Gore \n     should have tackled it. Ultimately, she said, ``oil companies \n     are probably more responsible than anyone else.''\n       Will fuel prices hurt? Voters are almost evenly split on \n     whether rising fuel prices will hurt the economy. About 49 \n     percent say yes, 45 percent say no.\n       Bush or Gore on energy? When it comes to energy policy, \n     voters think Governor Bush will probably do a better job \n     making sure the US has sufficient energy supplies. They \n     prefer him on this issue by 44 percent to 33 percent over \n     Vice President Gore.\n       Pay more for cars? By 57 percent to 38 percent, Americans \n     say they would pay $1,000 more for a comparable vehicle that \n     had greater fuel efficiency.\n       Buy smaller cars? Most Americans--75 percent--say that with \n     rising gas prices, they would be willing to drive smaller \n     cars to achieve better mileage.\n       Use mass transit? By a 62 percent to 27 percent margin, \n     Americans say they would use mass transit or car pool to save \n     fuel.\n       Use military force? In times of crisis, Americans would be \n     willing to use U.S. military power to keep oil supplies \n     flowing--but the issue is clearly divisive. Those favoring \n     military force (48 percent) are nearly equaled by those who \n     oppose (43 percent).\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me read a portion:\n\n       Another surprise was a solid support (54 percent to 38 \n     percent) for oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. ANWR's coastal plain could hold as much oil as \n     Alaska's highly productive Prudhoe Bay.\n\n  I think that is a significant indication of the public posture and \nthe change. As we have noted for some time, Vice President Gore is very \nmuch opposed to opening this area. This body, in 1995, passed \nlegislative action authorizing the opening of ANWR, but the President \nvetoed that action. We have today a clear indication of support from a \nmajority of Americans who now favor responsible drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  For the sake of keeping this matter in balance, I remind my \ncolleagues there are 19 million acres in that area. Out of that 19 \nmillion acres, which is about the size of the State of South Carolina, \n9 million acres has been set aside in a refuge, 8.5 million acres has \nbeen set aside in a wilderness. This is in perpetuity. Congress left \nout 1.5 million to be determined at a future date whether it should be \nopen for exploration. Geologists say it is the most likely area in \nNorth America where a major oil field might be discovered, and there \nmight be as much as 16 billion barrels in that field. That would equate \nto what we import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period of time. Some \nof the environmentalists say it is only a 200-day supply. Isn't that in \nerror? That is assuming all other oil production in the world stops.\n  Prudhoe Bay came on about 23 years ago. It has been producing about \n20 percent of the total crude oil produced in this Nation for that \nperiod of time. They said it was only going to produce 10 billion \nbarrels. It has produced 12 billion barrels so far and still produces a \nmillion barrels a day.\n  The prospects of finding oil domestically, in the volumes we are \ntalking about, in this small sliver of the Coastal Plain are very good. \nAs a consequence, it is rather comforting to note that a distinguished \nperiodical such as the Christian Science Monitor should conduct an \nindependent poll and find that 54 percent of Americans solidly support \nopening up ANWR for drilling; 38 percent are opposed.\n  One other point that deserves consideration has been underplayed by \nthe media and underplayed by the administration. That is the situation \nwith regard to natural gas. Governor Bush's energy plan is more than \njust increasing the domestic supply of oil. He would also expand access \nto natural gas on Federal lands and build more gas pipeline. Even the \nVice President has said natural gas is vital for home heating and \nelectricity and fuel for the future. Mr. President, 50 percent of U.S. \nhomes, or 56 million homes, use natural gas for heating. It provides 15 \npercent of the Nation's electric power; and 95 percent of our new \nelectric power plants will be powered by natural gas as a fuel, \npartially of choice but partially of necessity. You cannot build a \ncoal-fired plant; you cannot build a nuclear plant; you cannot build a \nnew hydroelectric plant. Where are you going to go? You are going to go \nto natural gas. You can get a permit. But all the emphasis of the \nelectric industry is towards natural gas. Putting on more pressure \nincreases the prices, as I said, from $2.16 a year ago to just over \n$4.50 today. The ratepayers are going to be paying this. They just have \nnot seen it yet. It has not been included in your electric bills, but \nit will be very soon, and you will feel it in your heating bill.\n\n  The administration has refused to allow exploration or production of \nnatural gas on Federal lands. There are huge areas of the overthrust \nbelt in Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado that have been off \nlimits. The administration has withdrawn about 60 percent of the \nproductive area for oil and gas discoveries since 1992.\n  The difficulty we are having here is, as they put Federal lands off \nlimits to new natural gas production, we find ourselves with simply no \nplace to go other than the offshore areas of Texas and Louisiana and \nthe offshore areas of Mississippi and Alabama as the major areas of OCS \nactivity. My State of Alaska and California are off limits; the East \nCoast is off limits. They have withdrawn huge areas from our Forest \nService--roadless areas. They have put on a moratorium from OCS \ndrilling until 2012 in many areas. The Vice President would even cancel \nexisting oil and gas leases. Where is the energy going to come from?\n  The Vice President said during his first debate:\n\n       We have to bet on the future and move away from the current \n     technologies to have a whole new generation of more \n     efficient, cleaner energy technologies.\n\n  I buy that, and so does the American public. But he forgets to be \nspecific: Where? How? Why? How much? Where are you going to get the \nenergy?\n  I think we all agree in this case our energy strategy should include \nimproved energy efficiency as well as expanded use of alternative fuels \nand renewable energy. But we are still going to need energy from oil, \nnatural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear, and we are not bringing these \nother sources into the mix.\n  The Vice President said he would make a bet. He will bet on \ndiminishing the supply of conventional fossil fuels such as oil and \nnatural gas. That is his bet, that you would like that; that you would \nbe more than willing to pay higher prices for energy and make \nrenewables more competitive. You would like that. He will support \nhigher energy taxes, just as he did in 1993 when he cast the tie-\nbreaking vote in this body to raise the gasoline tax.\n  This is in his book ``Earth In The Balance.'' Clearly, he wants to \nraise energy prices to effect conservation. But the reality is, as we \nput more central controls on energy use, he would have us set a \nstandard for each part of your everyday life. He would tell you what \nkind of energy you could use, how much of it you could use, how much \nyou would have to pay for it. That is part of it. That is in his book.\n  By contrast, Governor Bush would harness America's innovation to use \nthe energy resources of today to give us the technologies of tomorrow. \nGovernor Bush will set aside the up-front funds from leasing Federal \nlands for oil and gas, so-called bid bonuses, to be earmarked for basic \nresearch into renewable energy. Production royalties for oil and gas \nleases will be invested in energy conservation and low-income family \nprograms such as LIHEAP and other weatherization assistance.\n  Using new tax incentives, Governor Bush will expand the use of \nrenewable energy in the marketplace, building on a successful \nexperience in the State of Texas. As a result of Governor Bush's \nefforts on electricity restructuring, Texas will be one of the largest \nmarkets for renewable energy, some 2,000 new megawatts.\n  Governor Bush will maintain existing hydroelectric dams \nand streamline the FERC relicensing program. We know the current \nadministration wants to take down some of the dams in the Pacific \nNorthwest. Governor Bush will responsibly address the risks posed by \nglobal climate change through investing in getting clean energy \ntechnologies to the market.\n\n  The Vice President would rather have us ratify and implement a costly \nand flawed Kyoto Protocol that puts the United States at an economic \ndisadvantage.\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\n  Some of us remember the vote we had here with respect to climate \nchange and the Kyoto Protocol--the Byrd/Hagel Resolution. I think it \nwas 95-0. The administration asked for our opinion. We are a body of \nadvice and consent. We gave our advice. I think that vote pretty much \nindicates a lack of consent. That particular proposal exempts the \nlargest emitters of greenhouse gases, China and India.\n  In conclusion, the bottom line is there is a clear contrast between \nthe candidates on the subject of energy policy. The Vice President \nwants to raise prices to limit supply of fossil energy which makes up \ncurrently over 80 percent of our energy needs. We wish it were less, \nbut that is the reality. He wants to replace it with solar, wind, \nbiomass--technologies that are promising but they are simply not \navailable or affordable at this time.\n  Governor Bush will expand domestic production of oil and natural gas, \nensuring affordable and secure supplies, reducing energy costs, and \nkeeping inflation at bay. Governor Bush will use the energy of today to \nyield cleaner, more affordable energy sources of tomorrow.\n  The choice for consumers is very clear.\n  Let me leave you with one thought with regard to our foreign policy. \nCurrently we are importing about 600,000 barrels a day from Iraq. I \nknow the occupant of the chair recalls in 1991 and 1992 when we fought \na war, the Persian Gulf war, we had 147 American service personnel who \ngave their lives in that war, with 427 wounded; we had 23 taken \nprisoner. How quickly we forget.\n  Now we are over there enforcing, if you will, an aerial blockade, a \nno-fly zone. We have flown over 300,000 sorties, individual missions, \nenforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq. We have bombed; we have fired; we \nhave intercepted. Fortunately, we have not suffered a loss. But what \nkind of foreign policy is it where we buy his oil, put it in our \nairplanes, and go over and bomb him? I leave you with that thought, and \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11413-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11413-S11415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we had an opportunity to listen to 2 \nhours of debate and speeches from some on the other side of the aisle \nearlier this afternoon trashing a piece of legislation and the process \nconnected with that legislation that originally passed the Senate 83-14 \nearlier this year.\n  I have heard the Senator from Minnesota and others complain about the \nprocess of getting the bankruptcy bill to the floor. It seemed to me, \nas I listened to what he said that it is almost an unbelievable thing \nfor him to say that. The Senate passed the bankruptcy bill after weeks \nof debate and after disposing of literally hundreds of amendments. The \nSenator from Minnesota objected to going to the conference committee in \nthe regular order. We tried to do things in the regular way, but he was \none of those Senators who blocked our efforts to get to conference.\n  I think the speeches we have heard this afternoon, particularly from \nthe Senator from Minnesota, are misleading. It is very misleading for \nSenator Wellstone to pretend he is not the reason for this bill not \nmoving in the regular way and then to find fault with the \nunconventional way in which we finally did it.\n  Also, looking at that process, there are few conference committees \naround here that have an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. \nThis conference committee had three Democrats and three Republicans. So \nobviously Democrats had to sign the conference report, or we would not \neven have it before us. But that is the way this process has been--not \nonly this year but last year and the year before and the year before.\n  We have been trying to bring about badly needed bankruptcy reform. It \nhas been done in a bipartisan way. The best evidence of that \nbipartisanship, both from the standpoint of substance and the \nstandpoint of the process, is the 83-14 vote by which the original bill \npassed the Senate and Democrats signing the conference report that is \nnow before us. So I am glad we finally have a chance to get to debate \non the merits of the bankruptcy reform conference report.\n  Today is Halloween. That is an appropriate day to take the bill up \nbecause of our liberal friends who have tried to dress the bankruptcy \nbill in a scary costume in a tired effort to frighten the American \npeople for crass political purposes. The fact is, the bankruptcy reform \nbill we are going to vote on tomorrow will do a lot of good for the \nAmerican people and for the economy.\n  Remember, we are talking about 1.4 million bankruptcies. Remember, we \nare talking about a very dramatic explosion of bankruptcies just in the \nlast 6 or 7 years. Remember, the last time we had bankruptcy reform, \nthere were about 300 thousand bankruptcies filed per year.\n  That is up to 1.4 million. It is a cost to the economy for every \nworking family in America of paying $400 per year more for goods and \nservices because somebody else is not paying their debt.\n  I want to summarize a few things that this bill will do that my \ncolleagues may not know about as a result of the disinformation \ncampaign waged by our liberal opponents.\n  Right now, for instance, farmers in my State of Iowa, and for that \nmatter in Minnesota and all across the country, have no protections \nagainst foreclosures and forced auctions. That is because chapter 12 of \nthe bankruptcy code, which gives essential protections for family \nfarmers, expired in June of this year.\n  Why did chapter 12 expire leaving farmers without a last-ditch safety \nnet? The answer is that chapter 12 ceased to exist because the Senator \nfrom Minnesota blocked us from proceeding on this bankruptcy bill we \nhave before us.\n  The bankruptcy bill will restore chapter 12 on a permanent basis. \nNever again will Iowa farmers or even Minnesota farmers be left with no \ndefense against foreclosures and forced auctions. Congress will fail in \nits basic responsibilities to the American farmer if we fail to restore \nchapter 12 as a permanent part of the bankruptcy code.\n  The bankruptcy bill does more for farmers than just make protections \nfor farmers permanent. The bankruptcy bill enhances these protections \nand makes more Iowa farmers, more American farmers, and even more \nMinnesota farmers eligible for chapter 12. The bankruptcy bill lets \nfarmers in bankruptcy avoid capital gains taxes. This will free up \nresources that would have otherwise been forced to go to the Federal \nTreasury, that would otherwise go down the black hole of the IRS, to be \ninvested in farming operations.\n  We have a real choice. The Senate can vote as the Senator from \nMinnesota wants us to vote and the Senate can kill this bill, or we can \nstand up for American farmers and Minnesota farmers. We can do our duty \nand make sure that family farms are not gobbled up by giant corporate \nfarms. We can give our farmers a fighting chance. I hope the Senate \nwill stand up for our farmers. I hope the Senate does not give in to \nthe bankruptcy establishment that has decided to fight bankruptcy \nreform no matter who gets hurt, including the Iowa farmer, the \nMinnesota farmer--the American farmer.\n  What else is in this conference report? The bankruptcy bill will give \nbadly needed protection for patients in bankrupt hospitals and nursing \nhomes. About 10 percent of the nursing homes in America are in \nbankruptcy, so this is a real problem for senior citizens of America. \nThe Senate protected these people by unanimously adopting an amendment \nwhich I offered. Again, my colleagues may be unaware of the importance \nof this provision because the opponents of bankruptcy reform do not \nwant us to realize what killing the bankruptcy reform bill will really \ndo for those people who are in bankrupt nursing homes.\n  I had hearings on patients in bankrupt nursing homes. As my \ncolleagues know, Congress is trying to put more money into nursing \nhomes through the Medicare replenishment bill. Because we have so many \nnursing homes that are in bankruptcy, the potential for harm is very \nreal.\n  Through the hearing process in committee, I learned of a situation in \nCalifornia where a bankruptcy trustee simply showed up at a nursing \nhome on a Friday evening and evicted the residents. The bankruptcy \ntrustee did not provide any notice that this was going\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nto happen. He literally put these frail, elderly people out into the \nstreet and changed the locks so they could not get back into the \nnursing home. The bankruptcy bill that we will vote on tomorrow will \nprevent this from ever happening again. If we do not stand up and say \nthat the residents of nursing homes cannot just be thrown out into the \nstreet, then Congress will have failed in its duty to the senior \ncitizens of America.\n  Again, we have a choice: We can vote this bill down and tell nursing \nhome residents and their families that they can just go fly a kite. I \nhope the Senate is better than that. I hope the Senate stands for \nnursing home residents and not for inside-Washington liberal special \ninterest groups that are trying to make a case against this bill but \njust cannot make a case against the bill. We have not heard them \ntalking about helping farmers through chapter 12. We have not heard \nthem talk about helping nursing home residents through the provisions \nthat are in the Patients' Bill of Rights for nursing home residents.\n  There is more to this bill. The bankruptcy reform bill contains \nparticular provisions advocated by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan and by Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. I hope the Senator \nfrom Minnesota takes note of those two people being appointed by the \nPresident of the United States, Larry Summers being a member of this \nadministration as Secretary of the Treasury, to whom some from the \nother side of the aisle ought to listen.\n  These provisions will strengthen our financial markets and lessen the \npossibility of domino-style collapses in the financial sector of our \neconomy. According to both Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Summers, \nthese provisions will address significant threats to our prosperity, \nthe very prosperity that their candidate for President is out talking \nabout every day saying it ought to be protected.\n  Yet again, we have a choice: We can strengthen our financial markets \nby passing this bill, or we can side with the liberal establishment and \nfight reform, no matter what the cost is to our society, our economy, \nthe farmers, or the people in nursing homes.\n  The American people want us to strengthen the economy, not turn a \ndeaf ear to the pleas for help from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard and from the Treasury Secretary. I hope the Senate decides to \nvote to safeguard our prosperity, not put it at risk.\n  The Senator from Minnesota said he wanted us to learn more about the \nbankruptcy bill. I do, too. Once we look at this bill in its totality I \nam confident that the Members of this body will see this is a \nresponsible approach, that we will then do the responsible thing: We \nwill vote for cloture, and then we will also do final passage.\n  There is an issue about how the bankruptcy bill will impact people \nwith high medical expenses. Earlier this year, I addressed this very \nissue, but I want to reassure my colleagues who have remaining \nquestions about this that we have taken care of the problems they have \nlegitimately raised. I do not find fault with their raising them; I \nonly find fault with the fact that we have taken care of them and they \nhave not found it out yet. Before the vote tomorrow morning, I want \nthem to find it out. I want the Senator from Minnesota and I want my \nfriend and colleague from the State of Iowa who raised this issue to be \naware of it as well.\n  My friend from Iowa was quoted in the Des Moines Register Sunday as \nsaying about this bill: I am not for it. I think it's a bad bill. He \ntalked with bankruptcy lawyers who said that it will hit hardest those \nwho rack up big bills due to medical problems.\n  As to the Time magazine article that was referred to earlier by the \nSenator from Minnesota which alleged that medical expenses drove some \nof the families profiled into bankruptcy, I would just say that this is \nflat out wrong.\n  To the extent any person in bankruptcy has medical expenses, the \nbankruptcy bill deals with this issue in two ways.\n  The General Accounting Office to look at the provisions of this bill \nfrom the point of view of medical expenses. You can see from this \nreport that came from the General Accounting Office that all medical \nexpenses that are deducted in determining whether you have the ability \nto go to chapter 7 or chapter 13. The bill is very clear health care \nexpenses are covered because of ``other necessary expenses'' include \nsuch expenses as charitable contributions, child care, dependent care, \nhealth care, payroll deductions, life insurance, et cetera. All of \nthese are used in determining your ability to repay your debts.\n  So anybody who comes to the floor of the Senate and says that we do \nnot take medical costs into consideration in determining this--those \ncolleagues have not read the bill.\n  There is one additional thing. Somebody can make a case that this \ndoes not take care of all of the instances. I do not know how much \nclearer it can be. But we still have application to the bankruptcy \njudge, under special circumstances, to argue any case you want to of \nsomething that should be taken into consideration in your ability to \nrepay debt. Medical expenses, obviously, fall into that category if \nthis provision is not adequate. But I do not know how much clearer it \ncan be than when you say medical expenses are things that are \ndeductible in making your determination of ability to pay.\n  Several Senators have also, today, made reference to the issue of \nwhether we need to modify the bankruptcy laws to prevent violent \nabortion protesters from discharging their debts in bankruptcy court. \nNow the fact is, our current law already prevents this from happening.\n  I am releasing today a memo to me from the nonpartisan Congressional \nResearch Service that says, without a doubt, no abortion protester has \never, ever gotten away with using bankruptcy as a shield. So I hope my \ncolleagues listen to this nonpartisan source and not the partisan \npolitical statements that were made yesterday on the Senate floor in \nregard to this.\n  I want to put this in the Record, Mr. President, so I know that this \nis clearly stated. I ask unanimous consent that this memo be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: Westlaw/LEXIS survey of bankruptcy cases under 11 \n         U.S.C. Sec. 523.\n       This confirms our phone conversation of October 25, 2000. \n     You requested a comprehensive online survey of reported \n     decisions considering the dischargeability of liability \n     incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health \n     clinics by abortion protesters.\n       The only reported decision identified by the search is \n     Buffalo Gyn Womenservices, Inc. v. Behn (In re Behn), 242 \n     B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the bankruptcy \n     court held that a debtor's previously incurred civil \n     sanctions for violation of a temporary restraining order \n     (TRO) creating a buffer zone outside the premises of an \n     abortion service provider was nondischargeable under 11 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6), which excepts claims for ``willful and \n     malicious'' injury. The court surveyed the extent and \n     somewhat discrepant standards for finding ``willful and \n     malicious'' conduct articulated by three federal circuit \n     courts of appeals. It granted the plaintiff's motion for \n     summary judgment and denied the debtor/defendant's motion to \n     retry the matter before the bankruptcy court. Specifically, \n     the court held:\n       ``[W]hen a court of the United States issued an injunction \n     or other protective order telling a specific individual what \n     actions will cross the line into injury to others, then \n     damages resulting from an intentional violation of that order \n     (as is proven either in the bankruptcy court or (so long as \n     there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the \n     question of volition and violation) in the issuing court) are \n     ipso factor the result of a `willful and malicious injury.' \n     ''--242 B.R. at 238.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In other words, once again, just to make it very clear \nthe Congressional Research Service has searched every known case, and I \nhave here, as my colleagues can read, the only case that is available, \nin which the result is that an abortion protester wasn't able to \ndischarge his debts. The court was very clear that they were not able \nto get a discharge for that purpose.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend from New Jersey, who is on the other \nside of the aisle but very supportive of our legislation, who needs \ntime because he supports this legislation from our side of the aisle. \nSo I am going to quit at this point. I ask if I can have the floor back \nafter he has finished.\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to do that, so I can defer to \nthe Senator from New Jersey right now.\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will ask this way, that when the Senator from New \nJersey has finished, to give the Senator from Wyoming the floor, and \nthen me, because I want to continue presenting our case on the \nbankruptcy reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Iowa yielding time to the \nSenator from New Jersey? The Republicans control the time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I intend to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the last 4 years, my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, has shown extraordinary patience and considerable \nleadership in bringing this institution towards fundamental and fair \nreform of the bankruptcy laws. It has not always been a popular fight, \nbut it is unquestionably the right thing to do for consumers, for \nbusiness, and perhaps most importantly, for small businesses, family-\nowned businesses, that are often victimized by abusers.\n\n  Everyone, I think, generally agrees, within reason, that there is a \nneed for bankruptcy reform. The question, of course, has been how to do \nthat. In the last Congress, we came extremely close to bipartisan \nreform. Having come so close in the 105th Congress, I inherited the \nrole as the ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction, and I \nfelt some optimism that we could succeed.\n  Since that time, working with Senator Grassley, I think we have dealt \nwith most of the critical issues. He has been extremely cooperative. \nIndeed, Members on both sides of the aisle have had suggestions, \nchanges, most of which have been incorporated. Overwhelmingly, Senators \nwho had problems with the bill and individual changes have been \naccommodated in both parties.\n  So today we bring to the floor the culmination of 2 years of work, of \nrefining something that had been worked on for the 2 years before \nthat--4 years--with many Members of the institution, and overwhelmingly \nMembers who have voted for it.\n  Is it perfect? No. Were I writing bankruptcy reform by myself, there \nwould be differences. But none of us writes any bill by ourselves.\n  The critical question is: Is it fair and is it a balanced bill? \nUnequivocally, the answer to that question is yes.\n  Will it improve the functioning of the bankruptcy system without \ndoing injury to vulnerable Americans who have need, legitimate need, of \nbankruptcy protections? Absolutely, yes.\n  For those reasons, this bill deserves and, indeed, clearly has \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  What has fueled this broad and deep support among Democrats and \nRepublicans in the House and the Senate have been the facts, an \noverwhelming misuse and expansion of bankruptcy. In 1998 alone, 1.4 \nmillion Americans sought bankruptcy protection, a 20-percent increase \nsince 1996, during the greatest economic expansion in American history, \nwith record employment, job growth, income growth, a 20-percent \nincrease in bankruptcies, more staggering, since 1980, a 350-percent \nincrease in the use of bankruptcy laws.\n  It is estimated that 70 percent of those filings were done in chapter \n7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Conversely, just 30 \npercent of those petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires \na repayment plan.\n  The result of these abuses of the system has meant that just 30 \npercent of petitions under chapter 13 require a repayment plan. \nOverwhelmingly, people have discovered, contrary to the history of the \nact and good business practices, they can escape paying back these \ndebts, although they have the means to do so, and escape so by simply \nfiling under a different chapter.\n  This is the essence of the bill. Simply making this adjustment, \nmoving many or some of these 182,000 people back into repayment plans, \ncould save $4 billion to creditors. This isn't somebody else's problem. \nThat $4 billion gets paid. If the bankruptcy affects a carpenter, a \nfamily owned masonry business, a home building company, it can put them \nout of business, or the cost gets passed on to someone else who buys \nthe next house. If it is the mom and pop store on main street, it can \nput them out of business or they absorb the cost. But even if it is a \nmajor financial institution, with many credit card companies losing 4 \nor 5 percent of revenues to bankruptcy, it gets passed on to the next \nconsumer.\n  This $4 billion is not the problem for some massive company faraway \nthat can afford to absorb it. It is us. We are all paying the bill. The \nAmerican consumer is absorbing this money from the abuse of the \nbankruptcy system--often those least able to absorb it, small \nbusinesses, family owned businesses, and consumers.\n  This is why, with these compelling facts and the logic of this \nreasoning, that the Senate passed a very similar bill by a vote of 83-\n14 from both parties, across philosophical lines, in an overwhelming \nvote. That is the bill we bring back today.\n  It is charged by critics of the bill that this will deny poor people \nthe protection of the Bankruptcy Act. One, this is not true. Two, if in \nany way it denied poor people the protection of bankruptcy, not only \nwould I not speak for it, not only would I not vote for it, I would be \nhere fighting against it. The simple truth is, no American is denied \naccess to bankruptcy under this bill.\n  What the legislation does do is assure that those with the ability to \nrepay a portion of their debts do so by establishing a clear and \nreasonable criteria to determine repayment obligations. However, it \nalso provides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in \nneed of debt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh \nstart. That bears repeating. No one is denied bankruptcy protection \nbecause, ultimately, of judicial discretion. Prove you need the \nprotection, and you can and will get it.\n  To do this, the bill contains a means test, virtually identical to \nthe one passed by the Senate with 84 votes on a previous occasion. \nUnder current law, virtually anyone who files for complete debt relief \nunder chapter 7 receives it. Regardless of your resources, whether you \ncan repay it or not, your obligation simply gets passed along to the \nsmall store owner, the mom and pop store, the family business. You pass \non your obligation, regardless of your ability. We changed that by \ncreating a needs-based system which establishes a presumption that \nchapter 7 filings should either be dismissed or converted to chapter 13 \nwhen the debtor has sufficient income to repay at least $10,000 or 25 \npercent of their debt--a presumption that if you have money in the bank \nor you have income to repay a portion of this, you should do so. You \ncan answer the presumption. You can overcome it. You can defeat it. But \nsurely it is not unreasonable for someone with those means to have that \nburden, to prove they cannot pay the debt.\n\n  In addition to this flexible means test, the bill before us also \nincludes two key protections for low-income debtors that were a vital \npart of the Senate bill previously passed. The first is an amendment \noffered by Senator Schumer to protect low-income debtors from coercive \nmotions. This will ensure that creditors cannot strong arm poor debtors \ninto making promises of payments they cannot afford to make. Senator \nSchumer asked for it to be in the bill. It is in the bill. It offers \nprotection from unscrupulous, unfair, and burdensome collections.\n  The second is an amendment offered by Senator Durbin. Senator Durbin, \nwho previously held my position and drafted the bill 2 years ago in its \ninitial form, provided a miniscreen to reduce the burden of the means \ntest on debtors between 100 and 150 percent median income. This is a \npreliminarily less intrusive look at the debts and expenses of middle-\nincome debtors to weed out those with no ability to repay those debts \nand to move them more quickly to a fresh start.\n  It was a good addition, but the combination of Mr. Schumer's \namendment\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nfor a safe harbor in addition to the Durbin miniscreen and other \nprovisions, not a part of the original Senate bill, will provide real \nprotections to low-income debtors. These include, first, a safe harbor \nto ensure that all debtors earning less than the State median income \nwill have access to chapter 7 without qualifications; two, a floor to \nthe means test to guarantee that debtors unable to repay less than \n$6,000 of their debts will not be moved into chapter 13; three, \nadditional flexibility in the means test to take into account the \ndebtor's administrative expenses and allow additional moneys for food \nand clothing expenses--three protections--absolute, providing real \nprotection for low-income families on vital necessities, on modest \nsavings, and on means of collection.\n\n  All of this should assuage any fear that this bill will make it more \ndifficult for those in dire straits to obtain a fresh start and \nreorganize their lives. Absolutely no one, because of these \nprotections, will be denied access to complete protection in \nbankruptcy. But it is balanced because there is also protection for \nbusinesses and family companies.\n  Critics have also argued that the bill places an unfair burden on \nwomen and single-parent families. This is the most important part of \nthis bill to understand. There is not a woman in this country, there is \nnot a single parent, there is not someone receiving alimony, child \nsupport, or any child in America whose position is weakened because of \nthis bill. Indeed, their position is strengthened because of this bill. \nSingle-parent families, by elevating child support to the first \nposition rather than its current seventh position, are in a better \nplace because of this bill than they are if we fail to act.\n  Under current law, when it comes to prioritizing which debts must be \npaid off first, child support is seventh--after rent or storage \ncharges, accountant fees, and tax claims. Remember this, because if you \noppose this bill and if we fail to act in the bankruptcy line, \naccountants will be there, tax claims will be there, storage claims \nwill be there, and women and children will be behind. Under this bill \nand this reform, children, women, single-parent families are where they \nbelong--in front of everyone, including the Government.\n  Finally, the bill requires that a chapter 13 plan provide for full \npayment of all child support payments that become due after the \npetition is filed. This is simply a better bill--for business and for \nfamilies.\n  Finally, in drafting a balanced bill, Senator Grassley and I were \nconfronted with the very real need to provide some additional consumer \nprotection. The fact is, many people don't just fall into bankruptcy. \nIn my judgment, they are driven into bankruptcy by unscrupulous, \nunnecessary, and burdensome solicitations of debt by the credit \nindustry. This had to be in the bill, and it is in the bill.\n  The credit card industry sends out 3.5 billion solicitations a year. \nThat is more than 41 mailings for every American household--14 for \nevery man, woman, and child in the Nation. It is not just the sheer \nvolume of the solicitations; it is a question of who is targeted. \nSolicitations of high school and college students are at a record \nlevel. Americans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their \nuse of credit.\n  The result is not surprising, as 27 percent of families earning less \nthan $10,000 have consumer debt of more than 40 percent of their \nincome. This bill deals with that reality.\n  With the help of Senators Schumer, Reed, and Durbin, we have ensured \nthat there is good consumer protection in this bill. It is not \neverything I would have written, certainly not everything they would \nhave liked, but it is good and it is better than current law.\n  The bill now requires lenders to prominently disclose the effects of \nmaking only a minimum payment on your account; that interest on loans \nsecured by dwellings is tax deductible only up to the value of \nproperty, warnings when late fees will be imposed, and the date on \nwhich an introductory or teaser rate will expire and what the permanent \nrate will be after that time. All of these things will be required on \nconsumer statements in the future. Few are required now.\n\n  What this means is that Senator Grassley and I have done our best. We \nhave worked with all Members of the Senate in both parties. This is a \ngood bill and a balanced bill. The Senate has approved it before. It \nshould do so again. It provides new consumer protection, protection for \nwomen and children, securing their place in bankruptcy lines, ensuring \nthat debts get repaid when they can be, ensuring bankruptcy protection, \nand ensuring that abuses end so that small businesses are not \nvictimized and consumers who can pay their bills do not pay the \nadditional costs of those who choose not to.\n  I congratulate Senator Grassley once again on an extraordinary \neffort. I am very proud to coauthor this bill with him. I look forward \nto the Senate's passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I hope we had a lot of people who were \nable to listen all afternoon on this debate. I doubt if very many \npeople listened for 4 hours, but they heard a lot of charges against \nthe bill that were partisan early on this afternoon. Then I said how \nthis bill passed 83-14 originally. That would never have happened--that \nwide of a margin and bipartisan cooperation--except for the early \nsupport and continuing support, and you have seen that demonstrated in \nthe recent speech by Senator Torricelli. I thank him for that.\n  I also thank Senator Biden of Delaware for also helping us get this \nbill out of committee and to the floor, and also Senator Reid of \nNevada, who helped us get through the hundreds of amendments we had \nfiled with this legislation. So this is evidence of just three people \non the other side of the aisle who have worked very hard to make this a \nbipartisan approach, and this legislation, as controversial as it is, \nwould not have gotten as far as it had without that cooperation. I \nthank Senator Torricelli.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11416-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it is highly unfortunate that the \nClinton administration is apparently trying to play politics with \nimmigration during the final days before the Presidential election.\n  The Congress has tried to work in good faith with the President to \nhelp immigrants who play by the rules, and have not been treated fairly \nby the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Unfortunately, the \nPresident does not seem to be interested in a reasonable compromise.\n  President Clinton has demanded blanket amnesty for any alien in the \nUnited States in 1986 or before. This is not limited to legal \nimmigrants. It includes illegal aliens. It does not matter to the \nPresident whether they have tried to follow the law in getting their \nstatus adjusted during all these years, or whether they flagrantly \nviolated the immigration laws. The President just wants to give blanket \namnesty. Also, the White House does not know how many would be eligible \nfor amnesty under their plan, but the number would clearly be in the \nmillions. This is irresponsible policy.\n  The National Border Patrol Council, whose members are border patrol \nagents, has strongly criticized the President's proposal. They said, \n``In addition to punishing those who abide by our immigration laws and \nrewarding those who disobey them, a new amnesty would encourage \ninnumerable others to break our laws in the future. This is not sound \npublic policy.''\n  The Congress has a better way. The Legal Immigration Family Equity \nAct, which is part of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations \nlegislation, would allow aliens in the United States before 1982 to \nsecure amnesty if they had tried to comply with the immigration laws. \nThis would provide assistance to about 400,000 aliens who were wrongly \ndenied relief through administrative action of the I.N.S.\n  Moreover, the legislation would assist hundreds of thousands of \napplicants who are on a waiting list to be united with their families \nin the United States. This bill would greatly help promote family \nunification.\n  As this legislation demonstrates, the Congress should help immigrants \nwho help themselves and try to follow the rules. However, far too \noften, the roadblock that legal immigrants run into has nothing to do \nwith the Congress. It is caused by the Administration, and more \nspecifically the I.N.S.\n  The record of the I.N.S. in helping legal immigrants during this \nAdministration has been very poor. I have grown very frustrated in \nrecent years trying to help citizens of my state who are trying to work \nthrough the I.N.S. and follow the law. Sometimes, when I make inquiries \nabout an applicant's case, the I.N.S. does not even respond to my \nrepeated requests. When I do get a response, it is often handwritten \nand hard to read or understand. It may even be inaccurate. Also, the \nI.N.S. has actually lost files about which I was inquiring. If federal \nelected officials receive this type of treatment, the difficulties that \napplicants face while trying to work with the I.N.S. alone must be \nmany, many times worse. I have contacted the Attorney General about \nthese chronic problems, but I have not even received the courtesy of a \nresponse.\n  With a new Administration next year, I hope we can fundamentally \nreform the I.N.S. We must make it responsive to the people.\n  In the meantime, the President should cooperate with the Congress, \nand promote reasonable solutions to the problems faced by legal \nimmigrants. At the same time, he should devote his attention to \naddressing the fundamental problems regarding how immigrants are \ntreated by his own administration every single day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11417-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11417-S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GEN. RICHARD LAWSON, USAF: IN THE STYLE OF CINCINNATUS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the great success and continuing strength of \nthe United States as a republic is due in no small part to the \nwillingness of our citizens to be soldiers and, no less important, of \nour soldiers to be citizens.\n  One such soldier-citizen is General Richard L. Lawson, late of the \nAir Force of the United States, now on the verge of a second \nretirement, this time from a productive career in public life.\n  On active duty as General Lawson, he held positions of trust at the \nhighest levels of responsibility in planning and executing the military \nelements of U.S. foreign policy during times of great tension.\n  As Dick Lawson, the envoy plenipotentiary from the most basic of \nAmerica's basic industries to the councils of government that include \nthis Senate, he has made useful and durable contributions to policies \nthat make the Nation more secure and energy independent.\n  Richard Lawson is, in fundamental ways, exceptional, if not unique.\n  He is one of few individuals to hold every enlisted and commissioned \nrank in the military structure from enlistee of bottom rank to the \nfour-star grade that signifies overall command. He may well be the only \none to have done this between two services--to rise step-by-step from \nbuck private to regimental sergeant major in the Army National Guard of \nIowa; and then, when commissioned into the Air Force, from second \nlieutenant to general.\n  Highlights of General Lawson's Air Force career include the \nfollowing: military assistant at the White House under two Presidents; \nCommander, Eighth Air Force; Director of Plans and Policy for the Joint \nChiefs of Staff; U.S. representative to the military committee of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Alliance; Chief of staff at Supreme Headquarters \nof the Allied Powers in Europe; and, finally, command of the day-to-day \nactivities and deployments of all services in the U.S. European \nCommand, the deputy commander-in-chief.\n  During his span of service, some important national and international \ndevelopments included the following: the making of plans and the \nacquisition of means to re-establish U.S. strength and flexibility and \ndeterrence; the restoration of cordiality among the NATO allies.\n  General Lawson left active service in 1986. Early the next year, \nwhile figuratively behind the plow, like Cincinnatus, he was approached \nby a delegation of coal industry leaders. They found him, in fact, \nclearing undergrowth on his acreage in the Virginia countryside. They \ncalled him again into service, and he again responded.\n  In the 14 years since then, Dick Lawson has presided over the \nunification of what once was both a profusion and a confusion of voices \nthat sought to speak for mining. He first blended together within the \nNational Coal Association all elements of the coal industry. More \nrecently, he joined the many elements of mining represented by coal, \nmetals and minerals producers. With the union of the coal association \nand the American Mining Congress to form the National Mining \nAssociation, two voices became one.\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\n  It has been America's good fortune to have leaders which exhibit true \nfaith and allegiance to the general welfare and the blessings of \nliberty.\n  One such leader is Richard L. Lawson. I personally thank him for his \nefforts, for his patriotism, and for his vision.\n  His 40 years of combined military duty is rich with decorations and \nhonors. It includes the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Air \nForce Distinguished Service Medal with oak leaf cluster, and the Legion \nof Merit.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe finest scholars to have graced the United States Senate, Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan. As all of you know, our esteemed colleague \nfrom New York will soon be retiring from the Senate after 24 years.\n  Senator Moynihan has a rich history of public service. Beginning his \npolitical career as a member of Averell Harriman's gubernatorial \ncampaign staff in 1954, Senator Moynihan used his vast intellect to \nbuild one of the most expansive political resumes of the 20th century. \nTo attempt to list every position ever held by my colleague would take \nentirely too long. However, some of the highlights of his political \ncareer include serving in the Cabinet or sub-Cabinet of Presidents \nKennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford, serving as a U.S. Ambassador to \nIndia, and as a U.S. Representative to the United Nations. In 1976, he \nagain represented the U.S. as President of the United Nations Security \nCouncil. It is important to note that Senator Moynihan accomplished all \nof this prior to his tenure in the Senate.\n  Though anyone would be impressed with such an extensive biography, \nSenator Moynihan has not limited himself to the political arena. He has \nserved in the United States Navy, taught at some of the most elite \nschools in the Nation, authored or edited 18 books, and has served on \nnumerous boards and committees. An exhaustive lifestyle few could \nendure has resulted in Senator Moynihan's receipt of some of the most \nprestigious national awards, and 62 honorary degrees.\n  The Senate will not be the same without my esteemed colleague from \nthe Empire State, and I would like to express my gratitude for his \nservice to this Nation. I wish him and his wife Liz health, happiness, \nand success in all of their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11418-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATOR BOB KERREY'S RETIREMENT FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nbid farewell to a true American hero. Senator J. Robert Kerrey will be \nretiring from the United States Senate after dedicating the last twelve \nyears to representing the fine state of Nebraska.\n  Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have had the opportunity to serve \nwith several distinguished patriots. However, few have displayed the \ncommitment and ability of Senator Bob Kerrey.\n  After graduating from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln in 1966, \nBob set his aspirations high, earning a prestigious slot on one of \nAmerica's most elite fighting forces, the Navy Seals. While serving \nthis Nation in Vietnam, Bob demonstrated the valor, leadership, and \nselflessness deserving of the Congressional Medal of Honor. The Medal \nof Honor is the highest medal awarded by the United States and is \nreserved for those who have gone above and beyond the call of duty, at \nthe risk of their own life, to perform a deed of personal bravery or \nself-sacrifice.\n  Upon his return to the States after the war, Bob built a thriving \nbusiness with unwavering determination. After proving himself an able \nbusinessman, he decided to pursue a career in public service. In 1982, \nhe was sworn in as Governor of the Cornhusker State. During his four \nyear tenure, he used his vast financial knowledge to turn a three \npercent deficit into a seven percent surplus.\n  Bob changed roles but continued his public service, when he won a \nseat in the U.S. Senate in 1988. Admired by his constituents for his \ncountless contributions to furthering education and assisting small \nfarmers, he was re-elected in 1994.\n  It has been a privilege to serve along side this American patriot, \nand I am pleased that I had the opportunity to work with him on the \nArmed Services Committee. I wish him and his two children, Benjamin and \nLindsey, health, happiness, and success in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11418-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11418-S11419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATOR CONNIE MACK'S RETIREMENT FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nhas made countless contributions to the state of Florida and to this \nNation during his tenure in the United States Senate, Senator Connie \nMack. Senator Mack has decided to retire after serving two successful \nterms in the Senate.\n  Prior to his entrance into public service, Connie spent 16 years as a \nlocal banker. During this time, he established himself as a civic \nleader in his Florida community and helped spearhead an effort to build \na much needed local hospital. Recognizing that as a member of Congress \nhe could do much more to help not only his local community, but the \nentire nation as well, he decided to run for a seat in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  While serving three terms in the House, Connie built a reputation as \nsomeone who could get things done. It was soon obvious to many familiar \nwith this aspiring politician that his talents would best serve this \nnation in the United States Senate. Running on a platform of ``less \ntaxing, less spending, less government, more freedom,'' Connie Mack was \nembraced by the Florida voters and was sworn in as the junior Senator \nfor the Sunshine State in January 1989.\n  Senator Mack was soon recognized by his colleagues as a man with a \nsolid work ethic of uncompromising integrity. In 1996, he was chosen by \nhis Republican colleagues as Chairman of the Republican Conference, and \nhe retained this post for the rest of his time in office. He fought \nintensely for his constituents, and they repaid him in 1994 when they \nre-elected him with 70 percent of the vote--the first Republican in \nFlorida to be re-elected to the United States Senate.\n  During Connie's tenure in the Senate, he has used his extensive \nbanking experience to frame landmark legislation which modernized our \nbanking laws and helped prepare our financial system for the global \nmarket of the 21st century. A fierce opponent of government waste, he \nadvocates deficit reduction and cutting congressional spending.\n  Connie's most admirable trait is his determination to overcome \ntragedy. His family's battle with cancer catalyzed the young Senator to \npush a legislative agenda focused on eliminating this destructive \ndisease. Senator Mack\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nis known nationwide as an advocate for cancer research, and both he and \nhis wife Priscilla have been honored repeatedly for their work to \npromote cancer awareness. He has been instrumental in obtaining medical \nresearch funding, and his perseverance paid off to the benefit of the \nhealth of this Nation.\n  Senator Connie Mack is an individual well respected on both sides of \nthe political aisle. His legacy is one composed of honesty and \nintegrity, and I feel that I can speak for all of my colleagues when I \nexpress my gratitude for his countless contributions to the Senate. I \nwish him and his wife Priscilla health, happiness, and success in the \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11419-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11419-S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          THE NEED FOR A BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue which \nhas, of late, affected the lives of all Americans. I am talking about \nrising energy costs. All indications suggest that America's summer of \ndiscontent is going to continue and become the winter of discontent \nwith respect to energy prices. Americans have paid recordbreaking \nprices at the pump this summer. They will continue to suffer escalating \nprices this winter, too. Higher energy prices hit most those Americans \nwho can afford it the least. But more important, the findings of an \ninternational panel of scientists has concluded that man-made \ngreenhouse gases are altering the atmosphere in ways that affect \nearth's climate.\n  The World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations \nEnvironment Program established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) in 1988. The function of IPCC is to assess available \ninformation on the science, impacts, and crosscutting economic issues \nrelated to climate change, in particular a possible global warming \ninduced by human activities. The IPCC completed its first assessment \nreport in August 1990 which indicated with certainty an increase in the \nconcentration of greenhouse gases due to the human activity. The report \nassisted the governments of many countries in making important policy \ndecisions, in negotiating, and in the eventual implementation of the UN \nFramework Convention on Climate Change which was signed by 166 \ncountries at the UN Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de \nJaneiro in 1992. The convention was ratified in December 1993 and took \neffect on 21 March 1994. IPCC also issued another assessment in 1995.\n  I find the conclusions of the panel's latest assessment alarming. One \nof its most striking findings is its conclusion that the upper range of \nwarming over the next century could be even higher than the panel's \n1995 estimates.\n  The evidence of increasing warming has shown up in different places--\nretreating glaciers and snow packs, thinning polar ice, and warmer \nnights. There is a growing consensus that humans are playing a \nsignificant role in climate change. Even some of those who dissent from \nthe view that human activity is altering the climate concede that human \ninfluence on the earth's climate is established.\n  I rise today, in the closing days of the 106th Congress, to urge all \ninterested organizations and individuals to begin working now to \naddress energy issues early in the next Congress. We have two distinct \nproblems to address. First, we must ensure that Americans continue to \nenjoy reasonably priced energy now and in the future. Second, we must \nwork on the development of environmentally sound solutions to our \nenergy problem in the mid- to long-term timeframe.\n  In the last few months we have had several hearings on electricity \nrestructuring, oil prices, supply and demand, gasoline price hikes, \nnatural gas, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. All these hearings \npoint to one thing--that we have problems with our energy picture, and \nthey need to be fixed, and fixed soon.\n  Our energy problem has been in the making for a long time. For the \nlast thirty years, we have had several energy crises. The reasons for \nall of these crises were the same: actions and crises in the Middle \nEast, rising American demand, bigger cars, and so on. The crisis this \nyear is no different. Whenever the Middle East sneezes, Americans catch \ncold. American pockets books have suffered these periodic colds. But \nthe people of Hawaii have suffered a long and almost interminable cold. \nThroughout the 1990's, Hawaii has been the number one state in terms of \ngas prices at the pump. It relinquished this dubious honor to states in \nthe Midwest this summer. This has to stop. We must ensure that \nAmericans get energy at reasonable prices.\n  Our import dependence has been rising for the past two decades. The \ncombination of lower domestic production and increased demand has led \nto imports making up a larger share of total oil consumed in the United \nStates. Last year crude oil imports amounted for 58 percent of our oil \ndemand. Oil imports will exceed 60 percent of total demand this year. \nImports will constitute 66 percent of the U.S. supply by 2010, and more \nthan 71 percent by 2020. Continued reliance on such large quantities of \nimported oil will frustrate our efforts to develop a national energy \npolicy and set the stage for energy emergencies in the future.\n  Transportation demands on imported oil remain as strong as ever. \nSince the oil shock of the 1970s, all major energy consuming sectors of \nour economy with the exception of transportation have significantly \nreduced their dependence on oil. The transportation sector remains \nalmost totally dependent on oil-based motor fuels. The fuel efficiency \nof our vehicles needs to be improved.\n  U.S. natural gas demand in the last decades has increased \nsignificantly. It is expected to grow by more than 30 percent over the \nnext decade. Demand for natural gas from each of the major consuming \nsectors--residential, commercial, industrial, and electricity \ngeneration will increase. Electricity generation accounts for the \nlion's share of this increase at 50 percent of the increase.\n  We are facing problems on both sides of the supply and demand \nequation. Worldwide supplies of available energy sources are getting \ntighter and demand is increasing. This only means that unless one side \nof the equation changes, we will continue to have energy problems.\n  We cannot look at our energy sources in a piecemeal fashion. We will \nhave to take a comprehensive look at all aspects of our energy picture. \nThe only way to deal with our energy problem is to have a multifaceted \nenergy strategy and remain committed to that strategy. We must adopt \nenergy conservation, encourage energy efficiency, and support renewable \nenergy programs. Above all, we must develop energy resources that \ndiversify our energy mix and strengthen our energy security.\n  I urge all interested organizations and individuals to work together \nto strengthen our energy policy, an energy policy that serves the \nAmerican public.\n  In the short term, we can do this by building upon a lot of good work \nthat has already been done. Initiatives such as the deep water royalty \nincentives proposed by our former colleague, Senator Bennett Johnston \nand supported by the Administration have been major contributors to the \n65 percent increase in offshore oil production under this \nAdministration. Policies that led to the increases in natural gas \nproduction in deep waters by 80 percent in just the past two years are \nwelcome. Natural gas production on Federal lands has increased by \nnearly 60 percent since 1992. This is a good sign that we are able to \nutilize our national resources in an environmentally responsible \nmanner.\n  Initiatives such as the Interagency Working Group on Natural Gas, the \nFederal Leadership Forum to address environmental review processes, a \nresource assessment for Wyoming oil and gas, and technology partnering \nwith the Bureau of Land Management to improve access to Federal lands \nwill provide increased energy resources.\n  In 1998, DOE and the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, concluded the \nlargest divestiture of federal property in the history of the U.S. \ngovernment. The sale of Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve in California \nfor $3.65 billion underscored the Clinton Administration's faith in the \nprivate sector to carry responsible development of the 11th largest of \nthe Nation's oil and gas fields.\n  The Clinton Administration has proposed several tax incentives to \nencourage new domestic exploration and production and to lower the \nbusiness costs of the producers when oil prices are\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nlow. It also proposed tax credits for improving energy efficiency and \npromoting use of renewable energy. Tax reforms would help us improve \nour energy supply picture.\n  The Administration has also advanced legislation to address the issue \nof restructuring the electric utility industry. A number of other \nrestructuring proposals have been made. The electric utility industry \nis an integral part of the overall energy supply and demand equation.\n  The restructuring that we are talking about essentially involves the \nlower 48 States that are contiguous. Some may ask what is in it for \nHawaii? It is not connected to the national grid. The answer is simple. \nHawaii imports from the Mainland a vast portion of goods and services \nit consumes. Reduction in production costs on the Mainland because of \ncompetition unleashed by electric utility industry restructuring would \nbenefit the people of Hawaii.\n  We can build upon the Clinton Administration's accomplishments. Its \nstrategically focused energy policy encompasses economic, \nenvironmental, and national security considerations. It is a balanced \napproach.\n  The effects of major global climate change on the U.S. and the rest \nof the world will be devastating. I will take a few minutes here to \ndescribe the effect of climate change on Hawaii. Being a state \nconsisting of islands with limited land mass, we are, as we must be, \nsensitive to global climate changes. We are tropical paradise and we \nwould like to stay that way. But the worldwide problem of greenhouse \ngases threatens our well-being.\n\n  Honolulu's average temperature has increased by 4.4 degrees over the \nlast century. Rainfall has decreased by about 20 percent over the past \n90 years. By 2100, average temperatures in Hawaii could increase by one \nto five degrees Fahrenheit in all seasons and slightly more in the \nfall. New data may revise this estimation upward.\n  Estimates for future rainfall are highly uncertain because reliable \nprojections of El Nino do not exist. It is possible that large \nprecipitation increases could occur in the summer and fall. It is also \nnot yet clear how the intensity of hurricanes might be affected.\n  The health of Hawaii's people may be negatively affected by climate \nchange. Higher temperatures may lead to greater numbers of heat-related \ndeaths and illnesses. Increased respiratory illnesses may result due to \ngreater ground-level ozone. Increased use of air conditioning could \nincrease power plant emissions and air pollution. Viral and bacterial \ncontamination of fish and shellfish habitats could also cause human \nillness. Expansion of the habitat and infectivity of disease-carrying \ninsects could increase the potential for diseases such as malaria and \ndengue fever.\n  In Honolulu, Nawiliwili, and Hilo, the sea level has increased six to \nfourteen inches in the last century and is likely to rise another 17 to \n25 inches by 2100. The expected rise in the sea level could cause \nflooding of low-lying property, loss of coastal wetlands, beach \nerosion, saltwater contamination of drinking water, and damage to \ncoastal roads and bridges. During storms, coastal areas would be \nincreasingly vulnerable to flooding.\n  Agriculture might be enhanced by climate change, unless droughts \ndecrease water supplies. Forests may find adapting to climate change \nmore difficult. For example, `ohi'a trees are sensitive to drought and \nheavy rains. Changes could disproportionately stress native tree \nspecies because nonnative species are more tolerant of temperature and \nrainfall changes. Climatic stress on trees also makes them vulnerable \nto fungal and insect pests.\n  Hawaii's diverse environment and geographic isolation have resulted \nin a great variety of native species found only in Hawaii. However, 70 \npercent of U.S. extinctions of species have occurred in Hawaii, and \nmany species are endangered. Climate change would add another threat. \nHigher temperatures could also cause coral bleaching and the death of \ncoral reefs.\n  Hawaii's economy could also be hurt if the combination of higher \ntemperatures, changes in weather, and the effects of sea level rise on \nbeaches make Hawaii less attractive to visitors. Adapting to the sea \nlevel rise could be very expensive, as it may necessitate the \nprotection or relocation of coastal structures to prevent their damage \nor destruction.\n  We have to address the problems that may be created by the climate \nchange and the sooner we start on this the better off we will be. We \nwould have to invest in the development of new technologies that will \nprovide new and environmentally friendly sources of energy, newer and \nenvironmentally friendly technologies that allow use of conventional \nenergy sources. We would have to work closely with other nations in a \ncooperative manner. We can help the rest of the world through our well \nknown technological prowess.\n  Our energy policy for the 21st century requires forward thinking. \nSustainable economic growth requires a sustainable energy policy. In an \nera with revolutionary changes in communications and information \ntechnologies, information exchange, interdependent trade, the world \neconomies are becoming increasingly globalized. Our challenge will be \nto sustain this global economy while enhancing the global environment. \nOur energy challenge will be to formulate and implement policies that \nprovide not only the U.S. but all nations with reasonably priced \nenergy.\n  We need fundamentally different sources of energy for the 21st \ncentury. Hydrogen is one such energy source. The long-term vision for \nhydrogen energy is that sometime well into the 21st century, hydrogen \nwill join electricity as one of our Nation's primary energy carriers, \nand hydrogen will ultimately be produced from renewable sources. But \nfossil fuels, especially natural gas, will be a significant long-term \ntransitional resource. In the next twenty years, increasing concerns \nabout global climate changes and energy security concerns will help \nbring about penetration of hydrogen in several niche markets. The \ngrowth of fuel cell technology will allow the introduction of hydrogen \nin both the transportation and electricity sectors.\n  We are a long way from realizing this vision for hydrogen energy. But \nprogress is being made and many challenges and barriers remain. \nSustained effort is the only way to overcome these challenges and \nbarriers. We need to support a strategy that focuses on midterm and \nlong-term goals.\n  While we develop suitable technologies for using this clean source of \nenergy, we can rely on other clean sources such as natural gas. Natural \ngas is a good choice for the fuel of the future. It is safe and \nreliable to deliver, more environmentally friendly than oil, and more \nthan three times as energy-efficient as electricity from the point of \norigin to point of use. There are other potential sources of clean \nenergy such as methane hydrates that need to be explored and developed.\n  We need to unleash American ingenuity to find solutions to our energy \nproblem. This Senator is convinced that we can do this only when we \nhave a national commitment to, and a strategy for technological \nadvancement as part of national energy policy. Only a national \ncommitment will help us maintain a sustainable economic growth while \nprotecting environmental values. We should recognize that there is a \ngrowing intersection between national economy, environment, and energy. \nIf we ignore energy policy, then we only imperil our economy and \nnational security.\n  I want to compliment my friends, Senators Murkowski and Bingaman, the \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Energy Committee for the \ngreat effort that they put into educating us all and trying to build a \nconsensus on very difficult issues. Our Senate Energy Committee has \ncommitted a great deal of time in discussing our energy problems. I \nbelieve the time has come for us to act. I am committed to help move \nthe energy agenda with alacrity in the coming Congress.\n  In the coming session, we must try to move legislation that \nencourages, adopts, and strengthens energy conservation. We must \nencourage energy efficiency, and support renewable energy programs. \nAbove all, we must formulate and advance policies that encourage the \ndevelopment of energy resources that diversify our energy mix and \nstrengthen our energy security without sacrificing the environment.\n  We have had eight long years of unparalleled economic growth. The\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nhealth of our economy is threatened by the escalating price of energy \nand dire predictions about our energy supply and demand equation. We \ncannot allow our energy problem to derail our economy. We cannot allow \nthe greenhouse gases to negatively impact the American people and their \nway of life. We must act at the earliest possible moment in the coming \nsession to address energy issues that we were not able to address in a \nbipartisan fashion in the 106th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11421-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SID YATES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

All of us who \nknew and loved Sid were saddened by his recent death. He was a soft-\nspoken leader who demonstrated time and again his unequivocal \ncommitment to his constituents in Chicago and his unwavering respect \nfor the nation's best principles. He was a public servant in the truest \nand most noble sense, and he was a powerful inspiration to all of us \nwho were fortunate enough to work with him.\n  During his years as Chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Sid skillfully advanced legislation to sustain and \nprotect our national parks and historic sites. He was a brilliant \nlegislator who has done more to preserve our national historic and \ncultural legacy than any other member of Congress.\n  Sid was also well known as Congress's leading advocate for the \nNational endowments for the Arts and Humanities. He was a strong and \ncourageous defender of these important agencies. Especially during \ntimes of controversy over the agencies, he spoke effectively and \npersuasively to preserve their vital programs. because of Sid Yates, \nart and music and dance and theater are now more accessible to families \nacross the nation through their schools and in their cultural \ninstitutions. It's an outstanding legacy, and I know I join my \ncolleagues in Congress in a commitment to honor Sid Yates' memory with \na renewed effort to support the endowments.\n  Sid Yates will long be remembered as a man who brought graciousness, \nintegrity and civility to public service. He is a patriot who is deeply \nmissed here in Congress as well as in his beloved Chicago. I commend \nall that he accomplished, and all of us are grateful for his five \ndecades of selfless and principled public service. He will be \nremembered fondly for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11421-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the Idaho youth \nwho have honored World War II veterans in recent months. Several Idaho \nhigh schools, including Pocatello High School, Highland High School, \nand Century High School, as well as Bosie high School, have become \ntremendously involved in Operation Recognition. In addition, students \nat Eagle High School have fundraised extensively for the National WWII \nMemorial that will be placed on the National Mall in Washington, DC.\n  Operation Recognition is a new program through which honorary high \nschool diplomas are awarded to WWII veterans. The veterans who receive \nthese diplomas left for service in the war before they completed their \nstudies. The gesture of awarding an honorary diploma is a way to thank \nveterans and demonstrate appreciation for the sacrifices that they \nmade.\n  Students whose high schools award honorary diplomas often assist in \nplanning the details of the ceremony. In the process of developing \nmemorable and personal additions to the graduation, these young people \nlearn about the war and its historical significance.\n  Pocatello High School has selected December 7th of this year, which \nis the 59th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, as the date of its ceremony \nfor graduating veterans. Honorary diplomas will also be awarded to \nthose who attended nearby Highland High School and Century High School. \nAs part of the festivities, one student from each high school will \ninterview a veteran who attended his or her school. The graduates and \ntheir families are invited to stay after the ceremony for a reunion. \nStudents have been asked to help decorate the stage and escort \nattendees to their seats.\n  The Boise High School History Club is already preparing for the April \n17, 2001, Boise High veterans' graduation. Students in the club have \ndone exhaustive research to find eligible veterans. They have also been \nworking to publicize the event, preparing a yearbook for each \ngraduating veteran, and making arrangements for a homeroom mentor \nprogram. The students are arranging speaking opportunities for the \nveterans and a range of social activities, including a cookout. Idaho \nState Veterans Home Volunteer Coordinator, Tom Ressler, says that the \ngoal is to establish a relationship between veterans and students \nbefore the graduation.\n  Eagle High School students showed their appreciation for WWII \nveterans by raising more than twenty-three thousand dollars for the \nNational WWII Memorial. Their year-and-a-half fundraising effort proved \nto be the most successful of all our nation's high schools. The \nenthusiastically-run fundraising campaign included candy sales, a giant \ntag sale, and concession stands. The students also marched in parades \nand ran advertisements on television.\n  Eleventh grade American history teacher, Gail Chumbley, and student \nchairs Fil Southerland and Kate Bowen spearheaded the initiative. Ms. \nChumbley reported that the fundraising campaign has motivated many \nstudents to learn about WWII outside of class. Ms. Chumbley, Mr. \nSoutherland, and Ms. Bowen will present The National Campaign Chairman, \nSenator Bob Dole, with a commemorative check at the monument's \ngroundbraking ceremony that will be held on Veterans' Day this year.\n  I take great pride in the fact that members of the youngest \ngeneration of Idahoans, who have grown up in a time of relative peace \nand unprecedented prosperity for our country, take time to honor our \nnation's WWII veterans.\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nThrough their endeavors, these students have learned much about WWII. \nIn the process, they have heightened their community's awareness of \nthis important part of American history and the brave people who were \npart of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11422-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COMMENDATION FOR JARED HOHN AND THE HOTSHOTS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr.President, I rise today to commend the \nSawtooth Hotshots for their valiant efforts in fighting the recent \nforest fires that raged through the Black Hills of South Dakota and \nother western states. The Hotshots are U.S. Forest Service fire crews \nthat specialize in putting out large forest fires. The work is tough, \ndemanding and invaluable. The Hotshot crew is dedicated, spending \ncountless hours training for situations like those faced this summer. \nOnce the fires occur, they often literally work around the clock to \nsave the forests.\n  Nowhere is this spirit more exemplified than by Jared Hohn, a 21-year \nold college student from Hill City, South Dakota. For the last four \nsummers, Jared has worked as a member of the Hotshot crew, fighting \nfires all over the country to help put himself through college at the \nUniversity of South Dakota. As a member of the crew, he often works 16 \nhour days and, in one instance, worked for 42 hours straight fighting \ndesert fires.\n  The work is dangerous and many lives have been lost. But the 80 hours \nof training that the crew receives at the start of each summer greatly \nhelps to minimize the danger that they face. The training teaches \nproper firefighter techniques and understanding of the forces that \naffect fires, like weather patterns.\n  The dedication to public service and to saving lives is reflected in \nJared and the entire Hotshot crew. Jared and the Hotshots are a hard-\nworking group who literally lay their lives on the line to improve the \nworld around us and to protect us from fires. We owe a great deal to \nthem and to the Forest Service for preforming such a valuable public \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11422-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11422-3", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11422-S11423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2485.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \ntreatment of employee stock purchase plans; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                    worker investment protection act\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation \ndesigned to clarify the tax treatment of employee stock purchase plans \n(ESPPs). The Worker Investment Protection Act provides this needed \nclarification.\n  Employee stock purchase plans are a common tool used by employers to \nallow rank-and-file employees to set aside part of their paychecks to \npurchase the company's stock. The tax code provides incentives for \nemployees to participate in ESPPs to encourage employee ownership. This \nlegislation is necessary because in selected cases around the country, \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has begun to act contrary to almost \n30 years of published policy, and is attempting to collect income taxes \nand payroll taxes on\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nESPPs. For three decades, the published IRS ruling position (Rev. Rul. \n71-52) has been that transactions under qualified stock option plans do \nnot give rise to income that is subject to employment taxes. In Notice \n87-49, the IRS extended the principles of this ruling to incentive \nstock options (ISOs). In a series of private letter rulings, the IRS \napplied the same position to ESPP transactions, which are generally \ngoverned by the same Code provisions as qualified and incentive stock \noptions. The IRS has periodically indicated that it may reconsider the \npositions in Rev. Rul. 71-52 and Notice 87-49, but no further official \nguidance has been forthcoming.\n  Rev. Rul. 71-52 and Notice 87-49 remain the best statements of \ncurrent law and represent the only publicly published IRS position on \ncurrent law. Nevertheless, IRS agents have selectively begun seeking to \ncollect retroactive assessments of employment taxes, including \nwithholdings, from employers who reasonably relied on these rulings and \ndid not subject transactions under ESPPs to such taxes.\n  The IRS's actions in this area are inconsistent with long-standing \npublished IRS positions. This legislation would clarify that any income \narising from transactions under ISOs and ESPPs, either upon grant or \nexercise, or qualifying and disqualifying disposition, is not subject \nto employment taxes or federal income tax withholding.\n  ESPPs are the primary vehicle through which rank and file workers \npurchase stock in their companies. However, additional tax liabilities \non employees and high administrative costs for plan administration will \ndiscourage employers from offering these programs that encourage broad-\nbased employee stock ownership. Imposing employment taxes on otherwise \nnontaxable transactions will weaken incentives for employees to \nparticipate. The taxes involved are very modest when compared with the \ncompliance costs and the unfair burdens on rank-and-file workers \ngenerally.\n  This legislation will clarify what is sensible tax policy regarding \nESPPs. More important, it will empower workers during their working \nyears because they will be both employees and owners of the company as \nwell as additional providers of their own retirement security. \nFurthermore, it will thwart the arbitrary and selective IRS actions, \ncontrary to all previously published Treasury and IRS policies.\n  I am introducing the Worker Investment Protection Act in the closing \ndays of the 106th Congress with the hope that the Secretary of the \nTreasury, Lawrence Summers, will clarify longstanding IRS policy, and \ntherefore preclude the need for this legislation. If not, I intend to \npursue this legislation aggressively during the next session of \nCongress. I urge my colleagues to support the Worker Investment \nProtection Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the attached letters from the \nAmerican Electronic Association, Micron Technology, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers in support of my efforts regarding \nemployee stock purchase plans be made a part of the Record, immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Electronics Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.\n\n     Re tax withholding on employee stock purchase plans.\n\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: On behalf of the more than 3,000 small, \n     medium and large company members of the American Electronics \n     Association (AEA), I am writing to express our serious \n     concern over the issue of payroll tax withholding on stock \n     obtained from an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) \n     qualified under section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n     Many of our member companies' ESPPs have been an important \n     part of their overall compensation packages, benefiting over \n     hundreds of thousands high-tech employees.\n       We are writing to express our strong support of your effort \n     to amend the Community Renewal and New Markets Act of 2000 to \n     ensure that purchases from Employee Stock Purchase Plans \n     (``ESPP'') continue to enjoy the favorable tax treatment that \n     was intended.\n       AeA understands that the favorable tax treatment of equity \n     ownership by employees is in jeopardy. The Treasury is \n     working on guidance that could reverse 30 years of IRS \n     precedent and business practice in this area by imposing \n     employment taxes when employees exercise ESPP options. There \n     simply is no reason to impose employment taxes on amounts \n     that are not subject to current income tax, and no law has \n     changed that validates the IRS' change in position. Sound tax \n     policy supports rules that encourage companies to continue \n     these plans and does not weaken the incentives for rank-and-\n     file employees to participate in them.\n       We support your amendment to the Community Renewal and New \n     Markets Act of 2000 legislation that would reaffirm the \n     positions that taxpayers have been following in good faith in \n     this area, consistent with Congressional intent. Please feel \n     free to contact me or AEA's Tax Counsel, Caroline Graves \n     Hurley, if we can provide you any additional information on \n     this matter. We appreciate your attention to this important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               John P. Palafoutas,\n     Sr. Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Micron Technology, Inc.,\n\n                                    Boise, ID, September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Craig: Micron Technology is writing to seek your \n     support of legislation that would confirm the long-standing \n     treatment under the tax code of Employee Stock Purchase Plans \n     (``ESPPs''). This issue is very important to companies like \n     ours who encourage employee-ownership.\n       To provide some background, an employer is generally \n     required to withhold income and employment taxes on ``wages'' \n     paid to an employee. However, the IRS ruled in 1971 that the \n     acquisition of stock by an employee pursuant to a qualified \n     stock option does not result in the payment of ``wages'' and, \n     therefore, is not subject to income tax withholding and \n     employment taxes. Employers and the IRS have followed this \n     principles for almost 30 years.\n       Recently, and without proper notification to taxpayers, the \n     IRS changed its position and instructed its auditors to \n     retroactively impose deficiency assessments on companies that \n     failed to withhold income and employment taxes on the \n     benefits afforded by qualified ESPPs.\n       There are compelling legal and policy reasons to support \n     the position that ESPP transactions are exempt from \n     employment taxes and Federal income tax withholding. The \n     IRS's change of position will discourage broad-based employee \n     stock ownership; will weaken the incentives for workers to \n     participate in these programs; and will increase corporate \n     compliance costs far in excess of the potential tax amounts \n     involved.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Roderic W. Lewis,\n     Vice President and General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.\n     Hon. William V. Roth,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the ``18 million people who make things \n     in America'' and our 14,000 small, mid-sized and large member \n     companies, I urge you to take action this year on a proposal \n     to clarify the tax treatment of employee stock purchase plans \n     (ESPPs). Specifically, I encourage you to include in your \n     Chairman's Mark of the Community Renewal and New Markets Act \n     of 2000 an ESPP amendment officer by committee member Larry \n     Craig.\n       The tax code currently includes incentives for ESPPs that \n     employees to purchase company stock at a discount of up of \n     15%. For nearly 30 years, IRS has taken the position in \n     published guidance that ESPP transactions are exempt from \n     employment taxes and federal income tax withholding. However, \n     over the past two years, IRS agents have sought to collect \n     employment taxes from employers who did not subject these \n     transactions to such taxes. The amendment offered by Sen. \n     Craig confirms that any income from ESPP transactions is not \n     subject to employment taxes or federal income tax \n     withholding.\n       Based on our experience, ESPPs motivate employees and \n     create entrepreneurial zeal by giving workers a stake in \n     their company's future. In contrast, the additional tax \n     liabilities and administrative costs of IRS' change in \n     position will discourage employers from offering these \n     programs. At the same time, imposing employment taxes on ESPP \n     transactions will confuse employees and weaken incentives for \n     them to participate. The Craig amendment will ensure that \n     employers continue to offer ESPPs and that employees continue \n     to benefit from company ownership. Thank you in advance for \n     supporting this important initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dorothy Coleman,\n     Vice President, Tax Policy.\n\n

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is now \nconsidering legislation I introduced to stem the proliferation of \nwebsites that distribute counterfeit identification documents and \ncredentials over the Internet. I appreciate the timely action on this \nlegislation by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, \nas well as the support and assistance of Senators Kyl, Leahy, and \nFeinstein. The substitute amendment proposed by Senator Feinstein and \nme improves the bill while retaining all of its key features.\n  After this measure becomes law, Internet commerce in computer discs, \nfiles, and templates designed for use in the production of false \nidentification documents will be illegal. The bill will also outlaw the \npractice of producing false identification containing easily removable \ndisclaimers, a method currently used to avoid prosecution. Finally, the \nlegislation will establish a coordinating committee to concentrate \nresources of several federal agencies on investigating and prosecuting \nthe creation of false identification. I authored this legislation after \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, held \nhearings on a disturbing new trend--the use of the Internet to \nmanufacture and market counterfeit identification documents and \ncredentials. Our hearing and investigation revealed the widespread \navailability on the Internet of a variety of fake identification \ndocuments and computer templates that allow individuals to manufacture \nauthentic-looking IDs in the seclusion of their own homes. The Internet \nFalse Identification Prevention Act of 2000 will strengthen current law \nto prevent the distribution of false identification documents over the \nInternet and make it easier to prosecute this criminal activity.\n  Mr. President, the high quality of the counterfeit identification \ndocuments that can be obtained through the Internet is astounding. With \nlittle difficulty, my staff was able to use Internet materials to \nmanufacture convincing IDs that would allow me to pass as a member of \nour Armed Forces, a reporter, a student at Boston University, or a \nlicensed driver in Florida, Michigan, or Wyoming, to name just a few of \nthe identities I could assume. For instance, using the Internet my \nstaff created a counterfeit Connecticut driver's license that is \nvirtually identical to an authentic license issued by the Connecticut \nDepartment of Motor Vehicles. Just like the real Connecticut license, \nthis fake with my picture includes a signature written over the picture \nand an adjacent ``shadow picture'' of the license holder. The State of \nConnecticut added both of these sophisticated security features to the \nlicense in order to reduce counterfeiting. Unfortunately, some websites \noffer to sell fake IDs complete with State seals, holograms, and bar \ncodes to replicate a license virtually indistinguishable from the real \nthing. Thus, technology now allows website operators to copy authentic \nidentification documents with an extraordinary level\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\nof sophistication and then mass produce those fraudulent documents for \ntheir customers. The websites investigated by the subcommittee offer a \nvast and varied product line, ranging from driver's licenses to \nmilitary identification cards to federal agency credentials, including \nthose of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Central \nIntelligence Agency (CIA). Other sites offer to produce Social Security \ncards, birth certificates, diplomas, and press credentials.\n  Testimony before the subcommittee demonstrated that the availability \nof false identification documents from the Internet is a growing \nproblem. Special Agent David Myers, Identification Fraud Coordinator of \nthe State of Florida's Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, \ntestified that 2 years ago only 1 percent of false identification \ndocuments came from the Internet. Last year, he testified, a little \nless than 5 percent came from the Internet. Now he estimates that about \n30 percent of the false identification documents he seizes comes from \nthe Internet. He predicts that by next year his unit will find at least \n60 to 70 percent of the false identification documents they seize will \ncome from the Internet. The General Accounting Office (GAO) and the FBI \nhave both confirmed the findings of the subcommittee's investigation. \nEarlier this year the GAO used counterfeit credentials and badges, \nreadily available for purchase on the Internet, to breach the security \nat 19 federal buildings and two commercial airports. GAO's findings \ndemonstrate that, in addition to the poor security measures at federal \nfacilities, the Internet and computer technology allow nearly anyone to \ncreate convincing identification cards and credentials. The FBI has \nalso focused on the potential for misuse of official identification, \nand recently executed search warrants at the homes of several \nindividuals who had been selling federal law enforcement badges over \nthe Internet.\n\n  In response to these findings, the House has passed legislation that \nwill complement the provisions in the bill we currently have under \nconsideration. H.R. 4827, the Enhanced Federal Security Act of 2000, \nwas introduced by Congressman Steve Horn, and would make it a crime to \nenter federal property under false pretenses or for an unauthorized \nindividual to traffic in genuine or counterfeit police badges. The \nHouse bill, supported by Congressman McCollum, chairman of the House \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Crime, provides an additional measure to curb \nthe use of false identification, and I hope that the Senate will \napprove it along with S. 2924.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is a revolutionary tool of commerce and \ncommunication that benefits us all. But many of the Internet's greatest \nattributes also further its use for criminal purposes. While the \nmanufacture of false identification documents by criminals is nothing \nnew, the Internet allows those specializing in the sale of counterfeit \nidentification to reach a broader market of potential buyers than they \never could by standing on a street corner in a shady part of town. They \ncan sell their products with virtual anonymity through the use of e-\nmail services and free Web hosting services, and by providing false \ninformation when registering their domain names. Similarly, the \nInternet allows criminals to obtain fake IDs in the privacy of their \nown homes, substantially diminishing the risk of apprehension that \nattends purchasing counterfeit documents on the street. Because this is \na relatively new phenomenon, there are no good data on the size of the \nfalse identification industry or the growth it has experienced as a \nresult of the Internet. The subcommittee's investigation, however, \nfound that some Web site operators apparently have made hundreds of \nthousands of dollars through the sale of phony identification \ndocuments. One website operator that we investigated told a state law \nenforcement official that he sold approximately 1,000 fake IDs every \nmonth and generated about $600,000 in annual sales.\n  Identity theft is a growing problem that these Internet sites \nencourage. Recent testimony by the Federal Trade Commission noted that \nthe number of calls to their ID theft hotline had doubled between March \nand July of this year, that the agency was receiving between 800 and \n850 calls a week, and that their phone counselors had handled more than \n20,000 calls in an 8-month period earlier this year. Fake IDs, however, \nfacilitate a broader array of criminal conduct. The subcommittee's \ninvestigation found that some Internet sites were used to obtain \ncounterfeit identification documents for the purpose of committing \nother crimes, ranging from very serious offenses such as bank fraud to \nthe more common problem of underage teenagers buying alcohol or gaining \naccess to bars. The legislation under consideration today is designed \nto address the problem of counterfeit identification documents in \nseveral ways. The central features of the bill are provisions that \nmodernize existing law to address the widespread availability of false \nidentification documents on the Internet.\n  First, the legislation strengthens federal law against false \nidentification to ensure that it is suited to the Internet age and the \ntechnology associated with it. The primary law prohibiting the use and \ndistribution of false identification documents was enacted in 1982. \nAdvances in computer technology and the use of the Internet may have \nrendered the law inadequate to encompass the technology of the present \nday. This bill will clarify that current law prohibits the sale or \ndistribution of false identification documents through computer files \nand templates, which our investigation found are the vehicles of choice \nfor manufacturing fake IDs in the Internet age.\n\n  Second, the legislation will make it easier to prosecute those \ncriminals who manufacturer, distribute or sell counterfeit \nidentification documents by ending the practice of using easily \nremovable disclaimers as part of an attempt to shield the illegal \nconduct from prosecution through a bogus claim of ``novelty.'' No \nlonger will it be acceptable to provide computer templates of \ngovernment-issued identification containing an easily removable layer \nsaying it is not a government document.\n  For instance, the subcommittee staff purchased a fake Oklahoma \ndriver's license as part of an undercover operation conducted during \nour investigation. The fake license appears to bear the disclaimer, \n``Not a Government Document,'' which is required by federal law. We \nfound, however, that with one simple snip of the scissors, the fake ID \ncould be removed from his laminated pouch, effectively discarding the \ndisclaimer. It will no longer be acceptable under my bill to sell a \nfalse identification document in this fashion.\n  Finally, my legislation seeks to encourage more aggressive \nenforcement by dedicating investigative and prosecutorial resources to \nthis emerging problem. The bill establishes a multi-agency coordinating \ncommittee that will concentrate the investigative and prosecutorial \nresources of several agencies with responsibility for enforcing laws \nthat criminalize the manufacture, sale, and distribution of counterfeit \nidentification documents. While the new provisions are intended to \ncover any individual or entity using a computer disc, file, template, \nor the Internet to produce, transfer or make available false \nidentification documents or document-making implements, the substitute \nbill makes clear that the new offense does not cover companies \nproviding interactive computer services, such as Internet service \nproviders, communications facilities, or electronic mail services, who \nare innocent conduits of false identification documents. Just as the \ncounterfeiting laws do not cover an unknowing provider of a device or \nservice used to manufacture or transmit counterfeit money, the \nprovisions in this legislation are not meant to apply to unknowing \nparties whose devices or services are used in the production or \ntransfer of false identification documents. This exception is \ninapplicable, however, and ordinary common law doctrines of criminal \nlability will apply in cases of conspiracy between the interactive \ncomputer service and the user; knowledge of and specific intent of an \nofficer, director, partner or controlling shareholder that the server \nor system be used for this criminal purposes; or when the material \navailable through a service consists primarily of material that is \ncovered by the new offense in this legislation.\n  This bill is one in a line of bills that have been considered by \nCongress in recent years that address the issue of\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\nservice provider liability relevant to the unlawful conduct of third \nparties. These have ranged from bills dealing with the liability of \nservice providers in cases of defamation suits, to copyright \ninfringement actions, to criminal prosecutions for online drug \ntrafficking, Internet gambling, and in this case, online distribution \nof false identification document-making implements. Through these \nbills, Congress has had to consider the complexities of the particular \narea of law at hand, the application of common law doctrines, such as \nrespondant superior and theories of contributory and vicarious \nliability, and the nature of liability with respect to specific \nviolations in both civil and criminal contexts. In short, I believe \nthat my bill, while addressing a number of these issues, does not \nnecessarily set a standard for Congress to follow when considering the \nissue of service provider liability in future bills, in future \ncontexts.\n  Mr. President, our investigation established that federal law \nenforcement officials have failed to devote the necessary resources and \nattention to this serious problem. By striking at the purveyors of \nfalse identification materials, I believe we can reduce the end-use \ncrime that often depends upon the availability of counterfeit \nidentification. For instance, the convicted felon who testified at the \nsubcommittee's hearing said that he would not have been able to commit \nbank fraud had he not been able to easily and quickly obtain high \nquality, fraudulent identification documents over the Internet. I am \nconfident that, if federal law enforcement officials prosecute the most \nblatant violators of the law, the false ID industry on the Internet \nwill wither in short order. By strengthening the law and by focusing \nour prosecution efforts, I believe that we can curb the widespread \navailability of false identification documents that the Internet \nencourages. The Director of the United States Secret Services testified \nat our hearing that the use of fraudulent identification documents and \ncredentials almost always accompanies the serious financial crimes that \nthey investigate. Thus, I believe that a stronger law against making \nfalse identification documents will deter criminal activity in other \nareas as well. I urge my colleagues to support S. 2924.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have print in the Record a brief section-\nby-section summary of the substitute for S. 2924.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nInternet False Identification Prevention Act of 2000 (Collins/Feinstein \n                Substitute)--Section-By-Section Summary\n\n       Section 1 names the bill as the Internet False \n     Identification Prevention Act of 2000.\n       Section 2 establishes a coordinating committee to ensure \n     the vigorous investigation and prosecution of the creation \n     and distribution of false identification documents. The \n     coordinating committee, appointed by the Attorney General and \n     the Secretary of the Treasury, shall consist of the Secret \n     Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department \n     of Justice, the Social Security Administration, and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service, and shall exist for \n     two years. The coordinating committee will focus \n     investigative and prosecutorial resources of the federal \n     agencies concerned with false identification in order to curb \n     this growing problem, and will report the results of agency \n     actions each year.\n       Section 3 will amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1028 to modernize the \n     primary federal law pertaining to false identification \n     documents. The bill modifies the existing definition of \n     ``document-making implement'' to include computer templates \n     and files that are now frequently used to create counterfeit \n     identification documents from the Internet.\n       A new provision will make it illegal to ``knowingly produce \n     or transfer a document making implement that is designed for \n     use in the production of a false identification document.'' \n     This provision will close a loophole which currently allows a \n     person to transfer, through a Web site or e-mail, false \n     identification templates that can easily be made into actual \n     finished documents. Current law will also be amended to \n     cover, in addition to documents used in interstate or foreign \n     commerce, any document made available by ``electronic \n     means.'' This will ensure that a false identification \n     document offered for download on a Web site is captured by \n     the statute. Innocent third parties, such as Internet service \n     providers or transmission companies, are excluded from \n     coverage under the legislation.\n       Finally, this section will provide for the first time a \n     definition of ``false identification document.'' A ``false \n     identification document'' will be defined as a document that \n     is intended or commonly accepted for the purpose of \n     identification which is not issued by or under the authority \n     of a government, but which appears to be issued by or under \n     the authority of any government entity. This provision, in \n     conjunction with the removal of the disclaimer provision \n     below, will make it clear that it is illegal for anyone but a \n     government entity to produce any document that is commonly \n     accepted for legal identification.\n       Section 4 will repeal 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1738, thus ending the \n     ability to use a disclaimer and legally produce \n     identification documents that include the age or birth date \n     of an individual. Repealing Section 1738 will prohibit the \n     practice, which was frequently encountered during the \n     Subcommittee's investigation, of attempting to avoid criminal \n     liability for manufacturing and selling counterfeit \n     identification products by displaying a ``NOT A GOVERNMENT \n     DOCUMENT'' disclaimer. This type of disclaimer can be \n     fashioned so as to be easily removable on both computer \n     templates and counterfeit identification documents. It will \n     now be illegal to produce or sell any document that resembles \n     a government identification document.\n       Section 5 will make the provisions effective 90 days after \n     enactment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Internet False Identification \nPrevention Act, S. 2924, is intended to provide additional tools to law \nenforcement to combat the theft of, and fraud associated with, \nidentification documents and credentials. I share the concerns of the \nsponsors of this legislation over this matter. In fact, in the last \nCongress, I sponsored, along with Senators Kyl, Hatch, Feinstein and \nothers, legislation to prohibit fraud in connection with identification \ninformation, not just physical documents. We recognized that criminals \ndo not necessarily need a physical identification document to create a \nnew identity; they just need the information itself to facilitate the \ncreation of false identification documents.\n  I note that improvements to the bill as originally introduced were \nmade during consideration of the legislation by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Specifically, as originally introduced this bill would have \nmade it a crime to possess with intent to use or transfer any false \nidentification document, rather than ``five or more'' as required under \ncurrent law. See 18 U.S.C. 1028(a)(3). I raised concern that the scope \nof this proposed offense would have resulted in the federalization of \nthe status offenses of an underage teenager using a single fake ID \ncard. The substitute bill reported by the Judiciary Committee \neliminated this change in current law.\n  The substitute amendment that the Senate considers today would \nrequire the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to \ncoordinate through a ``coordinating committee'' the investigation and \nprosecution of offenses related to false identification documents, and \nreport to the Judiciary Committees of the House and the Senate on the \nnumber and results of prosecutions. In addition, the substitute \namendment amends 18 U.S.C. 1028 in a number of ways, including by \ncreating a new criminal prohibition on the knowing production or \ntransfer of a document-making implement designed for use in the \nproduction of false identification documents. A new definition is \nprovided for the term ``transfer'' to include ``making available for \nacquisition or use by others.'' To address the concerns of internet \nservice providers that the combination of the new crime and the new \ndefinitions would expose them to criminal liability, the bill also \nincludes an exemption from the new crime for an interactive computer \nservice.\n  In addition, the bill repeals 18 U.S.C. 1738, which allows businesses \nthat sell identification documents bearing the birth date or age of the \nperson being identified to avoid criminal liability by printing clearly \nand indelibly on both the front and the back ``Not a Government \nDocument.''\n  While I do not object to moving this bill at this time, I must note \ntwo lingering concerns that we have to revisit. First, I appreciate \nthat the sponsors wish to repeal 18 U.S.C. 1738 to stop the practice of \nselling counterfeit identification products with disclaimers that are \nintentionally fashioned to be easily removable on both computer \ntemplates and counterfeit identification documents but that \nnevertheless avoid criminal liability by displaying the disclaimer. \nThis is a practice that deserves congressional attention, but I am \nconcerned that repeal of this section may go too far, since it may \nremove legal protection for some legitimate businesses that\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\nsell identification documents for legitimate reasons, such as for \nsecurity or private guard services.\n\n  The legislative history of section 1738 makes clear that this \nprovision was considered necessary when passed because private \nidentification documents ``are used by many persons who have no \nofficial record of their date of birth and are unable to obtain \nofficial identification cards for that reason. The conferees determined \nthat to simply require privately issued identification cards to carry a \nprominent disclaimer that they are not government documents would \nadequately protect the public interest.'' Conference Report on False \nIdentification Crime Control Act of 1982 (H.R. 6946), 97th Cong., 2d \nSess., Rpt. 97-975, at p. 4 (December 17, 1982). It remains unclear to \nme how many legitimate uses and businesses will be affected by repeal \nof this section, and the manner in which this repeal is being enacted \nmakes it impossible to know in advance.\n  Second, the substitute amendment contains an exemption for \ninteractive computer services that was added after consideration by the \nJudiciary Committee. Representatives of internet service providers \nexpressed concern that the breadth of the intent standard in the bill, \nwhich provides that a defendant need only knowingly transfer or make \navailable by electronic means an illegal document-making implement, \nsuch as computer template, to risk criminal liability. They contend \nthat this scienter requirement could put at risk ISPs that simply offer \na third party the ability to communicate or locate material that is \notherwise illegal, even though the ISP does not know that the document-\nmaking implement can be or will be used to make false identification \ndocuments and does not intend to be facilitating an illegal \ntransaction.\n  The ISPs may have correctly pointed out a problem in the scope of the \ncriminal liability but the cure should not be to grant a blanket \nexemption for service providers. There is no comparable exemption \nanywhere else in the federal criminal code. A better cure would have \nbeen to clarify the scope of the criminal prohibition and to define \nmore precisely the scienter requirement for criminal liability. Instead \nof making the new crime applicable to anyone who ``knowingly produces \nor transfers a document-making implement that is designed for use in \nthe production of a false identification document,'' the bill could \nhave been more precisely drawn to cover only a person who ``knowingly \nproduces or transfers a document-making implement with the intent that \nit be used in the production of a false identification document.'' This \nwould have avoided the necessity of carving out exemptions for innocent \nISPs that merely facilitate the transfer of illegal document-making \nimplements, without knowing the nature of the what is being \ntransferred.\n  Moreover, including an immunity provision in this bill for ISPs \nraises a question about their criminal liability exposure under many \nother criminal statutes that make illegal the knowing transfer of \nillegal materials without requiring specific knowledge on the part of \nthe transferor that the material is illegal. For example, federal law \nprohibits the knowing distribution, including by computer, of any \nmaterial that contains child pornography. 18 U.S.C. 2251A(a)(2)(B). \nThere is no blanket immunity for ISPs for facilitating the distribution \nof such illegal material. Will inclusion of a blanket immunity \nprovision in this bill encourage courts to construe broadly the \nprohibitions in other statutes to cover innocent ISPs? This is a matter \nthat could benefit from additional scrutiny.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 158 submitted by \nSenator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 158) expressing the \n     sense of Congress regarding appropriate actions of the U.S. \n     Government to facilitate the settlement of claims of former \n     members of the Armed Forces against Japanese companies that \n     profited from the slave labor that those personnel were \n     forced to perform for those companies as POWs of Japan during \n     World War II.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise today with my cosponsors, Senators Feinstein and \nBingaman, in support of a sense of the Senate resolution to encourage \nthe U.S. Government, through the State Department or other appropriate \noffices, to use its best efforts to open a dialog between former \nAmerican POW's forced into slave labor in Japan and the private \nJapanese companies that profited from their labor. This is a very \nimportant issue to our veterans and I think they deserve our help.\n  On April 9, 1942, Allied forces in the Philippines surrendered Bataan \nto the Japanese. Ten to twelve thousand American soldiers were forced \nto march some 60 miles in broiling heat in a deadly trek known as the \nBataan Death March. Following a lengthy internment under horrific \nconditions, thousands of POW's were shipped to Japan in the holds of \nfreighters known as ``Hell Ships.'' Once in Japan, many of these POW's \nwere forced into slave labor for private Japanese steel mills and other \nprivate companies until the end of the war.\n  Fifty years have passed since the atrocities occurred, yet our \nveterans are still waiting for accountability and justice. \nUnfortunately, global political and security needs of the time often \novershadowed their legitimate claims for justice--and these former \nPOW's were once again asked to sacrifice for their country. Following \nthe end of the war, for example, our government allegedly instructed \nmany of the POW's held by Japan not to discuss their experiences and \ntreatment. Some were even asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. \nConsequently, many Americans remain unaware of the atrocities that took \nplace and the suffering our POW's endured.\n  Following the passage of a California statute extending the statute \nof limitations for World War II claims until 2010 and the recent \nlitigation involving victims of Holocaust, a new effort is underway by \nthe former POW's in Japan to seek compensation from the private \ncompanies which profited from their labor. Let me say at the outset, \nthat this is not a dispute with the Japanese people and these are not \nclaims against the Japanese Government. Rather, these are private \nclaims against the private Japanese companies that profited from the \nslave labor of our American soldiers who they held as prisoners. These \nare the same types of claims raised by survivors of the Holocaust \nagainst the private German corporations who forced them into labor.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the claims being \nmade by the former American POW's against the private Japanese \ncompanies. One issue of concern for the Committee was whether the POW's \nheld in Japan are receiving an appropriate level of advocacy from the \nU.S. Government. In the Holocaust litigation, the United States \nappropriately played a facilitating role in discussions between the \nGerman companies and the victims. The Justice Department also declined \nto file a statement of interest in the litigation--even when requested \nby the court. The efforts of the administration were entirely \nappropriate and the settlement, which was just recently finalized, was \nan invaluable step toward moving forward from the past.\n  Here, in contrast, there has been no effort by our Government, \nthrough the State Department or otherwise, to open a dialog between the \nJapanese and the former POW's. Moreover, in response to a request from \nthe court, the Justice Department did, in fact, file two statements of \ninterest which were very damaging to the claims of the POW's--stating \nin essence that their claims were barred by the 1951 Peace Treaty with \nJapan and the War Claims Act.\n  From a moral perspective, the claims of those forced into labor by \nprivate German companies and private Japanese companies appear to be of \nsimilar merit, yet they have spurred different responses from the \nadministration. Why?\n  Here in the Senate, we have been doing what we can to help these \nformer prisoners of war. With the help of Senator Feinstein, we have \nmoved through the Judiciary Committee Senate bill 1902, the Japanese \nRecords Disclosure Act, which would set up a commission to declassify \nthousands of Japanese Imperial Army records held by the U.S. Government \nafter appropriate screening for sensitive national security information \nand the like.\n  The Senate is also doing what it can to fulfill our Government's \nresponsibility to these men by including a provision in the DOD \nauthorization bill which would pay a $20,000 gratuity to POW's from \nBataan and Corregidor who were forced into labor. Such payment would be \nin addition to any other payments these veterans may receive under \nlaw--and thus would not compromise any of the claims asserted in the \nlitigation against the Japanese companies.\n  The bill I introduce today, an expression of the sense of the Senate \nthat the U.S. Government should attempt to facilitate a dialog, as it \ndid in the German case, is a logical and appropriate extension of our \nother efforts. Ultimately, I do not know where we will come out on the \nprecise meaning of the Treaty. Regardless of how the technical legal \nissues are resolved--which the courts will determine--in light of the \nmoral imperative and interests of simple fairness, we must ask \nourselves why shouldn't the United States facilitate a dialog between \nthe parties? When is good faith discussion a bad idea? I think we owe \nthis much to these brave veterans and their families. I believe a good \nfaith dialog is the first step towards a just resolution that \naccommodates the various moral, legal, national security, and foreign \npolicy interests which are at play.\n  I urge all Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 158) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 158\n\n       Whereas from December 1941 to April 1942, members of the \n     United States Armed Forces fought valiantly against \n     overwhelming Japanese military forces on the Bataan peninsula \n     of the Island of Luzon in the Philippines, thereby preventing \n     Japan from accomplishing strategic objectives necessary for \n     achieving early military victory in the Pacific during World \n     War II;\n       Whereas after receiving orders to surrender on April 9, \n     1942, many of those valiant combatants were taken prisoner of \n     war by Japan and forced to march 85 miles from the Bataan \n     peninsula to a prisoner-of-war camp at former Camp O'Donnell;\n       Whereas, of the members of the United States Armed Forces \n     captured by Imperial Japanese forces during the entirety of \n     World\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\n     War II, a total of 36,260 of them survived their capture and \n     transit to Japanese prisoner-of-war camps to be interned in \n     those camps, and 37.3 percent of those prisoners of war died \n     during their imprisonment in those camps:\n       Whereas that march resulted in more than 10,000 deaths by \n     reason of starvation, disease, and executions;\n       Whereas many of those prisoners of war were transported to \n     Japan where they were forced to perform slave labor for the \n     benefit of private Japanese companies under barbaric \n     conditions that included torture and inhumane treatment as to \n     such basic human needs as shelter, feeding, sanitation, and \n     health care;\n       Whereas the private Japanese companies unjustly profited \n     from the uncompensated labor cruelly exacted from the \n     American personnel in violation of basic human rights;\n       Whereas these Americans do not make any claims against the \n     Japanese Government or the people of Japan, but, rather, seek \n     some measure of justice from the Japanese companies that \n     profited from their slave labor;\n       Whereas they have asserted claims for compensation against \n     the private Japanese companies in various courts in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the United States Government has, to date, opposed \n     the efforts of these Americans to receive redress for the \n     slave labor and inhumane treatment, and has not made any \n     efforts to facilitate discussions among the parties;\n       Whereas in contrast to the claims of the Americans who were \n     prisoners of war in Japan, the Department of State has \n     facilitated a settlement of the claims made against private \n     German businesses by individuals who were forced into slave \n     labor by the Government of the Third Reich of Germany for the \n     benefit of the German businesses during World War II: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n         Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that it is in \n     the interest of justice and fairness that the United States, \n     through the Secretary of State or other appropriate \n     officials, put forth its best efforts to facilitate \n     discussions designed to resolve all issues between former \n     members of the Armed Forces of the United States who were \n     prisoners of war forced into slave labor for the benefit of \n     Japanese companies during World War II and the private \n     Japanese companies who profited from their slave labor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11433-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11433-S11436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FIRE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I need to address a slightly different issue \nat this point, to again explain why we are where we are. I began in \nJune with regular speeches about how we were going to wind up in this \nposition: The other side of the aisle was objecting to motions to \nproceed to appropriations bills and the extended debate we had to have \non whether we could debate put the Senate in a situation where we had \nto do all of our negotiations with the White House, instead of, as the \nConstitution says, where the Senate will determine in conjunction with \nthe House the expenditures of this Nation.\n  That is exactly what has happened. There has been delay after delay \nafter delay that has pushed the appropriations process to this point. \nYesterday, the President vetoed the Treasury-Postal bill. Through a \nquote from Congress Daily, we learn a top administration official \nconfirmed Wednesday that the President will sign it; we didn't need to \nmake changes to it.\n  There is a lot of speculation why this was vetoed. The President said \nyesterday there was nothing really wrong with the Treasury-Postal bill, \nbut he just didn't think we ought to have that bill signed until we \ncomplete the few other remaining bills. He arbitrarily vetoed the bill \nafter a top administration official said the President would sign it \nand after the Democratic leadership in Congress had agreed to it.\n  The President keeps moving the goalposts in an attempt to provoke a \nconfrontation with Congress. As a result, it has made negotiations next \nto impossible. How can you negotiate when the commitments aren't kept, \nwhen the rules aren't followed?\n  One most important to me is the ergonomics amendment. That is an \namendment passed in the Senate on a bipartisan vote. The exact same \namendment was passed on the House side by a bipartisan vote. Labor-HHS \nhas some monetary items that are different between the two sides but \nnot that amendment. A conference committee was formed and they met. The \nWhite House said, we don't like the amendment on ergonomics. Both sides \nof the conference committee said that is not conferenceable. It was the \nsame on both sides.\n  Now, because we get in this little bit of a jam and the President \ngets a little more leverage in his negotiations, we are now at a point \nwhere some of the leadership had said, OK, we won't make it a year's \ndelay before more work can be done on OSHA with ergonomics; it will \nonly be until March 1st. In the last minutes, that goalpost was moved \nagain. The President said, no, I want to be able to put it into effect, \nand they can take it out of effect if there is a new administration \nnext year.\n  Let me state how difficult a procedure that would be. It would be \nnext to impossible to remove an absolutely ridiculous rule that is \nlandsliding through this place by an agency out of control, that has \nknown what it wanted to do from the very first day that it wrote the \nrule. It has done every single thing it can to make sure that rule \ncomes into effect. They don't care who doesn't like it.\n\n  Our ergonomics amendment, which delays it one year, is not about \nwhether we should have an ergonomics rule. It is not a prohibition \nagainst an ergonomics rule. It is most definitely not a dispute about \nthe importance of safety for American workers. We need to have safety \nfor American workers, but we need to do it the right way.\n  This amendment was passed in a bipartisan way. It is imperative that \nCongress insists there be a reasonable amount of time on this rule. The \nrule was only published a year ago. They are anticipating that maybe \nthey can even squeak by before there is agreement and get this rule \nfinalized and approved. That will be quicker than OSHA has done a rule. \nThat would be record time.\n  They mention this was brought up about 12 or 13 years ago. There has \nnot been agreement on it since that time. It never got published until \na year ago. There has been no official action until a year ago.\n  Let me state why we ought to be concerned about this rule and why the \ndelay occurred, in a bipartisan way, for a year. People didn't approve \nof the way OSHA was handling it, the way they were going about it. OSHA \npaid over 70 contractors a total of $1.75 million to help with the \nergonomics rule. They paid 28 contractors $10,000 each to testify at \nthe public rulemaking hearings. They didn't only pay the witnesses to \ntestify; they didn't notify the public, and then they assisted the \nwitnesses with the preparation of their testimony. Then they brought \nthem in for practice runs for the hearing. Then they paid them to tear \napart the testimony of the opposition. That is not the way we do things \naround here.\n  That resulted in people on both sides of the aisle being extremely \nupset with the way it was handled. The way that OSHA has handled this \ngives every indication that the way they wrote it is the way it has to \nbe; that they are not going to pay attention to any of the comments or \nthe additional testimony. They knew they were right when they\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\nwrote it and they will be darned if they are going to change it. That \nis not how we do rules, particularly ones that cost billions of \ndollars, without getting the desired effect. That is the purpose of a \nrule, to get a desired effect. This one will not get the desired \neffect.\n  It is interesting to note the Bureau of Labor Statistics says, \nwithout the rule, United States employers reduced ergonomic injuries by \n29 percent. What do the hearing records show? With the ergonomics rule \nthey would get zero percent the first year and 7 percent the second \nyear. American business is doing better than that without the rule. How \nare they doing it? Somebody is helping them to figure out what they \nneed to do.\n  Small business in this country has trouble handling the OSHA rules. \nThey have over 12,000 pages of regulations they have to digest. If you \nare a small employer, you cannot read 12,000 pages in a year. Any time \nthey get help on knowing what they can do to provide safety in the \nbusiness, they do it. It is shown time and time again on every kind of \ninjury there is. So we put in the motion to slow down OSHA a little \nbit, to make sure they took the necessary time to look at the rule and \nto get rid of this perception that their first idea was the only idea \nand the right idea and going to be the final idea. Somehow, they have \nto work past that perception.\n  The amendment is a reasonable 1-year delay. It will ensure that OSHA \ntakes the time to evaluate all 7,000 comments it has received and try \nto resolve the problems with the rule. It also gives Congress the time \nto perform its appropriate oversight function.\n  So there is a reason for a delay. Rules in OSHA have been extremely \npermanent. Any one that has ever passed has had court trials and a \nnumber of them have been reversed. But if they make it through the \ncourt trial, did you know they have not been revised in the time that \nOSHA has been around? Do you think technology has changed a little bit? \nDo you think there is any reason we ought to look at rules that are 29 \nyears old? We probably ought to. Instead, we are rushing into an area \nhere that not only provides a rule without sufficient oversight, but it \nprovides a rule that gets into workers comp. Yes, it gets into workers \ncomp. In its preamble, OSHA specifically prohibits any right to impose \non workers comp, and there is good reason for that. Workers comp has \nbeen around a long time. There are precedents that have been developed. \nThey are important precedents.\n  Here is the biggest problem with it. You can get paid twice for the \nsame injury. It is kind of a rule of mine: If I can make more by not \nworking than I can working, don't expect me to show up. That is going \nto cause some major problems for business in this country. It is \nsomething that needs to be revised. Again, there is no indication at \nall it would be revised.\n  So the House folks and the Senate folks--not just the House folks, as \nhas been written up in some of the papers--have been incensed the \nPresident is insisting this rule be allowed to go into force but not to \nbe enforced until next year. That is not the way we do it. That is one \nof the things that is keeping Labor-HHS from being approved now. It \nshould not be the major crux of an appropriations bill, but it is a \nvery important point that we need ensure that any changes made in rules \nthat work on the worker get the proper amount of oversight.\n\n  That is all we are asking for, an opportunity to do the proper \noversight on it and to get an indication of some sort from OSHA that \nthey are going to pay attention to any of the 7,000 comments they \nreceived.\n  We are at a point where we need to wrap up this session. We are at a \npoint where we need to get the work done. But that is one item I will \nstay around here for until next year, if I have to, to be sure we do \nthe job right and not in a hurry. We do not need to rush things.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have had a good discussion on the bankruptcy bill. \nWe will have further discussion postcloture. I think we have a good \nproduct. This conference report is basically the Senate-passed \nbankruptcy bill with certain minimal changes made to accommodate the \nHouse of Representatives. The means test retains the essential \nflexibility that we passed in the Senate. The new consumer protections \nsponsored by Senator Reed of Rhode Island relating to reaffirmation is \nin our conference report before the Senate. The credit card disclosure \nsponsored by Senator Torricelli is also in this final conference \nreport. We also maintain Senator Leahy's special protections for \nvictims of domestic violence and Senator Feingold's special protections \nfor expenses associated with caring for nondependent family members.\n  I think it is pretty clear that on the consumer bankruptcy side, we \nmaintain the Senate's position. Anybody who says otherwise has not read \nthe conference report.\n  It is also important to realize how much of an improvement this \nlegislation is for child support claims. The organizations that \nspecialize in tracking down deadbeat fathers think this bill will be a \ntremendous help in collecting child support.\n  I have a letter I am going to ask to have printed in the Record from \nMr. Philip Strauss of the Family Support Bureau of the San Francisco \ndistrict attorney's office. Mr. Strauss notes that professional \norganizations of people who actually collect child support\n\n       . . . have endorsed the child support provisions of the \n     Bankruptcy Reform Act as crucially needed modifications of \n     the Bankruptcy Code, which will significantly improve the \n     collection of support during bankruptcy.\n\n  There you have it. According to people in the front lines, the \nbankruptcy bill is good for collecting child support. So I say to my \ncolleagues, if you have concerns about child support, look at this \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          District Attorney Family\n\n\n                                               Support Bureau,\n\n                            San Francisco, CA, September 14, 1999.\n     Re S. 625 [Bankruptcy Reform Act].\n\n       Dear Senators: I am writing this letter in response to the \n     July 14, 1999 letter prepared\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n     by the National Women's Law Center. That letter asserts in \n     conclusory terms that the Bankruptcy Reform Act would put \n     women and children support creditors at greater risk than \n     they are under current bankruptcy law. The letter ends with \n     the endorsement of numerous women's organizations.\n       I have been engaged in the profession of collecting child \n     support for the past 27 years in the Office of the District \n     Attorney of San Francisco, Family Support Bureau. I have \n     practiced and taught bankruptcy law for the past ten years. I \n     participated in the drafting of the child support provisions \n     in the House version of bankruptcy reform and testified on \n     those provisions before the House Subcommittee on Commercial \n     and Administrative Law this year.\n       I believe it is important to point out that none of the \n     organizations opposing this legislation which are listed in \n     the July 14th letter actually engages in the collection of \n     support. On the other hand, the largest professional \n     organizations which perform this function have endorsed the \n     child support provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act as \n     crucially needed modifications of the Bankruptcy Code which \n     will significantly improve the collection of support during \n     bankruptcy. These organizations include:\n       1. The National Child Support Enforcement Association.\n       2. The National District Attorneys Association.\n       3. The National Association of Attorneys General.\n       4. The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement \n     Council.\n       The thrust of the criticism made by the National Women's \n     Law Center is that by not discharging certain debts owed to \n     credit and finance companies, the institutions would be in \n     competition with women and children for scarce resources of \n     the debtor and that the bill fails ``to insure that support \n     payments will come first.'' They say that the ``bill does not \n     ensure that, in this intensified competition for the debtor's \n     limited resources, parents and children owed support will \n     prevail over the sophisticated collection departments of \n     these powerful interests.''\n       With all due respect, nothing could be further from the \n     truth. While the argument is superficially plausible, it \n     ignores the reality of the mechanisms actually available \n     for collection of domestic support obligations in contrast \n     with those available for non-support debts.\n       Absent the filing of the bankruptcy case, no professional \n     support collector considers the existence of a debt to a \n     financial institution as posing a significant obstacle to the \n     collection of the support debt. The reason is simple: the \n     tools available to collect support debts outside of the \n     bankruptcy process are vastly superior to those available to \n     financial institutions and, in the majority of cases, take \n     priority over the collection of non-support debts.\n       More than half of all child support is collected by \n     earnings withholding. Under federal law such procedures have \n     priority over any other garnishments of the debtor's salary \n     or wages and can take as much as 65% of such salary or wages. \n     By contrast the Consumer Credit Act prevents non-support \n     creditors from enforcing their debts by garnishing more that \n     twenty-five percent of the debtor's salary.\n       In addition, there are many other techniques that are only \n     made available to support creditors and not to those \n     ``sophisticated collection departments of . . . [those] \n     powerful interests:'' These include:\n       1. Interception of state and federal tax refunds to pay \n     child support arrears.\n       2. Garnishment or interception of Workers' Compensation or \n     Unemployment Insurance Benefits.\n       3. Free or low cost collection services provided by the \n     government.\n       4. Use of interstate processes to collect support \n     arrearage, including interstate earnings withholding orders \n     and interstate real estate support liens.\n       5. License revocation for support delinquents.\n       6. Criminal prosecution and contempt procedures for failing \n     to pay support debts.\n       7. Federal prosecution for nonpayment of support and \n     federal collection of support debts.\n       8. Denial of passports to support debtors.\n       9. Automatic treatment of support debts as judgments which \n     are collectible under state judgment laws, including \n     garnishment, execution, and real and personal property liens.\n       10. Collection of support debts from exempt assets.\n       11. The right of support creditors or their representatives \n     to appear in any bankruptcy court without the payment of \n     filing fees or the requirements of formal admission.\n       While the above list is not exhaustive, it is illustrative \n     of the numerous advantages given to support creditors over \n     other creditors. And while all of these advantages may not \n     ultimately guarantee that support will be collected, they \n     profoundly undermine the assumption of the National Women's \n     Law Center that the mere existence of financial institution \n     debt will somehow put support creditors at a disadvantage. To \n     put it otherwise, support may sometimes be difficult to \n     collect, but collection of support debt does not become more \n     difficult simply because financial institutions also seek to \n     collect their debts.\n       The National Women's Law Center analysis includes without \n     specification that the support ``provisions fail to insure \n     that support payments will come first, ahead of the increased \n     claims of the commercial creditors.'' Professional support \n     collectors, on the other hand, have no trouble in \n     understanding how this bill will enhance the collection of \n     support ahead of the increased claims of commercial \n     creditors. To them, such creditors are irrelevant outside the \n     bankruptcy process. And in light of the treatment of domestic \n     support obligations as priority claims under current law and \n     the enhanced priority treatment of such claims in the \n     proposed legislation, this objection seems particularly \n     unfounded.\n       Where support creditors are indeed at a disadvantage under \n     current law is during the bankruptcy of a support debtor. \n     Under existing bankruptcy law support creditors frequently \n     have to hire attorneys to enforce support obligations during \n     bankruptcy or attempt the treacherous task of maneuvering \n     through the complexities of bankruptcy process themselves. \n     Attorneys working in the federal child support program--\n     indeed, even experienced family law attorneys--may find \n     bankruptcy courts and procedures so unfamiliar that they are \n     ineffective in ensuring that the debtor pays all support when \n     due. Ideally, procedures for the enforcement of support \n     during bankruptcy should be self-executing and uninterrupted \n     by the bankruptcy process. The pending bankruptcy reform \n     legislation goes far in this direction. To suggest that women \n     and children support creditors are not vastly aided by this \n     bill is to ignore the specifics of the legislation.\n       In the first place support claims are given the highest \n     priority. Commercial debts do not have any statutory \n     priority. Thus when there is competition between commercial \n     and support creditors, support creditors will be paid first. \n     And, unlike commercial creditors, support creditors must be \n     paid in full when the debtor files a case under chapter 12 or \n     13. Unlike payments to commercial creditors, the trustee \n     cannot recover as preferential transfers support payments \n     made during the ninety days preceding the filing of the \n     bankruptcy petition, and liens securing support may not be \n     avoided as they may be with commercial judgment liens. Unlike \n     commercial creditors, support creditors may collect their \n     debts through interception of income tax refunds, license \n     revocations, and adverse credit reporting, all--under this \n     bill--without the need to seek relief from the automatic \n     bankruptcy stay.\n       In addition, support creditors will benefit--again, unlike \n     commercial creditors--from chapter 12 and 13 plans which must \n     provide for full payment of on-going support and unassigned \n     support arrears. Further benefits to support creditors which \n     are not available to commercial creditors is the security in \n     knowing that chapter 12 and 13 debtors will not be able to \n     discharge other debts unless all postpetion support and \n     prepetition unassigned arrears have been paid in full.\n       Finally, and most importantly, support creditors will \n     receive--even during bankruptcy--current support and \n     unassigned arrearage payments through the federally mandated \n     earnings withholding procedures without the usual \n     interruption caused by the filing of a bankruptcy case. Like \n     many other provisions of the bill, this provision is self-\n     executing, the bankruptcy proceeding will not affect this \n     collection process. Frankly, and contrary to the assertions \n     of the National Women's Law Center, it is difficult to \n     conceive how this bill could better insure that ``support \n     payments will come first, ahead of the increased claims of \n     the commercial creditors.''\n       The National Women's Law Center states that some \n     improvements were made in the Senate Judiciary Committee. \n     This organization may wish to think twice about that \n     conclusion. What the Senate amendments did was to distinguish \n     in some cases between support arrears that are assigned (to \n     the government) and those that are unassigned (owned directly \n     to the parent). The NWLC might have a point if assigned \n     arrears were strictly government property and provided no \n     benefit to women and children creditors. However, upon a \n     closer look, arrears assigned to the government may greatly \n     inure to the benefit of such creditors.\n       In the first place the entire federal child support program \n     was created to recover support which should have been paid by \n     absent parents, but was not. Such recovered funds became and \n     remain a source of funding to pay public assistance benefits, \n     especially by the states which contribute about one half of \n     the costs of such benefits.\n       More directly significant, however, is the fact that under \n     the welfare legislation of 1996 (the Personal Responsibility \n     and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) support arrearage \n     assigned to the government and not collected during the \n     period aid is paid reverts to the custodial parent when aid \n     ceases. This scenario will become increasingly common in the \n     very near future as the five year lifetime right to public \n     assistance ends for individual custodial parents. In such \n     cases this parent will face the double whammy of being \n     disqualified from receiving the caretaker share of public \n     assistance and--because of the Senate amendments--not \n     receiving arrears or intercepted tax refunds because they \n     were assigned at the time the debtor filed for bankruptcy \n     protection.\n       In addition, prior to the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     amendments a debtor could not obtain confirmation of a plan \n     if he were not current in making all postpetition support \n     payments. The advantage of this scheme was that it was self-\n     executing. Under the Senate amendments a debtor may obtain \n     confirmation even when he is not paying his on-going support \n     obligation. He is only required to\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\n     provide for such payments in his plan. In such cases it will \n     then be the burden of the support creditor to bring a \n     bankruptcy proceeding to dismiss the case if the debtor stops \n     paying. While this procedure is a welcome addition to the \n     arsenal of remedies available to support creditors, it should \n     not have supplanted the self-executing remedy which required \n     the debtor to certify he was current in postpetition support \n     payments before the court could confirm the plan.\n       While the Senate version of bankruptcy reform should \n     certainly be amended to restore the advantages of the earlier \n     draft, it does, even in its present form, provide crucial \n     improvements in the protections and advantages afforded \n     spousal and child support creditors over other creditors \n     during the bankruptcy process. These improvements will ease \n     the plight of all support creditors--men, women, and \n     children--whose well-being and prosperity may be wholly or \n     partially dependent on the full and timely payment of \n     support. Congress has created the federal child support \n     program within title IV-D of the Social Security Act. It is \n     the opinion of those whose job it is to carry out this \n     program that the Bankruptcy Reform Act provides the long \n     overdue assistance needed for success in collecting money \n     during bankruptcy for child and spousal support creditors.\n       Most of the concerns raised by the groups opposing the bill \n     do not, in fact, center on the language of the domestic \n     support provisions themselves. Instead they are based on \n     vague generalized statements that the bill hurts debtors, or \n     the women and children living with debtors, or the ex-wives \n     and children who depend on the debtor for support. It is \n     difficult to respond point by point to such claims when they \n     provide no specifics, but they appear to fall into two \n     categories.\n       The first suggests that the reform legislation will result \n     in leaving debtors with greater debt after bankruptcy which \n     will ``compete'' with the claims of former spouses and \n     children. As discussed above there is little likelihood that \n     such competition would adversely affect the collection of \n     support debts. In any event the bill does little to change \n     the number or types of nondischargeable debt held by \n     commercial lenders. it will slightly expand the presumption \n     of nondischargeability for luxury goods charged during the \n     immediate pre-bankruptcy period and will make debt incurred \n     to pay a nondischargeable debt also nondischargeable. It is \n     doubtful that either provision will, in reality, have much \n     effect on the vast majority of ``poor but honest'' debtors \n     who do not use bankruptcy as a financial planning mechanism \n     or run up debts immediately before filing for bankruptcy in \n     anticipation of discharging those obligations.\n       The second contention is presumably directed at a number of \n     provisions in the bill that are designed to eliminate \n     perceived abuses by debtors in the current system. The \n     primary brunt of this attack is borne by the so-called \n     ``means testing'' or ``needs based bankruptcy'' provisions \n     which would amend the current language of Section 707(b). \n     Most of the opposition appears to stem from the notion \n     that means testing would be a wholly novel proposition. \n     Such a conclusion is plainly incorrect. Virtually every \n     court that has ever considered the issue holds that \n     Section 707(b) already includes a means test or, more \n     accurately, a hundred or a thousand means tests, one for \n     each judge who considers the issue. The current Code \n     language sets no standards or guidelines for applying this \n     test, thus leaving the outcome of a motion subject to the \n     unstructured discretion of each bankruptcy judge. The \n     proposed bankruptcy reform legislation attempts to \n     prescribe one test that all courts must apply.\n       The precise terms of that standard have been under constant \n     revision since the bankruptcy reform bills were introduced \n     last year, and undoubtedly they will continue to be fine-\n     tuned to ensure that they strike a balance between preventing \n     abuse and becoming unduly expensive and burdensome. But mere \n     opposition to any change in the present law, and vague claims \n     that any and all attempts to address such existing abuses as \n     serial filings are oppressive and will harm women and \n     children, does nothing to advance the dialogue. And worse, \n     the critics appear content to sacrifice the palpable \n     advantages which this legislation would provide to support \n     creditors during the bankruptcy process for defeat of this \n     legislation based on vague and unarticulated fears that women \n     will be unfairly disadvantaged as bankruptcy debtors. In more \n     ways than one the critics would favor throwing out the baby \n     with the bath water. No one who has a genuine interest in the \n     collection of support should permit such inexplicit and \n     speculative fears to supplant the specific and considerable \n     advantages which this reform legislation provides to those in \n     need of support.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                Philip L. Strauss,\n                                      Assistant District Attorney.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, listen to the people who actually know \nhow it is in the trenches collecting child support. Don't listen to \ninside-Washington special interests. Don't listen to academics who have \nno real world knowledge on this subject.\n  I would add a word about cracking down on the very wealthy \nindividuals who abuse the bankruptcy system. If you listened to the \nSenator from Minnesota last night, you might have had the impression \nthat the Homestead exemption is a giant loophole that this bill does \nnot deal with. We have had the General Accounting Office look at the \nquestion of how frequently the Homestead exemption is abused by wealthy \npeople in bankruptcy. The General Accounting Office found that less \nthan 1 percent of bankruptcy filings in States where there are \nunlimited Homestead exemptions involving homesteads of over $100,000. \nThat means 99 percent of bankruptcy filings were not abusive. So this \nis not a loophole. We might say it is a little tiny pinhole.\n  But there is a real problem with very wealthy people filing for \nbankruptcy under chapter 11, which is the chapter of the bankruptcy \ncode normally left for corporations. Because chapter 11 is not designed \nfor individuals, there are numerous loopholes that allow the wealthy to \nlive high on the hog while paying nothing to their creditors. This bill \nbefore the Senate fixes this very major problem so these wealthy people \nwill know they are no longer going to get off scot-free.\n  This bill combats abuse wherever we find it. The Homestead exemption \nis capped at $500,000 for homes purchased within 2 years prior to the \ndeclaration of bankruptcy. The chapter 11 loophole is closed. This is \nwhat real reform is all about.\n  In sum, in this conference report we preserve the proconsumer \namendment adopted in the Senate. We crack down hard on abuses by the \nwealthy. We help child support claimants in a very major way. This bill \nis good for the American consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for his \ntremendous leadership on this bill. As he has said so plainly and \neffectively, that anyone who is concerned about consumer problems, \ndebtors, fraud and abuse, and who does not believe this bill is an \nimprovement over current law, has not read the bill.\n  I am going to talk about some of those things. This bill makes \nprogress in virtually every area over current law. Senator Grassley has \npatiently, for over 3 years, gone through hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I have been honored to serve, in his subcommittee, \non the floor of this Senate, in conferences, committees, and meetings \ntrying to eliminate every possible objection anyone could have to this \nbill.\n  When we get to this point after having tremendous votes--over 90 \nvotes, one time 97-1 we passed this legislation--and we still have not \nmade it law because a few dedicated people are threatening to hold it \nup and the President has indicated he may veto this bill that makes \nreal progress in protecting consumers and fair and just legal dispute \nresolution.\n  Bankruptcy law is operative in Federal court. It is presided over by \na Federal bankruptcy judge, not an Article III judge that presides over \nFederal district court, but a Federal judge nevertheless. All the laws \nused in this court, unless the Federal law says otherwise, are federal.\n  There was a Bankruptcy Reform Act passed by Congress in 1978. We have \nhad no significant reforms since then. During the time since 1980, just \n2 short years after the passage of that act, there were 330,000 \nbankruptcy filings. In 1998, there were 1.4 million bankruptcy \nfilings--a 423-percent increase during a time of unprecedented economic \ngrowth and prosperity.\n  What is happening? Certainly it is time for us, as good stewards of \nAmerican legal policy, to take a minute to find out what is happening \nin bankruptcy court, to see what the abuses are and what loopholes \nclever lawyers are now using--to see if we can't improve it and make it \nfairer and better for all concerned. We absolutely can do that. That is \nwhy this legislation, essentially as it is today, has repeatedly passed \nthe House and the Senate with overwhelming majorities. It passed the \nJudiciary Committee 15-3 and 16-2. That is why it ought to pass today.\n  It is absolutely stunning to me that we are at a point where this \nbill may not pass because of the misinformation and politics that is \nhappening here. There are now 3,474 bankruptcy filings per day. This \nchart shows the increase\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\nin filings subsequent to the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. It shows a \ntremendous increase. We are not making up these numbers. There are a \nlot of reasons for it.\n  Actually, what has happened is that a cottage industry has sprung up. \nTurn on your TV, turn on your cable channels, look in your newspapers. \nYou will see the ads: ``Lawyers: Wipe out your debts. Got problems \npaying your debts? Call old Joe the attorney, he will take care of you. \nHe will save you rent. You can get out of paying rent.'' All of a \nsudden people are doing that.\n  In fact, here is an ad in one paper--and I am going to talk about it \na little later--``7 months free rent,'' just call your old buddy the \nbankruptcy lawyer. ``We guarantee you can stay in your apartment or \nhouse 2 to 7 months more''--that means more than you would get under \neviction rules of the State which protect tenants from being evicted \nunfairly--``more without paying a penny. Find out how. We can stop the \nsheriff or the marshal.'' Call old John your bankruptcy lawyer. This \nbill ends a host of abuses. It will greatly benefit women and children \nin their child support and alimony, and those facts cannot be denied.\n  Let me talk about some of the complaints we have heard first. They \nsay this is a procedural unfairness; that this is a bizarre way we have \ndone this, unprecedented, and unfair. We have had this bill up and \nabout for 3 years. It has been debated in so many different ways. It is \nnow part of the embassy security bill which is not at all unusual for \none piece of legislation to be made a part of another piece of \nlegislation as it passes through the Senate.\n\n  The Senate rules allow for that to happen and for it to come forward \nas a conference bill if the House has voted on it. The House has voted \non it and voted in favor of this bill. The House acted on October 12. \nIt is perfectly proper for it to be in the form it is.\n  There have been statements made that we have not had a chance to \namend or that we have not had full discussion. There has been constant \ndiscussion. There has been agreement time and again to amend it. \nSenator Kohl, a member of the Democratic Party who worked hard on this \nbill, and I battled to improve the homestead law. We did not get all we \nwanted, but we made substantial progress. The homestead law in this \nlegislation is significantly more fair than the unlimited homestead in \ncurrent law, and if we do not pass the bill, current law will remain in \neffect, and the homestead abuses will continue unchecked; whereas, this \nbill eliminates the most serious homestead law abuses.\n  That cannot be denied. I do not understand. We are almost in 1984 \nland. Is it perfect? Is it the enemy of the good? Yes, I would have \nliked to have made more progress. I debated it on this floor. I argued \nfor reform. A number of States have laws that would be overridden by \nchanges I would like to see, and they fought tenaciously to hold on to \ntheir own laws. We had to make some compromises to move this bill \nforward, though, and I think we have made substantial progress. If \nanybody is concerned about the homestead law, why in the world would \nthey vote to keep an old bill and not pass this new bill which improves \nthe homestead provisions. Senator Biden, a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee who was intimately involved in this bankruptcy law, was the \nranking member of this conference committee. He voted to bring the bill \nout to this floor in the form we are in today.\n  Senator Kennedy raised an odd objection. He claims he is worried \nabout poor people, but he wanted to put in language that would allow \npensioners who had millions of dollars in their pension accounts--no \nmatter how much they had in there--to keep that money and to not have \nto pay the guy who put the roof on their house when they filed for \nbankruptcy. They could file for bankruptcy and keep everything in their \npension account, even if it was millions of dollars.\n  Senator Grassley and I thought that was an unfair advantage to the \nrich. We wanted to cap the amount of money that could be kept in a \npension account. If you had a reasonable amount, $1 million, $750,000, \nwhatever the amount would be, we tried to contain it at a reasonable \namount. Why should a person keep $2 million in a pension account and \nnot pay his doctor, not pay the local hospital, not pay the man who \nfixed his roof, not pay the guy who repaired his car or his brother-in-\nlaw who loaned him money? Why should that happen? That is not fair, but \nthat is what Senator Kennedy wanted. He pushed for it and, as a \ncompromise--in fact, it does not happen that often--we agreed to \nconcede to that. To say that we were not making changes at the last \nminute is really strange.\n\n  Senator Schumer is going to vote against the bill if it does not have \nhis abortion clinic language in it; when, in fact, it does not have \nabortion clinic language in it now. And he is not going to get it in \nthere because it is an unfair targeting of one group of wrongdoers. He \nwill not agree to have broad-based language, as I would support, and \nothers will. So everybody is losing. The perfect becomes the enemy of \nthe good.\n  Let me mention this. In the 105th Congress, 2 years ago, the House \npassed this bill 306-118. It passed the Senate September 23, 1998, 97-\n1. In the 106th Congress, in May, the House voted 313-108 to pass this \nbill--an even higher vote. In the Senate, we voted in February of this \nyear, 83-14, to pass this bill.\n  It has broad bipartisan support. It is a tremendous step forward. Why \nin the world we are having the difficulties we are in having to \novercome a filibuster remains difficult for me to understand.\n  I want to talk a little bit about the homestead situation.\n  The Federal bankruptcy law says, with regard to how much money you \ncan protect as your homestead will be determined by State law.\n  In Alabama, the State says you cannot keep more than $5,000 in your \nhomestead. If you have more than $5,000 equity in your house, you need \nto go refinance it and use that money to pay the people the debts that \nyou owe them. Why should you keep it and not pay your debt if you have \nthis money?\n  In Texas, they say you can have an unlimited homestead exemption; \nalso in Florida, Kansas, and several other States there is an unlimited \nhomestead exemption. They did not want to give that up. I think it is \nan abuse.\n  We have an example of people leaving New York to go to Florida and \nbuying a multimillion-dollar mansion on the beach, pumping all their \nassets into it, holding off creditors for a few months, and then filing \nbankruptcy, wiping out what they owe to everybody; and they are free to \nsell their million-dollar mansion and use the million dollars to live \nhigh and carefree for the rest of their days. That is not right.\n  So we dealt with that. It was not easy. We had a lot of people here \nwho did not want to change that privilege of a State to set that \nhomestead exemption.\n  In Alabama, you can, for example, move from Mobile to Pensacola, FL--\n50 miles away--put all your money in a multimillion-dollar house on the \nbeach and defeat your creditors. That is not right, either. So we tried \nto do better. We came up with language that would stop that. Senator \nKohl and I debated it right here.\n  This legislation provides for a 7-year look-back. If you can prove \nthat a person moved to a State to gain preferential homestead \ntreatment, and he moved assets into a house in order to file bankruptcy \nand defeat creditors, and if that happened within 7 years, you could \nset that aside. That is a big step forward--a big step to attack the \nmost blatant fraud that occurs in this area. This provision is in the \nlegislation.\n  By passing this legislation, we can stop this abuse right now. If we \ndo not pass the legislation, we will be allowing this abuse to \ncontinue.\n  Let me talk about another very real problem, a loophole, a source of \nabuse that is causing problems and is very common.\n  People are using Federal bankruptcy laws to hold over on expired \nleases. That is a lease whose term is 1 year, and they are already \nbeyond that 1 year. They have not paid their rent. It has been \nterminated, without the debtor paying rent, just like this ad refers \nto.\n  The sheriff of Los Angeles County has really spoken out aggressively \non this. He said: ``3,886 people filed bankruptcy in Los Angeles County \nin 1996 alone in order to prevent the execution of valid, court-issued \neviction notices.''\n\n  As this ad says: ``We can stop the sheriff and the marshal and get \nyou\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\nmore time.'' You do not have to pay your rent. You do not have to pay \nmaybe the lady who has two duplexes and it is her retirement income. \nYou do not have to pay that. You can rip her off for 7 months. Just \nlisten to us.\n  How does it happen? It does happen. Judge Zurzolo, in In re Smith, a \nFederal bankruptcy judge in Los Angeles, wrote this:\n\n       . . . the bankruptcy courts in the Central District of \n     California are flooded with Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases \n     filed solely for the purpose of delaying unlawful detainer \n     evictions. Inevitably and swiftly following the filing of \n     these bankruptcy cases is the filing of motions for relief of \n     the Stay by landlords who are temporarily thwarted in this \n     abuse of the bankruptcy court system.\n\n  In other words, what happens? They file bankruptcy. The landlord is \nseeking to evict them. They file a motion in the bankruptcy court to \nstay the landlord from proceeding with his eviction until the \nbankruptcy case is completed. Then the landlord has to go and hire a \nlawyer to file a motion to say that this isn't a valid use of the stay. \nA stay only protects you in an asset. If your lease has expired, it is \nnot an asset. If it is not an asset, the court cannot protect it. It is \nthe landlord's; it is not the tenant's, if the lease has expired.\n  So what happens? Mr. President, 3,886 of those were filed, according \nto the sheriff, simply for that purpose--to get this unfair extension \nof time without paying rent.\n  How we have a law in this country that promotes and allows this kind \nof abuse is beyond me.\n  The truth is when the landlord files these motions, he always wins \nbecause the lease has expired or it has been legally terminated, and as \nsuch the tenant does not have any property. He does not have an \ninterest to be protected. It is the landlord's property, not the \ntenant's. It costs the landlord a lot of money; and a lot of months and \nweeks go by while he waits to be returned to rightful possession. The \ncurrent law is abusive to these law-abiding landlords. We can help \nthem--we can improve on current law--and we should. This bill provides \nthat help.\n  It also allows, of course, all the State protections for eviction \nthat every State provides.\n  California provides a lot before you can be evicted from an apartment \nor house. As the judge says: Contrary to the false representations made \nby these ``bankruptcy mills''--he is talking about this cottage \nindustry of lawyers and advertisers who run this stuff--despite their \nrepresentations, the debtor/tenants usually only obtain a brief respite \nfrom the consummation of the unlawful detainer convictions, after \nhaving paid hundreds of dollars to the lawyers. That is what the judge \nsaid.\n  There are 50,000 bankruptcies a year filed in the Central District of \nCalifornia. The judge says:\n\n       The mountain of paperwork that accompanies the thousands of \n     abusive ``unlawful detainer'' case filings places an \n     unnecessary burden on our already overworked and under-\n     compensated clerk's office. Of course this mountain of \n     paperwork flows from our clerk's office to the chambers of \n     our judges when landlords file their relief from Stay \n     motions. Because of the increased workload caused by these \n     blatantly abusive unlawful detainer case filings, our court \n     has had to establish special procedures dismissing these \n     cases as quickly as possible so that the court's dockets and \n     the clerk's files will not become more choked with paperwork \n     than they already are.\n\n  I am not saying this. This is a Federal judge saying this, who deals \nwith these cases every day. I am quoting:\n\n       These relief from stay motions are rarely contested and \n     never lost as long as the moving party provides adequate \n     notice of the motion and competent evidence to establish a \n     prima facie case.\n\n  Well, how did this arise? How could such happen? Bankruptcy provides \nfor an automatic stay. If someone is suing you and you file bankruptcy, \nyou don't have to go to court and defend all those cases where you have \nnot been able to pay your debts on time and a bunch of people sue you. \nIf you go into bankruptcy, everything stops. You have only to answer to \nthe bankruptcy judge who sorts out all these legal problems and tells \nyou whom to pay and how much to pay. An expired lease does not \nconstitute an asset of a bankruptcy estate, as the courts have plainly \nheld. That is what this language says, and it will stop this abuse from \ncontinuing unchecked and spreading around the rest of the country as \nmore and more of these bankruptcy mills are created.\n  It is expensive for the landlord to do this. He has to hire an \nattorney. Weeks go by. Maybe the lease was up. Maybe the mother wanted \nto turn the apartment over to her daughter to live in and the lease was \nup in January. She starts trying to get the person out, and come March \nor April or May or June, the person is still there. She has had to file \nfor eviction. Then they get a lawyer who stays it for all this kind of \ntime and really costs individuals a lot of money. There are 7, 8, 9 \nmonths without rent being paid and all the while the attorney's fees \nare adding up. This scenario is a real problem that this legislation \nfixes.\n  What about women and children? There have been suggestions that \nsomehow women and children are disadvantaged under this legislation. \nNothing could be further from the truth.\n  Priority payment: Under current Federal law, child support and \nalimony payments are seventh in the list of priority debts that must be \npaid off in a bankruptcy proceeding. Incidentally, what do you think is \nNo. 1? Attorney's fees. In this bankruptcy business and industry, who \nhas been roundly critical of this legislation and who has lobbied their \nbuddies around this Senate telling them this is such a bad piece of \nlegislation? Who is going to have to change their ways? The lawyers. \nThey don't get No. 1 priority over child support any longer, under this \nbill, and that makes them nervous.\n  What do I mean by No. 1? Often people who file bankruptcy do have \ncertain assets. Those assets are brought into the bankruptcy estate and \nadded up. Let's say there is $5,000 of assets and $50,000 worth of \ndebts. The bankruptcy judge starts paying off. Under the old law, the \ncurrent law today, if the bankruptcy attorney's fee is $5,000, he gets \nit all. He has to go down six different steps, paying off six different \ngroups of creditors, before he gets to child support and alimony. We \nsay, if there is $5,000 in the estate and there is child support money \nowed, the child support money gets paid first out of that, and alimony.\n  How anyone can say that that is unfair to women and children is \nbeyond me. It is beyond comprehension. Those who say that are not \nright. This is historic change to the benefit of women and children. \nNobody can dispute what I have just said about that. It is plain fact. \nLet me say some other things it does.\n  This legislation requires that a parent who is filing bankruptcy--\nlet's say a father, deadbeat dad, files for bankruptcy--must fulfill \npast due and current child support before he can get discharged from \nbankruptcy. The court is going to monitor him to make sure he is paying \nhis child support. If he is not paying his child support, the court \nwill not give the final discharge that wipes out his debts. He has to \ntake care of his children first.\n  It also will ensure that custodial parents, the parents who have the \ncustody of the children, get effective and timely assistance from child \nsupport agencies. It requires the bankruptcy trustee or administrator--\nthat is, this new law we are proposing and asking to be passed--to \nnotify both the parent and the State child support collection agency \nwhen the debtor owing child support or alimony files for bankruptcy. In \nother words, a mother may not know that her ex-husband or the father of \nher child who lives in a distant State is even filing bankruptcy. What \nthis says is, the mother has to be told; not only that, the State \ncollection agency which is helping mothers collect the money has to be \ntold so that they can intervene and make sure the child is protected.\n\n  It will provide timely and valuable information to parents to help \ncollect child support.\n  Jonathon Burris of the California Family Support Council, a group \nthat tries to protect mothers and children, wrote in an open letter to \nCongress that the provisions in this bill are ``a veritable wish list \nof provisions which substantially enhance our efforts to enforce \nsupport debts when a debtor has other creditors''--and they always have \nother creditors--``who are also seeking participation in the \ndistribution of the assets of a debtor's bankruptcy estate.''\n  Phillip Strauss of the District Attorney Family Support Bureau wrote \nthe Judiciary Committee. I was Attorney\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nGeneral of Alabama. I was involved in this. States have district \nattorneys associations. They can intervene on behalf of women and \nchildren to make sure child support is being paid and that the money is \nbeing collected. That is what he does full time.\n  He recently wrote the Judiciary Committee. This is a man whose \nbusiness full-time is collecting money for children. He wrote our \ncommittee to express his unqualified support for this bill.\n  Mr. Strauss notes that he has been in the business of collecting \nchild support for 27 years. He knows what he is talking about. He also \nnotes that the National Child Support Enforcement Association, a \nnational group of which he is a part, and the National District \nAttorneys Association and the Western Interstate Child Support \nEnforcement Council agree with him and support this legislation.\n  There has been this big talk about how this harms families. Let me \ndescribe an amendment I added that I think would be of tremendous \nbenefit.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One of the things I have learned is that within every \ncommunity in America there are agencies called credit counseling \nagencies. They sit down with families who have debt problems. They sit \naround a table. They even get the children in. They talk about what the \nincome is, how much the debts are, how much current living expenses \nare. They help them establish a budget.\n  Some of them will even receive the money and pay the current debts \nregularly. They call up the banks and credit card companies and other \npeople and ask for modifications of the payment schedule, a reduction \nin interest rates, and that sort of thing. They are very successful. \nThey help families get mental health counseling if that is needed. They \nhelp families get treatment for gambling problems or drinking problems \nor drug problems. They help families--not like these mills, these \nbankruptcy mills, where people respond to an ad, a lawyer says they \nneed so much money, and they say: I don't have this much money. The \nlawyer says to them--I am not exaggerating here--Use your credit card. \nPut all your bills on the credit card. Bring me your paycheck and pay \nme my fee. Don't pay anything else. Then we will file bankruptcy, and \nwe will wipe out all those debts. So they get that.\n  They have a little clerk or a secretary or a paralegal who fills out \nthe bankruptcy form. He doesn't see him again until they come to court. \nHe shows up. They present their petition, and eventually the debts are \nwiped out. And they don't know the names hardly of the people with whom \nthey are dealing. They have no concern or empathy to really deal with \nthe problems in that family. And we also know, from statistics, that \nthe largest cause of marital breakup in America is financial problems. \nWe need to do better about that.\n\n  So I offered an amendment that has been accepted, and everybody seems \nto be pleased with it--except some of the lawyers--and that is to say \nthat every person, before filing bankruptcy ought to talk with a credit \ncounseling agency to see if what they offer might be better than going \nthrough bankruptcy--no obligation, just talk to them.\n  I think a lot of people are going to find that they have other \nchoices than just going to bankruptcy court. Some people need \nbankruptcy. We are not trying to stop bankruptcy. Some people need it \nto start over again--but not everybody. A lot of people can work their \nway through it with the help of a good credit counseling agency. I \nthink this is a tremendous step forward. I am very excited about it, \nand I believe it will offer a lot of help to people struggling with \ntheir budgets today.\n  Now we have had a most curious development. We have had Senators for \nthe last 2 years come down on this floor and go forward with the most \nvigorous attacks on credit card companies. Do you know what it is they \nsay they do wrong? They say they write people letters and offer them \ncredit cards. They say this is some sort of an abuse, some sort of \npreying on the poor, to offer people credit cards.\n  I am telling you, we have laws that this Congress has passed--banking \nlaws and other rules--that say you can't deny credit to poor people \nunless you have a serious, objective reason to do so. Why in the world \nwould we want to pass a law that would keep MasterCard, Visa, or \nAmerican Express from writing somebody and saying: If you take my \ncredit card, your interest rate will be such and such, and you can have \n6 months at 3 percent interest--or whatever they offer--and if you want \nto change from the one you have, we have a better deal?\n  What is wrong with that? We often have competition. Interest rates, \nin my opinion, for credit cards are too high. I am too frugal to have \nmuch money run up on my credit card if I can avoid it. I don't like \npaying 18 or 20 percent interest. What is wrong with offering people an \nopportunity to choose a different credit card? If these companies were \nrefusing poor people and would not send them notices of the \nopportunities to sign up, I suppose we would be beating them up and \nsaying they are unfair to poor people or they are redlining them and \ncutting them off. I wanted to say that. To me, that is sort of bizarre.\n  Second, this is a bankruptcy court reform bill. We are here to deal \nwith the process of what happens when a person files for bankruptcy. We \nare not here to reform banking laws and credit card laws that are \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. That committee \nconsiders that. It is really not a bankruptcy court problem, \nfundamentally.\n  But what have we done in order to get support for this bill and \nanswer questions? We made a number of consumer-friendly amendments in \nthis bill to satisfy those who have complained. Of course, as soon as \nyou give them something, they are not happy, and they say you are \ndefending the evil credit card companies; that is all you are doing, \nthey say.\n  I am trying to create a rational way for people who can't pay their \ndebts to go to court and wipe out their debts, but not rip off people \nwhom they can pay because they have the money to pay. So we have a \nminimal credit warning, a toll-free number so debtors can find out \ninformation about their records. That will be required of credit card \ncompanies.\n  There are a lot of good things here that are not in current law. So \nto not pass this bill will eliminate the steps we have made to put more \nlimits and controls on credit card companies. Without a doubt, that is \ntrue. They might like to have a whole rewrite of credit card law in the \nbankruptcy bill, but that would be inappropriate. I think we have made \nsteps in the right direction and we should continue in that direction.\n\n  As Senator Grassley noted, there are terrific benefits for farmers \nunder chapter 12. Chapter 12 provisions give additional benefits to \nfarmers who file bankruptcy, and it expires this year. By not passing \nthis bill, we are going to throw away the added protections that \nfarmers have. How is that helping poor people and consumers? How does \nit help those who are having trouble with credit cards to vote down a \nbill that provides more demands on credit cards?\n  These are just a few ways, Mr. President, that this legislation \nimproves current bankruptcy law. If time permitted, there are many more \nimprovements that I would like to share with the members of this body.\n  In conclusion, I would just like to say that this bill includes many \nprotections for women and children. It provides a long-overdue \nhomestead fix, credit counseling, help for the family farmer and many \nother worthy provisions. A vote for this bill is a vote for much-needed \nchange in the bankruptcy law in this country. As such, I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/31/senate-section/article/S11442-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
