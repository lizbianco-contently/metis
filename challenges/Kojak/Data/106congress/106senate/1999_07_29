The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. I \nraise a point of order that the Abraham amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the Budget Act for \nconsideration of the Abraham amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S9652]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes of debate.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a letter dated April 21, 1999, on a \nsimilar provision, then-Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin wrote to \nSenator Moynihan that this ``provision could preclude the United States \nfrom meeting its financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to \nmake benefit payments--including Social Security checks--also worsen a \nfuture economic downturn.''\n  The lockbox in this proposal is potentially destabilizing in a manner \nreminiscent of the constitutional amendment to require a balanced \nbudget.\n  I remind those who propose rigid 10-year schedules for reducing the \npublicly held debt that economics does not follow the agricultural \ncycle. There will be periods when surpluses, both on and off budget, \nwill fall far short of projections. We should not impose a debt \nreduction schedule, enforced by a declining debt cycle ceiling, even if \nit can be overridden with 60 votes. To do so will risk default every \ntime the debt ceiling is lowered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, first of all, we have endeavored to and \nhave modified our amendment to try to address some of these concerns. I \nthink we have done so. I believe we have given sufficient flexibility \nso that there will not be the concerns that were raised in that letter.\n  This lockbox does not need a lot of debate. Americans have been \nhearing us talk about it now for almost 3 months. We will continue to \ntry to get a straight up-down vote on this. I would note that once \nagain this morning another procedural roadblock has been put in place \nto prevent us from getting a straight up-or-down vote. I regret that. I \nwas prepared to come today and offer both sides the opportunity to have \nstraightforward votes. If one side or the other in their various \nlockbox proposals got 50-plus votes, they would win and we could give \nthe American people what I believe they want, and that is protection \nfor their Social Security dollars sent to Washington. But again, once \nmore, what we have had is a procedural impediment placed in the way of \ngetting final action on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who have previously supported \nthis lockbox to do so. It is a tougher lockbox that protects Social \nSecurity. If we want to do it, I say vote ``yes.'' Vote to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 227 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

The point of order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \nvotes in this series be limited to 10 minutes in length, and I ask that \nall the Members of the Senate stay on the floor. We have a full and \nbusy day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Peter \nMcDougall of my staff be given floor privileges throughout the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Baucus motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand each side has 1 minute of \nexplanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a very simple matter before the \nSenate. It is a choice: Do we want to protect Medicare or not. It is \nthat simple. That is the choice that we are presented with today.\n  The amendment I am offering is the House lockbox which passed the \nHouse by an overwhelming margin--it only had three or four votes \nagainst it--along with the Medicare lockbox. The Medicare lockbox we \nprovide sets aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. It \ncan be used in whatever way we want to use it for Medicare, including \nto provide an affordable prescription drug benefit or for shoring up \nMedicare solvency.\n  That is the choice before the Senate. Do we preserve Medicare or not. \nOur choice here today, however, is nothing compared to another choice. \nThat is the choice that about 16 million seniors must make every day: \nDo I choose to buy my medicine, choose to pay the rent, or choose to \nbuy food?\n  We are saying set aside and preserve for Medicare one-third of the \non-budget surplus so that the choices facing seniors are not quite as \nabhorrent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is another opportunity on the part \nof the other side to propose to the American people that they want \nanything but tax relief. This is a motion to recommit. It would do \nnothing to protect Medicare. It is the President's proposal, which is a \nphony transfer of IOUs to the Medicare trust fund. It does nothing to \nhelp senior citizens. It is just an effort to lock up $300 billion so \nyou can't give the American people a tax cut, plain and simple. They \ndon't want to confront the issue of a lockbox for Social Security so \nthey muddle it up and instead of trying to solve something, they would \nlike to create an issue instead of a solution.\n\n  Frankly, there are hardly any experts in America who look at this \nlockbox concept for Medicare and say it helps the seniors or it helps \nMedicare. If this is the plan the President is alluding to across this \nland, then he has none.\n  I believe, since the other side did not let us have a vote, we ought \nto do ours procedurally also, and I am compelled to do that.\n  Therefore: The language in this amendment is not germane to the bill \nbefore us, so I raise a point of order under section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, \nI move to waive the applicable sections of that act for the \nconsideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all amendments \nand motions to recommit to S. 1429 must be filed by 2 p.m. today at the \ndesk and with the bill managers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, what time was that?\n  Mr. ROTH. Two p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1401\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think we are ready for the vote on the \nnext amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment simply delays the effective \ndate of the tax cut that is proposed. There are many who believe that a \ntax cut of this magnitude at this time would be ludicrous. But that is \nnot the issue. The issue is whether or not we ought to go ahead with a \ntax cut notwithstanding the fact that we have not protected Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Most of the people who have spoken so far have talked about their \nconcern for doing just that. The lockbox provisions were proposing to \ndo just that.\n  If you want to save Social Security and Medicare, this is an \nincentive. It will delay the implementation of the act, but it will not \nnegate the effectiveness of the act.\n  I ask that our colleagues vote to support this particular amendment, \nsave the one-half of 1 percent of the total which would be expended \nthis year, and not lock in cuts that would cost $792 billion, which \nwould be almost impossible to reverse should that prove to be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, no one in this chamber thinks other than \nthat we want a real, sound, solid, and solvent Social Security system \nand Medicare system. Most of us, however, realize we will only have \nthat if we have fundamental reforms in those systems, such as that \nproposed by the Medicare commission at which the President scoffed.\n  This amendment will serve to actually make Social Security and \nMedicare less sound. It will actually delay the process of real reform. \nThe solvency dates that are used in this legislation are taken from the \nPresident's proposal and will invariably result in pouring more and \nmore general revenues into these entitlement programs, delaying the day \nwhen we have to face up to the fact that we have to have fundamental \nreform.\n  Our bill sets aside 75 percent of the surplus for Medicare, Social \nSecurity, debt retirement, and other spending priorities. With regard \nto the 25 percent remaining, there is no reason to delay tax cuts.\n  If we saved every penny of the surplus, put it into Medicare and \nSocial Security, it would not do one thing toward solving the \nfundamental problem.\n  This language is not germane to the bill now before us; therefore, I \nraise a point of order, under section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nTexas is recognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9654]]\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have the highest admiration for the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. I am supportive of the tax cut he \nhas crafted in committee. I intend to vote for it on final passage if \nthis amendment fails.\n  But I believe we need a clearer vision. I believe we need to define \nvery precisely what we would like to use this tax cut to do, rather \nthan running around trying to stick a nickel in everybody's pocket with \na targeted program.\n  I would prefer to have a tax cut that has clear themes and this is a \nvery simple substitute because it consists of simply five things. So \nthis is a tax cut that you can explain to every American, and it \ncontains basic principles that I believe every American can understand \nand support.\n  The first principle is we ought to have an across-the-board tax cut \nof 10 percent. Now, I know our Democrat colleagues are going to jump up \nand down and say, first of all, that 32 percent of American families \npay no income taxes, and so if you have an across-the-board tax cut, \nthey will not get a tax cut. And that is right. Tax cuts are for \ntaxpayers. If you don't pay taxes and we have a tax cut, you don't get \na tax cut. Most Americans don't get food stamps; most Americans don't \nget TANF; most Americans don't get Medicaid because they don't qualify \nfor those programs. If you don't pay taxes, you don't qualify for a tax \ncut.\n  Our Democrat colleagues are obviously going to jump up and down and \nsay that Senator Rockefeller, who pays 10 times as much taxes as I do, \nwith a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut, will get 10 times as big a \ntax cut. That is right, but he pays 10 times as much taxes. If you ask \npeople in your church to take up money to build a new parsonage and it \nturned out you had taken up too much money, and you decided to give it \nback, isn't the logical way to give it back to simply take how much an \nindividual gave and take the amount that you didn't need and give it \nback to them proportionately?\n  So the point is, the first principle we believe in is there ought to \nbe an across-the-board tax cut, so every American who pays income taxes \nwill get a tax cut. Now, our Democratic colleagues have said they \nbelieve if you are rich, which means you are in the upper half of the \nincome distribution--and they design that as roughly making somewhere \naround $50,000--you don't deserve a tax cut. In their proposal, you \nbasically don't get one. I want to remind my colleagues that by \nexcluding people who pay 99 percent of the income taxes in America, \nthey are excluding from a tax cut 62 percent of all homeowners, 66 \npercent of all Americans between the ages of 45 and 64, 67 percent of \nall families who have children in their homes, 67 percent of all full-\ntime workers, 68 percent of all Americans who have some college \neducation, 69 percent of all married couples, and 80 percent of all \ntwo-wage earner families in America.\n  Our Democrat colleagues love investment, but they hate investors. \nThey love the benefits of capitalism, but they hate capitalists. An \nacross-the-board tax cut gives everybody a tax cut, and if people pay a \nlot of taxes, they get a bigger tax cut--not proportionately, but they \nget the same tax cut. If that offends you, if you believe that somehow \npeople who make over $50,000 a year are the enemies of the people and \nthey ought to continue to be punished, you would want to be against \nthis provision.\n  The next thing this provision does is it eliminates the marriage \npenalty. Most Americans are not aware of that because our Tax Code is \nso perverted, if two young people, both of whom work, fall in love and \nget married, they, on average, pay the Federal Government $1,400 a year \nin taxes for the right to be married. My wife is worth $1,400, but the \npoint is, she ought to get the money, not the Government. We eliminate \nthe marriage penalty.\n  Secondly, we have income splitting. Now, I know some of our Democrat \ncolleagues are going to get up and say, well, look, if the husband \nearns all the money and the wife stays at home and raises the children, \nthey ought not to get the correction for the marriage penalty. Well, we \ndo income splitting. We have decided we don't want to inject the Tax \nCode in the decision about whether people work outside the home or not. \nMy mama worked every day that I was a child, and she did it because she \nhad to do it. My wife has worked every day that our children have been \nalive because she wanted to do it. I am not trying to distort the \ndecision one way or another, or make a judgment. All I am saying is \nthat people who stay at home and raise their children contribute to \nAmerica. They make a big contribution. By allowing a couple, where only \none of them works outside the home, to split their income and attribute \nhalf to each one of them--that is what the partnership of marriage is \nabout--we are able to give them a substantial reduction in the penalty \nthey pay for being married.\n\n  The next provision is, we repeal the death tax, which is a certain \nkind of death penalty. I like the death penalty where we put murderers \nto death. I don't like the death penalty when working people die and we \nend up forcing their children to sell their business or their farm. All \nover America, people work a lifetime to build up a business or a farm, \nand then when they die, their children have to sell that business or \nsell that farm to give Government 55 cents out of every dollar they \nearned in a death tax. This provision repeals the death tax.\n  Now, I know that our Democrat colleagues are going to get up and say, \nwell, these are rich people. But I want to give you an example. When I \nfirst met a printer from Mexia named Dicky Flatt, I met him about 25 \nyears ago. He was in business with his daddy, who worked on these old \ncalculator machines that businesses use. His mama kept all the books, \nhis wife basically was working in their stationery shop, and Dicky \nFlatt did the printing business. They had an old building in Mexia, and \nit was cracking right down the middle. They kept putting sand in the \nbottom and kept tar-papering over the top. They had one bathroom, and \nit didn't have a door on it; it had a curtain on it. So when you went \nin to use the bathroom, you pulled the curtain.\n  Now, they worked hard in that business. So now Dicky Flatt has torn \ndown that building. He has built a Morton building, a metal building, \nand he has a good size print shop and stationery shop. He sent his two \nsons to Texas A They have come back and have gone into business with \nhim. He works every day. He gets in at 6 and leaves about 8. He is \nthere on Saturday until 6 o'clock. Whether you see him at the PTA, Boy \nScouts, or the Presbyterian Church, try as he may, he never gets that \nblue ink off the ends of his fingers.\n  Now, Dicky Flatt may be rich, for all I know. He doesn't live like a \nrich guy. When his brother died of cancer, he took over his school \nsupply business with his wife. My basic point is that Dicky Flatt and \nLinda, his wife, have worked 6 days a week their whole lives. They \nbuilt up this business. Every penny they put into it has been in after-\ntax dollars. How can it be right to force their two boys, who now work \nin that business, to sell that business when Dicky and his wife Linda \ndie in order to give the Government 55 percent of it, in order to take \nthe money from Dicky Flatt and give it to people who have been sitting \non their fannies in Mexia, not working on Saturday, and in some cases, \nnot working at all? I am sure we are going to hear that this is for \nrich people. I want to put a human face on it.\n  When we revolted against King George, he wasn't doing things such as \nthe death tax. This is an outrage. This is an assault on every value \nthis country stands for, and I want to repeal it and repeal it \noutright.\n  I want to index the capital gains tax.\n  That is the fourth provision of this bill.\n  I want to say that from this day forward, if you buy a house as an \ninvestment and the price doubles and you sell the house for twice as \nmuch as you paid for it, you haven't made any money, you simply kept up \nwith inflation. But under current tax law, you have to pay the Federal \nGovernment a capital gains tax on the doubling of your house's price \neven though that new price will buy only the amount of goods you could \nhave bought with the money for which you bought the house. So the next \nthing we do is index the capital gains tax for inflation.\n  Finally, we eliminate not the last outrage in the Tax Code but it is \na big\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\noutrage. If General Motors buys you health insurance, it is tax \ndeductible for them, but if you buy it for yourself, it is not tax \ndeductible. We eliminate that by saying that no matter who buys health \ninsurance in America, the employer or the employee, a retiree or a \nworker, a homemaker or someone who is employed in the economy, that \nhealth insurance is tax deductible.\n  It is a simple tax cut that you can put on one piece of paper. If you \npay taxes, you are going to get a 10-percent reduction in income taxes \nout of this bill. It is easy to figure. If you pay $1,000 in income \ntaxes, you are going to get $100. If you pay $10,000, you are going to \nget $1,000. If that breaks your heart, so be it. I think most people \nwill like it.\n  Second, we eliminate the marriage penalty and we allow income \nsplitting. If you have one parent who stays at home, you are able to \ndivide the income in half and have each of them claim half that income \nthat belongs to them. This is endorsed by every family group in America \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  We repeal the death tax outright over a 10-year period--no ifs, ands, \nor buts. If you live 10 more years, under this bill, and you build \nsomething with after-tax dollars, it belongs to your family forever.\n  That is simple arithmetic. I think we can all understand it.\n  We index the capital gains tax so that you never pay capital gains \ntax again on inflation. This is a big issue for every homeowner and for \nevery investor in America.\n  Finally, we provide full deductibility of health insurance. This is \nan equity issue. It is something that ought to be done.\n  This is a tax cut you can understand. It represents what I believe is \nthe vision of the party of which I am proud to be a member. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote for this substitute. I believe it represents a \ndramatic improvement and simplification in the Tax Code.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nCalifornia and then 10 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin, off the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware controls the time in \nopposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Delaware delegated that to the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair thanks the Senator for that \nclarification.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank Senator Baucus.\n  My colleague from Texas says the Democrats hate investors and the \nDemocrats hate capitalism. As a former stockbroker, I deeply resent his \nremarks. Maybe when the Senator from Texas was a Democrat he hated \ncapitalism and he hated investors, but the Democrats around here don't. \nOne of the reasons we are not supporting his amendment is that we think \nit is bad for capitalism and we think it is bad for investors.\n  I have to say that this amendment, which reflects what the House did, \nis a risky and radical amendment. It hurts the middle class. He says he \nloves the middle class. He talks about his momma and Dicky Flatt. And I \nlove to hear him do it. But the bottom line is, the result of his \namendment will hurt the very people he says he wants to help because it \nis such an unfair tax cut that would go to the very wealthiest and hurt \nthe middle class and the working poor.\n  I say to my friends who may be listening to this debate, the Senator \nfrom Texas is a great debater but he was wrong when he said the Clinton \nplan would lead to economic disaster and he is wrong today. I hope we \nwill vote down his amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer some comments on the reconciliation \ntax measure we are considering.\n  First, let me note that we have come a long way in the last seven \nyears.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we were facing an actual budget \ndeficit of $340 million.\n  That was the real figure--the figure that did not use the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund balances to mask the deficit.\n  Thanks in large part to the President's deficit reduction package in \n1993, and to a lesser extent the bipartisan budget cuts of 1997, we are \napproaching a truly balanced budget.\n  I emphasize `'approaching,'' Mr. President, for we are not there yet.\n  The budget projections of the Office of Management and Budget, and of \nthe Congressional Budget Office, are just that--projections.\n  We do not currently have a budget surplus, not without including the \nSocial Security Trust Fund balances.\n  Mr. President, I do not mean to minimize the wonderful budget \nturnabout that has been achieved.\n  But we should not be building massive new commitments on a shaky \nfoundation of questionable budget assumptions.\n  And that is just what we have.\n  The assumptions underlying the tax measure we will debate depend on \nCongress making cuts of $775 billion in real spending over the next ten \nyears compared to current levels.\n  Let me note that this level of cuts does not include any additional \ncuts that might have to be made in order to offset the cost of \nunanticipated emergencies.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President.\n  The $775 billion in real spending cuts over the next ten years does \nnot include the spending we do to help the victims of hurricanes, \nearthquakes, tornadoes, floods, or any kind of international emergency.\n  But, for the moment, let us suppose that there will be no hurricanes, \nor earthquakes, or tornadoes, or floods in the next ten years.\n  Let us suppose that there will be no international emergencies that \nrequire our assistance.\n  Will Congress find the political will to cut spending by three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars over the next ten years?\n  Mr. President, Congress has yet to demonstrate it can stay even \nwithin the current spending caps, let alone find an additional three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars in cuts.\n  Last fall, Congress passed an omnibus appropriations bill that busted \nthe current spending caps by more than $20 billion.\n  This past winter, even before we passed a budget resolution, the \nSenate passed another budget buster, S. 4, the military pay and \nretirement measure, which over the next ten years would add another $62 \nbillion in spending.\n  And just a few weeks ago, Congress busted the spending caps yet again \nwith $15 billion in additional spending.\n  Mr. President, this is not a record of fiscal discipline.\n  Nor is it the kind of record that should give anyone confidence that \nthe budget assumptions underlying this tax bill are sound ones.\n  Mr. President, the assumptions underlying this tax bill are grounded \nnot in fiscal reality but in political expediency.\n  But, let us assume that somehow, Congress was able to enact the \nthree-quarters of a trillion dollars in spending cuts.\n  And let us further assume, as we did earlier, that there will be no \nhurricanes, or floods, or earthquakes, or drought, or any other kind of \nnatural disaster for the next ten years.\n  And that there will be no more Bosnias or Kosovos or Iraqs--no \ninternational emergencies of any kind for the next ten years.\n  Even under all of these assumptions, would this tax proposal be a \nsound one?\n  The answer is no, because even if each and every one of those rosy \nscenarios comes true, this bill would use over $75 billion in Social \nSecurity balances to pay for the tax breaks.\n  Mr. President, I strongly oppose using Social Security to fund tax \ncuts; that is why I voted against the 1997 tax cut package.\n  We simply should not be using Social Security balances--balances \nneeded to pay future benefits--to fund other government programs, or to \npay for tax cuts.\n  Of course, some may argue that even more spending cuts will be found \nin order to avoid the use of Social Security balances--on the top of \nthe three-quarters of a trillion dollars in cuts assumed in this \nmeasure.\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\n  Mr. President, granting even this still rosier scenario, would this \ntax measure be fiscally responsible?\n  I regret that it would not, because not only does this tax bill risk \nour current budget, it puts future generations at risk as well.\n  Mr. President, while the revenue impact of any tax cut measure can be \nexpected to grow over time, the policies outlined in this measure \nexplode.\n  Consider that while in the next ten years, the cost of this proposal \nis an already whopping $800 billion--if those tax policies are \ncontinued, the cost in the second ten years will be a nearly \nunbelievable $2 trillion.\n  If you add the additional interest payments that will arise from debt \nservice, the total cost of the tax policies in this bill rise to over \n$3 trillion.\n  For those who may have forgotten, let me remind my colleagues that it \nis in that second ten years when the baby boomer generation begins to \nretire and put increased pressure on Social Security, Medicare, and the \nlong-term care services provided under Medicaid.\n  If ever there were a time to be prudent, now is the time.\n  As improved as the short-term budget picture is, the longer-term \nbudget picture is little changed.\n  We still face serious problems in Medicare, and as I noted, the baby \nboomer generation will put enormous pressure on that program, as well \nas on the long-term care services, many of which are provided through \nMedicaid.\n  There is also a consensus that we should address the long-term fiscal \nhealth of Social Security, and the sooner the better.\n  And finally, Mr. President, we still face a mountain of debt that was \nrun up during the 1980s and early 1990s because of the deficits that \nwere run up during that time.\n  In each of these areas, there is a stark choice: we can act now to \naddress each of these areas; or, we can ignore them, watch the problems \nget much worse, and leave the work and cost of reform to our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, for me, that's an easy choice.\n  I do not want my children footing the bill for the failure of past \ngenerations to act responsible.\n  I want to support a tax cut, but not one that jeopardizes the work we \nhave done to straighten out the current budget and squanders the \nopportunity to reduce our debt and put Social Security, Medicare, and \nour long-term care system on sound footing.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to look at the make-up of the tax \nmeasure itself.\n  One might expect that a tax cut of $800 billion would provide the \nsort of broad-based tax benefits that would be politically attractive.\n  But given the amount of revenue dedicated to this tax cut, the \nbenefits to the average taxpayer are surprisingly small, and the \noverall package is heavily skewed to some of the wealthiest individuals \nand corporations in the world.\n  As was noted by the tax watchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, the \ntax bill gives three-quarters of its benefits to the best-off fifth of \nall taxpayers.\n  By contrast, only 11 percent of the tax bill's benefits go to the \nbottom 60 percent of all taxpayers.\n  While the average tax reduction for the wealthiest 1 percent of \ntaxpayers--those with incomes over $300,000--is over $23,000 a year \nunder this bill, those with more average income do not do quite as \nwell.\n  The average tax cut for those who are among the middle fifth of \ntaxpayers will be $279, or about $5 per week.\n  For those in the bottom three-fifths of all taxpayers, the average \ntax cut is even smaller--about $140 per year, or less than $3 per week.\n  Mr. President, under this $800 billion tax bill, the majority of \ntaxpayers will have an average tax cut of $3 per week.\n  Maybe the proponents of this bill are hoping most of America will use \nthis windfall to buy one of those overpriced cups of coffee.\n  Well, Mr. President, thanks to this tax bill, once a week, three-\nfifths of America will now be able to go to one of those fancy coffee \nshops and get a frothy decaf cappuccino latte with skim milk.\n  This tax bill is a bad tax policy any way you brew it.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that some may genuinely believe we should \ndedicate about $800 billion to tax cuts over the next ten years.\n  The tragedy is that even in that context, the $800 billion was spent \nunwisely, because in addition to Social Security, Medicare, long-term \ncare, and reducing our national debt, one of our highest priorities \nshould be significant reform of our tax code.\n  It was just a few months ago that we heard how critical fundamental \ntax reform was to our future.\n  Flat tax, consumption tax, a national value-added tax--there were a \nnumber of significant proposals that sought to address the inefficiency \nof our current Tax Code.\n  Simplification was the order of the day, and let me add, Mr. \nPresident, that while I did not support many of those proposals, I \nthink many of the proponents of reform got it exactly right.\n  Our Tax Code should be simplified.\n  We should reduce the number of special interest tax breaks and use \nthat savings to lower the tax rates for everyone.\n  I participated in just that kind of exercise at the State level as \nchair of the Taxation Committee in the Wisconsin State Senate.\n  As we all know, there will be winners and losers in a reform of our \ntax code, and I can tell you from direct experience that the best time \nto enact tax reforms is when you have additional resources to help \nincrease the number of winners and decrease the number of losers.\n  Mr. President, this tax bill and the House version both squandered \nthat opportunity as well.\n  We might have had a significant start on real tax reform.\n  Instead, we got a grab bag of goodies for special interests added to \na tax code already thick with complexity.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post listed a number of the \nspecial interest tax breaks in this bill and the House version.\n  They include tax breaks for: multinational corporations, utility \ncompanies, railroad, oil and gas operators, timber companies, the steel \nindustry, seaplane owners in Alaska, sawmills in Maine, barge lines in \nMississippi, Eskimo whaling captains, and Carolina woodlot owners.\n  This bill is a dream come true for business lobbyists.\n  The Post reported one lobbyist as saying, ``If you're a business \nlobbyist and couldn't get into this legislation, you better turn in \nyour six-shooter.''\n  Mr. President, in the name of complete disclosure, let me note that I \nunderstand the Democratic alternative, which I may support, suffers \nfrom the same problem, though to a much lesser extent.\n  And it will come as no surprise to my colleagues that I firmly \nbelieve this kind of pandering to special interests is a direct result \nof our campaign finance system.\n  There's ample evidence to that effect right here in this bill.\n  The campaign finance system gives wealthy interest an open invitation \nto influence legislation in this body, and in this bill it's clear that \nspecial interests accepted that invitation in droves, Mr. President.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues and the public, I'd like to share \njust a few examples of what these interests gave in PAC and soft money, \nand what they got in either this bill, the House tax measure, or both.\n  I do this from time to time; it is known as ``The Calling of the \nBankroll.''\n  According to the Washington Post, an umbrella organization called the \nCoalition of Service Industries, a coalition of banks and securities \nfirms, won a provision to extend for five years a temporary tax \ndeferral on income those industries earn abroad. The value of this tax \ndeferral: $5 billion over ten years.\n  So we know what Congress has given the Coalition of Service \nIndustries, but what has the Coalition of Service Industries given to \ncandidates and the political parties? During the 1997-1998 election \ncycle, coalition members gave the following:\n  Ernst & Young--more than half a million dollars in soft money, and \nnearly $900,000 in PAC money.\n  CIGNA Corporation--more than $335,000 in soft money, and more than \n$210,000 in PAC money.\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\n  American Express--more than $275,000 in soft money and nearly \n$175,000 in PAC money.\n  Deloitte and Touche--more than $225,000 in soft money and more than \n$710,000 in PAC money.\n  Of course, as I said Mr. President, this is just a sampling of what \nCoalition of Service Industries members have given. I'd be up here a \nlot longer if I had a document all the millions of dollars these groups \nhave given.\n  But it doesn't stop there. These two tax bills mean Christmas in July \nfor special interests, Mr. President, with gifts for jut about every \nindustry in Santa's bag.\n  The post reports the utility industry got a provision affecting \nutility mergers in the House measure, which, if it survives, is worth \nmore than $1 billion to the utility industry. The provision would \nexcuse the payment of taxes on the fund that utilities set up to cover \nthe costs of shutting down nuclear power plants.\n  Utilities companies that operate nuclear power plans would be \nparticularly grateful to see this provision passed, Mr. President.\n  Their depth of their gratitude would be matched only by the size of \ntheir campaign contributions during the last election cycle, including:\n  Entergy Corporation, which gave $228,000 in soft money and nearly \n$250,000 in PAC money;\n  Commonwealth Edison, which gave $110,000 in soft money and more than \n$106,000 in PAC money;\n  And Florida Power and Light, which gave nearly $300,000 in soft money \nand more than $182,000 in PAC money.\n  As it does so many other issues, our campaign finance system is \npreventing real reform to our tax code, and those who doubt that only \nneed to look at this bill.\n  Mr. President, the best thing we can say about this tax bill is that \nit will not be enacted into law.\n  The President will almost surely veto it, and he will be right in \ndoing so.\n  This bill is fiscally irresponsible.\n  It depends on budget suppositions that are at best fanciful.\n  It uses Social Security balances to pay for tax cuts.\n  It proposes a tax policy that no only jeopardizes our current budget \nbut our future fiscal health.\n  It sticks our children and grandchildren with the cost of paying-off \nthe debt run up over the past two decades, and leaves them the task of \nextending the solvency of Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and \nreforming our long-term care system.\n  And it hands our special interest tax breaks galore while providing \nlittle tax relief to the vast majority of taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this bill, and urge my colleagues \nto do so as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to my good friend from \nDelaware, Senator Roth.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, Senator Gramm has provided Members with a \nstraightforward alternative to the bipartisan Finance Committee bill. I \ncompliment him on the clarity of his approach, much of which I favor. \nAlthough provisions of Senator Gramm's substitute have appeal for me, \nfrankly, I could not have used it as a basis for the Finance Committee. \nHis proposal contains elements that would not garner a majority of \ncommittee members.\n  In addition, Senator Gramm's substitute, though popular with many in \nthe Senate Republican caucus, would not pick up support on the other \nside of the aisle. For that reason, his proposal would not be a \nblueprint for tax cuts, in the form of a signable bill, that we can \ndeliver to the American people now.\n  Finally, although Senator Gramm's amendment is simpler, it leaves out \nmany bipartisan tax measures that address important tax issues. For \ninstance, education savings incentives are deleted. This means parents \nwho want to save for a child's college education would be left out of \nthe picture. We're talking about millions of parents and students in \nevery state.\n  Yet another example is the student loan interest deduction. Under the \nFinance Committee bill, at least three million graduates, bearing the \nburden of college debt, would be allowed to deduct student loan \ninterest on their tax returns.\n  In my legislation I try to focus on matters of need to the American \nfamily. I provide incentives to promote savings, pensions, IRAs. Many \nin retirement depend not only on Social Security, which we will \naddress, but also on personal savings and pensions. My bill addresses \nthat. There is nothing to correct the problems of AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax. Unfortunately, thousands upon thousands of American \nfamilies will be hit by AMT and not enjoy the full benefit of many \nprograms such as the child tax credit.\n  Finally, nothing is done with respect to charitable giving. We have \nproposals that will promote and create incentives.\n  For these and other reasons, I must oppose Senator Gramm's well-\nintentioned amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The Finance Committee has already rejected this provision. The \nFinance Committee deliberated this amendment in committee, and, by a \nlarge margin turned it down because it is excessive. It is \nirresponsible, in my judgment. It is not the right thing to do. It says \nwe are going to take the entire on-budget surplus. And because of the \ntax cut plus the lost interest on the debt, there is nothing left for \nMedicare, discretionary spending or any other programs which will be \ncut anyway by a very large margin.\n  It is excessive, too, compared to the bill passed by the committee \nbecause it is so backloaded. It is so top heavy. By that, I mean the \nbulk of the cost of the provisions are at the very end--6, 7, or 8 \nyears from now. No one can predict the future of this country and what \nposition we will be in 6 to 8 years from now.\n  I was speaking to the CEO of a major American company a few days ago, \na man we all know, a company we all know very well. He told me they \ncan't begin to plan for the future. They do have 5-year plans but they \nknow the 5-year plans are not going to be accurate. So they have to \njust do the best they can on virtually a quarterly basis. They have to \ngo ahead in the areas they think are the areas of the future, but it is \nalmost impossible to plan in this modern era.\n\n  So I say, if we today were to lock in provisions in the law which \nwill hemorrhage this country's budget surplus based upon ephemeral, \ndistant projections which are never accurate, that is not responsible. \nThat is not the right thing to do. And that is what this amendment \ndoes. That is why basically, fundamentally, without going into all the \ndetails of it, why this does not make sense. It has often been stated \nduring this debate that the time when the baby boomers begin to retire \nis when these things really start to kick in and the costs explode.\n  I think prudence is the watchword here today. History sometimes is a \nguide. Look at the 1980s. What happened in the 1980s? There was a huge \ntax cut. Congress succumbed to the siren song of supply side economics. \nWhat was supply side economics supposed to do? It was supposed to make \ndeep tax cuts, spend more on defense, and guess what, folks, that is \ngoing to cause the budget to be balanced. That was what supply side \neconomics was supposed to do--advocated, by the proponents of this \namendment. It was going to balance the budget.\n  The theory is the trickle down theory: Cut the taxes of the most \nwealthy, they invest a lot more, it trickles down and the economy \nstarts humming and it balances the budget. That was the Laffer curve. \nGuess what, it did not work. We kind of knew it was not going to work, \nbut it was such a temptation, such a siren song to vote these huge tax \ncuts, hoping, hoping, hoping that what the proponents said would come \ntrue. Guess what, it did not. It did not come true at all.\n  The tax cut was passed in 1981. Then what happened in 1982? This \nCongress, a Republican Congress, and President Reagan, had to change \ncourse. They had to raise taxes. The Republican Congress and Republican \nPresident raised taxes in 1982. Then guess what. This tax increase was \nnot enough because the deficits were just so large. The Republican \nCongress and Republican President had to raise taxes again in 1984. \nThey had to raise taxes more because the deficit was so large. The \nnational debt in 1980 was roughly about\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\n$1 trillion; 8 years later it was roughly $3 trillion, maybe close to \n$4 trillion. It tripled and quadrupled during that time of the huge tax \ncuts. Then we had to add more taxes back again in 1982 and 1984.\n  So, in many ways this is history repeating itself. Democrats in the \nSenate support a tax cut. We support using a third of the on-budget \nsurplus to pay for a tax cut. But we are just saying don't use all of \nthe on-budget surplus for tax cuts with virtually all going to the most \nwealthy Americans.\n  Do you know what else is going on here? I do believe the proponents \nof this bill are so--not distrustful, but so opposed to Government that \nthey want these huge tax cuts partly to force down deeper cuts, way \nbelow the baseline in spending. I think they want to cut veterans' \nbenefits 30 percent; they want to cut health education 20, 30 percent; \nwant to cut these programs. I think there are really many on that side \nwho want to make these cuts. They want to. As strange as that might \nsound, they want to. That is another reason for this huge tax cut \nbecause it will force cuts in spending later on.\n  We have already cut spending. Discretionary spending has been cut so \nmuch by this body over the last 10 years it is unbelievable. And the \nsize of government has gone down, with many fewer federal employees \nthan there were years ago.\n  To sum it all up, we have seen this provision in the Finance \nCommittee. The Finance Committee soundly rejected this amendment. I \nurge the Senate to also soundly reject this amendment. It is not good \npolicy.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think Senator Gramm is bringing a very \nimportant principle to the table, one that we need to address: If we \nare going to have a tax cut, what kind of tax cut should we have? What \nis best for the economy, and what is fair?\n  There was a consensus in this country, 10, 15 years ago, that we \nneeded to have a tax policy based upon a broader base and lower rates. \nThat is essentially the tax bill that came out in 1986. We came down to \ntwo tax rates. We had a 15-percent and a 28-percent tax rate. There was \na broader base, where more people were paying taxes, but lower rates.\n  In the 1990s, we have gotten away from that. We have gotten away from \nthat principle and gone, instead, toward what has been referred to as \ntargeted tax cuts. That its basically the Government--we, the \nPresident--that decide, on an individual basis, who deserves the tax \nbreak or tax cut in any particular year. Usually it is based upon how \nmuch clout they have, or some notions of fairness of a particular \ncongressional makeup at some particular time. So now we have wound up \nwith higher rates and a narrower base. We now have five income tax \nrates instead of the two we had back in 1986 in addition to phaseouts. \nThe Tax Code, not only do we have additional rates, it has become more \nprogressive, even in addition to those rates.\n  I do not think a lot of people are aware of this. I think most \nAmericans think initially, basically, they can look at tax rates and \nsee what their tax burden is. But then you look at all the phaseouts \nthat we have. Congress has decided in its wisdom that people of a \ncertain income level do not deserve some of the deductions, exemptions, \nand benefits that others deserve. So we have a personal exemption \nphaseout.\n  We have an itemized deduction phaseout at basically the $124,000 \nlevel for individuals. I am talking about individuals and not couples, \nin terms of the dollar amounts I am using. The personal exemption \nphaseout; itemized deduction phaseout, limitation of only being able to \ndeduct that amount over 2 percent of itemized deductions; a 7.5 percent \nfloor on medical deductions; a 10 percent adjusted gross income floor \non casualty deductions; a $500 child credit that phases out at an \nincome level of $75,000; a dependent child credit that begins to be \nphased out at an income level of $10,000--if you make that much it \nbegins to be phased out; a deductible IRA, $30,000; an education IRA, \n$95,000; the HOPE credit, college credit, begins to be phased out at \n$40,000 for an individual. So we want to help you go to college, we \nwant to help your kids go to college--as long as you do not have a job, \nbasically is what that amounts to.\n  We have a life-time learning credit of $40,000; student loan interest \ndeductions, at $40,000 it begins to be phased out; education savings \nbond interest--if you make $52,000 you begin to lose that; elderly/\ndisabled credit, $7,500; adoption credit/exclusion, $75,000; DC first \ntime homebuyer--if you make $75,000, you begin to have that phased out \nas a taxpaying individual; rental real estate losses; rehabilitation \ntax credit--on and on and on.\n  In addition to continuing to raise the tax rate--the highest one in \n1986 was 28 percent and now it is up to 39.6 percent plus the maximum--\nplus the limited itemized deductions and phaseout of personal \nexemptions, you wind up with an effective rate of over 40 percent. When \nyou remove the cap on Medicare tax, plus these phaseouts, you are \nlooking at, in some cases, close to an effective 45-percent tax rate, \nsomething like that.\n  My only point is that, as we decide how to go forward, we need to \nunderstand that we have a progressive system as far as our income Tax \nCode is concerned, and that is the way it ought to be. A lot of people \nbelieve it is that way. But every time we have a tax cut, we cannot say \nlet's give everybody the same dollar amount back in taxes regardless of \nhow much they paid in because we have a very progressive system.\n\n  We have progressive tax rates up to 39.6 percent, with phaseouts so \nthat if you are making any money, if people are working hard and making \na pretty good living, they begin to lose the deductions and credits. \nThat makes it even more progressive.\n  We come along and say we are going to give a tax cut now, and we say \nif the other guy is paying twice as much in taxes as I am, give him a \ntax cut. He lost all these exemptions because he is making good money. \nHe is paying twice as much in taxes. But we come along with a tax cut \nand we say they are going to both get the same amount back? I do not \nthink that makes much sense.\n  Let's say the economy was good and we were able to have successive \ntax cuts over a period of time and we gave the same dollar amount back \nto everybody regardless of how much they were paying in taxes. We would \nhave a narrower and narrower base all the time and fewer and fewer \npeople paying any taxes at all. We would continually be taking people \noff the tax rolls. We already have 43 million people who do not pay \ntaxes.\n  As progressive as our Tax Code is, as does the Senator from Texas, I \nmake no apologies for the proposition that when it comes time for a tax \ncut, let's base the tax cut on how much people are paying in.\n  We have to ask ourselves a fundamental question: Are we interested in \npunishing folks who make a good living or are we interested in \ncollecting money for the Federal Government to pay legitimate \nGovernment expenses? History shows every time we have had a reduction \nin tax rates, we have more money. Every time the Government reduces \nrates in any appreciable amount, the Government winds up getting more \nmoney.\n  In the 1920s, it was true. In the 1960s, under President Kennedy, who \nsaid a rising tide lifts all boats, it was true. In the much maligned \n1980s, which laid the groundwork for the greatest economic prosperity \nthis world has ever known, it was true.\n  Increased revenues in the twenties was 61 percent over a 7-year \nperiod. In the sixties, a revenue increase after inflation was about 33 \npercent. In the eighties, after cutting the tax rates, revenues \nincreased 28 percent because it reduced the incentive to hide income, \nto shelter income, and to underreport income.\n  Similarly, the share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose \ndramatically as the rates fell. By cutting rates, we get more money out \nof the rich.\n  Do we want to be concerned about how much somebody is making and try \nto hold that down or do we want the money for the Federal Government? I \nthought the idea was to have a fair Tax\n\n[[Page S9659]]\n\nCode but to raise the money for the legitimate expenses of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In the 1920s, they called rich $50,000. I guess things have not \nchanged that much. But in 1921, the rich paid 44 percent of the income \ntax. In 1928, after the rate cut, they paid 78 percent of all taxes. \nThe gap was not quite as pronounced later on, but in 1963 under \nPresident Kennedy, at the time of the cut, the rich were paying 11.6 \npercent of all the taxes being paid. In 1966, they were paying 15.1 \npercent. In the 1980s, we were talking about the top 10 percent----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I ask for another 3 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the Senator another 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. In the 1980s--1981--the rich were paying 48 percent of \nthe taxes. In 1988, they wound up paying 57 percent of the taxes. We do \nnot get a lot of credit taking up for the rich, but our responsibility \nas public servants is to look out for the country and have policies \nthat are going to get the most money and not try to be too concerned \nabout who is going to get this share of the economic pie: I am going to \nget yours; you are not going to get mine. Our concern should be with \nmaking that economic pie better.\n  As far as an across-the-board cut is concerned, every serious \nobserver nowadays thinks it is sound economic policy. Lawrence Lindsey, \nformer Federal Reserve Board member, George Shultz, former Secretary of \nState, and even the oft quoted Chairman Greenspan--there may be some \ndiscussion as to when he thinks a tax cut should come about, but he \nsays when it comes about, it ought to be an across-the-board rate \nreduction. This is sound economic policy.\n  I know the prospects for this particular amendment, but all of this \nbusiness about soak the rich and unfairness, we need to keep a little \nbalance and keep things in mind. If we want more money, if we want to \nbe fair--first of all, we have to recognize we have a very progressive \nsystem in this country, so when it comes time for a tax cut, let's pay \nsome attention to the idea of across the board and not have politicians \ndeciding the detailed targeted tax cuts for their favorite people, but \nmake it across the board. It is more fair, and it will get more money \nfor the Federal Treasury. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take off \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have attacked the Reagan tax \ncut. With that I strongly disagree.\n  I have no argument with those who want to bring up history in their \nattempt to argue against the need for this tax relief package. But I do \nhave an argument when they attempt to change facts and debunk what \nwas--and continues to be--a tremendous economic legacy.\n  First, let me make it clear that cutting taxes to keep the economy \nstrong did not begin with President Reagan--nor is the idea isolated to \none political party or the other.\n  In the 1960s, President Kennedy ushered America into economic \nexpansion with his own historic tax cuts.\n  In fact, in recalling our history it might help us to remember \nPresident Kennedy's statement to the Economic club of New York in \nDecember 1962. On that occasion, he said:\n\n       Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one \n     hand, and the avoidance of large federal deficits on the \n     other. It is increasingly clear that...an economy hampered by \n     restrictive tax rates will never product enough revenues to \n     balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs \n     or enough profits.\n\n  Second, the facts concerning President Reagan's economic record are \nvery clear: everyone benefited from the broad based 25 percent across-\nthe-board tax cuts signed into law by President Reagan. The facts show \nthat all income groups saw their incomes rise during the period of 1980 \nto 1989. The facts show that during that period, the mean average of \nreal income rose by 15.2 percent, compared to a 0.8 percent decline \nfrom 1970 to 1980.\n  And what of record-setting deficits? Did cutting taxes 25 percent \nacross the board deplete the Treasury revenues? Absolutely not. Again, \nthe records, the facts show that Federal revenues actually exploded. As \nAmericans grew in wealth, Treasury revenues grew. Between 1981 and \n1987, they grew 42 percent.\n  The deficits remind my debunking colleagues--were not created by \ncutting taxes and stimulating economic growth; they were the product of \na Congress that refused to hold the line on spending. While revenues \nincreased 42 percent, following those tax cuts, spending increased by \n50 percent.\n  And, my colleagues, that is unlikely to happen after this tax relief \npackage becomes law, as Congress is largely controlled by the same \nindividuals who--2 years ago--passed the first balanced budget in a \ngeneration.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the distinguished Senator from North Dakota 10 \nminutes off the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what a remarkable debate. At a time when \nso many Americans think so much in politics is fuzzy and they can't see \nmuch of a difference between the two parties, this is a bright-line \ntest. There is a radical difference in terms of what we stand for and \nwhat we fight for and what we have passion to change. I want to \ndescribe a little of that difference.\n  But first I want to go back to what some would call ``the good old \ndays.'' Let's go back to the year just before we passed, by one vote, \nthe bill that increased some taxes for a few people in this country, \ncut some taxes for others, cut some spending, and put this country back \non track with an economic plan that resulted in where we are today.\n  In 1993 I voted for that package. We did not get one vote from the \nother side of the aisle--not one. It passed by one vote in the House, \none vote in the Senate. We did not get one vote to help us from the \nother side of the aisle.\n  In fact, some on the other side of the aisle stood up and said: If \nyou pass this, this country is going into a depression. If you pass \nthis, it will ruin the American economy. It will throw people out of \nwork. It will injure this country. Well, we passed it anyway.\n  Do you remember those days? The Federal deficit then was $290 billion \nand growing. We had nearly 10 million Americans out of work, looking \nfor a job. The Dow Jones Industrial Average just barely reached 3,000. \nInflation was double what it was last year. There were 97,000 business \nfailures.\n  Then we passed a piece of legislation that put this country back on \ntrack--over the objections, I might add, of the folks who bring----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota--this is a question--\nindicated that the Democrats did not receive a single Republican vote \nin the 1993 budget; is that true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator also remember some of the statements of \ndoom made?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do, indeed.\n  Mr. REID. Do you remember this one made by the author of this \namendment:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit four years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower . . . when all is said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  Do you remember that statement?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course I remember that. There were predictions of \ndoom, saying, if you pass this, you are going to throw this country \ninto a tailspin.\n  This is a country that had a $290 billion deficit, an anemic economy, \nwith 10 million people out of work. This is a country that desperately \nneeded a change in direction. We made it without the help of one vote \nfrom the other side.\n  Frankly, I thought a couple of the folks you referenced were going to \ndo a half-gainer off the Capitol Dome, they were so upset about us \nchanging the fiscal policy of this country. But we did it.\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n  Guess what happened. Guess what happened. This country's economy has \nseen robust economic growth. Seven years later, we do not have a budget \ndeficit. No, we do not have a $290 billion, and growing, budget \ndeficit. We have a budget that is nearly in balance. Economists are \npredicting surpluses for the next 10 years--I might point out, the same \neconomists who predicted in the early 1990s we would have a full decade \nof sluggish, anemic growth in this country.\n  I mentioned yesterday these are the same economists who can't \nremember their home phone number or address telling us what will happen \n3, 5, and 10 years from now. We ought to be careful about these \npredictions. We do not have a budget surplus yet. The 10 years of \nestimated $3 trillion surpluses do not exist, and we have folks on the \nfloor who are breathless to try to deal with them through tax cuts.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend from South Carolina, who is managing this \nbill, that whatever time I use asking these questions be yielded off \nthe bill so the Senator does not lose his time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the statement I read to the Senator \njust a short time ago was given August 5 by the author of this \namendment that we are now debating. A day later, on August 6, do you \nremember this statement? I quote:\n\n       I believe that this program is going to make the economy \n     weaker. I believe that hundreds of thousands of people are \n     going to lose their jobs as a result of this program. I \n     believe that Bill Clinton is one of those people.\n  The fact is, does the Senator from North Dakota realize that there \nhave been 18 million jobs created in those 7 years? Hundreds of \nthousands losing their jobs?\n  You do remember this statement, don't you?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Oh, I do. In fact, the same people who made those \npredictions that were so wrong are now telling us they have new \npredictions and we should believe the new predictions.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, do you also understand that since this \nstatement was made we have had the lowest inflation, the lowest \nunemployment, in some 40 years? Does the Senator acknowledge the fact \nthat the deficits, when these predictions were made, which were about \n$300 billion a year, are now down to nothing? Does the Senator realize \nthat?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The economy has performed in a way no one expected. But \nwe knew that the direction this country was headed in was wrong--$290 \nbillion in a year in deficits, and heading up; more inflation, more \npeople out of work. And we proposed to change the fiscal program for \nthis country.\n  It took some guts to vote for it because it was not very popular. But \nI said to the folks I represent: Don't blame me for voting for that. \nGive me credit for it because I stand behind this program. We did what \nwas necessary to put an end to these Federal budget deficits and to put \nthis country's economy back on track--over the objections of a lot of \nfolks in this Chamber who today are telling us they have a new vision, \na new idea.\n  We have heard their ideas. An old fellow in my hometown--a small \ntown--once told me: Never buy something from somebody who is out of \nbreath.\n  There has been an almost breathless quality to the efforts by the \nmajority party, for 6 months, to get to the floor as quickly as they \ncould with their tax cuts.\n  If this is a battle of the pie charts, I say you win, we just give \nup. Here is a pie chart. Let me just show you. Let us just right at the \nstart of this discussion say: You win; this is your pie; if it is a \nbattle of the pie charts, you get the pie award. Republican tax breaks: \n$23,344 for the top 1 percent of the income earners. So you win the pie \naward.\n  Of course, these folks down here, they pay taxes, too. They all go to \nwork. They pay payroll taxes. Eighty percent of the people in this \ncountry pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.\n  But you breathlessly run to the floor of the Senate with a bill that \nsays let's cut income taxes, because that allows you to give a huge \nportion of this pie to the largest income earners in this country. In \nthe meantime, there are folks working today for the minimum wage, $5, \n$6, $7 an hour, who pay a payroll tax, a big tax, pay more in payroll \ntaxes than they do in income taxes. Are they going to get a tax cut? \nNo; they don't count because they ``don't pay taxes.'' They are not \ntaxpayers according to this strategy and this kind of philosophy. That \nis what is wrong with it.\n  Let me just run through a couple charts.\n  One of my colleagues showed this earlier this morning. I want to show \nit again.\n  The bottom 60 percent of the income earners, under this plan, will \nget $141 in tax breaks a year; the top 1 percent, $23,344 a year. And \npeople say: How dare you tell us this benefits the rich. How dare we? \nIt happens to be the fact.\n  As I said, so much of politics is fuzzy. But you do not need strong \nglasses to see this chart. There is nothing fuzzy about this. If you \ndecide you do not want to do this, then do not do it. It is easy to \namend your bill. If it is not your intention to give the bulk of the \ntax cut to the wealthiest Americans, then do not do it. But do not \ncomplain to us that we are calling attention to it when you do it. If \nyou do not stand behind it, then change it.\n  My problem is this: I don't understand what conservatism means \nanymore. I thought being conservative would be to try to put this \ncountry at a lower risk with respect to future opportunities and its \nfuture economy. Conservatism apparently means put the country at higher \nrisk. If you see a glimmer of a prospect of an estimate by an economist \nthat there might be a surplus, rush to the floor of the Senate and \npropose a three-quarters-of-a-trillion-dollar tax cut. Is that \nconservative?\n  It was a perfect symmetrical proposition that, on the floor of the \nSenate yesterday, the first vote was to waive points of order that \nwould exist against their bill, waive points of order for a conference \nreport that has not yet been written, for a conference that has not \nbeen held. That was, in my judgment, in perfect symmetry to the \nproposition they bring to the floor to provide tax cuts, paid for with \nsurpluses that don't yet exist. What perfect symmetry. But how \nperfectly awful as public policy to do that and put the country at this \nrisk.\n  We have some choices. The choice is that we have good economic times \nin the future. Let us all hope and pray we do because that is good for \nthis country. More people are working. Fewer people are on welfare. The \ncountry is growing, less inflation. It is a wonderful opportunity we \nhave in this country. But the same people who opposed the fiscal policy \nthat got us here have decided they want to create a new fiscal policy \nand a new strategy that puts all of that at risk. They know we are \nheading towards a serious problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. An additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We are heading toward a demographic time bomb in both \nSocial Security and Medicare. The question is, If these surpluses \nexist, what shall we do with them; reduce the Federal debt? That has \ngone from $1 trillion to $5.7 trillion in two decades. Reduce the \nFederal debt? The answer of the Republicans is no. How about extend the \nsolvency of Social Security because we know we face this problem. Older \npeople living longer; fewer people working to support them. Extend the \nsolvency of Social Security? No. How about extending the solvency of \nMedicare? No.\n  The only answer coming from that side of the aisle is take three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars, package it up, put a huge bow around \nit, and then bring it to the floor of the Senate, and then complain \nabout a pie chart that shows they have cut out the biggest piece for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I suggested that the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Texas, which as I understand it, is the House version of \nthe tax cut, is even worse than the Senate version when it comes to \nhelping working families, and frankly, I think, gives the\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\nword ``conservative'' a bad name. I ask the Senator if he would \nconsider the following:\n  In this Nation where we revere free speech, we basically let people \nsay what they want to say. Some people have gone so far as to suggest \nthat tomorrow will be the end of the world. Well, when tomorrow comes \nand goes and the world doesn't end, most of those people shrink away.\n  The people who are offering this amendment, in 1993, said the Clinton \nplan for deficit reduction was the end of the economic world for \nAmerica. We would see deficits as far as the eye could see. We would \nhave unemployment, high inflation, the economy was in terrible shape. \nAs a result, not a single Republican would vote for the Clinton plan.\n\n  I ask the Senator, did the world end, as Senator Gramm and others \nsuggested, with this Clinton plan? The same group is suggesting to us \ntoday that Alan Greenspan is wrong, Bill Clinton is wrong again, and \nthat we have to pass this tax break for wealthy people which will \nendanger our economy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the Senator knows the economy not only did not \ncollapse and crash and go into a depression as a result of our new \nfiscal policy; the economy blossomed and grew and everything changed. \nThe deficits were gone. The deficits were at $290 billion and growing. \nWe changed the fiscal policy.\n  A number of our friends stood up and said: You do this and you are \ngoing to collapse this country's economy. In fact, the fellow who has \noffered this amendment is an economist, taught economics. I taught \neconomics in college. I have been able to overcome that and lead a \nreasonably productive life, but economists can argue forever about all \nthese things.\n  The question is whether we are going to put the country at risk by \nmoving away from a fiscal policy that we know works and taking three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars from surpluses that do not yet exist and \ngiving big tax breaks.\n  This amendment is the House tax bill. I want to read for the author \nsomething he probably heard me read yesterday.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield to correct a factual error? First \nof all, there is nothing wrong with the House tax bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. This amendment is substantially more focused than the \nHouse tax bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did yield, and he made his point. Reclaiming my time, \nmy understanding was it was described as the House tax bill. If you \nhave made a couple of grammatical changes to that, so be it. Let me \nmake the case, with regard to the House tax bill and, similarly, the \nSenate bill, Kevin Phillips, a Republican columnist, said the \nfollowing:\n\n       We can fairly well call the House legislation the most \n     outrageous tax package in the last 50 years. It is worse than \n     the 1981 excesses. You have to go back to 1948.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Two additional minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The point I am making is this: This is not a Democrat \ntalking. This is a Republican saying this. We all know what is in this \nlegislation. This legislation is a piece of legislation that does what \nis always done by the same suspects that bring this to the floor. They \nare always shading, not just shading, they are galloping towards the \nhighest end of the income ladder to provide very significant cuts. The \nfolks on the lowest rung of the ladder, they pay payroll taxes and they \nare told they don't count. So the lowest 20 percent are going to get a \n$22 tax break; the top 1 percent, $23,300.\n  So the question is, when you stand up and say that is unfair, what is \nunfair? That we are telling people what is in your bill? Is that \nunfair? Do you want to change the bill? Do you deny this? Do you want \nto change the bill? Offer an amendment, I will support the amendment to \nchange the bill, but don't say it is unfair when we tell people what \nthe tax cut is going to be--$22 for the lowest 20 percent of the \nAmerican people, and the $23,300 for the top 1 percent--because you \nhave decided that people who pay payroll taxes don't count as taxpayers \nand you don't intend to give them any help. It is the folks at the \nupper end of the income ladder who are going to get huge tax breaks \nfrom the income tax system.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question, perhaps Bill \nGates and Donald Trump do need a tax break. Maybe the Senator from \nTexas believes that is a good reason to pass the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask that the Senator be given 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Three additional minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Is it true or not \ntrue that in the last 2 weeks Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, has testified before Congress several different times \nwarning us that this kind of tax proposal that is coming from the \nRepublican side could jeopardize the economic expansion? Is it not true \nthat it is within the power of the Federal Reserve Board, by their \nmonetary policy, to raise interest rates if they see indications of \ninflation, and by raising these interests rates, put an additional \neconomic burden on families who are paying for their mortgages, family \nfarmers who are trying to stay in business, and small businesses alike? \nIs it not true that if we see inflation come on the scene and interest \nrates go up, that a $22 tax break for working families will disappear \nin a heartbeat?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, that is the case.\n  I submit this: In a quiet moment, in a secluded corner, in a private \nconversation, most Members of the Senate who are supporting this three-\nquarters-of-a-trillion-dollar tax cut would admit that a better \napproach for this country and its future and certainly its children \nwould be to use anticipated surpluses, first, to begin to pay down the \nFederal debt. If during tough times you run up the debt from $1 \ntrillion to $5.7 trillion and then in good times you say, but we can't \npay down the debt, there is something fundamentally flawed about that \nstrategy.\n  I think if you take all the politics and fuzz out of this and get in \na quiet corner, those who are really conservative and have conservative \nvalues about these issues as embodied in the fiscal plan we passed in \n1993, I think they would admit that we ought to take some of this \nsurplus and reduce Federal indebtedness. I think they would also admit \nthere is not an intention to kick 100,000 kids off of Head Start or to \ndecimate the education program. Yet that is where we are headed, on \nauto pilot, because this surplus is garnered by those who want to \npackage it up in a tax cut that predominantly benefits the upper-income \nfolks.\n  We ought to do the right thing. The right thing, it seems to me, for \nour children's sake, is to tell them we are going to begin using some \nof this to reduce Federal indebtedness, and for our children's sake, \nthat we are going to use some of this to extend the solvency of \nMedicare and Social Security, two programs that have made this country \na much better place in which to live for millions and millions of \nAmericans. We ought to do that. All of us know we ought to do it. \nRegrettably, we are on the floor in a perverted process. Reconciliation \nwas never intended for this process--never.\n  Yet, we are here because it muzzles us up with a 20-hour debate and \ndoes not allow a full debate about fiscal policy and tax cuts. And I \nsay to those on the other side, you will get your bill and have your \nvotes and you will pass a bill. But, in my judgment, you will put this \ncountry at risk because you are spending, through tax cuts, surpluses \nthat do not yet exist, just as yesterday you wanted to waive points of \norder on a conference report that had not yet been drafted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to take a little time off the bill \nto answer all this stuff, but first I want to give Senator Grams an \nopportunity to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Does the Senator from Delaware yield time off the bill?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator from Texas--\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am yielding time off the amendment. I will ask for time \noff the bill to answer the points that have been raised.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S9662]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask if I may be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Does the Senator yield 10 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Five minutes is all the time I have. I am sorry.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to support the tax relief plan \noffered by Senator Phil Gramm. But I also want to talk a little bit \nabout what we heard from our Democratic friends and colleagues on the \nother side.\n  Make no mistake about it, the surplus dollars out there are going to \nbe spent. The question is, Who is going to spend it? Are we going to \nallow it to be returned to the hard-working families and Americans and \nallow them to spend it, or are we going to let Washington spend it? To \nsome, it seems that if the taxpayers spend it, it will jeopardize the \neconomy, but if we trust the President and trust Washington, the money \nwill be spent correctly.\n  Also, I heard them talk about 1993 and what a great turnaround in \nfiscal policy for this country it was, and that it was due to their \nefforts that turned this economy around. The CBO finds the increased \nrevenues were propelled by personal income tax increases, and it cites \nfour reasons for this unexpected revenue: First, the rapid growth of \ntaxable income, which raised the tax base for personal income receipts; \nsecond, adjusted gross income, which has grown even more rapidly than \ntaxable personal income, mainly through the realization of capital \ngains--the capital gains tax increased by 150 percent between 1993 and \n1997, which is a third of the growth of the tax liability relative to \nthe GDP--third, raising taxes paid on pensions and IRA retirement \nincome; fourth, and most important, is the increase in the effective \ntax rate. That is people making a little more money, inflation pushing \nthem into the higher brackets, and now not paying 15 percent but 28, 31 \npercent or higher.\n  By the way, this is also what CBO said. It points out that the \nrevenue windfall did not result from legislative policy changes, which \nmy Democratic friends have claimed. In other words, the CBO says the \nlegislative initiatives taken by the President and the Democrats did \nnot generate this surplus; what generated this surplus was the \ninvestment in the economy by businesses, through the Reagan era of tax \nrelief bills, and also by the high productivity, work, and effort of \nthe American people. It wasn't by what Washington did; it was in spite \nof what Washington did that led to this.\n  So, clearly, all four reasons that we have a surplus are the result \nof the productivity of working men and women and businesses in this \ncountry.\n  Before I run out of time, I want to show you this chart. This depicts \nwhat is going to happen to the surplus. This is excess money that \ntaxpayers have sent to Washington. Here is what I have often said. Here \nwe have the man saying, ``I found someone's wallet, and I want to do \nthe right thing, so I plan to spend the money carefully.''\n  That is what our Democratic colleagues and the President want to do. \nWhen they find the money on the street, instead of giving it back to \nthe people it belongs to, they are going to spend it carefully for you.\n  Again, this debate is not over anything except who is going to spend \nthe money. As the Senator from North Dakota said, it is a clear, bright \nline. The line is: Do we want Washington to spend your surplus tax \nmoney, or do we want to return it to you and allow you to spend it on \nyour priorities?\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask our distinguished chairman to yield \nme 5 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in Ronald Reagan's own words, I want to \ntake our Democrat colleagues down memory lane. They have such fond \nmemories of what President Clinton has done, and I would like to tell \nthe rest of the story. It is true that Bill Clinton was elected \nPresident. It is true that he came to Washington and proposed the \nlargest tax increase in American history. It is true that not one \nRepublican voted for that tax increase. It is true that it passed by \none vote. It is true that the largest tax increase in American history \nnow bears heavily on working Americans.\n  Everything else they said is not true. Let me try to explain why. \nThey quote people saying harsh things about the Clinton program. Let me \ntell you the rest of the program. The rest of the program was a massive \nstimulus program where the Clinton administration proposed spending $17 \nbillion, in 1993 alone, on everything from ice skating rink warming \nhuts in Connecticut to alpine slides in Puerto Rico. I had harsh things \nto say about it, and I am proud of that. I am very proud that \nRepublicans, who were in the minority, killed that bill with a \nfilibuster.\n  Bill Clinton didn't just propose the largest tax increase in American \nhistory, he proposed having Government take over and run the health \ncare system, collectivizing American medicine, forcing everybody into a \nGovernment-run health care collective, which was a giant HMO run by the \nGovernment. It would have meant Government taking over one-eighth of \nthe American economy. I said it would be a disaster. I am proud that I \nhelped lead the effort to kill it, and I am proud that it is dead where \nit belongs. That is the Clinton program. The point is, we were able to \ndefeat every part of it, except the tax increase.\n  Now, when the Republican majority showed up in Washington, DC, in \nJanuary of 1995, they received this budget from President Clinton. On \npage 2 of this budget, President Clinton outlines what his budget was. \nIt had a deficit for fiscal year 1995 of $192 billion, and then the \nnext year $196 billion, $213 billion, $196 billion, $197 billion, and \n$194 billion. That was the Clinton budget.\n  But we elected a Republican majority in Congress. What happened? With \nthat Republican majority in Congress, we were not able to pass every \nbit of our Contract With America, but we reformed welfare, we cut \nspending, we stopped the runaway spending freight train of Bill \nClinton. And under a Republican majority, while Clinton's deficits \nlooked like this, the real deficit started to fall and turn into a \nsurplus which is indicated on the chart.\n  The question is, Who led, who followed, and who got out of the way? I \nbelieve that the Republican Congress led, the Democrats in Congress \nfollowed, and Bill Clinton got out of the way.\n  So if we are going to tell the history of what happened in the \nClinton era, let's not just remember his tax increase, let's remember \nhis stimulus package, which we killed. The Democrat majority could not \nget 60 votes, and it died. Clinton was heartbroken, but it died. And we \ndefeated the Clinton health care bill. It would have taken over one-\neighth of the American economy, and Americans were so shocked at the \nClinton program that they elected the first Republican majority since \nthe 1950s.\n  When we took over, things changed. With the same old Bill Clinton who \nwas here in 1995, when the deficit was $200 billion, what changed was \nthe Republican majority.\n  I just say to the American people, give us a Republican President, \nand we will again control spending, and we will let working people have \nmore of what they earn.\n  Mr. President, I yield Senator Hagel 5 minutes off the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I first want to add my thanks to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, for the leadership he has brought to the floor \non such an important issue on a very substantive vehicle that we are \nusing now to really make some decisions on behalf of the American \npublic.\n  I have heard this morning that this is an issue about priorities. \nSurely it is. This is about priorities. This will further be about \npriorities as we debate this issue throughout the day, and actually \nthroughout this year and into next year, because the priorities are \nabout whose money it is. It is not my money. It is not Senator Gramm's \nmoney. It is not President Clinton's money. It is the taxpayers' money. \nWe tend to allow that to slip aside here when we are engaged in this \ntheoretical debate.\n  Second, we all have to appreciate that we live in the mythical \nkingdom around here. The political kingdom says that all the clouds and \nall the\n\n[[Page S9663]]\n\ngoodness will reside here in the knowledge and the fountain of wisdom \ncoming forth from Washington. We are seeing a great dynamic of that \ngiven when we are trying to take the people's money and then tell them \nhow we will spend it and give it back to them because we are benevolent \nSenators; we are benevolent representatives of the people; we can \nfigure it out better.\n  If there is a sense of arrogance in this, I think you are right if \nyou sense that, that the Congress is going to decide who gets what; we \nare going to make that decision. So we are going to target all of these \npieces of the pie because we can decide better for the American people \nhow they should spend their money, if we decide to give them back some \nof their money.\n  I have also heard some interesting conversations this morning about \nprojections. As a matter of fact, I used to have a real job, and in \nthat real job I was a businessman. I had to deal with projections \nbecause I had to put together budgets. Those budgets had to direct \nresearch and development. Those budgets had to direct investment, \ncapital, and what we were doing for the long term. Yes, they are \nimperfect. Ten-year budgets are slippery, and they are dangerous. But \nthe fact is, we must base a budget upon something. That budget must be \nbased upon a relevant series of assumptions. So that is a given, and we \nhave to deal with that.\n  After we get through that, then we have to make some tough decisions. \nThat is what we are going through today. I believe this bill that we \nhave brought to the floor this morning does that. I think it does it \nfirst in a very responsible way. It does it in a way that allows 75 \ncents of every surplus dollar to go back into debt reduction projects--\nSocial Security, Medicare, important Government programs such as \ndefense. The first real obligation of responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment is national security--veterans programs, education, medical \nresearch, and health care. That money is there.\n  We are talking about a $3 trillion budget surplus--both on the budget \nand off the budget, meaning in Social Security and out of Social \nSecurity--$3 trillion over the next 10 years. I don't know if that is \ngoing to materialize, but one of the things we know is that we have to \nmake some tough decisions based upon what we know and what we project. \nThis bill does it very responsibly. It does it in a way that addresses \nthose needs of our Republic and what we have committed to the American \npublic.\n  My goodness, to say that giving 25 percent of that back to the \nAmerican public in a tax cut is somehow irresponsible is well beyond my \ncalculations.\n  Senator Mack was on the floor yesterday. I want to repeat a couple of \npoints he made. One, he said, for example, how can a $4 billion net tax \ncut for fiscal year 2000 overstimulate demands in a trillion-dollar \neconomy? Of course, as of now, this bill phases in those tax cuts over \na series of 10 years.\n  Senator Mack said yesterday, and as my colleague again reminded us, \nhe asked rhetorically, ``Would a $39 billion tax cut in the year 2002 \noverheat the economy when this is only .004 percent of the total \nprojected GDP?''\n  I think you get the message.\n  We are engaged once again in this mythical kingdom of fantasy. The \nfact is, this money is the taxpayers' money. The fact is, this is a \nresponsible direction of those resources that surely, if they are \nallowed to stay here in Washington, will be spent.\n  The President has given us ample opportunity to look over that very \ngenerous menu he has presented to us with all of his new spending.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I think our distinguished friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hollings, is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, Senator Lieberman, I send a motion to the desk in \naccordance with the rule, by 2 o'clock, that they be filed and we \nintend to make later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Let me just say quickly to clear the Record that the Senator from \nTexas was talking about what the Republicans have done for the economy.\n  I can tell you what they have done for the economy. They came in \n1995, and for 1996 they worked, of course, on the budget. They \nimmediately increased spending for the next year of $148 billion. They \nincreased spending, and the budget went up another $50 billion. This \nyear, of course, it is another $50 billion, and they have added. The \ntrack record will show that they have added $661 billion to the \nnational debt.\n  But what did President Clinton do in 1993? And we did not have the \nlargest tax increase. That was under Senator Dole. I will show the \narticles analyzing both.\n  But I readily acknowledge that I voted and supported and worked like \na tiger to get the Deficit Reduction Act of 1993 passed, which \nprevailed by one vote. Yes, we did cut spending, we did downsize over \n300,000 Federal jobs. But more than anything else, yes, we raised \ntaxes.\n  The Senator from Texas, when we raised the taxes on Social Security, \nwas adamantly opposed to that, and he said--I will use his expression--\nyou increase taxes on Social Security and they will hunt you Democrats \ndown in the streets and shoot you like dogs.\n  The Senator from South Carolina never forgot that expression. That is \nhow tough we had it. They were going to hunt us down.\n  Of course, the chairman of the Finance Committee at that time, \nSenator Packwood, said, ``I will give you my home if this thing \nworks.'' The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Kasich, said, \n``I will change parties and become a Democrat if this thing works.'' \nAnd it is working.\n  That is a tremendous frustration I have because it is working. We \nhave the lowest unemployment, the lowest inflation, and the economy is \nmoving along. Mr. Greenspan, not just on yesterday but earlier in the \nyear, in February, said stay the course.\n  My usually responsible Republican friends--I come from a Republican \nState, unfortunately--have given us what was called outrageous on \nMonday by the best of the best conservatives, Kevin Phillips--I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Commentary by Kevin Phillips on National Public Radio's Morning \n                     Edition, Monday, July 26, 1999\n\n       Bob Edwards: The Republican party last week had its tax \n     reduction proposal passed by the House of Representatives. \n     Commentator Kevin Phillips says it's the most unsound fiscal \n     legislation of the last half century:\n       Kevin Phillips: Tax bills often deal with Pie in the Sky. \n     The mind boggling ten-year cuts passed late last week by the \n     House of Representatives however deserve a new term: Pie in \n     the Stratosphere. That's because the cuts are predicated on \n     federal budget surpluses so far out, six, eight or ten years, \n     that it would take an astrologer, not an economist to predict \n     federal revenues. The most publicized provision, phased in \n     ten-percent across the board reductions in federal income tax \n     rates, looks excessive. But these at least stand to be \n     delayed by a legislative trigger, if surpluses and debt-\n     reduction don't occur as assumed. Not so for the truly venal, \n     smaller provisions. Ones too complicated to be explained in \n     40 seconds on the TV news shows. Democrats are certainly \n     correct about the imbalance of benefits by income group. \n     Treasury figures show that the top 1% of families, just 1%, \n     would get 33% of the dollar cuts, the bottom 60% of families \n     get a mere 7%. Conservatives reply that the tax cuts are \n     simply going to the people who pay the taxes and have the \n     incomes. That's partly true. The top 1% of families have \n     about 13% of the nation's income but that's under an official \n     definition that excludes capital gains. If you include \n     capital gains in household income, the top 1% may indeed have \n     some 20% to 30% of the national total these days. Which gets \n     us to the real guts of this bill: Two low profile, but high \n     favoritism provisions. First, reduction of the top federal \n     capital gains tax rate from 20% to 15% and, second, the \n     phasing out of the federal gift and inheritance taxes. Both \n     changes would concentrate a huge portion of their benefits in \n     the top 1%.\n       The top 1% of American taxpayers reported about 60% of the \n     taxable capital gains dollar values several years back. To \n     reduce their capital gains rate from today's 20% to 15% is \n     unnecessary in terms of investment stimulus. All of the bull \n     markets of the last 50 years have occurred when the top cap \n     gains rate is in the 20 to 28% range. The bills special \n     interest provisions phasing out the Federal estate and gift \n     taxes over the next\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\n     decade could be even more costly. Demographers say life \n     expectancies ending in the years 2000 to 2010 will send a \n     tidal wave of estates through the inheritance processes. The \n     top 1% of families have the great dollar bulk of what are now \n     taxable estates and if these are not substantially taxed, \n     wealth and position in America will be more and more \n     inherited, not earned.\n       We can fairly call the House legislation the most \n     outrageous tax package in the last 50 years. It's worse than \n     the 1981 excesses, you have to go back to 1948, when the \n     Republican 80th Congress sent a kindred bill to President \n     Harry Truman. Truman vetoed it, calling the Republicans \n     bloodsuckers, with offices in Wall Street. Not only did he \n     win reelection, but the Democrats recaptured Congress. We'll \n     see if Bill Clinton and Albert Gore have anything resembling \n     Truman's guts.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one sentence of his commentary: ``We can \nfairly call the House legislation the most outrageous tax package in \nthe last 50 years.''\n  That is why I come to the floor to speak. I agree with Mr. Phillips. \nThis tax bill turns everything on its backside when we have a good \ngoing economy, and the Republicans come in with, of all things, a tax \ncut. How come? I will tell Members exactly. I can't find out what was \nfirst, the chicken or the egg, but OMB got into this blooming 2000 \nelection, and CBO has a Republican--not any Alice Rivlin or Bob \nReischauer, but they have a Republican fix--Mr. Crippen over at CBO. I \nhave been working on this budget since we passed it back in 1973.\n  Both CBO and OMB started finding money. How we could as a party put \nin tax cuts and have the real issue for the election 2000.\n  This is very interesting. You don't find the word ``unified, unified, \nunified.'' That is all I have heard for the last 20 years--unified. It \nis not a unified budget. It is an outright budget surplus. That is what \nthe CBO called it. It is not a budget surplus at all. The fact is, and \nI will quote the figures, the debt goes up each year for the next 5 \nyears.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record from the CBO \nreport on page 19.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 TABLE 10.--CBO BASELINE PROJECTIONS OF INTEREST COSTS AND FEDERAL DEBT (BY FISCAL YEAR)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Actual\n                                                1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       NET INTEREST OUTLAYS (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nInterest on Public Debt (Gross interest) \\1\\      364      356      358      358      350      345      342      338      333      328      323      316\nInterest Received by Trust Funds:\n    Social Security.........................      -47      -53      -59      -67      -74      -82      -91     -100     -110     -121     -132     -144\n    Other trust funds \\2\\...................      -67      -68      -70      -73      -74      -76      -79      -81      -84      -87      -89      -92\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal............................     -114     -120     -129     -140     -148     -159     -170     -182     -194     -208     -222     -236\nOther interest \\3\\..........................       -7       -7       -6       -7       -7       -7       -8       -8       -8       -8       -8       -9\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Total...........................      243      229      222      212      194      179      164      148      131      112       92       81\n \n                                                FEDERAL DEBT AT THE END OF THE YEAR (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nGross Federal Debt..........................    5,479    5,582    5,664    5,721    5,737    5,760    5,770    5,770    5,732    5,675    5,600    5,500\nDebt Held by Government Accounts:\n    Social Security.........................      730      856    1,003    1,157    1,321    1,493    1,675    1,869    2,075    2,292    2,520    2,755\n    Other accounts \\2\\......................    1,029    1,107    1,188    1,267    1,350    1,431    1,510    1,589    1,666    1,743    1,813    1,880\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal............................    1,759    1,963    2,190    2,425    2,670    2,925    3,185    3,458    3,741    4,035    4,333    4,635\nDebt Held by the Public.....................    3,720    3,618    3,473    3,297    3,066    2,835    2,584    2,312    1,992    1,640    1,267      865\nDebt Subject to Limit \\4\\...................    5,439    5,543    5,626    5,684    5,700    5,724    5,734    5,736    5,699    5,643    5,568    5,469\n \n                                                 FEDERAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT\n \nDebt Held by the Public.....................     44.3     40.9     37.5     34.2     30.5     27.1     23.7     20.3     16.8     13.2      9.8     6.4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Excludes interest costs of debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury (primarily the Tennessee Valley Authority).\n\\2\\ Mainly Civil Service Retirement, Military Retirement, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.\n\\3\\ Mainly interest on loans to the public.\n\\4\\ Differs from the gross federal debt primarily because most debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury is excluded from the debt limit.

Gross Federal debt, on page 19: In the year 1999, \n$5.582 trillion; it goes to $5.664 trillion; 2001, $5.721 trillion; \n2002, $5.737 trillion; 2003, $5.760 trillion; 2004, $5.770 trillion.\n  Up, up, and away. Deficits, not surpluses; deficits--the \nCongressional Budget Office says--as far as the eye can see.\n  The Republicans were going to take the $1.9 trillion of Social \nSecurity. We have to not get into Social Security. We have to find $1 \ntrillion for the tax cut about which we have been talking. So they said \nwe have another $1 trillion. How do we do it? They said--at least the \nRepublicans, and I will limit my comment to that because that is what \nthey have in this particular amendment--they said: Let's not just have \ncurrent policy. Let's stick to the spending caps that we put in.\n  They violate the spending caps. They violated it again last year, $21 \nbillion, and we already are up to $17 billion and it is going to be at \nleast $35 billion or $40 billion or more at the end of this year--\nalready in violation of the caps. When the majority says they keep the \ncaps on with no emergency spending and the economy stays at a growth of \naround 2 to 2.5 percent. The chairman of the Budget Committee on Sunday \nsaid CBO estimated two recessions--That is not right and I would like \nto correct that. CBO in this book does not project any recession during \nthe next 10 years, rather 2.5-percent growth.\n  If you can get all of that growth you can get and have unemployment \nstaying the same way, inflation staying way down, interest rates down, \nyou obey the caps and you have no emergencies whatever. And then you \nfind some money.\n  However, I point out that they knew where most of the money, 80 \npercent, was coming from--the other trust funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that page in \nthe report, Trust Funds Looted to Balance the Budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                      [By fiscal year, in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 1999     2000     2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security..............................      857      994    1,624\nMedicare:\n  HI.........................................      129      140      184\n  SMI........................................       39       44       64\nMilitary Retirement..........................      141      148      181\nCivilian Retirement..........................      490      520      634\nUnemployment.................................       79       88      113\nHighway......................................       25       26       32\nAirport......................................       11       14       25\nRailroad Retirement..........................       23       24       28\nOther........................................       57       59       69\n                                              --------------------------\n      Total..................................    1,851    2,057    2,954\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Includes accrued capital gains.\n\\2\\ Primarily credit programs.\n \nNote: Projections for 2010 through 2014 are an OMB extension of detailed agency budget estimates through 2009.\n\n  The page shows increasing deficits going up. The national debt goes \nup from $5.6 trillion to about $7.6 trillion; $7.587 trillion over 15 \nyears.\n  What do we have? We have an increase in the debt of Social Security \nof which the distinguished chairman has the jurisdiction. They owe it \n$857 billion. In 10 years, they will owe Social Security $2.7 trillion \nand they are talking about saving Social Security--lockbox. This is a \nshameful sideshow out here. There is no dignity left in this Senate. No \nresponsibility.\n  If they can put up a chart, run away, whine, and say the people back \nhome know how to spend--if we have all the money, why can't the people \nget it back? They didn't give it back to the Social Security people \nwhen he was going to shoot me in the streets. They didn't give it back \nto where they came from, the wage earners, the payroll tax.\n  Oh, no, as the Senator from North Dakota said, the rich get it all. \nCome on. It seems as if there would be a conscience in this crowd. I \ndon't think this will sell with the American people when they hear the \ntruth. That is what I am trying to give them here today--the truth.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas comes up. I knew it because I \nhave been working at his side in previous years. He comes up and the \nfirst thing he said is the real problem is how to give it, and the best \nwas ``across the board.'' I knew he was going to get to Dicky Flatt. He \nimmediately changed subjects and the debate became the Gramm amendment, \nwhich is supposed to go between workers, wage earners, and deadbeats. \nIf he can put that one over, then he has won the day with the hard-\nworking people and Dicky Flatt.\n  Come on, give us a break. We have been through that. There is no \neducation in the second kick of a mule.\n  We have a good economy. Alan Greenspan, the best of the best, who has \nhelped us maintain that, says stay the course. The Hollings-Lieberman \nmotion is not to take sides in this intramural between tax cuts and \nspending. But just saying: Finance Committee, come back with a bill \nthat says any surplus you find, apply it to reducing the national debt. \nLet's all go home. I think we will win the approval of the American \npeople.\n  Now, not coming in with all of the lockboxes, that immediately puts \nback the money into IOUs. They issue these Treasury bills, which are \nnothing more than an IOU under section 201 of Social Security, and then \nthey spend the money on other things. There is not any true lockbox.\n  We had an amendment and I showed that to the majority leader. I \ncirculated it to all the Senators. That is why if they allow us to put \nour amendments up, including my amendment to cap the debt, we will get \nthe truth. All I want to do is say cap the debt as of September 30, \n1999. If you have nothing but surpluses, then run around asking how to \nspend it or how to give a tax cut or whatever.\n  I will agree that you are right if there is a surplus. But the debt \nwon't go down at the end of the fiscal year. They didn't want that \nvote. That is why we are in a filibuster about the lockbox. Somehow, \nsomewhere, we have to get the truth out and cut out this whining about \nthe people back home know how to spend their money. The point is, you \ncannot cut taxes without increasing spending. That is the great fiscal \ncancer we have developed in the 1980s with the Reagan tax cuts. The \nnational debt was less than $1 trillion, less than $1 trillion at that \nparticular time. Now we have a $5.6 trillion debt. With all of that \n``growth, growth, growth--we are going to have growth everywhere,'' \nwhat has grown is the national debt with an interest cost of $1 billion \na day.\n\n  I served on Peter Grace's commission against waste, fraud and abuse. \nThe only thing Congress created was the biggest waste of all, spending \n$358 billion in interest costs. If we had that $358 billion, we could \ndo all these things--Social Security, Medicare, research, tax cuts and \neverything else. We are going to spend it on account of a political \nsideshow and use our credibility to get by. The reason we creditably \nget by, and I will finish in a moment. We had a wonderful debate in the \n1930s. I will listen to that any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, off the bill we yield the Senator 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We had a wonderful debate in the 1930s between Walter \nLippmann and John Dewey. It was Mr. Lippmann's contention that the way \nto maintain and strengthen a democracy was get the best of minds in the \nvarious disciplines--foreign policy, economic policy, housing, \nwhatever--get them around the table, determine the public's needs, the \nNation's needs, determine a policy to answer those needs, and give it \nto the politicians in Congress and let them enact it.\n  John Dewey, the educator, said no. He said give the American people \nthe truth. Let the free press give the American people the truth, and \nthe truth will be reflected through the Congressmen and the Senators in \nthe Congress\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\nand we will have a strong democracy. And that is what we did for 200-\nand-some years. As Jefferson said, ``When the press is free and every \nman can read, all is safe.''\n  What has happened? We are not safe any longer because the press has \ngotten into entertainment and they have joined the conspiracy and they \ncall spending increases spending cuts and they call deficits surpluses. \nThat is our dilemma. That is our dilemma. The only thing that is going \nto save us is that free press getting back to their professional code \nof conduct, and cut out the entertainment, and get back to telling the \nAmerican people the truth. Then we would not have to argue about tax \ncuts. It has to be an embarrassment to come out here with a tax cut. It \nwould be an embarrassment to come out here and just spend billions and \nbillions of dollars that we do not have. This year we are spending $103 \nbillion more than we are taking in. We are in a deficit position.\n  I thank the Chairman and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to address some of the issues I \njust heard from the Senator from South Carolina. The first is quoting \nof Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. I believe \nDr. Greenspan's comments have been taken far out of context. Because if \nyou look at what he said, plainly it is if the choice is more spending \nor tax cuts, I will take tax cuts.\n  It is true he said he would be very cautious.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will yield on your time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator was correct in what I was saying. I said \nnothing about tax cuts--I favored those over spending. I said in my \nmotion there is a surplus that we apply to reducing the national debt, \nand I quoted Mr. Greenspan as of February, when he said, ``Stay the \ncourse.'' I didn't say Greenspan said I prefer tax cuts over spending. \nI did not use that quote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Dr. Greenspan said: If it is a choice of tax cuts \nversus spending, he takes tax cuts. Paying down the debt is exactly \nwhat the Republican plan does. So I think it is very important we keep \nDr. Greenspan's comments in context.\n  If you look at the President's plan, he takes $1 trillion and spends \nit. The Republican plan takes the same $1 trillion and gives $792 \nbillion back to the people who earned the money, and we have a cushion \nfor spending on issues such as Medicare and education in the rest of \nthe $1.3 trillion in surplus that comes from income tax withholding.\n  The Republican plan takes all of the payroll taxes that we heard the \nSenator from North Dakota talk about and puts that into Social Security \nreform and stability. So when we are talking about a lockbox, we are \nsaying all the payroll taxes for Social Security that people pay in \nwill be set aside for Social Security. That is $2 trillion. That is \nexactly what the President's plan sets aside for Social Security.\n  It also has the effect of paying down debt by about 50 percent, \naccording to the estimates. So you pay down debt and you stabilize \nSocial Security with $2 trillion that is set aside from the payroll \ntaxes that people pay in.\n  But for the other $1 trillion we are looking at that comes from \nincome tax withholding, we have very different plans. The President \nwould spend it. The Republicans would let the people who earned it keep \nit, and we would hold the rest in abeyance for spending on Medicare, \neducation, national defense.\n  Why do we want the people who earn this money, who work so hard for \nit, to be able to keep it? Because we believe the people who earn it \nneed the relief for their own purposes--for them to decide how they \nwant to spend their money. The typical American family is paying more \nin income taxes in peacetime than ever in our history--38 percent in \nincome taxes. A 10-percent across-the-board tax cut is fair to \neveryone. Because when people paid their taxes last year--they know \nwhat they paid, and they can take 10 percent off that. That is the most \nfair of all tax cuts, to let people keep more of what they earn. In \nfact, our tax relief package is less than the tax increases that \nPresident Clinton put in place in 1993. At that time, President Clinton \nsaid he was going to tax the rich and he put in that category people on \nSocial Security who earned $34,000 a year. That is what he declared as \nrich. I think these people deserve a break, and that is what we are \ntrying to give them.\n\n  We are giving marriage tax penalty relief. This morning at my \nconstituent coffee, I met a schoolteacher and a football coach. I am \ngoing to estimate they earn about $35,000 and about $40,000 apiece. \nThey get hit right square between the eyes with the marriage penalty \nbecause when you put their incomes together, they go into a new \nbracket. They are earning, then, $65,000 to $70,000 for a family of \nfour.\n  That is wrong. We should not tell people because they get married \nthat they owe more in taxes, just because they got married.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, did Senator Hollings' question come \noff his time or mine?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It came off of his time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is time we provide marriage tax \npenalty relief, tax relief across the board, death tax relief so people \nwill not have to visit the undertaker and the tax collector on the same \nday and give up the family farms that have had to be sold because of \ndeath taxes. That is wrong. This amendment will correct that situation. \nIt is time we give relief to the hard-working people of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The distinguished Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understand I have 10 minutes. I will \ntry to cut that in half in the interest of moving this along.\n  I cannot believe the amendment that is before this body. I am \nspeaking about the Gramm amendment. The Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities does very good work, as does Citizens for Tax Justice. Let's \ntake the 10-percent tax rate cut across the board: this is what they \nsay. 60 percent of the benefits of this tax cut will go to 10 percent \nof the taxpayers with the highest income. The bottom 60 percent of all \ntaxpayers will share just over 9 percent of the total benefits under \nthis plan. The average tax cut under the Gramm amendment, for the \nlowest income, 60 percent of all taxpayers, those with incomes below \n$38,000, will be about $99.\n  By contrast, those in the top 10 percent will enjoy an average tax \ncut of about $4,000. Tax cuts for the 1 percent highest income, those \nmaking more than $300,000 a year, will average $20,000 a year. I am not \neven talking about estate and capital gains tax cuts, which make the \nGramm amendment even more regressive.\n  To pick up on the comments of my colleague from South Carolina, the \noriginal House Ways and Means Committee proposal in the second 10 years \nwould explode the debt, costing $2.8 trillion. This may be only $2 \ntrillion. But even here, $2 trillion is a lot of money. From 2010 to \n2019, this tax cut package in the Gramm amendment will probably cost \nabout $2 trillion. That is what it will cost us.\n  Mr. President, Kevin Phillips, in some commentary the other day on \n``Morning Edition,'' talked about the House proposal. I think what he \nsaid applies to this Gramm amendment:\n\n       The mind-boggling 10-year cuts passed late last week by the \n     House of Representatives . . . deserve a new term: [Not pie \n     in the sky but] pie in the stratosphere.\n\n  That is what this Gramm amendment is: pie in the stratosphere.\n  Sometimes my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I say \nthis with a twinkle in my eye, it is never hatred; we always enjoy our \nwork--they will accuse some of us of class warfare. I say to my \ncolleague from Texas, this is class warfare. This is class warfare: 60 \npercent of the benefits go to the top 10 percent of all taxpayers. The \nbottom 60 percent gets 9 percent. The average tax cut for most of the \npeople in my State of Minnesota is about $99. But if you make over \n$300,000 a year, there will be an average\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\ntax cut of $20,000 a year. I say to my colleague from Texas, this is \nclass warfare. That is what his amendment is.\n  In some ways, I am glad to fight this war because the vast majority \nof people in this country, when they realize who gets the benefits and \nwho does not, when they realize what this amendment does in the second \n10 years, here is what they are going to say. They are going to say: We \nheard enough about how this surplus belongs to us. We are responsible \nadults. We are responsible parents and grandparents, and we believe \nthat whatever the performance of our economy--and I hope it will be \ngood; we do not know, this is all assumed--and whatever we have by way \nof surplus, here is what we believe: We believe that it does not belong \nto us; it belongs to our children and our grandchildren.\n  That means we pay off some of the debt we put on their shoulders, and \nthat means we also make sure that Medicare and Social Security are \nthere for them. It also means our children and our grandchildren, \nregardless of whether they are rich or poor, have opportunities; that \nthere is equal opportunity for every child. That is what the American \npeople believe. That is what Minnesotans believe.\n  I love this Gramm amendment. I love it because I think it presents in \nthe clearest possible way to people in Minnesota and people in the \ncountry what we are about, whose side we are on. It is a class warfare \namendment, and it should be trounced in a vote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the Senator from Michigan 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my good friend \nfrom New York.\n  The tax program which is in the amendment before the Senate, like the \nplan that it would amend, is unfair to middle-income Americans. It is \neconomically unwise, and it is based on unrealistic assumptions. The \nunfairness in the underlying bill it would amend is perhaps best shown \nin the fact that about two-thirds of its tax benefits go to the upper \none-fifth of our people. The amendment makes that worse. It makes an \nunfairness doubly unfair because it will give almost 80 percent of the \ntax benefits to the upper one-fifth of the income bracket.\n  In addition to being unfair, it is also economically unwise because \nit jeopardizes Medicare, it fails to strengthen Social Security, and it \nrisks higher interest rates. Yesterday, Alan Greenspan, testifying \nbefore the Banking Committee said:\n\n       We probably would be better off holding off on a tax cut.\n\nWhy? Because of the uncertainty of budget surplus projections and also \nbecause we should normally reserve tax cuts for periods of economic \nslowdown.\n  The implication, in his words, has also been pretty clear over these \nlast few months, which is that a large tax cut would cause the Fed to \nincrease interest rates. For the average middle-income taxpayers, a \nrise in interest rates means larger mortgage payments, larger loan and \ncredit card payments, larger payments on that automobile, and that \nwould far outweigh the small share of the benefits from the tax cut \nwhich that average taxpayer might receive.\n  The tax program that is being offered to us is also based on \nunrealistic projections. Projections are always risky. We have seen \nmany Federal budget estimates, and we know that as quickly as the \nsurpluses appear, they can disappear. The estimates of both the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget \nhave frequently been far off the mark in recent years, and that is not \ntheir fault. We have some bright economists in the CBO and the OMB. \nThey have a difficult task. Forecasting the performance of the economy, \nparticularly over the course of several years, is more art than \nscience, and there is a lot of guesswork in it.\n  For instance, the CBO estimated that the unified budget surplus for \nfiscal year 2000 will be $79 billion. But 4 months later, in a January \n1999 CBO document, the surplus for fiscal year 2000 was estimated at \n$130 billion. In 4 months, it jumped from a $79 billion estimate to a \n$130 billion estimate. The July estimate for fiscal year 2000 now \nprojects a $161 billion surplus. So there has been a change of over 100 \npercent in the projection of the surplus in less than a year. If most \nAmericans were confronted with such uncertainty over their own budget \nsituation, they would follow a cautious course, and we should, too.\n  The projections in both the underlying proposal and the pending \namendment to it are extremely risky because they are based on \nassumptions about domestic spending levels that are highly unrealistic. \nThe on-budget surplus, which the Republicans now say will pay for the \ntax cut, is reliant largely on massive cuts in discretionary spending, \n$595 billion over 10 years. That is a 23-percent cut in real terms from \nthe 1999 level adjusted for inflation. Can we really believe we will be \ncutting discretionary programs by 23 percent in real terms?\n  Is that what we are doing now?\n  If a realistic defense spending level is adopted--even the \nPresident's proposal; if we assume just that--the domestic spending cut \nwill grow to $775 billion over 10 years, which is a 38-percent cut in \nreal terms.\n  We have seen proof in the last few weeks that these levels are \nunrealistic. The so-called spending caps are already being exceeded by \nattaching emergency spending labels to new funding. We have already \nheard from the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that these \nlimits, or caps, are going to be lifted in any event. The House tends \nto use emergency spending to get around the caps. Apparently, we are \ngoing to be more forthright and just lift the caps.\n  So most people in Congress already believe--whether they acknowledge \nthis publicly or not--that the caps are simply not going to hold. So we \nalready have strong evidence that the basis of the surplus projection \nis not realistic or credible.\n  The proposal before us is going to take the economy backwards, just \nas we are climbing out of a deficit ditch.\n  In 1992, the deficit in the Federal budget was $290 billion. We made \nremarkable progress which has brought us now to the threshold of \nsurpluses. It came in large part because of a deficit-reduction package \nwhich President Clinton presented in 1993 and which we passed by a \nmargin of one vote. We should not now, by passing a tax bill such as \nthe one before us, head down the road toward new future deficits.\n  The alternative that Democrats offered yesterday was far better, by \nall three tests--the test of fairness, the test of prudence, the test \nof credibility. But by those same three tests, we should hold off on \nany tax cut. We should hold off on any tax cut, period.\n  First, we should see if the surplus is real before we adopt tax cuts. \nSecond, if the surpluses are real, we should pay down the national debt \nfaster. And third, we should save tax cuts for a time of economic slow \ndown.\n  The argument is made that this is the taxpayers' money. It is. But \nthe economy is the American taxpayers', too. The economy belongs to the \nAmerican taxpayer. Social Security belongs to the American people, just \nas this money belongs to the American people. The surplus belongs to \nthe American people. So does the Medicare program belong to the \nAmerican people. Our education program, helping people through college, \nbelongs to the American people, just as the surplus does.\n  These are taxpayers' dollars. There can be no dispute about that. But \nthe veterans' program is the American people's program. When we cut \nveterans' health care, we are cutting into something that the American \npeople want. It is their program, just as the surplus, just as the \ntaxes, are the American people's.\n  The American people are speaking loudly, at least to me, at least in \nmy office, when I go back home to Michigan every weekend and talk to \nthe American people. What they are telling me is: Pay down the debt, \nprotect Social Security, protect Medicare. Do what you need to do to \ninvest in education. Don't cut veterans' programs. But we don't need \nthis tax cut that is being proposed at this time, not just because it \nis unfair to middle income Americans--which it is, since most of the \nbenefits go to the upper fifth--but we don't need the tax cut because \nwe want debt reduction, real debt reduction.\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\n  That is what they are telling us. That is what the American people, \nwho produced this surplus, who send us the tax money, are telling us. \nThey are telling us that loudly, not just in public opinion polls--in \nthe mail that we open up, in the phone calls we get, and in the \npersonal pleas we get when we go home.\n  That is exactly what we should do: To hold off on any tax cut and \nreduce the debt with the money that otherwise would go to that tax cut, \nagain, not just because it is unfair--which it is--but because it is \nunwise and imprudent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Democrat \nside of the aisle has completed their run of speakers. They have a \nlittle time left. I have a little bit more. But it would be my \nintention, if it suits everybody else, to go ahead and try to answer \nall of these points that have been made, and try to deviate from my \nbackground as a schoolteacher and not take all day, and then go ahead \nand yield back my time if they would yield back theirs, and then we \nwill set my vote aside and let Senator Kennedy offer his amendment, if \nthat will suit everybody on time.\n  The only thing I want to be sure of is--since I want to be sure I get \nto answer every point that has been made--I would like to be the last \nspeaker on my substitute. So if that works with everybody, I am happy \nabout it; if not, we can do it another way.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator's proposal is entirely agreeable. I cannot, \nhowever, let pass the notion that Texas may be the only State in the \nUnion where a former professor of economics refers to himself as a \nsometimes schoolteacher. But that is the way it is. We look forward to \nhearing all he has to say.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. So we have someone here to speak when the Senator finishes, \ncould the Senator give us an estimate of when he might complete his \nstatement on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen and a half minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be through before that. Senator Kennedy may want to \nstart making his way over here.\n  Mr. President, we are about to wrap up the debate on this amendment. \nI think sometimes it is easy to get carried away and get in the \nbusiness of trying to look at people's motives. I would like, in my \nconcluding comments, to try to set this whole thing in perspective.\n  I wonder sometimes if our Democrat colleagues do not just rediscover \nevery once in a while how progressive--and that is the term that was \nmade up by the people who wanted the Tax Code to be highly skewed, \nwhere higher income people paid the great preponderance of taxes in \nAmerica.\n  We are today talking about cutting income taxes. Our dear colleague \nfrom Minnesota points out that if you make less than $30,000, you are \ngoing to get less than $100 of income tax cuts in this bill. But what \nour colleague fails to recognize is that 50 percent of Americans pay \nonly 4.3 percent of the income taxes; 32 percent of American families \npay no income taxes whatsoever.\n  So I know it makes for a good sound bite to say 32 percent of \nAmericans will get no income tax cut if you cut taxes across the board \nby 10 percent, but they do not get a tax cut because they do not pay \nincome taxes.\n  Tax cuts are for taxpayers. The people who will get a tax cut under \nthis bill get no food stamps. Is that an outrage? People who will get a \ntax cut under this bill do not qualify for Medicaid. Is that an outrage \nthat they do not qualify for Medicaid? People who will get a tax cut \nunder this bill do not qualify for Aid to Families with Dependent \nChildren. Is anyone outraged about that? I am not, because AFDC, food \nstamps, Medicaid are not for everybody; they are for poor people. Tax \ncuts are for taxpayers.\n  So when our colleagues stand up and say the top one-quarter of the \ntaxpayers in America will get 60 percent of the tax cut under this \nbill, don't forget that the top 25 percent of income earners in America \ntoday pay 81.3 percent of all the taxes.\n  Why would anybody be shocked that a group of people who pay 81.3 \npercent of the taxes might get 60 percent of the tax cut? In fact, what \nour dear colleague from Michigan was pointing out is that the Roth bill \nis, from the point of view of the existing Tax Code, putting a heavier \nburden on higher income people. My amendment does not do that. Now, \nsome of our colleagues, a few minutes ago, suggested that I was \noffering the House bill. The House tax cut bill is 457 pages long. The \ntax cut I am offering is 46 pages long. This is a very simple tax cut. \nAt the end of my comments, I will go over what it does and does not do.\n\n  It is true that the top 1 percent will get more tax cut than the \nbottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent of income earners in America earn \n16 cents of every dollar earned, but they pay 32.3 percent of the \ntaxes. The bottom 50 percent pay only 4.3 percent of the taxes. So if \nyou are giving a tax cut, people who pay taxes get it. If you are \ngiving welfare or Medicaid, people who are poor get it. I don't know \nwhy that comes as a shock to our Democrat colleagues.\n  Our dear friend from South Carolina said the rich get it all. Well, \nthe plain truth is that the average family in America making $50,000 a \nyear, they are rich, according to the Senator from South Carolina. But \nthe average family making $50,000 a year will get $624 in a tax cut by \nthe 10-percent across-the-board tax.\n  How is it that only rich people are getting the tax cut? Well, you \nhave to remember that when the Democrats, in 1993, raised taxes, they \ndefined ``rich'' as anybody making over $25,000 a year when they taxed \npeople earning $25,000 a year on their Social Security benefits. I hope \npeople are not confused when they hear the Senator from South Carolina \nsay under the Gramm amendment rich people get it all. I hope they \nunderstand that rich people are people over $25,000 a year. When \nSenator Hollings was saying, yes, he voted to raise taxes on Social \nSecurity, that was on rich people who made over $25,000 a year. Don't \nforget the code when we are talking about these things.\n  There are a lot of people on the Democrat side of the aisle who say \nhold off on the tax cut. Well, I don't find that unappealing. Just to \nlevel with people, if we could stop the spending spree that is underway \nand hold off on the tax cut and have an election--I believe we are \ngoing to have a Republican President; I think I know who it is; I \nbelieve we are going to have a Republican majority in both Houses of \nCongress--I think we could do a better job 2 years from now. So when \nSenator Levin says hold off on the tax cut, why do I not end up \nsupporting his position?\n  Well, the problem is, this is the Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis of President Clinton's budget. He is proposing to spend $1.033 \ntrillion, not only every penny of the surplus, but he is having to \nplunder Social Security for 3 out of the 10 years. So while our \ncolleagues are saying don't cut taxes, what they are not telling is \nthat the President has proposed spending every penny of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus, plus part of the Social Security surplus.\n  We are already $21 billion over the budget this year. I would be \nwilling to wait when we had a President who I think would support a \nbetter tax package, but under President Clinton's budget, we will have \nspent every penny of the surplus before we can elect a new President. \nSo that is why we have to act now.\n  The second thing is about how large this tax cut is, how outrageous, \nhow obscene. If you want to spend all the money, any tax cut is \nobscene. If you don't want a tax cut, all tax cuts are for rich people, \nall tax increases are on rich people. So most people, at least in that \nlanguage, don't have a stake in it.\n  But the problem is, all tax increases are on working people and our \ntax cut is for working people. The question is, Is it too big?\n  When Bill Clinton became President, Government was taking in taxes, \n17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Because of the \nmassive tax increase in 1993 and because\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\npeople, as incomes have gone up, have moved into higher brackets, \nGovernment is now taking a peacetime record 20.6 percent of the economy \nin Federal taxes.\n  Now, if we took all $1 trillion of the non-Social Security surplus \nand gave it back to the American worker in tax cuts--and I remind \nSenators, we are giving less than $800 billion because we are keeping \n$200 billion for Medicare and for emergencies--if we gave it all back, \nthe tax burden, at 18.8 percent of every dollar earned, would still be \nsubstantially higher than it was the day Bill Clinton became President. \nSo even if you adopt our tax cut and even if the President signed it, \nwhen he left office and when this tax cut was fully implemented, he \ncould say: Taxes were substantially higher when I left than when I \ncame--even though supposedly we are talking about a huge tax cut.\n  Now, finally, if you take the arithmetic and you say: How big is this \ntax cut relative to the level of taxes we are collecting, over a 10-\nyear period, the tax cut is a whopping 3.5 percent. Over a 10-year \nperiod, if we adopt our tax cut, we are reducing revenues by 3.5 \npercent.\n  How can the President say this tax cut endangers the American \neconomy? In fact, the day before yesterday he was saying it endangers \nwomen's health care; if we let working people keep more of the money \nthey earn, it is going to hurt women's health.\n  I don't know, if this debate goes on another day or two, he may say \nthat infantile paralysis will be back, that polio will suddenly descend \non America. If you let people keep more of what they earn, it could \nhappen. The bubonic plague could come back. The point is, we are \ntalking about 3.5-percent tax cuts over 10 years.\n  Why are we doing this? We are doing it because we are going to \ncollect $3 trillion in taxes over the next 10 years above the level we \nare going to spend. We are taking $2 trillion and putting it away so \nwhen we get a President that has the courage to fix Social Security--we \ndo not have such a President today, I am sad to say, but when we get \none, we will have the money and we will be ready to do it.\n  Then out of the trillion that is left, we are saying, let us give \neight-tenths of it back in tax cuts and let us keep two-tenths of it \nfor Medicare and for any emergencies we might have.\n  Our colleagues say, if you give these tax cuts, the money is gone \nforever. That is interesting because we raise taxes round here all the \ntime. But yet when they spend this money on $1.033 trillion of new \nprograms, it is as if we can snap our fingers and have it back.\n  The truth is, you can always get money back that you give to the \nAmerican public in tax cuts. If we start 81 new programs, which is what \nPresident Clinton wants to do, we will never be able to get that money \nback. We will never be able to end those programs. That is what the \ndebate is about.\n  I see that one of my colleagues who had asked to speak before, came \nand waited for others to speak, has come back. How much time do I have \nat this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield that Senator 5 minutes of my time, and then I will \nsum up with the last minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have heard the name of the Federal Reserve \nBoard Chairman, Alan Greenspan, invoked in this debate as if the \nChairman would oppose the tax-relief bill. That is not my understanding \nof where Mr. Greenspan stands on the issue. I want to include for the \nRecord at the end of my remarks a copy of a Wall Street Journal \neditorial on the subject that ran on July 27, 1999.\n  When Chairman Greenspan testified before the Banking Committee last \nweek, he said that he would delay tax cutting and apply the surplus to \ndebt repayment--but here is the part of the quote that many in the \nmedia have failed to report. He said he would defer tax cuts:\n\n       . . . unless, as I've indicated many times, it appears that \n     the surplus is going to become a lightening rod for major \n     increases in outlays (emphasis added). That's the worst of \n     all possible worlds, from a fiscal policy point of view, and \n     that, under all conditions, should be avoided.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan went on to say, ``I have great sympathy for those who \nwish to cut taxes now to pre-empt that process, and indeed if it turns \nout that they are right, then I would say moving on the tax front makes \na good deal of sense to me.''\n  Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan's view is important because \nopponents of this tax relief bill claim that the Federal Reserve will \nrespond to its enactment by raising interest rates to the cool economy. \nBut Mr. Greenspan's remarks make it clear that the real threat to \ncontinue prosperity is bigger government, not tax relief. And if the \ntax overpayment is not returned to taxpayers, I think it is clear that \nit will be spent long before it can be applied to debt reduction.\n  Just consider that President Clinton is proposing new spending \namounting to $826 billion--more than the 10-year cost of the tax-relief \nbill that is before us. Remember, too, that our tax bill accounts for \nonly about 25 percent of the available surplus. In other words, we are \nonly proposing to refund about 25 cents of every surplus dollar to the \npeople who sent it to us--hardly a risky or irresponsible thing. \nSeventy five cents of every surplus dollar would be dedicated to \npreserving Social Security and Medicare, and funding other domestic \npriorities.\n  Remember, to the extent that there is a surplus, we will have taken \ncare of our core obligations already--things like education and health \ncare, running our national parks, and providing for the national \ndefense. It may be true that refunding the overpayment will mean we \ncannot fund some low priority programs, but that is the point: \ntaxpayers ought to be able to decide how to spend their own hard-earned \nmoney before Washington wastes it.\n  Critics of the tax-relief bill also claim that it cannot be justified \nbecause projected surpluses may never materialize, that Congress and \nthe President will be unable to live within the spending limits we \nagreed to on a bipartisan basis only two years ago. In other words, \nthey contend that spending the surplus is a preordained outcome. To me, \nthat is not a reason to defer tax relief. It is the very reason we need \nto pass tax relief--before Washington can find new ways to spend the \ntax overpayment.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to clarify that we are talking \nabout what to do with the non-Social Security surplus. Our plan saves \nall of the Social Security surplus for Social Security. President \nClinton says that it is his goal as well, but his budget would actually \nspend $158 billion of the Social Security surplus on other programs. If \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle would end their \nfilibuster against the Social Security lockbox bill, we could pass it \nand make sure the Social Security surplus is not spent.\n  Let me turn for a few moments to the specific provisions of the tax-\nrelief bill that is before us today. I want to begin by commending the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for producing a bill that fully meets \nthe instructions of the budget resolution we passed earlier this year \nand provides a full $792 billion in tax relief over the next decade.\n  But I must say that I would have written the bill very differently. \nIt seems to me that there are too many provisions that are targeted too \nnarrowly. For example, the bill includes a tax break for the renovation \nof historic homes. That is great if you intend to engage in such \nrenovation. But if you do not have the means to own a historic home, or \ndo not want one, you get no relief.\n  People with a foreign address would have their frequent flyer miles \nexempted from the 7.5 percent air passenger ticket tax.\n  Generation of electricity from chicken litter would earn a tax break.\n  And if you are fortunate enough to get certain scholarships, your \naward would be excluded from tax.\n  These four provisions alone--and each may have merit in its own \nright--have a combined revenue impact of about $4 billion over 10 \nyears--money that I would prefer to put toward broad-based, growth-\noriented tax relief that help all taxpayers.\n  While there are many worthwhile provisions in the Finance Committee \nbill, a better approach is embodied in an amendment that will be \noffered by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. Whereas the committee bill \nattempts to spread\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nrelief among some 130 parts of the Tax Code, the Gramm amendment would \nfocus on just five areas, using the surplus to finally correct some of \nthe most unfair and egregious provisions of the law.\n  The Gramm amendment would, for example, expand on the provisions of \nthe underlying bill to completely eliminate the marriage-tax penalty. \nWhat rationale can there possibly be for imposing such a penalty? All \nof us say we are concerned that families do not have enough to make \nends meet--that they do not have enough to pay for child care, college, \nor to buy their own homes. Yet we tolerate a system that overtaxes \nfamilies. According to Tax Foundation estimates, the average American \nfamily pays almost 40 percent of its income in taxes to federal, state, \nand local governments. To put it another way, in families where both \nparents work, one of the parents is nearly working full time just to \npay the family's tax bill. It is no wonder, then, that parents do not \nhave enough to make ends meet when government is taking that much. It \nis just not right.\n  The marriage penalty alone is estimated to cost the average couple an \nextra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected, \nand the cost is particularly high for the working poor. Two-earner \nfamilies making less than $20,000 often must devote a full eight \npercent of their income to pay the marriage penalty. The highest \npercentage of couples hit by the marriage penalty earns between $20,000 \nand $30,000 per year.\n  Think what these families could do with an extra $1,400 in their \npockets. They could pay for three to four months of day care if they \nchoose to send a child outside the home--or make it easier for one \nparent to stay at home to take care of the children, if that is what \nthey decide is best for them. They could make four to five payments on \ntheir car or minivan. They could pay their utility bill for nine \nmonths.\n  The Finance Committee bill goes a long way toward resolving the \nmarriage-penalty problem, and I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for that; but since we have the resources to solve it fully \nonce and for all, we should.\n  The death tax is just as wrong, and we ought to do something about \nit, too. The Gramm amendment includes the provisions of the Kyl-Kerrey \nbill, as modified by the House, that would eliminate the death tax \noutright.\n  Although most Americans will probably never pay a death tax, most \npeople still sense that there is something terribly wrong with a system \nthat allows Washington to seize more than half of whatever is left \nafter someone dies--a system that prevents hard-working Americans from \npassing the bulk of their next eggs to their children or grandchildren, \nor even their local charities. Liberal Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of Southern California, Edward J. McCaffrey, put it this \nway: ``Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on \nalcohol and cigarettes.'' ``The estate tax,'' he went on to say, ``is \nan anti-sin, or a virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without \nconsumption, on thrift, on long term savings. There is no reason even a \nliberal populace need support it.''\n  Economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell reached similar \nconclusions, writing in a 1992 study that death taxes ``have failed to \nachieve their intended purposes. They raise little revenue. They impose \nlarge excess burdens. They are unfair.''\n  In fact, 77 percent of the people responding to survey by the Polling \nCompany last year indicated that they favor repeal of the death tax. \nWhen Californians had the chance to weigh in with a ballot proposition, \nthey voted two-to-one to repeal their state's death tax. The \nlegislatures of five other states have enacted legislation since 1997 \nthat will either eliminate or significantly reduce the burden of their \nstates' death taxes.\n  Talk to the men and women who run small businesses around the country \nand you will find that death taxes are a major concern to them. The \n1995 White House Conference on Small Business identified the death tax \nas one of small business's top concerns, and delegates to the \nconference voted overwhelmingly to endorse its repeal. Remember, this \nis a tax that is imposed on a family business when it is least able to \nafford the payment--upon the death of the person with the greatest \npractical and institutional knowledge of that business's operations.\n  Although the death tax raises only about one percent of the federal \ngovernment's annual revenue, it exerts a disproportionately large and \nnegative impact on the economy. In fact, Alicia Munnell, a former \nmember of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors, estimates \nthat the costs of complying with death-tax laws are roughly the same \nmagnitude as the revenue raised. In 1998, for example that amounted to \nabout $23 billion. In other words, for every dollar of tax revenue \nraised by the death tax, another dollar is squandered in the economy \nsimply to comply with or avoid the tax.\n  Over time, the adverse consequences are compounded. A report issued \nby the Joint Economic Committee last December concluded that the \nexistence of the death tax this century has reduced the stock of \ncapital in the economy by nearly half a trillion dollars.\n  By repealing the death tax and putting those resources to better use, \nthe Joint Committee estimates that as many as 240,000 jobs could be \ncreated over seven years and Americans would have an additional $24.4 \nbillion in disposable personal income.\n  Unlike the Finance Committee bill, which leaves the death tax in \nplace indefinitely, the Gramm amendment would repeal the tax--pull it \nout by its roots. The House has already passed similar provisions, and \nthe Senate should, as well. Death-tax repeal is a must.\n  Mr. President, there are three other components of the Gramm \namendment that I will touch on only briefly. First, it would reduce \nmarginal income-tax rates by 10 percent across the board. In other \nwords, all taxpayers would see their tax bills reduced, proportionate \nto how much they pay. This is probably the fairest way of returning the \ntax overpayment.\n  Second, the amendment would index capital gains for inflation, \nrecognizing that the Treasury should not reap the benefit of \ninflationary policies.\n  Third, it would provide a full deduction for health insurance for the \nself employed.\n  Mr. President, the Gramm amendment would provide broad-based relief, \nand would do so in a way that is not only fair, but which would keep \nthe economy growing and providing a better standard of living for all \nAmericans.\n  I will vote for the Gramm amendment. If it is defeated, I will vote \nfor the underlying bill in order to get it to conference where the bill \ncould be improved. I will, however, reserve judgment about whether to \nsupport the conference report until I can see if it comes close to the \nGramm amendment or the House bill.\n  Before concluding, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street \nJournal editorial from July 27, 1999, which I mentioned at the \nbeginning of my remarks, be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Review & Outlook--Truth and Taxes\n\n       Ronald Reagan once famously noted that ``facts are stubborn \n     things,'' but that was before the Clinton Presidency. One \n     consequence of Clintonism is that facts have been irrelevant \n     to political debate, as for example in the current fight over \n     tax cuts.\n       Under the new Clinton rules, by now imbedded in media \n     coverage, it doesn't matter whether something is true; what \n     counts is whether it works politically. Thus last week \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suddenly found \n     himself hailed as a hero of the Democratic Party, allegedly \n     for trashing the House Republican tax-cut bill.\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\n     Or so the news reports said. We read his remarks, however, \n     and the truth is more interesting.\n       Mr. Greenspan: ``My first priority, if I were given such a \n     priority, is to let the surpluses run.''\n       Rep. John LaFalce (D., N.Y.): ``Thank you, Mr. Chairman.''\n       Mr. Greenspan: ``As I've said before, my second priority is \n     if you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they \n     tend to be spent, then I would be more in the camp of cutting \n     taxes, because the least desirable is using those surpluses \n     for expanding outlays.''\n       For some reason the press corps never mentioned this \n     spending caveat, as large as it is. We don't know how they \n     missed it, because a short time later the Fed chief said he'd \n     delay tax cutting ``unless, as I've indicated many times, it \n     appears that the surplus is going to become a lightening rod \n     for major increases in outlays. That's the worst of all \n     possible worlds, for a fiscal policy point of view, and that, \n     under all conditions, should be avoided.\n       ``I have great sympathy for those who wish to cut taxes now \n     to pre-empt that process, and indeed, if it turns out that \n     they are right, then I would say moving on the tax front \n     makes a good deal of sense to me.''\n       Now, also keep in mind that Mr. Greenspan is a central \n     banker. He runs monetary policy, which means he needs the \n     political running room to raise interest rates from time to \n     time. Like all central bankers, he gets irrationally \n     exuberant about deficits, which he fears could return and \n     complicate this task. Ergo, he'd prefer surpluses to pile up \n     from here to eternity.\n       Yet, if the surpluses are going to be spent, he'd still \n     rather cut taxes first. And indeed, last week Mr. Greenspan \n     repeated his belief that the revenue-maximizing tax rate for \n     capital gains is ``zero'' and that he prefers a cut in \n     marginal tax rates.\n       As it happens, last week the Beltway's media sleuths also \n     ignored some startling facts from the Congressional Budget \n     Office. CBO--historically no friend of tax-cutting--compared \n     Congress's budget proposals with Mr. Clinton's. And it found \n     that, despite its $800 billion tax cut over 10 years, \n     Congress's budget actually reduces the federal debt more than \n     does Mr. Clinton's\n       How can this be? because Mr. Clinton proposes to spend that \n     money instead of use it to retire debt, just as Mr. Greenspan \n     fears. Here's the CBO math on the Clinton proposals:\n       $111 billion for Medicare, including $168 billion for the \n     new prescription drug bribe less other savings;\n       $245 billion for USA Accounts, another political handout;\n       $328 billion for additional discretionary spending--$127 \n     billion for defense and $201 billion in nondefense \n     programs''; and\n       $142 billion for higher debt service costs because of the \n     higher spending.\n       The GOP tax cut is about $792 billion, while Mr. Clinton's \n     new spending would amount to $826 billion. In short, Mr. \n     Clinton isn't against the GOP tax cut because he wants to \n     save it for posterity. He's against it because he wants to \n     spend that money instead. Which by Mr. Greenspan's own \n     testimony last week means the Fed chief would endorse cutting \n     taxes first.\n       And, by the way, don't believe Mr. Clinton when he claims, \n     as he did in his Saturday radio address, that ``the GOP tax \n     cut is so large it would require dramatic cuts in vial areas, \n     such as education, the environment, biomedical research, \n     defense and crime fighting.'' As CBO also shows, since 1990 \n     domestic spending (not including entitlements) has increased \n     by 5% a year; that's roughly double the rate of inflation.\n       Mr. Clinton has taken to lying with such fluency that his \n     whoppers are barely even noticed. We're not optimistic that \n     anyone else will keep him honest. But we thought our readers \n     would like to know.\n\n  Mr. KYL. To reiterate, the bill includes a tax break for the \nrenovation of historic homes. That is great, if you intend to engage in \nsuch a renovation and you have a historic home. But if you don't have \nthat kind of a home, it is not going to do you much good. People with \nforeign addresses would have their frequent flier miles exempted from \nthe 7.5-percent passenger ticket tax.\n  Generation of electricity from chicken litter would earn a tax break. \nIf you are fortunate to get certain scholarship, you could be excluded \nfrom a tax. These four provisions alone, which may well have merit, \nhave a combined revenue impact of about $4 billion over 10 years--money \nI would prefer to put toward the kind of relief Senator Gramm has been \nproposing. That is why I support his amendment.\n  Let's take one of the provisions of his amendment, whereas, the \ncommittee bill attempts to spread relief. Out of about 130 different \nparts of the Tax Code, the Gramm amendment focuses on just 5 particular \nareas, using the surplus to finally correct some of the most unfair and \negregious provisions of the law. For example, it eliminates the \nmarriage tax penalty.\n  The Finance Committee proposal goes a long way toward working on that \nmarriage penalty, but it does not eliminate it. The Gramm proposal \nwould do that. It is not fair that we overtax families just because \nthey are married. The impact is estimated to cost the average couple an \nextra $1,400 a year. About 21 million American couples are affected. It \nis no wonder both spouses in the family are having to work. One, in \neffect, is working for the family, and the other is working to pay off \nthe taxes. They are upset with this marriage tax penalty. I support \nthat provision.\n  While we deal with the death tax in the Finance Committee proposal, \nwe don't eliminate it. It ought to be eliminated. The Gramm proposal \neliminates it along the lines of the Kyl-Kerrey bill. I appreciate \nSenator Gramm including our provision in his amendment. The death tax \nis the most unfair tax of all. Death should not be a taxable event. If \nyou want to tax people because they make some economic decision to \nspend money, to take money out of an account, to sell an asset, then \ntax that economic decision. They understand going in what the \nconsequences are going to be. But nobody chooses to die. Why their \nheirs should have to pay a tax because of a death is beyond most of us. \nIt brings in about 1 percent in revenue. It is not worth it. An awful \nlot of small businesses and farms, which have all of the assets tied up \nin equipment and the capital of the business itself, end up having to \nsell their assets in order to pay the taxes. The idea that it was to \nprevent the accumulation of wealth no longer works. In today's world, \nwhen you have to sell the business, you usually sell to some big \nconglomerate that then takes it over.\n\n  So the death tax is unfair. Our proposal, which in effect converts it \nto a capital gains tax on the sale of the assets if and when they are \never sold, is a much fairer proposal. It still permits the Government \nto recover some of the money, but it is not based upon the death of the \nindividual, it is based upon the sale of the asset when the people want \nto sell it.\n  There are three other components I will touch on briefly. First, it \nreduces the marginal income tax by 10 percent across the board. In \nother words, all taxpayers would see their taxes reduced, proportionate \nto how much they pay, as the Senator pointed out. It is probably the \nfairest way of returning the tax overpayment. The amendment would index \ncapital gains for inflation, recognizing that the Treasury should not \nreap the benefit of inflationary policy. Finally, it would provide a \nfull deduction for health insurance for the self-employed, something I \nthink everybody would like to see done.\n  We can afford to do those things, and we ought to do those things in \nthis amendment. I will vote for the Gramm amendment. If it is defeated, \nI will vote for the underlying bill in order to get it to conference \nwhere it can be improved. I will reserve judgment on whether to support \nthe conference report until I see whether it comes closer to the \napproach Senator Gramm has taken.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I have worked up an example that I think \ntells the story here at the end of the debate. The question is, If we \nhave a simple tax cut that cuts taxes across the board by 10 percent, \neliminates the marriage penalty, repeals the death tax, indexes capital \ngains taxes, and gives a full deduction for health insurance, what will \nit mean to your family?\n  Obviously, it is easy to take how much taxes you pay and then take \nthe 10 percent. Here is an example. Take this couple Senator Hutchison \ntalked about, where you have a teacher and a football coach and they \nare married. Together, they make $70,000 a year. Now, I know there are \nsome people on the other side of the aisle who are going to say they \nare rich. They have two children, and they might have one of them in \ncollege. If they have both of them in college, they are among the most \nfinancially stressed people in America.\n  But what would happen under this bill is that the 10 percent tax cut \nwould mean that this family--a coach and a teacher, making $70,000 a \nyear--would get an $800 tax cut; actually, it would be an $809 tax cut \nbecause of the 10 percent across-the-board cut; they would\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\nget a $1,400 tax cut from the marriage penalty elimination, meaning, in \ntotal, they would get $2,200 in tax cuts. That is roughly, I think, \nwhat working middle America is about.\n  Mr. President, I yield all my time back.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this side of the aisle yields all our \ntime back.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Gramm \namendment, No. 1405, be temporarily set aside in order for Senator \nKennedy to offer a motion relative to prescription drugs. I further ask \nconsent that following the debate time on that motion, the Senate then \nproceed to a vote on or in relation to the Gramm amendment, No. 1405, \nto be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Kennedy motion. I ask \nunanimous consent that no other amendments be in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote. I further ask consent that there be 2 minutes \nequally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the Senator from New York, on behalf of \nthe Finance Committee, is honored to yield to our distinguished friend \nand long-time colleague, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts. We welcome \nhim back to the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we now have a 1-hour time \nlimitation, am I correct, and the time is divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes on each side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n(Purpose: To modernize and improve the Medicare program by providing a \n   long-overdue prescription drug benefit, by reducing or deferring \n                        certain new tax breaks)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, moves to \n     recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with \n     instructions to report back within 3 days, with an amendment \n     to reserve amounts sufficient to provide a prescription drug \n     benefit to all Medicare recipients, in the context of \n     modernizing and strengthening Medicare, by reducing or \n     deferring certain new tax breaks in the bill, especially \n     those which disproportionately benefit the wealthy.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was indicated in the motion, senior \ncitizens deserve coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare, and it \nis time for Congress to see that they get it. This amendment presents a \nclear choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and \nunnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy.\n\n  This debate is about priorities. New tax breaks are a priority for \nthe Republicans. Prescription drugs for senior citizens are not. If \nsenior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a Medicare \nprescription drug bill today--not a tax cut bill. If senior citizens \nwere the priority, we would be debating a tax bill after we had taken \ncare of Medicare and Social Security--not before.\n  These Republican tax bills have $230 billion in new tax breaks for \npeople with incomes over $300,000 a year. They reinstate the three-\nmartini lunch deduction.\n  There are sweetheart deals for the insurance industry, the timber \nindustry, the oil industry, and large multinational corporations. But \nthere is not one dime for Medicare prescription drugs for senior \ncitizens.\n  Medicare is a clear contract between workers and their government. It \nsays, ``Work hard, pay into the system when you are young, and you will \nhave health security in your retirement years.'' But that commitment is \nbeing broken today and every day, because Medicare does not cover \nprescription drugs.\n  When Medicare was enacted in 1965, coverage of prescription drugs in \nprivate insurance policies was not the norm--and Medicare followed the \nstandard practice in the private market. Today, ninety-nine percent of \nemployment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug \ncoverage--but Medicare is caught in a 34 year old time warp--and too \nmany seniors are suffering as a result.\n  Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the \nmedicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses.\n  Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or \ndon't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the \nhigh cost of prescription drugs. Too many seniors are paying twice as \nmuch as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to \npay full price, while almost everyone with a private insurance policy \nbenefits from negotiated discounts. Too many seniors are ending up \nhospitalized--at immense costs to Medicare--because they aren't \nreceiving the drugs they need at all, or cannot afford to take them \ncorrectly. Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of \nmiracle cures for a host of dread diseases, but senior citizens will be \nleft out and left behind if we do not act.\n  The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the \nsupport of the American people, Congress is on its way to our goal of \ndoubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health. This \ninvestment is seed money for the additional basic research that will \nenable private and public sector scientists to develop new therapies \nthat will improve and extend the lives of people in the United States \nand around the globe.\n  In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion in \nresearch on new medicines and to bring them to the public.\n  These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by \npreventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All \npatients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, \nwhich is the nation's largest insurer, does not cover out-patient \nprescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities \npay a heavy price for this glaring omission.\n  Prescription drug bills eat up a large and disproportionate share of \nthe typical elderly household's income. Senior citizen spend three \ntimes more of their income on health care than persons under 65, and \nthey account for one-third of all prescription drug expenditures. yet \nthey make up only 12 percent of the population.\n  The greatest gap in Medicare--and the greatest anachronism--is its \nfailure to cover prescription drugs. Ninety-nine percent of all \nemployment-based plans--ninety-nine percent--cover prescription drugs \ntoday. But Medicare is still mired in the mid-1960s--when the private \nplans on which Medicare was modeled did not provide this coverage.\n  Because of this gap and other gaps in Medicare, and the growing cost \nof the Part B premium, Medicare now pays only 50% of the out-of-pocket \nmedical costs of the elderly. On average, senior citizens now spend \nalmost as much of their income on health care as they did before \nMedicare was enacted. And Medicare was enacted because there was a \ncrisis in health care for the elderly in the 1960s. How can we fail to \nact today, to deal with the health care crisis for the elderly in the \n1990s?\n  Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the \nelderly for health care. The average senior citizen fills an average of \neighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six prescriptions \ndaily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of $100, $200 or \neven more.\n  America's senior citizens and disabled citizens deserve to benefit \nfrom new discoveries in the same way that other families do. Yet, \nwithout negotiating power, they receive the brunt of cost-shifting--\noften with devastating results. In the words of a recent report by \nStandard & Poor ``Drugmakers have historically raised prices to private \ncustomers to compensate for the discounts they grant to managed care \nconsumers.'' The private customers referred to in this report are \nlargely the nation's mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and \ngrandfathers.\n  Despite--and to a large extent because of--Medicare's lack of \ncoverage for prescription drugs, the misuse of such drugs results in \npreventable illnesses that cost Medicare $20 billion or more a year, \nwhile imposing vast misery on senior citizens. It is in their best \ninterest, and in the best interest\n\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\nof Medicare, to design a system that encourages the proper use, and \nminimizes the improper use of prescription drugs. Substantial savings \ncan be found if physicians and pharmacists are educated on senior \ncitizen-prescription drug interactions and on ways to identify, \nprevent, and correct prescription drug-related problems.\n  Beneficiaries, too, must follow instructions that are dispensed with \nthe medication itself. Too often, we hear stories of senior citizens \nwho skimp on medicine. They take half doses or otherwise try to stretch \ntheir prescription, to make it last longer. That is not right, and it \ndoesn't have to happen. If senior citizens are confident that the drugs \nthey need will be covered, proper usage will improve, and so will the \nquality of life for senior citizens.\n  During the course of this debate, we will hear many arguments from \nthe opponents of this amendment. Their arguments are as predictable as \nthey are wrong.\n  First, we will hear that the sponsors of this excessive tax cut are \nall for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, too. They claim that even \nafter their tax cut, they still have $253 billion of surplus left. But \nwe all know that those estimates are as phony as a three dollar bill--\nand about as valuable.\n  The only way that any money is left after the Republican tax cut is \nbecause their budget pretends to cut national defense by $198 billion \nbelow the President's request--a request that Republicans say is \ninadequate. Their budget also pretends that there will never be another \nemergency appropriation--even though emergencies will cost us $90 \nbillion over the next 10 years if present trends continue. Their budget \npretends to cut domestic programs from Head Start to education to \nhighway construction to law enforcement by half a trillion dollars over \nthe next ten years, cuts that no one believes will ever happen.\n  Republicans hope they can continue to play ``let's pretend'' until \nthis reckless and irresponsible tax cut passes the Senate. But by then \nit will be too late--too late for today's senior citizens, who need \nprescription drug coverage--too late for tomorrow's senior citizens, \nwho need a solvent Medicare--too late to protect Social Security--too \nlate to meet pressing needs to educate the nation's children, support \nbiomedical research, fight crime, protect the environment, and meet all \nthe other pressing needs that are priorities for the American people.\n  This is an issue of priorities. Republicans may say that there is \nenough money left over to protect seniors. Let them put their votes \nwhere their mouth is. All this motion does is say set aside enough \nmoney out of the tax cut to provide a prescription drug benefit before \nwe vote to pass a tax bill. This should be a simple vote for any \nSenator who cares about senior citizens. Tax cuts are a priority for \nthe Republicans. Prescriptions drugs for senior citizens are not. If \nsenior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a prescription \ndrug coverage bill today--not a tax cut bill. If senior citizens were \nthe priority, we would be debating a tax bill after we had taken care \nof Medicare and Social Security--not before. If senior citizens were \nthe priority, it would be tax breaks that would get the left-overs, not \nthe elderly.\n  Republicans also say that prescription drug coverage should not be \nprovided to all senior citizens--only to the poor or those who have no \ncurrent coverage. But we heard those same arguments when Medicare was \noriginally enacted. The American people didn't buy these arguments \nthen--and they won't buy them now.\n  Let's look at the numbers. Fourteen million elderly and disabled \nMedicare beneficiaries--one-third of the total--do not have a dime of \nprescription drug coverage today. Not a dime.\n  One-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have coverage through an \nemployer--but retiree health benefits are on the chopping block as \ncompanies seek to cut costs by trimming health care spending. In fact, \nthe proportion of firms offering coverage has dropped one-quarter in \njust the last four years. No senior citizen--and certainly no 50-year-\nold looking forward to retirement--can count on prescription drug \ncoverage being there for them when serious illness strikes.\n  Seven million Americans get prescription drug coverage through a \nMedicare HMO. But that coverage is offered voluntarily--and it is often \nbeing cut back or eliminated altogether. Three-quarters of Medicare \nHMOs will impose caps on their benefits of less than $1,000 next year. \nAlmost one-third will impose caps of less than $500. The majority of \nseniors have annual drug expenses well in excess of $500. More than \n$325,000 beneficiaries will be dropped from their HMOs next year. There \nis not a single senior citizens who joined an HMO because of the \npromise of affordable prescription drug benefits who can count on that \npromise being kept.\n\n  Four and a half million senior citizens get prescription drug \ncoverage through a Medigap plan. But that coverage is extraordinarily \nexpensive and inadequate. According to Consumer Reports, a seventy-four \nyear old senior citizen enrolled in the least generous Medigap plan \noffering drug coverage would pay an average of close to $2,000 a year \nmore in premiums--on top of $1,4000 for the non-drug part of the \ncoverage--a total of more than $3,000 a year. And that is an average. \nSome beneficiaries must pay more than $9,000 a year for drug coverage \nthrough Medigap. Whatever the starting premium, it goes higher and \nhigher as senior citizens age and their need for medical care grows. \nAnyone who misses the chance to enroll in a plan offering drug coverage \nat age 65 never gets another chance if they have any health problems.\n  The only senior citizens who have stable, secure, affordable Medicare \ndrug coverage today are the very poor on Medicaid. The idea that only \nthe impoverished should qualify for needed hospital and doctor care was \npopular with Republicans more than 30 years ago when they fought \nagainst the enactment of Medicare. The American people rejected that \ncruel doctrine--and Medicare for all was enacted. Today, it is time for \nthe Senate to reject the equally indefensible proposition that poverty \nis the price that senior citizens should have to pay to get the \nprescription drugs they need.\n  A couple of Marshfield, Massachusetts vividly demonstrates why we \nneed to act now. Their plight is representative of millions of other \nsenior citizens across the country. They live on a fixed income of \n$30,000 a year from Social Security and a retirement pension. They are \nnot poor. Their income is not below 135% of poverty. In fact, it is not \neven below 200% of poverty--but it is not enough for them to afford the \nprescription drugs they need. Both have substantial medical needs, and \nboth belong to the Medicare HMO--but 19% of the couple's income is \nstill spent on prescription drugs.\n  By April, the couple had already exhausted their HMO's $150 quarterly \ncap for prescription drug coverage. The $956 cost of the wife's \nmedications for May and June will come completely out of their pockets. \nShe has been rationing her medication--not taking it as prescribed, in \nan attempt to stretch out the medicine to save money. She was a stroke \nvictim five years ago. Yet, she has to cut back considerably on her \nmost expensive prescriptions. She is having a difficult time with the \nleft side of her body, and cannot move her left arm.\n  She says, ``My muscles are really tight, and it is a result of not \ntaking my Methocarbamol, because I am trying to stretch my prescription \ndollars. We don't go out, we can't afford gas, and we have had to cut \ndown on groceries.''\n  Every senior citizen in America could find themselves forced to \nchoose between a decent retirement and the medications they need to \nsurvive. No person and no family should have to make that unfair \nchoice. This is what our amendment is all about.\n  Senior citizens need and deserve prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I would like to just reiterate an earlier point. The debate this week \nis really about priorities, and there are many of us who believe that, \nprior to moving toward any of these kinds of tax breaks, we ought to \nsecure Social Security, we ought to ensure the security of the Medicare \nsystem, and include in the Medicare system a prescription drug benefit \nprogram.\n  I have listened over the course of the past 2 days, as well as \nearlier in the year, to those who say we can afford the kind of tax \nbreaks that are being recommended. They say that we will have \nsufficient resources at the end of it in order to provide for a \nprescription drug benefit. I don't believe that to be the case.\n  Even if it were the case, I am not going to take our limited time to \ndebate how much may be left over after we deal with the Republican tax \nbreaks. I don't think there will be much, if anything.\n  But what we are saying today is rather than wait to see if there is \nanything left, let's go ahead today. We are saying that any proposal \nthat is going to\n\n\n[[Page S9674]]\n\ncome out of this Senate dealing with tax breaks is also going to \ninclude an important prescription drug benefit for the senior citizens \nof this country. That is what we are saying.\n  We say send this legislation back to the Finance Committee, and then \nwe ask the Finance Committee to report back within a period of 3 days.\n  There are a number of acceptable proposals. The proposal by the \nPresident of the United States is one that I favor. Senator Rockefeller \nand I also have a proposal that I favor. But this motion simply \nrequires the Finance Committee to come back with funds sufficient to \nprovide prescription drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries. It \ndoesn't specify one proposal over another. That is, in effect, what \nthis amendment is really all about.\n  We believe that coverage of prescription drugs is necessary in order \nto effectively upgrade Medicare to deal with modern realities. There \nare other considerations in the Medicare program that the President and \nothers have outlined which deserve consideration. But today we should \nsay that before we pass significant tax breaks, we are going to make a \ncommitment that a prescription drug benefit program be put into place.\n  It is a matter of enormous importance. It makes an incredible \ndifference in the quality of life of the senior citizens of this \ncountry.\n  Prescription drug benefits in the current system are completely \ninadequate. Those who rise to oppose it will say: Let us just have a \npartial program because there are only about one-third that have no \ncoverage. We went through those numbers earlier. Only the poorest \nseniors have affordable, reliable and adequate coverage.\n  Those with retiree coverage cannot be certain it will continue. Those \nin HMOs are being told that their coverage will be limited to $500 or \n$1,000 a year. Others are being dropped because their plan is leaving \nthe program. Seniors who can get into medigap are shelling out \nthousands of dollars a year for coverage that is inadequate.\n  Coverage of prescription drugs is an issue of life and death for our \nsenior citizens. Some would like to limit our assistance to only some \nof the elderly. Are we going to say now on this important issue that we \nshould turn Medicare into a poverty program, a Medicaid program? \nClearly, we should not.\n  There are those who say, well, Mr. President, we only have a small \ngroup that aren't covered. Let's target it at that. But every kind of \nindicator shows that coverage is declining every year for those who are \nfortunate enough to have some coverage now.\n  Our program is very clear and simple. Again, it says that this will \nbe a priority.\n  We said: Send this legislation back to the Committee. Have it come \nback to the floor with funds reserved to have a prescription drug \nprogram that is going to be worthy of its name. It says that before we \nsee the major kinds of tax breaks and tax cuts in this bill, we should \nmeet the needs of our senior citizens.\n  Every Member of this body can give chapter and verse about what is \nhappening in their communities, and about how important this is. I am \nsure that others in this body have had the opportunity, as I have, of \nvisiting a nursing home or a senior citizen gathering and asking them: \nHow many of you are paying out of your pocket for prescription drugs \n$25 or $50 or $75 a month? You see all the hands go up. You ask them: \nHow many are paying $75 a month? You will find about half to three-\nquarters of them. How many are paying $50? Half or three-quarters of \nthem. How many are paying $100 or more? You will still see many of \nthose hands in the air.\n  We are finding that many of the senior citizens are skimping on their \nprescription drugs--they take half of it or skip days--despite all of \nthe negative health implications that has.\n  It is interesting that for the five most common preventable \nconditions or diseases in the elderly, just five preventable diseases \nfor which prescription drugs are available, the Medicare system pays \n$30 billion a year in hospitalizations. Many of those hospitalizations \ncould have been avoided if those senior citizens had been able to \nafford the prescription drugs recommended by their doctors.\n  That is what we are talking about. We are going to pay for it either \non the front end or the back end.\n  This motion makes sense because it is the right thing to do from a \nhealth point of view. It is the right thing to do from a bottom line \npoint of view. It is necessary if we are going to meet our continuing \nresponsibilities to our senior citizens.\n  I would like to mention on the floor of the Senate a petition I just \nreceived from Silver Spring, MD. It is from the Homecrest House \nResident Council in Silver Spring, MD. They wrote,\n\n       We are enclosing our petition signed by most of our 300 \n     residents. We are sure that we voice a concern of our friends \n     around the Nation, seniors and disabled. We do without other \n     necessities in order to buy needed medications.\n\n  Here are the names from just one senior citizen center. Three hundred \nsenior citizens and disabled persons. They understand the importance of \nthis particular program.\n  Again, this debate is about priorities. Are we going to have tax \nbreaks for the wealthy and for special interests or are we going to \nhave the protection of our seniors?\n  Final point: I was listening with great interest to the debate on the \nother side about whether we are going to accept the House proposal. The \nfact is, that House proposal has a lot of tax goodies. There is the \nrestoration of the three-martini lunch.\n  Many Members thought we freed ourselves from the tax break for the \nthree-martini lunch back in 1993. It is back in the House bill.\n  This bill has all sorts of other tax goodies for special interests, \ntax goodies for various industries, including the insurance industry, \nthe timber interests, the oil and gas industry, for foreign tax \ncredits, and others that I think are questionable.\n  Out of all those issue that are out there, I say prescription drugs \nfor the elderly people are more important than putting into place the \ntax privileges in this bill.\n  This motion will put the Senate on record in favor of closing the \nlargest gap in Medicare. A vote to reject it is a vote to put a higher \npriority on new tax breaks for the wealthy than on quality medical care \nfor senior citizens. I know where the American people stand. It is time \nfor the Senate to decide where it stands.\n  I hope this motion will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield myself 3 minutes. I want to comment on the \nhistory that our distinguished friend, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, makes about the origins of the Medicare program.\n  He was the Senator at the time. I was a member of the administration \nat the time and was involved. A basic decision was made, and thank \ngoodness it was, that Medicare, medical assistance to the aging, would \nnot be a poverty program. It would not be dependent upon income. The \nidea was that programs for the poor inevitably become poor programs. I \nthink this has been the case over the years.\n  The second point I make deals with 1965 and the years that led up to \nit. The pharmaceutical revolution in ways began with the discovery of \npenicillin in London in the 1920s, and medications of the kind we know \ntoday have become a whole new phenomenon in medical care. There was a \ntime when hospitals were about all you could do for ill people. Now so \nmuch more can be done, principally through pharmaceuticals.\n  Indeed, if you had to make some bizarre choice between providing \nhospital care and providing the full range of pharmaceuticals, one \ncould very well choose the latter.\n  The Senator spoke of five lifesaving medications which are \nunavailable to people who instead go to hospitals where they can \nreceive consolation, but no true treatment.\n  This is a very wise and necessary motion. This Senator, for sure, \nwill support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, no one in the Senate is more concerned about Medicare \nand the program's beneficiaries than members of the Finance Committee. \nThis year alone, our committee has held a\n\n[[Page S9675]]\n\ndozen hearings looking into the needs and future of this important \nprogram. We are firm in our commitment to strengthen and preserve \nMedicare for the Americans who are now a part of the program, and for \nthose who will depend on it in the years ahead.\n  One of our areas of focus concerns prescription drug benefits, and we \nappreciate the seriousness with which the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts takes this issue. However, now is not the time and place \nto address this issue.\n  The carefully crafted bipartisan Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 leaves \nover $500 billion of the surplus for Congress to carefully weigh and \nmeet the needs and long-term viability of Medicare. In September, we \nwill turn our attention to addressing this most important concern.\n  But we should not be pressured into simply accepting something that \nrequires our most careful and studied attention.\n  Testifying before the Finance Committee only last week, Comptroller \nGeneral David M. Walker made it clear that Congress must take great \ncare as we address Medicare reform. He reminded us that Congress has \nlearned some sobering lessons about moving forward, pressed by \npolitical expediency to alter such an important program, without \nbenefiting from careful study and deliberation.\n  ``Effectiveness,'' Comptroller Walker reminded our committee, \n``involves collecting the data necessary to assess impact--separting \nthe transitory from the permanent, and the trivial from the \nimportant.''\n  ``Steadfastness is needed,'' Mr. Walker said, ``when particular \ninterests pit the primacy of needs against the more global interest of \nmaking Medicare affordable, sustainable, and effective for current and \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  This makes it all the more important that any new benefit expansion \nbe carefully designed to balance needs and affordability both now and \nover the longer term.''\n  Mr. President, Congress cannot haphazardly paste one politically \nmotivated change after another on the Medicare program and call it \nreform. We must be careful. We must be deliberate. To know how \nimportant this is, we simply need to harken back to 1988, when \nCongress--again out of politics, and in a rush--pasted together the \nMedicare Catastrophic Coverage Act.\n  Within six months of enacting that legislation, Congress and the \npeople realized the debacle, and we were forced to repeal it within the \nyear.\n  So we've been down this road before, Mr. President. A rush to \nlegislation that not only failed to serve those whom we intended to \nhelp, but that actually set back progress more than a decade.\n  There is no question that Medicare reform is necessary. And there is \nagreement on both sides of the aisle that prescription drugs for the \nelderly must be a critical component of the reform. But now is not the \ntime to address this issue. I can assure you that the committee will \ncontinue to proceed with Medicare reform as a top priority. We look \nforward to working with Senator Kennedy and others who are concerned \nabout this issue. Likewise, we will continue to give the President's \nrecent proposal careful consideration.\n  By proceeding methodically, but cautiously, Mr. President, Congress \nwill construct a reform package that is complete--one that meets the \npressing needs in the lives of the seniors who depend on the Medicare \nprogram. The amendment Senator Kennedy offers--as well as the \nPresident's prescription drug benefit, as it now stands--provides only \nlimited coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  By waiting . . . by proceeding constructively . . . and by working in \na bipartisan effort to reform Medicare, Congress will--in the end--\nprovide a more complete and lasting reform--reform that will prepare \nthe Medicare program for the new millennium.\n  This effort does not have to wait long. The Finance Committee intends \nto continue our work on Medicare reform following the August recess.\n  I fully intend to include a prescription drug option as part of the \nplan we will offer. At that time, the Senate will be able to more fully \nand carefully examine reform legislation. This will be in the long-term \ninterests of everyone.\n  I compliment Senator Kennedy on his continuing commitment in \naddressing social needs, but now is not the time to move on it.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, 5 minutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the privilege \nof the floor be granted to David Doleski, a fellow in my office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from \nDelaware, he said about four or five times, ``in the long term.'' That \nis not good enough. The long term is not good enough. When I am in \nMinnesota, and I travel the State, no matter where I go, in town \nmeetings, there is a huge turnout of older citizens, of senior \ncitizens. In my State of Minnesota there are probably about 800,000 \nMedicare recipients, and only 35 percent have any kind of coverage at \nall for prescription drugs --35 percent. Two-thirds of elderly \nMinnesotans have no coverage; two-thirds in Minnesota have no coverage \nat all. It is not uncommon to meet someone who is spending $300 a month \non a $1,000 monthly income. Mr. President, $300 a month on a $1,000 \nmonthly income.\n  It is also not uncommon to meet with people who will tell you--\nactually not in a public meeting. People are a little embarrassed to do \nit. But if you get to meet with people individually--they cut their \npills in half. The problem is it doesn't give them half the benefit. \nActually, it can be quite dangerous. Or if they don't cut their pills \nin half, there are people who just do not take them so they can put \nfood on the table, or if they go out and buy what they need, then they \ndo not put food on the table. I hear my colleagues on the other side \nsaying ``in the long run.'' In the long run? What are we waiting for? \nWhat are we waiting for?\n  You are talking about tax cuts. I was on the floor earlier when we \nwere discussing the Gramm amendment, which I assume will be voted down. \nBut take that one amendment: 60 percent of the benefit goes to the top \n10 percent. The average tax cut for the lowest income earners, the \nlowest 60 percent, earning below $38,000, would be $99. But if you have \nan income of over $300,000, it is a $20,000 tax cut. You are talking \nabout $700 billion, $800 billion of tax cuts in the Republican \nproposal, crowding out any kind of investment like this; for example, \naffordable prescription drug costs for the elderly.\n\n  We have another amendment, the Gramm amendment, which is class \nwarfare. That is what it is. The people in Minnesota are scratching \ntheir heads saying: We would love to get some relief, us hard-pressed \nworking people, but that is not what the Republican plan is.\n  Now we have the Kennedy amendment on the floor, which I fully \nsupport, that speaks directly to the concerns and circumstances of \nolder Americans. In my State of Minnesota, this is critically \nimportant. Only one-third of senior citizens have any prescription drug \ncoverage at all. This is a burdensome cost. This is a health care \nissue. This is a public health issue.\n  What made Medicare important--it was a huge step forward in 1965--is \nthat it was a universal coverage program. When we extend prescription \ndrug benefits to Medicare, we make it a universal care program. For my \nfather and my mother, neither of whom are alive today, both of whom had \nParkinson's disease, without Medicare they would have gone under. They \nnever made any money. The kind of drugs they needed, and seniors need, \nfor Parkinson's disease--I can talk about other diseases--they cannot \nafford them.\n  I hear my good friend from Delaware say ``in the long run.'' The long \nrun is too long. We are confronted with the urgency of now. This is a \nclear choice. You are either for the tax cuts, three-martini lunches, \negregious breaks for large corporations, the vast amount of the money \ngoing to the highest income citizens, exploding the debt over the next \n10 years and then the next 10 years it gets worse; or why don't we be \nfiscally responsible? Why don't we pay the debt down, make sure we \nsupport Social Security and Medicare, investment in our children, and \nwhen we support Medicare, the best thing we could\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\ndo would be to make sure there is prescription drug coverage for \nelderly Americans.\n  I hope there will be 99 or 100 votes for this amendment. There should \nbe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the amendment \noffered by my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts. The Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has introduced an amendment which suggests we set \naside this bill, recommitting it to the committee of jurisdiction, so \nthey will incorporate funding for a new prescription drug benefit in \nthe existing Medicare program.\n  I have several points to make. First of all, I think most important \nis that the Senate, this very body, has already set aside funds for \nMedicare modernization. This has now become a familiar chart on the \nfloor of the Senate, but I think it is very important. It goes right to \nthe heart of why this amendment should and hopefully will be defeated \ntoday. This is the plan. The U.S. Congress' use of the surplus, the \nalmost $3.3 trillion surplus: Debt reduction, $1.9 trillion; tax cuts, \n$792 billion. We talked about that. But what is most important for this \nparticular amendment is the $505 billion that is set aside over the \nnext 10 years to specifically address issues such as Medicare \nmodernization, including things such as the prescription drugs, which \nI, as a physician, believe is very important that we address as we \nmodernize, strengthen, and bring Medicare up to date.\n  Let me repeat: The Senate, this very body, has already set aside \nfunds for Medicare modernization, including prescription drug coverage.\n  First, what have we done? How can I say that with such determination? \nThe congressional budget plan has $505 billion over 10 years. Very \nspecifically, we say it again and again and again; it is for domestic \npriorities. That money is set aside, aside from the tax cuts, the tax \nrelief, and the debt reduction.\n  No. 2, the Senate has already specifically, in a reserve fund, set \naside $90 billion, in a reserve fund, for long-term Medicare reform. \nAgain, I refer people to April 15, the day we passed in this very body \nthe concurrent resolution for the year 2000, in section 203, reserve \nfund for Medicare. We lay it out. The charts are in the back, in terms \nof coming up with the $92.4 billion over 10 years.\n  No. 1, $505 billion is set aside for such things as Medicare \nmodernization; No. 2, we specifically set aside $90 billion for \nMedicare modernization in a reserve fund, which I quoted from.\n  No. 3, in the President's very plan, which he introduced a couple of \nweeks ago, the net cost of the coverage, he said, for prescription drug \ncoverage, was $46 billion for 10 years. That $46 billion is much less \nthan the $90 billion we have already put in our reserve fund and is \nonly a tenth of the $505 billion we set aside, but we do it right. We \nhave a real plan. We do not do it piecemeal. We modernize, update, \nbring to life a system that was very good for 1965, 1970, 1980, 1990, \nbut it is not good for the year 2000, 20005, 2010, specifically when \nthe demographic shift hits, when we have a doubling of the number of \nseniors when we go forward. That is the framework we set forward, and \nit is what we need to address.\n  Our job, our challenge now that we have the money set aside --we do \nnot need to recommit it, send it back for more dollars and cents--is to \nfix the system inside this framework, and we do it in three ways. We \nneed to modernize Medicare benefits, bring it up to date. The 1965 car \nis not up to today's standards and we can modernize it. We \ndemonstrated, through a bipartisan plan, the Medicare Commission--I \nwill come back to what we actually said. We need to modernize. No. 2, \nwe need to strengthen our Medicare commitment, our commitment to the \nseniors, the generation of today, the future generation--we need to \nmake sure we can fulfill that commitment. And No. 3, the issue of \nprescription drugs.\n\n  Shortly after I came to the Senate, about 5 years ago, I had a \npatient who was a transplant patient, somebody whom I transplanted. \nWhen I was running for reelection, he was 64 years of age. When I \ntransplanted him, he was about 62. When I was elected in 1965, he had \nMedicare. He had to give up his private plan. His private plan did \ncover prescription drugs. When he got to be 65, because we do not have \na modern Medicare program there today, he had to give that up.\n  What we need is a system that doesn't only focus on prescription \ndrugs but modernizes the overall program to match individual patients \nin a system which values choice, values freedom with those specific \nneeds. That is what we set out to do in the Bipartisan Commission.\n  We need to strengthen our Medicare program so it will be there. We \nall know most young people today do not believe Medicare will be there \nfor them. We need to make sure that it is.\n  Prescription drugs for our seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities--again, somebody with diabetes is going to be on \nprescription drugs later. Someone with chronic heart disease or \ndebilitating arthritis needs prescription drugs. It shows the \ninadequacy of our Medicare system today in the fact we do reimburse for \nhospital beds, we reimburse a little bit for preventive care, but not \nenough, and not anything at all for those people who need prescription \ndrugs.\n  I say this because I am the strongest advocate, or as strong as \nothers, that we must make prescription drugs a part of our proposal. \nThe Bipartisan Medicare Commission--bipartisan, Democrat, Republican, \n17 members--got together and came up with something that has \ncomprehensive Medicare modernization and reform, of which prescription \ndrugs is an integral part, to upgrade that machine which is going to be \nserving all of us someday.\n  How did we do it?\n  No. 1, we provide full Federal funding for immediate prescription \ndrug coverage for low-income seniors; that is, up to 135 percent of \npoverty.\n  No. 2, we require in the National Bipartisan Commission--I should \nsay, our recommendation was approved by a majority of the members, not \na supermajority, but a majority of members did vote for that--it \nrequired all plans participating with the Medicare program to make an \nenhanced benefit package available which includes prescription drug \ncoverage and protects seniors against unlimited out-of-pocket spending.\n\n  No. 3, in that National Bipartisan Commission, we require the medigap \nprograms--all plans--to include prescription drugs, to make those drugs \navailable in a policy. There are other prescription drug proposals out \nthere that need to be discussed and should be discussed.\n  President Clinton put a proposal on the table. That program, I \nbelieve, is inadequate for a whole host of reasons which I hope we have \nthe opportunity to discuss as we go forward.\n  It is a little disingenuous to say--and I think in some ways this \namendment at least implies that--that hard-working families do not \ndeserve tax relief today, which we have shown we can give with the \npriorities that have been laid out, until we set aside funds for \nMedicare modernization by just adding prescription drug benefits, \nbecause we have set that money aside; this body has done that.\n  The challenge before us, and the work before us, is to modernize \nMedicare, to strengthen Medicare so that it will be there for the next \ngeneration, with a focus on the patient, to make it less rigid, more \ncomprehensive, have more preventive care, have it be less costly to the \nseniors. We should be able to do that. There are solid proposals before \nus to do that.\n  Let me briefly talk about what this Medicare Commission came up with. \nAgain, remember that the majority of members supported this proposal. \nWe did not have a supermajority.\n  The four appointees by the President of the United States voted \nagainst this proposal, but a majority of members, 10 of the 17, did \nvote in favor of it. What it basically does is set up a Medicare board \nto oversee a group of plans which could be, in many ways, individually \ntailored to the needs of a heart transplant patient or chronic care \npatient, but all having the same core benefits that we have today.\n  The prescription drug coverage we proposed and that a majority of \nmembers of the Bipartisan Commission agreed to is as follows:\n\n[[Page S9677]]\n\n  Basically, prescription drugs today are provided for about 28 million \npeople. Sixty-five percent of people in Medicare today have some \nprescription drug coverage. How do they get it? Employer-sponsored \nplans, with Medicaid and Medicare--we call for both; it is called dual \neligible--and medigap insurance.\n  The proposal we came up with, and hopefully we are ultimately going \nto pass once we meet that challenge, is prescription drugs provided \nthrough employer-sponsored plans today, dual eligible today, and \nmedigap today. This group provides about 65 percent of all Medicare \nrecipients, individuals with disabilities, and senior citizens with \nsome coverage. It can be strengthened with some coverage.\n  We basically say let's supplement that, let's direct our attention at \nthe 35 percent of people who do not, and we do that through focusing on \nlow income, up to 135 percent, No. 1, and, No. 2, saying anybody who is \ngoing to come to the table and participates in a plan--Mr. President, I \nask for 2 more minutes to complete my remarks.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thus, our proposal, which we have discussed, to fix the \nsystem will supplement by offering people up to 135 percent complete \nand full coverage, a high option plan for anybody who actually comes to \nthe table.\n\n  I present all this today to make the point that, No. 1, the money, \nthe budgetary framework, has been set, has been passed by the Senate. \nWe set aside the $505 billion specifically in the resolution; the $90 \nbillion--the President's own plan costs only $46 billion, and we have \nalready addressed the problem of the money. The job of the Senate and \nthe Congress is to fix the system for the American people. A bipartisan \nproposal that is on the table is the premium support plan.\n  Let's look at other plans. Let's not drop that issue. That is \nunnecessary. Supporting the Kennedy amendment does not do that today. \nWe need to support freedom for seniors, give that freedom of choice, \nthat freedom to match specific needs with a plan. We need to address \nMedicare. We have a plan to do that. We have already set aside the \nresources to do that.\n  The political tactics we are witnessing do nothing to modernize \nMedicare, do nothing to focus on that individual patient and the \nquality of care they receive.\n  I close by saying that before 2 o'clock or in the next 2 to 3 \nminutes, I will be submitting an amendment which addresses the Medicare \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I have several points to make. The \nother side has talked constantly about we are going to fix the system. \nWe cannot do prescription drugs until we fix the system. It is a \nquestion totally of priorities. I will put a little dose of reality \ninto this.\n  No matter what my colleagues on either side of the aisle might think, \nwe are not going to reform Medicare this year on a systemic basis. If \nit happens the way the majority party wants, it is going to be vetoed \nby the President. It is not going to happen.\n  The question before the Senate on this amendment is, Do we want to \ntake the tens of millions of Americans who have no prescription drugs \nand give them the benefit of prescription drugs now through voting for \nthe Kennedy amendment, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor, or do we \nwant to say, oh, let's wait and fix the system, and then when we fix \nthe system, which may be 3, 4, 5, 6 years from now, we will do \nprescription drugs because that is sort of neat and orderly?\n  The world does not work like that. The real world of the Congress and \nthe White House does not work like that. We are either going to do tax \ncuts as they want to do it over there, or we are going to do \nprescription drugs and maybe some modest tax cuts as we want to do it \nover here. That is the choice that needs to be made.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \ntalked about catastrophic health care. He said beware of that \nexperience. My reaction is the opposite. Remember that experience as \nthe reason not to back off from making a hard choice. That was one of \nthe best bills on health care this Congress ever passed. The Senate did \nnot back off on catastrophic health insurance. Three times they tried \nto repeal it in the Senate, and 3 times we had 73 votes to defeat \nrepeal because catastrophic health insurance was a good thing for \nseniors. We did not get the message out to seniors. That was our fault. \nBut do not say beware of catastrophic health insurance. The House \nbacked off. We did not. It was good legislation.\n\n  We are here to do the right thing. The right thing is to pick between \nthe priorities. Do we want to wait 4, 5, 6, 8 years to fix Medicare \nuntil we get a bipartisan consensus? People talk about a bipartisan \nconsensus for Medicare reform. It is not here. They talk about the \nBreaux-Thomas commission, the Medicare Commission. Everybody talks \nabout the bipartisan thing. It was not bipartisan.\n  There were two Democrats who voted for it, yes, but it was not \nbipartisan. There is not a bipartisan consensus on the floor of the \nSenate today of what to do about Medicare, and there will not be one \nuntil we have some more iterations which I cannot yet explain because I \nam unable to.\n  Are we going to stand quietly by while the average senior in West \nVirginia has a gross income, from all sources, of $10,600 a year, and \nfrom which you then are to subtract $2,000, virtually all on \nprescription drugs or on medical out-of-pocket expenses, leaving that \nsenior with $8,600 a year to live all of life? Are we going to let that \nperson hang until the Senate, in its ultimate wisdom, comes to a sense \nof what is Medicare reform, and are we going to agree on it?\n  My priority is to do prescription drugs now. Pass the Kennedy \namendment. Do it now. They talk about having a $90 billion reserve. The \nSenator from Tennessee said we have fixed the problem. I am very sorry \nto say that that reserve talks about ``may be spent for,'' so it might \nbe prescription drugs, it might be disasters, it might be a whole \nseries of things, but there is no Medicare prescription drug benefit \nthat is in their plan.\n  In fact, if I could put it more boldly, under the Republican tax \nplan, there is no money for Medicare reform. There is no money for \nprescription drugs. It does not exist. I will hear arguments, and \nnumbers will be thrown back and forth, but that is the fact. It does \nnot exist. That is the reason for the Kennedy amendment--to make us \npick a priority: Tax cuts, for the most part for people who do not need \nthem or, in a very small measure, in a very small amount of money, \nprescription drugs for people who desperately need them, who do not in \nthe form of a cliche but in the form of real life, have to pick each \nweek whether they are going to eat, have heat in their homes, or have \nprescription drugs.\n\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I say to my colleagues, try to live \non $8,600 a year, as our seniors do in West Virginia. You could not do \nit. Prescription drugs are the reason the money gets so scarce for \nthem. We can solve that problem by passing the Kennedy amendment. I \nthink we have an absolute moral obligation to do so.\n  To wait for Medicare reform to be fully formed is a hoax upon those \npeople. They do not know that we do not have a consensus on how to \nreform Medicare. They do know that they are hurting. They do know that \nthey do not have prescription drugs. And they do know that some of them \ntake up to 12 drugs a day, and they cost, and it is coming out of their \npockets.\n  Medicare has no prescription drug benefits. These seniors are not on \nMedicaid; they are on Medicare. So they have nothing. So the money has \nto come out of their pocket. That is wrong in America.\n  So the question is the priority. Are we for giving those people \nprescription drugs--a modest amount of money--or are we for simply \ngoing ahead with the $792 billion tax cut and then saying, well, we \nwill just wait until Medicare is reformed someday, and then perhaps we \nwill consider prescription drugs? I think the choice is clear.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  I will be very brief and comment on the amendment of my good friend, \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I do not think there is any disagreement that we ought to have \nprescription drugs in the Medicare program. But it is interesting that \nthe recommittal motion tells the Finance Committee to report it back in \n3 days. I guess we could go over the weekend and, on Friday, Saturday, \nand Sunday write a prescription drug program and modernize Medicare and \nreform Medicare, but I doubt whether that is humanly possible, unless \nthe senior Senator from New York wants to spend the weekend doing all \nof this and finishing it up by Monday morning.\n  There is no question that there is a need for prescription drugs in \nthe Medicare program. But I say to my colleagues, that is not the way \nto fix Medicare. We have a program that is becoming insolvent. It is \ngoing broke in the year 2015. Just adding more benefits to the program, \nwithout reforming the structure of the program, is like having dessert \nbefore you eat your spinach. It is easy to add more benefits to a \nprogram. But bear in mind, we have a program that is structurally going \ninsolvent. We spend more money today than we take in. Just adding more \nbenefits, without taking the time to fundamentally reform the program, \nis not the answer.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said he planned \nto actually begin a markup in September on a comprehensive Medicare \nreform bill which will include prescription drugs, doing it in a timely \nfashion. I suggest that after that is reported out, that is the time to \nlook at how much money we need, and then pare down the tax cut, combine \nthe two, and have something that can be signed into law.\n\n  I think, obviously, we cannot do it in the next 3 days. I think the \nchairman has outlined a program that makes more sense and that I think \nis really doable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 8 minutes to Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. Chairman, fellow Senators, I did not know that \nSenator Breaux was going to come to the floor. I am delighted that he \nhas. I want to state how consistent he has been over the months by just \nputting a quote from the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, a \nDemocrat, here for everybody to see:\n\n       Medicare must not be used as a wedge issue any longer. The \n     question before this Congress is not whether to cut taxes or \n     whether to save Medicare. That's not the choice we're facing. \n     I support a tax cut, targeted, and I'm dedicated to saving \n     Medicare. It's not an either/or position.\n\n  That is from a distinguished Senator who is on the committee that \nwill do both--will reform Medicare and will write the tax laws. I give \nhim a great deal of credit because he is a man of his word when it \ncomes to these issues.\n  Frankly, it is not correct that it is either Medicare, prescription \ndrugs, reform, or tax cuts. The truth of the matter is, Senator Bill \nFrist has just showed you.\n  I hear Senator after Senator get up on that side and say there is no \nmoney for Medicare in this budget, there is no room after the tax cut.\n  Let me repeat, I went back and asked the Congressional Budget Office \nto do an analysis and assume that we froze discretionary spending. We \nput in the tax cut, we put in the $1.9 trillion for Social Security, \nand we asked them: How much money can be added to discretionary \nspending and Medicare reform and still live within the estimated \nsurplus? And they told us--$505 billion.\n  I say to the seniors in this country, I believe you have witnessed \nhere on the floor, through the good work of Chairman Bill Roth and the \nFinance Committee--I say to the seniors across America, I have seen \nthem produce a tax bill that I believe you will love because you care \nabout your sons and daughters; you care about the married members of \nyour family. This bill before us stops penalizing marriage for 22 \nmillion American families. I ask the seniors, isn't that a good piece \nof work? It makes child care more available for your grandchildren. \nIsn't that a good piece of work? It makes child care more accessible. \nAnd guess what. The President plans to veto these--all in the name of \n``we can't afford tax cuts.''\n  To be honest with you, the truth of the matter is, when you finish \nwith that Congressional Budget Office analysis, you are spending 23.4 \npercent of the surplus for tax cuts, you are putting the entire Social \nSecurity surplus aside, and you still have $505 billion to be used over \nthe next decade for high-priority items. So for those who have come to \nthe floor and said there is no money, there is $505 billion over the \nnext decade. Do you want to use $100 billion of it for Medicare? Some \nsay that is too much. The President thought $46 billion was enough. \nThat is very interesting. We still have people talking about how much \nmoney we are going to need to reform Medicare. I don't know how much. I \ntrust the Finance Committee, under the leadership of Bill Roth, to \nproduce a bipartisan bill. The President had proposed $46 billion as \nthe entire amount necessary. Remember, the chart my friend Bill Frist \nput up said there is $505 billion over the next decade.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield in a little bit. You want to ask about the \nauthenticity of my charts. I already explained it and you weren't here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I want to hear it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I heard your attack on it last night, but I was home so \nI couldn't come down here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Well, you stayed away.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me finish.\n  The President asked for $46 billion for the entire reform package on \nMedicare. What are we talking about? Holding up a tax bill that takes \ncare of the married sons and daughters of our senior citizens across \nAmerica. They have children and need all these things that the Tax Code \nprovides? They say, we just want to do anything but give them help, so \nwe will even hold up their bill, claiming we are really holding it up \nfor you seniors because we want to take care of Medicare.\n  Frankly, I have nothing but compliments for the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, because he is one who is concerned \nabout this. But I am equally comfortable in saying I am. I think \nSenator Bill Roth of Delaware is concerned about it. I think Senator \nBreaux is concerned about it. Frankly, I believe we are going to have \nplenty of money left over to fix that Medicare problem from that $505 \nbillion.\n  Now, if the Senator wants me to explain this budget, I will explain \nit right now.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is a CBO number.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The number on your chart that says CBO/Senate Budget \nCommittee, that is really a Senate Budget Committee number. That is not \na CBO number.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the truth of the matter is, we can ask \nthe Congressional Budget Office any questions we would like. We asked \nthem how much is the surplus, if you freeze discretionary programs at \nthis year's level for 10 years. They said these are the numbers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. That is CBO.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is CBO numbers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If I might ask another question. Basically, the CBO \nbaseline we are all working under, House and Senate, is the baseline \nwhich assumes that after the caps expire by 2002, spending under the \ndiscretionary caps will proceed at inflation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is not true.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is true. That is the assumption.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is not true, Senator. I did the budget resolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What you have done is, you have gone back to CBO and \nsaid, OK, let's assume that there is no inflationary increase.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is right.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Which is not CBO's assumption. But what you have done is, \nin order to show there may be, under your figures, there may be a $500-\n, $400 billion in spending, the yellow mark, you went back to CBO and \nsaid, I need to show a number, that yellow bunch there. What you did \nwas, you said, CBO----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is this off my time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just a second. You said, OK, CBO, give me a baseline that\n\n[[Page S9679]]\n\nI want you to produce. What I want you to produce is a baseline that \nshows no inflation after the year 2000 on spending caps up to the rest \nof the 10-year period.\n  If you do that, of course, you get that chart. But that is not the \nCBO numbers under which the Senate Finance Committee operated. That is \nnot the numbers under which the House operated. That is not the numbers \nunder which the rest of us operated. So that is why I am saying we are \nnot operating off the same numbers. You produced your own numbers by \ntelling CBO to produce them the way you wanted them produced.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute of the time yielded.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Roth, may I have 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. ROTH. One minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me assure fellow Senators and explain what this is. \nThis is a true assessment of the surplus in total dollars, if you \nassume that for the next 10 years discretionary spending is frozen. I \ndid that so we could find out how much new money is there, available to \nspend, because the discretionary programs are not entitled to an \ninflationary add-on. They are entitled to what we add on. If you want \nto know where their numbers came from, they came from the budget \nresolution we produced, which had $181 billion in discretionary \nspending. That was something we came up with. I asked them to take that \nout. And when they took it out, they said: Now you have this much to \nspend. You have $505 billion.\n  If you would like to certify that and ask the Congressional Budget \nOffice, is this correct, they will tell you absolutely, because we got \nit from them.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to answer questions now because I want \nto finish my argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a half minute left under the control \nof the Senator from Delaware. The Senator from New York has 5 minutes \n51 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He just yielded me a half minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A half minute has been yielded by the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever baseline anybody wants to use, there is \nroughly $405 billion above a freeze available to be spent on \ndiscretionary spending and on Medicare reform. That is all we try to \nshow in this chart. Before you start the chart, you can spend however \nmuch you want, but I decided to spend none so we could put in \nperspective how much there is that we can spend out of this surplus, \nand these are authentic numbers. They are correct, if you start with \nthat assumption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 51 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the point I am making is, those numbers \nare accurate, if you believe the assumptions behind the chart. The \nassumptions behind the chart are no increases, not even inflationary \nadjustment, for discretionary spending over the next 10 years. I think \nthat is an unrealistic assumption. And it is, in effect, a reduction of \nsome $500 billion over 10 years. If you add in the $127 billion for \ndefense, that means, in effect, about a $775 billion reduction in \ndomestic spending. So again, he is right, if you make those \nassumptions. I say those assumptions are unrealistic.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to come back to a very basic and \nfundamental concept, we believe it is as important to give assurances \nto our senior citizens that there will be a prescription drug benefit \nfor them as it is to have significant tax breaks. That is what this is \nabout.\n  Those that oppose us say they have a different conclusion, a \ndifferent priority. They think tax breaks are preferable. Then they \nmake other assumptions in terms of what is going to be available at \nsome future time.\n  I am not going to spend the last few minutes on this dispute, because \nthis has been debated over the past few days, but the Wall Street \nJournal, the CBO, and OMB have basically indicated that if we go \nthrough with the kind of tax cut that is being proposed and advanced by \nour Republican friends, there just won't be resources left to deal with \nthe elderly, the children and other priorities.\n  I say, why ask the senior citizens to wait? Why should they always be \nthe ones who have to wait? Why shouldn't we say that the Senate will \nput aside the amount necessary to afford a good benefit program on \nprescription drugs as part of this legislation?\n  We want to give them the assurance that they are going to be \nprotected. Why leave it iffy to the seniors? Why are they always the \nones left behind? That is the question. This is an issue of priority.\n  We say, if you are going to go down this road with regard to tax \nbreaks that benefit the wealthy, let's make sure we are going to \nallocate some funds for a prescription drug benefit for the senior \ncitizens and disabled persons who are on Medicare.\n  My friend and colleague from Louisiana said we can't do that over \nthis period of time. Well, they are going to have a conference on the \ntwo tax bills over the weekend. If they can have a conference on these \ntwo bills over the weekend, they ought to be able to get together and \nallocate sufficient funds for a prescription drug benefit in about half \nan hour. In the Finance Committee, we know they can do that within an \nhour. They can do it forthwith--introduce and report back with funds \nreserved for a benefit program. But we wanted to leave this up to the \nFinance Committee. This should not be a procedural issue, and it is \nnot. Those of us who are supporting it are telling every senior citizen \nthat we believe they are a priority, that their interests are \nimportant, and that their health care needs will be met. This isn't \nonly an issue for the health care of the senior citizens; this matters \nto their children and grandchildren. They have an interest in the \nhealth care of their parents and grandparents.\n\n  We ought to be able to have a Finance Committee that can report back \nallocations of resources and say a sufficient amount will be reserved \nfor prescription drugs. We will go ahead with the rest, but this is \nreserved for prescription drugs for all of those in Medicare. Let the \nFinance Committee work that process out, either as part of the Medicare \nproposal or as a separate proposal.\n  This is what this is about--priorities. It is about priorities. Those \nof us who are supporting it are giving the priorities to our senior \ncitizens.\n  Finally, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a group of \nletters from various groups that support this motion be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The National Council\n\n\n                                                 on the Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging--the nation's first organization formed to \n     represent older Americans and those who serve them--we write \n     to oppose the irresponsible tax cut proposal reported out of \n     the Senate Finance Committee and to support your amendment to \n     dedicate a portion of the tax cuts to a new prescription drug \n     benefit available to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n       We are deeply disappointed in the Finance Committee's \n     irresponsible decision to squander virtually the entire non-\n     Social Security surplus on a massive tax cut. If this \n     proposal were to become law, it would be impossible to \n     protect and strengthen Medicare for the future. Without \n     surplus or other new revenues, the Medicare program cannot \n     remain strong while adding a meaningful new prescription drug \n     benefit.\n       The Finance Committee tax cut proposal ignores the \n     impending retirement of a vast number of baby boomers. With \n     the Medicare population doubling by 2035 and a tax cut that \n     would balloon to almost $3 trillion in the second 10 years, \n     there would be no way to protect America's seniors, ensure \n     future solvency and provide adequate drug coverage. The \n     numbers simply do not add up.\n       We are also extremely concerned that such a tax cut would \n     lead to drastic cuts in domestic programs that vulnerable \n     seniors depend on. The cuts would undermine such\n\n[[Page S9680]]\n\n     Older Americans Act programs as meals on wheels, protections \n     against abuse and neglect, and home care services. The \n     proposal clearly assumes that programs like these would be \n     cut significantly.\n       The Senate Finance Committee tax cut proposals would rob \n     Medicare of the funds needed for modernization and future \n     solvency and drastically cut programs frail seniors need to \n     remain independent. This massive tax cut is bad medicine for \n     older Americans.\n       We deeply appreciate your efforts to attempt to protect and \n     strengthen the Medicare program and its beneficiaries and to \n     add a meaningful new prescription drug benefit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Firman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           National Hispanic Council on Aging,\n\n                                   Washington, DC., July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Hispanic Council on \n     Aging (NHCoA), its chapters and affiliates, enthusiastically \n     support your amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Bill \n     S1429 that allows for medical prescription drugs for those in \n     need. Elderly, of every economic means, will greatly benefit \n     from this amendment.\n       It is our hope that the proposed cuts in taxes bill is not \n     approved. Rather, that these monies are used in a more \n     productive way benefiting those in need in general and \n     elderly in particular.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Marta Sotomayor, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Nurses Association, the \n     only full-service professional organization representing the \n     nation's registered nurses through its 53 constituent \n     associations, strongly supports your amendment to S. 1429, \n     the Budget Reconciliation bill now being considered by the \n     Senate, that would direct the development and implementation \n     of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare.\n       ANA believes that enhancing the benefits package available \n     under Medicare, including a prescription drug benefit, would \n     enable beneficiaries to receive earlier, better, and more \n     comprehensive care. The use of part of the projected budget \n     surplus to pay for this benefit is an appropriate use of \n     those funds and is crucial to improving health and outcomes \n     for Medicare beneficiaries.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to continuing our work together to include this \n     amendment in the Budget Reconciliation bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Marjorie Vanderbilt,\n     Director of Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          National Council of Senior Citizens,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, July 28, 1999.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Council of Senior \n     Citizens (NCSC) is following closely the debate on S. 1429, \n     the Finance Committee tax bill. It is important that any tax \n     bill this session allows for the use of some of the expected \n     on-budget surplus to bolster the Medicare program and create \n     a universal Medicare pharmaceutical benefit.\n       NCSC, therefore, strongly supports your motion to recommit \n     S. 1429 back to the Finance Committee and to enact a \n     pharmaceutical benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. NCSC \n     believes that the Congress must use this historic fiscal \n     opportunity assure Medicare's solvency and to meet the \n     pharmaceutical needs of forty million Medicare beneficiaries.\n       We urge all members of the Senate to support your motion to \n     recommit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Steve Protulis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \n           Medicare,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of about five million \n     members and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, I am pleased to endorse your \n     amendment to the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999, S. 1429. I \n     understand that your amendment would earmark a portion of \n     projected budget surpluses to establish a universal \n     prescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n       Medicare beneficiaries spend nearly three times as much on \n     out of pocket costs as the under 65 population, significantly \n     because of the absence of prescription drugs in the basic \n     benefits package. Three-fourths of Medicare beneficiaries \n     have some chronic health problems, which require ongoing \n     treatment with prescription drugs. Many seniors do not fill \n     prescriptions or skip required doses because of cost \n     considerations.\n       It is imperative that we do not squander the opportunity \n     presented by projected surpluses. Our first priority must be \n     to extend Social Security solvency, improve and strengthen \n     Medicare, and pay down the federal debt. Your amendment would \n     modernize Medicare benefits in a way that meets one of the \n     most pressing needs for current and future seniors. We \n     support your amendment and applaud your consistent leadership \n     on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Epilepsy Foundation,\n\n                                      Landover, MD, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the Epilepsy Foundation, \n     the national voluntary organization that works for people \n     affected by seizures through research, education, advocacy \n     and service, this is to support your efforts to provide \n     funding for a Medicare drug benefit program. As the Senate \n     considers S. 1429, The Budget Reconciliation Bill, it is \n     particularly important to assure that Medicare beneficiaries \n     with epilepsy, for whom out-of-pocket expenses for seizure \n     medications can be significant, have access to prescription \n     medications at an affordable price. We also commend your \n     support for other programs important to individuals with \n     epilepsy who may face limited financial resources, such as \n     Medicaid and Social Security.\n       As baby boomers age, there will be increasing numbers of \n     age-related seizure disorders. It is estimated that 61,000 \n     new cases of epilepsy occur each year among elderly \n     Americans. By the year 2020, it is projected that one out of \n     every two people developing epilepsy will be over the age of \n     65.\n       In addition, many low-income, young, disabled individuals \n     with epilepsy are Medicare beneficiaries. For these \n     individuals, access to prescription drug coverage at an \n     affordable price is difficult.\n       I look forward to working with you to ensure that Medicare \n     beneficiaries with epilepsy can continue to afford to follow \n     their prescribed drug therapy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Eric R. Hargis,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Consumers Union supports your \n     prescription drug amendment which is consistent with our goal \n     of extending affordable prescription drug coverage to all \n     Medicare beneficiaries.\n       The need is great. The average Medicare beneficiary uses 18 \n     prescriptions each year, and average prescription drug \n     spending is projected to be $1,100 in the year 2000. More \n     than half will spend over $500. Seniors and other Medicare \n     beneficiaries suffer financial hardship because of their out-\n     of-pocket prescription drug costs.\n       Private prescription drug coverage is inadequate, over-\n     priced, and not even available to many beneficiaries who can \n     be denied coverage. Only 24 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \n     have retiree drug coverage, and this number is expected to \n     decrease. Medicare HMO coverage for prescriptions is not \n     available in all geographic areas, and has proven unreliable \n     with many HMO's pulling out of the market. Some medigap \n     policies offer prescription drug coverage, but coverage is \n     very limited and the extra premium charged for a policy with \n     prescription drug coverage is likely to actually exceed the \n     maximum benefit. Our analysis of medigap policies on the \n     market during 1998 (for 75-year-olds) found that the average \n     premium for medigap plan I, which provides at most a $1,250 \n     prescription drug benefit, was about $1,850 higher than the \n     average premium for medigap Plan C (which has nearly \n     identical benefits other than the prescription drug benefit). \n     This coverage represents extremely poor value for consumers.\n       The potential for prescription drugs to benefit those \n     covered by Medicare has increased substantially since \n     Medicare was enacted. Our nation's thriving economy and our \n     government's dramatically improved budget status make this \n     the right time to take this urgently needed step.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Gail Shearer,\n\n                                 Director, Health Policy Analysis,\n     Washington Office.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                The Gerontological\n\n\n                                           Society of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter is written in support of \n     your amendment S. 1429 to the Budget Reconciliation Bill. The \n     Gerontological Society of America, an organization of 6,000 \n     professionals in the field of aging, is vitally concerned \n     that the tax cuts as proposed in the current Budget \n     Reconciliation Bill will seriously jeopardize support for \n     prescription drug coverage under Medicare.\n       The cost of prescription drugs has increased at an average \n     of 6 percent annually and is the leading factor in today's \n     rising health care costs. This has particular impact on \n     elderly as they are more likely to be using, and even \n     dependent on, multiple prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S9681]]\n\n       I hope you are successful in convincing your colleagues to \n     support this important amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Carol A.

It is imperative that Congress both \n     acknowledge the benefit need and implement appropriate \n     budgetary policies to begin to lessen the cost burden on the \n     nation's most vulnerable populations.\n           Sincerely,\n     Shelley McLane,\n       National Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems.\n     Jeff Crowley,\n       National Association of People with AIDS.\n     Bob Griss,\n       Center on Disability and Health.\n     Kathy McGinley,\n       The Arc of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                       Area Agencies on Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, The National Association of Area \n     Agencies on Aging (N4A) supports your amendment to the tax \n     legislation currently on the Senate floor which recognizes \n     the need for a universal prescription drug benefit for \n     Medicare recipients.\n       The largest out-of-pocket expenditure for Medicare \n     beneficiaries is for drug coverage. Many beneficiaries are \n     required to pay for their own prescriptions at a time when \n     the cost of medication is rising sharply. Medicare needs to \n     be modernized to recognize the remarkable advances in \n     preventing and treating illnesses through drugs since the \n     program's inception in 1965 and N4A applauds your efforts in \n     this direction.\n       N4A is the umbrella organization for the 655 area agencies \n     on aging (AAAs) and 230 Title VI Native American aging \n     programs in the U.S. Through its presence in Washington, \n     D.C., N4A advocates on behalf of the local aging agencies to \n     ensure that needed resources and support services are \n     available to older Americans. We look forward to continuing \n     to work with you on all endeavors that promote the dignity \n     and independence of older Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Janice Jackson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        American Thoracic Society,\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy; We have learned that during \n     consideration of the Senate tax bill, you intend to offer a \n     motion to recommit the bill to the Senate Finance Committee \n     with instructions for the committee to develop financing for \n     the establishment of a Medicare pharmaceutical benefit. The \n     American Lung Association and its medical section, the \n     American Thoracic Society, strongly support your efforts to \n     move the issue of a Medicare pharmaceutical benefit to \n     forefront of Congressional activity.\n       America's seniors need prescription drug coverage under the \n     medicare program. Far too often, Medicare beneficiaries are \n     forced to choose between purchasing the drugs they need or \n     paying for food and housing. This intolerable dilemma is not \n     just a problem for a few low-income seniors. It is a chronic \n     problem being faced by middle class senior citizens.\n       While there are a number of difficult issues that must be \n     resolved before Congress can move forward with the creation \n     of a much needed Medicare pharmaceutical benefit, no issue is \n     more difficult than determining how to pay for the new \n     benefit.\n       Congress now faces a wonderful opportunity. The expected \n     budget surpluses has created a rare opportunity for Congress \n     to address one of the most glaring inadequacies in the \n     Medicare program, the lack of a drug benefit. Before Congress \n     can responsibly consider any tax cut, Congress must first \n     ensure that federal resources exist to provide prescription \n     drugs to our nation's senior citizens. Recommitting the \n     Senate tax bill to the Senate Finance Committee is an \n     appropriate first step in this process.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this process.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Fran DuMelle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Osteoporosis Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This is in support of your \n     prescription drug amendment to the tax bill.\n       The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), the only non-\n     profit, voluntary health organization solely dedicated to \n     eradicating osteoporosis, represents 250,000 members. To NOF \n     it is far more important that seniors receive the protection \n     they need under Medicare than it is for Americans to receive \n     a tax cut. First we need to protect our senior citizens and \n     people with low incomes before we provide tax breaks for \n     people of means.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Bente E. Cooney, MSW\n                                        Director of Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, virtually every major organization that \nrepresents senior citizens or persons with disabilities is in urgent \nsupport of this particular motion.\n  They know what is happening. There isn't a Member who hasn't gone \nhome and met with seniors in the state that doesn't know what is \nhappening. It is not good enough to say we care about it and we will \nhandle it some time in the future. You have a chance to handle it now, \nin the next 15 minutes.\n  We have a chance to put the Senate of the United States on record and \nsay: OK, we will work the details out now, but we are going to allocate \nthe resources for it. We don't have to do as my friend and colleague \nfrom Tennessee says--that we can wait until after 10 years and see \nwhere we are; or as our friend from Louisiana said, we can deal with \nthis some time in the future.\n  The seniors deserve better. They need an answer and they need it now. \nThey need a message from the Senate that says we hear you, we know what \nis of concern to those who have made this the great country that it is. \nThey deserve this kind of a protection.\n  There is an enormous need and incredible consequences. It is a matter \nof life and death for many senior citizens. Let us say that it is at \nleast--at least--as important to guarantee that there will be funding \nfor prescription drugs as it is for a tax benefit. Many of us believe \nit is more important, but with this motion to recommit the bill we are \nsaying it is at least as important as the tax cut bill itself. I hope \nthis motion will be accepted.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, has all time on both sides expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order against the \namendment under section 305 of the Budget Act on the grounds that it is \nnot germane.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsection of that act for consideration of the pending motion.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1405\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nreturn to the consideration of the amendment of Senator Gramm of Texas. \nThere will be 2 minutes of debate, to be equally divided.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding the filing requirement, it be in order for the manager \nto offer an amendment that has been cleared by both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is not a matter of one side of the \naisle or the other on Senator Gramm's amendment. Now for the first \ntime, we find\n\n[[Page S9682]]\n\nourselves in complete agreement with the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, that the amendment is a disaster. We don't have to \ncharacterize the existing proposal, but it is not everything we would \nhope for. That is something even the chairman would dread, and he is \nright to do so. I think we are right in a situation such as this to \novercome partisanship. It would be wicked, indeed, to join the Senator \nfrom Texas, and then where would we be? But we won't. I hope on our \nside we will support the chairman of the Finance Committee and show him \nthat we share his view of the unacceptable extravagance of the \nproposal, the amendment of the Senator from Texas, which will soon be \nvoted on.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the ranking member on the Finance Committee this \nquestion with respect to the Gramm amendment. In the course of the \ndebate, was there any discussion on what this amendment would cost--not \nin the first 10 years but in the next 10 years?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I think there was not. Were there such a debate and \ndiscussion, it would have been chilling.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is the great exploding tax cut. I was looking at \nthe very document the Senator from Texas himself distributed. It is \nclear that the marginal income tax rate cuts don't go fully into effect \nuntil the year 2008. By his own figures, it would cost $73 billion in \nthe first 5 years, and $451 billion over 10 years; and it is not \ngetting into full effect until right near the end of the 10-year \nperiod. So if you extrapolate out, you are going to have an incredible \nincrease in its cost.\n  The same thing is true with virtually every provision that is in this \namendment, with one exception. All of the others get phased in. They \ndon't take full effect until close to the end of the 10-year period. \nThen you are given these cost figures which, of course, are over the \nrange of the period. So, obviously, in the next 10-year period, these \ntax cuts are going to explode out of sight and put the Nation right \nback into the deficit box. Is that not a reasonable analysis, I ask the \nranking member?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The measure before us, which is moderate by the \nstandards of the proposal of the Senator from Texas, would cost in the \noutyears, in the second decade, $3 trillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Not that of the Senator from Texas, but the other one.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Start with the $3 trillion and think what that would \nadd.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right; exactly. It would literally explode out \nof sight.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Three trillion dollars is the Department of Treasury \nfigure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a question? \nWill the Senator from New York yield for a question that has to do with \na parliamentary procedure?\n  I wonder if he could enlighten the Senator. Perhaps Senator Roth \ncould. I thought we were under a unanimous consent to go to a vote. Has \nthat been laid aside?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We are delinquent and derelict and behind the times.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is there any way to get us back on schedule and no longer \ndelinquent and behind the times?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from California has made her point.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of time on behalf of \nSenator Gramm.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order against the \namendment that we are about to vote on under section 305 of the Budget \nAct on the grounds that it is not germane.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act for \nconsideration of the Gramm amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Congressional Budget Act in relation to the Gramm amendment \nNo. 1405. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 230 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do ask we might have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order. The \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I believe another vote is scheduled.\n\n\n                           Motion To Recommit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. There are 2 \nminutes evenly divided for the motion submitted by the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, can we have order? I will just take one \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, when the Medicare program was agreed to in 1965, it \nwas intended to provide health security for the seniors in this \ncountry. Now it still is a vital force, but there is a major element \nthat is missing, and that is the prescription drug coverage.\n  There are no senior citizens, unless they are on Medicaid, who have a \nprescription drug benefit that is reliable, dependable, and affordable. \nThis particular motion says we believe, those who support it, that as a \npart of this tax cut there ought to be set aside funding for a \nprescription drug benefit. We do not believe a tax cut has a higher \npriority than providing a prescription drug benefit for our seniors. \nBut what we do say is the Finance Committee should set aside sufficient \nfunds, and that the program can be developed later in this term. The \nmotion ensures that funds will be earmarked to provide our senior \ncitizens with a reliable, dependable, affordable prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Make such a fund part of this whole program. Do not take a chance \nthere will be some funds down the line. Do not ask our seniors to wait \nany further.\n\n[[Page S9683]]\n\n They have waited long enough. They need this; they depend on it. \nPrescription drugs are a lifeline for our senior citizens.\n  I hope this motion will be passed as part of a tax program, and that \nthere will be a designated fund available for a prescription drug \nprogram for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the time to the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion of the \nSenator from Massachusetts for several reasons. First and foremost, \nthis very body has already set aside funds specifically for Medicare \nmodernization and specifically for inclusion of prescription drug \ncoverage. The congressional budget plan has given us the figure of $505 \nbillion. In our resolution passed just 2 months ago, we have $90 \nbillion set aside specifically. The President's own proposal, his own \nproposal for Medicare prescription drug coverage, is $46 billion, much \nless than the $90 billion we have already directed to this cause.\n  We need to focus on fundamental modernization, repair of the Medicare \nsystem to include prescription drug coverage. That is something that is \nbefore us, not this issue of money just for prescription drug coverage. \nI urge its defeat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The question is on agreeing \nto the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to the Kennedy \nmotion to recommit S. 1429.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 45, nays 55, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 45, the nays are 55. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the motion falls.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1442\n\n     (Purpose: To make an amendment in the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the time in favor of this amendment will \nbe controlled by Senator Breaux for both Democrats and Republicans.\n  I commend Chairman Roth for his hard work in crafting the Taxpayer \nRefund Act. I was pleased to support that and defend it in the Finance \nCommittee. It is a carefully balanced, equitable bill that will provide \ntargeted tax relief to all Americans. It has several features that I \nwould like to point out.\n  First, it gives a generous tax deduction to millions of Americans \nwhose employers do not provide health insurance. In other words, those \nwho buy insurance through a company, but the company itself does not \npay for the insurance, this helps make that deductible.\n  Second it corrects a flaw in the alternative minimum tax which, if \nleft uncorrected, will result in the application of the alternative \nminimum tax to millions of American families who currently don't pay \nit.\n  Third, the bill contains some very important environmental and urban \nrenewal initiatives. Despite all the meritorious provisions in the bill \nof Senator Roth, I believe $800 billion in tax cuts is too big. What if \nthe budget surpluses needed to pay for these reductions don't \nmaterialize? Does any one of us believe that Congress can or should \nhold discretionary spending to nearly $600 billion below current levels \nover the next decade?\n  What about the fact that we are now in the middle of, or perhaps at \nthe end of, who knows, the longest burst of economic prosperity in our \npeacetime history? Is that going to continue unabated? Nobody can tell. \nNobody has a crystal ball that will give an accurate answer.\n  So I am simply not comfortable with rebating more than half of the \nprojected non-Social Security surplus in tax cuts. That is why, along \nwith fellow members of the Finance Committee, Senators Breaux, Jeffords \nand Kerrey, as well as a number of other moderate Senators from both \nsides of the aisle, I have joined in sponsoring a $500 billion \nbipartisan alternative tax cut amendment.\n  This bipartisan alternative is a good, solid package. It would \nprovide broad-based tax relief for middle income tax payers and \nfamilies. It would increase the standard deduction to $4,350 for joint \nfilers, $2,150 for heads of households, and $1,300 for single filers.\n  These increases in the standard deduction would have the effect of \nsimplifying tax preparation for some 9 million households. Our \nbipartisan alternative contains the historic homeowner credit that I \nmentioned earlier. That is an outstanding provision and certainly will \nbe of assistance in curbing urban sprawl.\n  If we are serious about passing a tax cut this year, I believe our \nbipartisan alternative is the right way to go. It would provide \ncarefully targeted, well-deserved tax relief to the American people but \nfor $300 billion less than either the House or Senate bills. There is \nno doubt in my mind that President Clinton will veto an $800 billion \ntax cut package, particularly one that resembles the House-passed bill. \nWhat is more, his veto will be sustained. All of that puts us right \nback at square one. All of this maneuvering could be avoided by the \nacceptance now of this sensible bipartisan alternative that is being \nproposed. I hope my colleagues will support that bipartisan \nalternative.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Breaux and yield the remainder \nof my time to Senator Breaux.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Senator Breaux and Senator Chafee have thoughtfully crafted an \namendment that offers a $500 billion tax cut. As with the alternative \nintroduced yesterday by my friend, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, Senator Breaux's amendment \ndemonstrates that there is agreement on both sides of the aisle \nconcerning the need to give individuals and families a well-deserved \ntax refund from the $3.3 trillion surplus.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Breaux, with his amendment, offers \na deeper cut than the alternative introduced yesterday, but I am \nconcerned that it still does not go far enough. It does not go far \nenough in providing the much needed relief Americans require to meet \nthe necessary and important priorities in their lives. It does not go \nfar enough to offer broad-based tax relief that will be necessary to \ngain the bipartisan support needed to pass this bill in the Senate.\n  For example, Mr. President, the Breaux amendment does not lower the\n\n[[Page S9684]]\n\n15-percent tax bracket. Instead, it simply expands it by only $2,500 \nfor individuals and $5,000 for joint returns. And this benefit is only \navailable for people who do not itemize. This means that if you take a \ndeduction for home mortgage interest you will not receive a tax rate \ncut, under this bill. Additionally, because the 15-percent bracket is \nnot reduced, the tax relief is not felt by middle-income taxpayers in \nthat bracket, nor is there a reduction for those paying taxes in the \nhigher brackets.\n  The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 cuts the 15 percent rate to 14 \npercent and broadens the 14-percent bracket by twice as much as what \nthe Breaux amendment would do at the higher 15-percent rate.\n  The Breaux amendment also falls short when it comes to providing \nfamily tax relief. For example, the Taxpayer Refund Act offers $222 \nbillion for family tax relief. The Breaux bill only provides $43 \nbillion. When it comes to providing families with the relief they both \nneed and deserve, the amendment offered by Senator Breaux is only 20 \npercent of the relief offered in our more complete package.\n  As with relief to families, this amendment also comes up short in \nproviding health care relief. Where the Taxpayer Refund Act offers $52 \nbillion in health-related cuts, this amendment offers only $32 billion, \nor roughly $20 billion less. The Shortfall can be seen in specific \nareas such as long-term care, where this amendment would not allow an \nemployer to provide such long-term care coverage as part of its \nemployee benefits package.\n  Another important difference between the Taxpayer Refund Act and this \namendment is the area of estate tax relief. We have heard eloquent and \npersuasive arguments these past two days concerning how important it is \nthat Congress provide American families with relief from death taxes. \nAnd our legislation offers almost $63 billion in relief. This will help \ncountless families save the businesses, farms, and ranches that have \nbeen built by parents and grandparents.\n  It is good for these families, and for America, as it protects their \nwork and sacrifice. Unfortunately, this amendment only contains a third \nof the relief that these families would receive from our legislation.\n  Mr. President, I compliment Senator Breaux for the work he has done \non this amendment. It certainly offers more than the alternative that \nthe Senate voted against yesterday. Like yesterday's alternative, it \nshows that there is bipartisan support for relief, but it does not go \nfar enough. It does not go far enough in the area of family tax relief.\n  It does not go far enough in the area of savings and investment. It \ndoes not provide enough health care tax relief, nor does it provide \nenough relief against death taxes.\n  As I said when I spoke against the Democratic alternative yesterday, \nthe Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 is built on the proposition that the \nincome Americans earn belongs to them; that when government sets a \nbudget and receives revenues in taxes to meet the budget obligations, \ngovernment--by the will of the people--receives what it needs to pay \nthe bills; and that when the people have given government more than \nwhat the budget calls for, well, then that money should be returned to \nthe people.\n  It's that simple, Mr. President. And with that understanding, \nCongress passed a budget resolution authorizing the Finance Committee \nto cut taxes by $792 billion over 10 years. The Finance Committee, with \nbipartisan support, met that responsibility and, as a result, has \noffered the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. What we have offered is a \nbroad-based tax relief plan that will benefit all Americans--one that \nis fair, constructive, and empowering.\n  Our plan will help restore equity to the tax code and provide \nAmerican families with the relief and resources they need to meet \npressing concerns. It will help individuals and families save for self-\nreliance in retirement. It will help parents prepare for educational \ncosts. It will give the self-employed and under-insured the boost they \nneed to pay for health insurance. It will begin to restore fairness to \nthe tax code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty.\n  These are all important goals. And, as with the Democratic \nalternative, this amendment also falls far short of accomplishing all \nthat we do with our broad-based plan. This amendment will leave many \ntaxpayers without the relief they deserve. For that reason, I encourage \nmy colleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time does not begin to run on the \namendment until the amendment is actually called up.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask for the reporting of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself, Mr. \n     Chafee, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Lincoln, and Ms. Collins, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1442.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest it is time for a reality check by Members of \nboth parties as to where we are and what we are attempting to do.\n  We in the United States in this period of time are in a very unique, \nand I would also say very unusual, position in the sense that other \ncountries around the world would love to have the problem that is \nfacing all of us in the Senate this afternoon: We are faced with a \ncountry that has a $1 trillion surplus.\n  That is a problem that most countries would love to have. It is a \nproblem because we are now faced with the question of what we are going \nto do with a $1 trillion surplus. Some have said all of it should be \nused in the form of a tax cut and given back to the American people. We \ncan argue about how they do that. But, for the moment, let's just say \nthey have decided all of it should go for a tax cut. Some on my side of \nthe aisle say, no, we can't do that. It should be a very small tax cut, \nand the rest should be reserved for other functions of Government.\n  I point out to my colleagues what I think the rest of the American \npeople already fully realize. They know if the proposal on that side of \nthe aisle--an $800 billion tax cut--should pass and get sent to the \nPresident, it is clearly going to be vetoed, and nothing will result \nfrom this other than a debate. We will end up with nothing more than a \npolitical argument to make against each other. If we pass the \nRepublican bill, and it ultimately goes to the President, there will be \na big ceremony in the White House where he will veto that piece of \nlegislation. He will then have a powerful political argument to say the \nRepublican Party has wasted the trillion dollar surplus. There are some \non the Republican side of the aisle who will say that is a great \nargument. The White House and administration will blame the Republicans \nfor wasting the trillion dollars and giving an unnecessary and \nunrealistic tax cut that is targeted to the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. That is a great argument for us.\n  While the political parties may have a short-term political gain, I \nsuggest that the real losers, if this is what is going to happen, are \nthe American people because they end up with nothing --no tax cut, no \ndecision on how to spend the surplus, with no money being allocated to \nreal Medicare reform, and no pressure to continue to work on a Medicare \nreform program.\n  I suggest there is a different way we can look at this problem \ninstead of a political opportunity. We can look at it as a policy \nopportunity to do something realistic, and that is what the amendment \nbefore this body does.\n  It is a $500 billion tax cut that is targeted to people who really \nneed help in this country. There are some arguments that say the polls \ntell us the people don't want any tax relief. If you explain it \nproperly when you go back, people do need help. People in the middle-\nincome brackets would like to have\n\n[[Page S9685]]\n\na greater standard deduction than they have now. People on the edge of \nbeing kicked up into the 28-percent bracket would like to stay in the \n15-percent bracket and work harder and earn more for their family. \nPeople would like to see more tax assistance for education and help for \nthe 43 million Americans who work every day and can't afford to buy \nhealth insurance because they work for a company that doesn't provide \nthem health insurance. We have carefully tailored the $500 billion to \nhelp those people.\n\n  Our legislation helps people buy health insurance. It helps people \navoid the ridiculous marriage penalty by eliminating it and increasing \nthe standard deduction. That is a tax policy that should have an \nopportunity to become law, because while we spend $500 billion over the \nnext 10 years to help people who need help the most, we also reserve \n$500 billion for other priorities of Government, to do something on \nMedicare, which needs to be reformed. The chairman says we will do \nsomething in September, and that is a very courageous position to take. \nBut there will be money to pay for what is needed for Medicare. There \nwill be a $500 billion pot of money to go to cover the very necessary \ndiscretionary spending needs in this country.\n  So we are offering something, according to a reality check, that has \nthe potential to become law as opposed to being merely a political \nstatement on both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, people in both \nparties have taken the position: It is my way or no way.\n  We were sent here not to do political statements and take political \npositions only, but to work together to resolve differences and come to \nan agreement on public policy. I happen to think public policy is good \npolitics. But good politics is not necessarily good policy. We have a \nchoice today, in the next couple of hours, to determine whether we are \ngoing to be interested in good politics in the short term, or whether \nwe are going to try to work together to reach an agreement that can \nbecome law and become policy for the American people.\n  There are very few things in life that are either all one way or the \nother way. Anybody who has been around for a short period of time knows \nthat. Certainly, when we are discussing what to do with $1 trillion, \nthere are a lot of good ideas. But we have to conclude that neither \nside is completely right. There has to be a blend of different ideas \nand philosophies in order to come together in a democracy and reach \nsomething that can become law and, ultimately, good public policy. Then \nthe argument will be over success, as opposed to an argument over \nfailure. The track we are on now leads us to go back and tell our \npeople it was their fault that nothing was done. That is arguing over \nfailure as opposed to arguing about success and who was able to bring \nthat to the American people.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I was listening to my colleague, Senator Breaux from \nLouisiana, and I want to respond to what he said because he said it--\nlike he says everything--very well, regarding the whole question of \nreality tests and good politics versus good policy.\n  I speak against this amendment, not for the sake of good politics but \nfor the sake of good policy. I speak against this amendment \nunderstanding that reality test, as I think about the lives of people \nin our country. I want to say one more time on the floor of the \nSenate--and I have said it a couple of times--that I do not understand \nthis kind of bidding war on tax cuts. I understand very targeted tax \ncuts to those citizens who need it the most. I understand very targeted \ntax cuts that speak to the concerns and circumstances of hard-pressed \nworking families. But I think the vast majority of people in the United \nStates of America--and I think this is the meaning of the poll about \ntax cuts--are saying this: You all are sort of--I don't know what the \nword is--trying to pander to us and you have this argument that you \nhave made for years--I am not saying all colleagues for this amendment \nhave made this argument for years, but it goes something such as this: \nThis money belongs to the people, and we are going to give it back to \nyou, whatever there is in surpluses, which, of course, is all based \nupon assumptions we make. And, hopefully, these assumptions will be \nborne out about economic performance.\n  I really think the vast majority of people in Minnesota and the vast \nmajority of people in the country are saying this belongs not to us but \nto our children and grandchildren, and whatever you have by way of \nsurpluses--now we are focusing on the non-Social Security surplus--put \nit into reducing the debt to get the debt off the backs of our \nchildren. Make sure there will be Social Security and Medicare for our \nchildren and our grandchildren as it has been there for us; and, \nfinally, make sure that our children and grandchildren are going to \nhave the same opportunities we have.\n  We can't do that. I came to the floor the other day and said about my \nown party's proposal at $300 billion--$200 billion less than $500 \nbillion--that we can't do all of that and have these tax cuts to the \ntune of $500 billion at the same time. It doesn't add up.\n  To use the old Yiddish proverb, ``You can't dance at two weddings at \nthe same time.''\n  If you look at the non-Social Security surplus, three-quarters of it \nis based upon cuts or the caps in domestic spending.\n  We say we are concerned about veterans' health care, we want to have \ncommunity policing, we want to have environmental cleanup, we certainly \nwant to make sure we deal with what is becoming a crisis of affordable \nhousing, and then all of us are forever and ever and ever talking about \nchildren and education. We talk about all those people who do not have \nany health insurance. We talk about prescription drug benefits for the \nelderly. How are we going to do all of that at the same time that we \nare going to have $500 billion of tax cuts? We are not.\n  With the Democratic proposal the other day on the floor with $300 \nbillion of tax cuts, we were still several hundred billion dollars \nunder where the caps take us. In other words, we were several hundred \nbillion dollars--I think close to $300 billion--short of making up the \ncuts in discretionary spending. With the $500 billion it is worse.\n  I want to know where the give is going to be.\n  In all due respect, as I look at the pattern of our powerlessness in \nAmerica today, it is a very distorted pattern of power. I know the \nPentagon will get its resources. I know we will make sure that we \ninvest in transportation.\n  I can just imagine with the squeeze on--that is exactly what you are \ngoing to have, deep cuts in discretionary spending for a decade, and \nthen God knows where this takes us in the next decade--what is going to \nbe cut.\n  We are going to go from 1 percent Head Start funding--pre-3-year-\nolds, Early Head Start funding--to less than 1 percent. We are going to \ngo from 40 percent, or a little over 40-percent funding for Head Start, \nages 2 to 5, to less than 40 percent. We are going to go from barely \ncovering 20 percent of affordable child care needs for low-income \nfamilies--much less moderate income and much less working families--to \nless than 20 percent.\n  That is the problem with this amendment.\n  My colleague from Louisiana said it is a compromise. It is a reality \ntest. It is a compromise between the political center of gravity of \nwhere Republicans are and where Democrats are, but it is not based upon \nwhere I think the political center of gravity is in the country. I know \nthat sounds presumptuous. Maybe it even sounds arrogant. I swear that I \ndon't mean it to be. But I really believe the vast majority of people \nin our country are for tax cuts that are very targeted, that speak to \nthe concerns and circumstances of really hard-pressed families, and \nthey want to see the rest of us deal with Medicare. They want to make \nsure we have Social Security, and people want to see some investment in \nour children. They want to see opportunities for children in this \ncountry. We can't do it with this.\n\n  We have several hundred billion dollars more--well over $300 billion \nmore--of cuts in discretionary spending if we go for their $500 billion \npackage. Where are we going to cut? You mean to tell\n\n[[Page S9686]]\n\nme that now we are putting a straitjacket on ourselves and boxing \nourselves in such a way that we are not even going to be able to make \nany of these kinds of investments in health, skills, intellect, and \ncharacter of our children? We are not going to be able to it.\n  I don't see this as being any kind of reality test amendment. I think \nthis is not at all based upon where most people in the country are. I \ndon't think it is based upon what we have to do as a nation.\n  I think in the next century we have to grow together. I think in the \nnext century, by the year 2030 or 2040 or 2050, we have to make sure \nthe next century belongs to our children and our grandchildren. We have \nto make sure they get the best education. We have to make sure they \nhave the best skill development. We have to make sure they are healthy. \nWe have to make sure they are productive. We have to make sure there is \nless violence in their lives; that they grow up to be independent, \nresourceful, self-reliant, morally responsible and democratic citizens. \nThat is what we ought to be doing with whatever kind of surplus we \nhave.\n  We certainly shouldn't be supporting a proposal with $500 billion of \ntax cuts that will crowd out all of that investment, especially when it \ncomes to the most vulnerable citizens in our country.\n  I hope this amendment will be voted down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I would like to thank my colleague, \nSenator Roth, for his management of this bill and for bringing this \nbill to the floor of the Senate. I am going to talk preliminarily about \nthe bill.\n  First, let me say to our colleagues who are offering the $500 billion \nsubstitute that I compliment them for the fact that they are trying to \nwork to reduce taxes. I think that is important. There are several \nprovisions they have in their bill that I compliment them for.\n  Most of all, I want to talk about the bill that is before us, the \nbill as reported out of the Finance Committee by a vote of 13-7. That \nwas a bipartisan vote. I think that is important.\n  Again, I think that happened in large part because of the Senator \nfrom Delaware and because of the content of the bill. I think that \nmaybe we spent too much time talking about numbers. Maybe that is \npartly my fault. I like talking about numbers. We have a $3 trillion \nsurplus. We are going to give a tax cut of $782 billion. That is about \n25 cents on the dollar.\n  We are going to take two-thirds of the surplus and use that for debt \nretirement. That is good.\n  Some people say: Wait a minute. You are not reducing the debt enough. \nWe reduced the debt more than Clinton's proposal. Maybe that is good. I \nthink that is probably good.\n  Concerning the tax cut and total of the estimated surplus: Some \npeople may say: Maybe the estimates aren't right. Maybe they are too \noptimistic. And even though we are only taking one-fourth of the \nsurplus and allowing people to keep it, they don't want to give it back \nto the taxpayers. They'd rather spend it.\n  Well, that is not what a tax cut is. A tax cut let's people keep more \nof their money. They do not have to get it back from Washington, DC. Is \nit their money, or is it Washington's money? It is their money. Is it \nnot a gift from us. We are taking it from them right now. In some cases \nwe are taking too much. In some cases the taxes we are taking from \npeople are unfair.\n  I am going to talk about that because the bill we have before us \nalleviates some of those problems. It doesn't solve all the problems, \nbut it alleviates some of the problems. Is it the best bill imaginable \nand perfect? No. But it does go a giant step toward eliminating \ninequities and injustices in the tax bill. I say ``injustices.'' There \nare some cases in the 1999 Tax Code where the taxes are unfair.\n  It is absolutely unfair for a married couple to have to pay more \ntaxes than if they were living together and unmarried. It is unfair to \nhave a tax penalty for being married--absolutely unfair. That is in the \nTax Code today.\n  The bill of the Senator from Delaware eliminates that. We want to get \nrid of it.\n  Unfortunately, that doesn't happen under the Democrats' proposal. Let \nme talk about that for a second.\n  Somebody says: Well, you eliminate the marriage penalty. What does \nthe House do? The House basically doubles the exemption for single \npeople and for couples. That is one way of taking care of the \nexemption. But it doesn't eliminate the fact that a lot of people have \ncombined incomes that push them into higher income brackets.\n  For example, an individual with a taxable income of $25,000 is taxed \nat 15 percent. Anything above that, they are taxed at 28 percent. That \nis kind of simple.\n  Let's say you have two teachers who are married, and they have a \ntaxable income of $25,000. If they file as individuals, they are both \ntaxed at 15 percent. If they are married, their combined income pushes \nthem into a 28-percent tax bracket. They are penalized.\n  It just so happens, as it works out, that in this case they are \npenalized $1,400.\n  Where did I get that?\n  They have a combined income of $50,000. A 28-percent tax bracket \nactually kicks in at $42,000. They have $8,000 that is taxed at a 14-\npercent rate. It is higher than what somebody is paying at the 14-\npercent rate. Senator Roth's bill moves the bottom rate from 15 to 14.\n  The difference between 28 and 14 is 14 percent. Fourteen percent \ntimes the number of thousands, if it is $10,000, that is $1,400.\n  This hypothetical couple pays an additional $1,400 more per year for \nbeing married. We shouldn't penalize them for that.\n\n  In the bill each couple has the option of being taxed individually. \nIf one member of the couple is taxed at 28 percent, fine. It doesn't \nmean the next spouse has to be taxed at that rate as well. Maybe the \nincome of that spouse, male or female, might be significantly lower. It \nwould be taxed at a lower rate. Why tax them at the highest rate? We \nshouldn't do that. We eliminate that in this bill. That is not \ninsignificant.\n  The example I gave was a $1,400 differential. CBO says the average \nmarriage penalty is $1,400. We should be able to eliminate that, and we \ndo eliminate it in this bill. Who benefits? Nineteen million married \nreturns would have that inequity eliminated. That is in this bill.\n  Let me talk about the 14-percent bracket expansion. I wasn't \nparticularly fond of this idea. I thought, why move the 15-percent rate \nto 14 percent? What does that mean? Somebody asked me the other day on \na radio show: What does that mean to me as a taxpayer? It means we have \na benefit for all taxpayers. Any taxpayer will benefit. How much do you \nbenefit? Individuals, up to $250; and a couple, $430.\n  Therefore, a couple who makes up to, I think, $48,000 receives a $430 \nbenefit. Somebody said the tax benefit in the bill is only 50 cents a \nday. Their numbers are not adding up. The benefit of that is $430 a \ncouple.\n  I will touch on the bracket expansion. I want to compliment our \ncolleagues on the pending amendment. They expand the 15-percent bracket \nup. We have that in this bill, too, under the pending bill authored by \nChairman Roth. We expand the 15-percent bracket. That means a lot of \npeople who are paying 28 percent will pay 15 percent. We increase that \nby $5,000 per couple or $2,500 for an individual. That means a couple \nwill save $700. If they have a combined income of $42,000, we save them \n$700 by reducing the rate from 15 to 14. For a couple earning $40,000 \nor more will save $1,130 under the bill. That is almost $100 a month.\n  I use the test sometimes of my son and his wife. He sells cars, and \nshe is a schoolteacher. They have one child. How will this benefit \nthem? From those two provisions alone, they will save almost $100 a \nmonth in taxes, and they are a middle-income, tax-paying family. I \nthink that is a good provision. When combined with marriage penalty \nrelief, the average married couple will realize significant savings \nthrough this bill.\n\n[[Page S9687]]\n\n  For instance, those items together come to $1,100 just in the rate \nreduction and the expansion of the 15-percent rate. Then there is \n$1,400 savings in eliminating the marriage penalty. Now we are talking \nabout $2,500 per year for a married couple making $40,000, $50,000, or \n$60,000 a year. That is not insignificant. That is $200 a month.\n  We are helping a lot of people. The number of people who would \nbenefit from expanding the 15-percent rate upwards, so they don't have \nto pay 28 percent, is a reduction of 13 or 14 percent --13 percent by \nthe substitute offered and 14 percent by Chairman Roth's proposal. \nChairman Roth's proposal says to individuals in that category, we are \ngoing to cut their rate in half for that additional $5,000. That is a \nsignificant savings. Add that all together, and we are talking about \n$2,500 for a couple who make $40, $50, or $60,000. That is not \ninsignificant.\n  Mr. President, 98 million people will benefit from the reduction in \nthe 15 to 14 percent income bracket, 80 million who have incomes less \nthan $75,000. In other words, it is a tax cut for taxpayers, not \nnecessarily targeted the way as some others might like, but it is a tax \ncut that is weighted on the lower end of the tax schedule.\n  Moving the 14-percent bracket up, 36 million middle-class people will \nbenefit from that provision; 19 million married returns will benefit \nfrom elimination of the marriage penalties.\n  Then there is something else that hardly anybody is talking about. We \nhave a provision that eliminates the penalty called alternative minimum \ntax that disallows a lot of the tax credits we have already passed. In \n1997 we passed a tax credit, $500 per child. It was $400 last year, \n$500 this year. That is law. I know a lot of the people arguing against \nthe Republican tax bill didn't like it when we passed that in 1997. I \nhad an appearance last night with Gene Sperling, and he said the \nPresident supported the $500 tax credit for a child.\n  Maybe a little history would be in order. The President campaigned \nfor it in 1992, and he forgot about it in 1993 when he raised taxes on \nall Americans. Not only did he forget about it, but he did a tax \nincrease rather than a tax cut. It wasn't until 1995 that the $500 tax \ncredit passed again. That was when Republicans took control. We passed \nthe bill, and the President vetoed it. We passed it again in 1997, and \nhe signed it. Now they are trying to take credit for it. They didn't \nwant a tax cut in 1995, they didn't want a tax cut in 1997, but we gave \nit to him and he signed it. Now that is law.\n  Because of AMT, a lot of people are not able to take full advantage \nof that tax credit or child care tax credit--13 million families, and I \ntell my colleagues that number is growing every year. Senator Roth's \namendment has significant relief. My colleagues will be interested to \nknow that is $96 billion. Over one-tenth, about 12 percent, of the \nentire tax bill is targeted toward AMT relief on American families. I \nhave not heard anybody talk about it. If anybody thinks that provision \nis wrong, offer an amendment to strike it out.\n  If anybody thinks the marriage penalty provision, which is $112 \nbillion--again, probably about 15 percent of this entire package--is \ntoo generous, if Members don't think we should have marriage penalty \nrelief, offer an amendment and take it out. If Members don't think we \nshould cut the rate from 15 percent to 14 percent--which is $298 \nbillion, which is the biggest provision in this entire bill, which is \nthree-eighths of the entire bill--if Members don't think it should be \nin there, take it out. I would oppose any such amendments, because \nthese provisions are at the heart of this legislation and are what make \nthis bill a tax cut for taxpayers on the lowest end of the ladder.\n  A lot of people say the Republican package is a tax cut for the rich. \nIt is not. Those people have not read the bill. This bill reduces taxes \nfor all taxpayers, including people at the lowest end of the economic \nladder.\n  The provisions I discussed are $506 billion out of $792 billion. That \nis over five-eighths of the bill I have already described. I haven't \nheard anybody single out any of those sections and say: that is a bad \nprovision, we shouldn't have that provision.\n  Let me discuss a couple of other areas in this bill and why we should \npass the bill. Let me talk about estate taxes. A lot of people are not \naware of how the amendment of the Senator from Delaware works. It \nreplaces the unified credit with an exemption. Most people say: What in \nthe world are you talking about? Unified credit, under the existing \nsystem, says we will credit you so much in taxes, and you don't have to \npay; but above that, you start paying taxes at whatever rate it is. It \nmeans if you have a taxable estate, once you start paying taxes, you \nstart paying taxes at a 39-percent rate. If you have a taxable estate \nof $1 million, 39 percent goes to the Government.\n  What we do by replacing the unified credit with an exemption is, once \nyou run out of the exemption, you start paying taxes at the lowest \nrate, which is 18 percent. That is a big difference. That is a big \ndifference for estates that are barely taxable. So, if you are over the \nexemption amount--the exemption amount today is $650,000--and you don't \nhave to have a lot of property or a lot of wealth to have an estate of \n$650,000, if you get above that, your tax would be 18 percent instead \nof 39 percent. That is a big difference, and I compliment the chairman \nfor doing it.\n  Frankly, I would like to eliminate the estate taxes and have the \ntaxable event not be death but when the property is sold. Senator Kyl \nand others have been advancing that. I think that is an excellent idea. \nYou should not be taxing somebody because somebody dies. You should tax \nthem when that property is sold. If the people who receive the \nproperty, the beneficiaries, the family, if they want to keep the \nbusiness and keep the business operating and running, great. If they \nwant to sell the business, tax it as a capital gain and tax it at the \nold valuation, at whatever escalation has been in the market value. \nThat is the capital gain. That is what the taxable event should be, \nwhen the property is sold--not because somebody dies.\n  Again, the chairman's provision, exchanging the unified credit for an \nexemption, is a giant step towards, basically, bringing about some \nrelief in estate taxes which I think is critically important. If you \nbelieve, as do I, in family-owned businesses, if you believe the \nGovernment is not entitled to take over half of people's property just \nbecause they pass away then you should support this bill. Somebody said \nearlier this provision in the bill only benefits the wealthy. I \ndisagree strongly with that statement.\n  My father, unfortunately, passed away when I was pretty young and we \nhad a family-owned business, Nickles Machine Corporation, in Ponca \nCity, OK. We had a significant dispute with the IRS for 7 years about \nthe valuation of this company. The IRS said: We think it is worth a \nwhole lot more and we want you to pay a lot of taxes. My mother did not \npass away; my brothers and sisters did not pass away--just my father. \nAnd he was second generation in this business. Yet the Government said: \nWe want a chunk of it.\n  The estate tax rate today says any estate over $3 million, they want \n55 percent. Why in the world would the Federal Government be entitled \nto take over half of what somebody worked his or her entire life for \nbecause somebody passed away?\n  One of the changes we made in 1981, it has been seldom noticed, but \none of the great changes we made, we eliminated the inheritance tax \nbetween spouses so surviving spouses do not have to pay a dime of \ninheritance tax. That is a positive change. I was here and had a little \nsomething to do with it, and I am very pleased we made that change.\n  But it isn't enough. Now, even though we have made that change, when \nthe surviving spouse passes away and you have a taxable estate of $3 \nmillion--maybe it is a manufacturing company, maybe it is a farm or \nranch, maybe it is a restaurant, and it happens to be worth $3 \nmillion--the Federal Government comes in and says: We want half. I \nabsolutely think that is wrong. That is one of the many reasons why I \nthink we need a tax cut today. That is one of the reasons why I think \nwe need a greater tax cut than the alternative proposed by our \ncolleagues that would provide $500 million. I note the estate tax \nrelief they have in their provision----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask an additional 10 minutes on the amendment.\n\n[[Page S9688]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Looking at the provision offered by our colleagues, in \nthe substitute they have $19 billion of estate tax relief and the \nestate tax relief offered by the underlying proposal is $63 billion. So \nit does a lot more in estate tax relief in the chairman's bill than \nwhat is offered in the substitute.\n\n  I happen to believe in estate tax reform very strongly, and not \nbecause it benefits the wealthy. I happen to believe it is a matter of \nfundamental fairness and freedom. People should be able to work their \nentire life and be able to pass their property on to their kids without \nUncle Sam coming in and saying that we want half or even over half. The \nchairman's amendment helps make that change.\n  Also in the underlying bill, we increase retirement savings. \nEverybody in this room knows we do not save near enough. What we do \nunder the underlying bill is we increase IRAs over a 3-year period from \n$2,000 to $5,000. We do that in both the IRAs that are tax exempt going \nin and the Roth IRAs, into which you may put after-tax dollars. That \nmeans we are allowing people to put in more money to save for their own \nretirement.\n  The $2,000 limit goes back for years and has not been indexed for \ninflation. Frankly, we in Congress should encourage savings. We want \npeople to be less dependent on Government, more dependent on \nthemselves, to be able to save for their retirement. Increasing this \namount from $2,000 to $5,000 is a giant step in the right direction. \nAgain, I compliment the chairman. This provision is in his bill. It is \nnot in most of the other bills. I do not believe it is in the \nsubstitute as well.\n  Finally, I want to touch on one other thing, and that is the self-\nemployed health care deductibility. The chairman's bill says, for self-\nemployed persons, we are going to allow 100-percent deductibility. We \nhad this debate actually when we were debating the Patients' Bill of \nRights. It was included in the measure we passed on the floor of the \nSenate. I argued then if we want to increase health care access, we \nshould at least make the Tax Code equitable, and it is not equitable. \nMajor corporations today get to deduct 100 percent of their health care \ncosts; self-employed deduct 45 percent. What is right about that? What \nis right about a code that says: Self-employed person, you deduct 45 \npercent but GM or any corporation in America, you deduct 100 percent? I \nam offended by that section in the Tax Code and I support this bill for \nmaking that much needed change. I used to be self-employed. I used to \nrun a corporation. A corporation deducts 100 percent, but if you are \nself employed tough luck, you only get to deduct 45 percent.\n  Then the chairman's package also has a major expansion for people who \ndo not get anything from their employer. If they pay over half their \nhealth care cost, they get to have an above-the-line deduction for \ntheir health care expense. Again, why in the world, if we are going to \nuse the Tax Code to encourage health care, why do we not let it apply \nto everybody in America? We do not do that today. If you do not work \nfor a generous employer who subsidizes your health care, you are out of \nluck. If you are not self-employed, you are out of luck. You have to \npay for your health care with after-tax dollars. You do not get any \ndeduction.\n  The chairman's bill changes that inequity and says, yes, you \neventually get a 100-percent deduction. It phases that in, but \neventually that person gets a 100-percent deduction for their health \ncare cost as well, and they do not have to itemize to get it. All \ntaxpayers would get it. Again, this is a giant step in the right \ndirection in bringing tax equity in health care costs.\n  When we allow people to buy homes and we say you can deduct your \ninterest, we do not say you have to work for a generous employer to be \nable to deduct the interest. Everybody gets it. We are free to use the \nTax Code to encourage health care. It should apply to everybody, and \nagain, the chairman's package makes a giant step in that direction.\n  The chairman's package does many other things. It allows an extension \nof time for people to be able to deduct their student loans; it allows \na continued deduction for companies that have educational plans and \nbenefits; it has a plan to help in education; it has a plan to help in \nhealth care; it has a plan to help increase savings and retirement and \n401(k)s; it has a plan to allow people to keep more of their own money; \nit eliminates the marriage penalty.\n\n  I tell my colleagues that those are things we need which will help \nAmerican families. That is not just a tax cut for the wealthy. That is \nnot something my colleagues can demagog. They may want to, but if they \nwant to demagog, where do they want to cut? Do they want to eliminate \nthe permanent R tax credit? Do they want to eliminate the self-\nemployed deductibility? Do they want to eliminate the marriage penalty? \nDo they want to eliminate the reduction in rate from 15 to 14? Do they \nwant to eliminate the expansion of the 15-percent tax bracket? I don't \nthink so.\n  I think the chairman has put together a good package and that \npackage, yes, costs $792 billion. I say costs. It is going to allow \npeople to keep $792 billion of their own money. They are going to be \nsending in over $3 trillion more than the Federal Government needs in \nthe next 10 years. We are saying we are going to let them keep some of \nthat themselves. The chairman has crafted this in a way that is going \nto help a lot of middle-income working Americans who are interested in \nhealth care, who are interested in education, who want to not be \npenalized because they happen to be married.\n  So I compliment him for his package. I urge my colleagues, with all \ngreat respect for the amendment that is pending, I urge them to vote no \non that amendment because we can do more, and we should do more. The \nAmerican taxpayers deserve more, deserve better. I hope our colleagues \nvote no on the pending amendment and vote yes on final passage, \nhopefully tonight.\n  I will mention, as far as procedurally, I hope we can finish this \nbill tonight. It is possible. It will not be easy, and our colleagues \nwill have to work together to make that happen, but I hope it will be \npossible for us to have final passage on the underlying amendment later \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \ncosponsor of the amendment, the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  The Senate has had before it three very distinct blueprints for the \nAmerican future, not a tax plan for the remainder of this year or next \nyear but blueprints that will dictate many priorities and decisions for \nmore than a decade. They are very distinctly different.\n  The Senate has before it a Republican tax reduction plan that will \nnever become law because the President will never sign it. The Senate \nis considering a Democratic tax reduction plan that will never become \nlaw because this Congress will never pass it. And there is a bipartisan \ntax reduction plan of $500 billion now before the Senate.\n  It is termed a ``bipartisan tax reduction plan,'' but it should be \nbetter known as the ``October plan,'' because we may spend July and \nAugust debating our partisan proposals.\n  Members of the Senate may not endorse this proposal today, but I \nsuggest that by the time we reach October, it is a plan such as this \nthat will bring us together.\n  This plan, crafted by Senators Breaux, Kerrey, Chafee, Specter, \nCollins, Snowe, Bayh, myself, and a group of others, is based on a \nbelief that the Nation should have returned to it as much of its tax \ndollars as possible, while still being prudent to allow the development \nof a surplus, protecting Social Security and other national priorities. \nReducing taxes is a national priority, but so is hiring 100,000 \nteachers, rebuilding American schools, providing for a pharmaceutical \nbenefit in Medicare, improving the national infrastructure, and \nreducing the national debt.\n  Like any compromise, this plan is designed to accommodate many of \nthese objectives, and I think we have succeeded. But it is also based \non the belief that the American people, after 8 years of economic \nexpansion that was built on hard work, high taxes, and sacrifices, \ndeserve a dividend.\n  This $500 billion tax reduction plan is a fair and reasonable \ndividend. This surplus developed for a reason. In 1993, appropriately \nin response to burgeoning deficits, this Congress increased taxes by a \nquarter of a trillion dollars. In the years that followed, American \nbusinesses produced and American workers produced at unprecedented \nlevels. They have provided an economic expansion and also a Government \nsurplus, and they deserve now to have some of it returned. That is the \nfoundation of this plan. But we accomplish nothing by returning these \ntax revenues if we only prestage a burgeoning deficit in the future or \nwe deny other needs in the country as well.\n  Tax reduction is an economic imperative, in my judgment, but so is \neducation and so is improvement of the national health care system, and \nso is expansion of the national infrastructure. There is before this \nSenate but one balanced plan that can achieve\n\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\nthese tax reduction goals while meeting these balanced national \nobjectives, and it is this plan, the ``October plan.''\n  This plan is also based on a recognition that even in good economic \ntimes, it is important to recognize that these are not perfect economic \ntimes. The United States today faces twin economic problems:\n  First, record levels of consumer debt. The current economic expansion \nis threatened by mounting middle-class consumer debt more than any \nother single indicator. Middle-income families with young children are \nshouldering more debt in home mortgages, credit card bills, and \neducational expenses than at any time in our national history.\n  This plan is designed to respond to that need by moving 4 million \nAmericans, people who earn $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 in family income, \nwith young children, and moving them from the 28-percent bracket to the \n15-percent bracket where they belong.\n  This Government has no right to go to a family that earns $60,000 and \n$70,000 and struggles every month to educate its children, provide \nhousing, clothing, and food, and take 28 percent of that income for the \nFederal Government. I do not believe it was ever our intention.\n  Prosperity and inflation moved people into these tax brackets. For a \nlong time, some of us lived with the illusion that people who lived at \nthese modest incomes somehow had expendable income, as if they were \nliving lives of luxury. There is no luxury in American life today on an \nincome of $30,000 to $70,000 with children. This bill recognizes \nthat fact.\n\n  We also recognize that many senior citizens and many young families \nsupplement their incomes by modest savings--people who earn a few \nthousand dollars in capital gains, put a little bit of money in the \nbank, or they invest in the stock market for a little security to \nparticipate in American growth. The Federal Government should not be \ncharging capital gains taxes on people who earn $2,000 and $3,000 a \nyear. We should be doing everything we can to encourage these people to \nsave for an emergency, prepare for the future, and this bill deals with \nthat reality, in response to the fact that the other crisis in American \neconomic life today, beyond high consumer debt, is a virtual collapse \nin national savings. This year, the United States has a national \nsavings rate of minus 1.2 percent, the lowest rate since the second \nyear of the Great Depression. We are the only developed nation in the \nworld with a negative savings rate.\n  This legislation responds to that reality. We eliminate the capital \ngains taxes on the first few thousand dollars of savings, which, in \npart, takes 4 million taxpayers off the tax rolls entirely--young \nfamilies and probably largely senior citizens who want a little \nsecurity in life. They should pay nothing, and that is what this bill \nprovides.\n  Those are the twin objectives we have: Reduce consumer debt by \nlowering taxes on the middle class by moving people from the 28-percent \nbracket to the 15-percent bracket; and, second, by encouraging savings, \nboth as Senator Roth has done by an expansion of the IRA, and in our \ncase from $2,000 to $3,000.\n  This Government should be doing everything possible to encourage \nAmericans to save money, if not for our larger economic purposes, then \nsimply because 50 percent of Americans have no pensions; 60 percent of \nAmericans retire only on Social Security. My colleagues and I know why \nthere is such enormous pressure on this Congress to increase Social \nSecurity and other Government benefits: Because people are not saving \nmoney, and they do not save money because this Government has made it \neconomically irrational to do so, and the Tax Code is the answer to \nchanging that reality.\n  Our bill, I think, is easily defined and explained. It is simply $500 \nbillion over the course of this next decade. It removes 3 million \npeople entirely from the tax rolls by increasing the standard deduction \nand eliminating taxes on modest savings. Three million people, largely \nsenior citizens, will pay nothing.\n  Second, as I suggested, we move 4 million people from the 28-percent \ntax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket, meaning that a family of \nfour earning $71,000 will now have their taxes arguably reduced in half \nand have money available for their own family needs. For a single \nperson earning $37,000, this translates into a $600 tax cut. A family \nearning $71,000, as I suggested, receives a $1,300 tax cut.\n  We also do more. We eliminate the marriage penalty entirely in the \nstandard deduction. We increase and expand the child care tax credit to \nremove American women from this dilemma where they have to choose \nbetween going to work to pay the mortgage and knowing their children \nare safe by allowing affordable child care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator from New \nJersey has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I close by urging my colleagues to join with me in \nthis bipartisan plan for reasonable and affordable tax relief. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I join in cosponsoring this centrist approach. In my \nview, the tax proposal to cut $792 billion over 10 years is too much. \nIt may be that the United States would be best served by not having any \ntax cut at all, but it appears we are headed for some tax cut. And a \ngroup of centrists, so-called moderates, have joined together on the \nproposal which is now on the floor for a tax cut of some $500 billion.\n  This same group, in substantial measure, was assembled 2 weeks ago on \nthe so-called Patients' Bill of Rights, where the centrists had an \nalternative proposal to the more extreme proposals on the right and on \nthe left.\n  We have rounded up the so-called ``usual suspects,'' but we have a \nfew more; and I think there is some chance that this bill, this \nproposal, this amendment will be adopted, if not today, then perhaps \nultimately.\n  At the outset, I acknowledge the proposition which has been advanced \nby the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan: that the \nGovernment of the United States would be best served if there were to \nbe no tax cut at all.\n  The projections of the surpluses are highly speculative. If you \nchange the interest rate a bit, or if you change the unemployment rate \na bit, those surpluses would change very dramatically.\n  There is a strong argument for the proposition that we would be best \nadvised to pay down the national debt. The national debt now stands in \nexcess of $5.5 trillion. When the Presiding Officer and I came to the \nSenate, after the 1980 election, the national debt was slightly under \n$1 trillion. Notwithstanding the so-called ``Reaganomics'' of the \nadministration of President Reagan, by the time he had left office, the \nnational debt was in the range of $3 trillion, and it has gone up.\n  To reduce the national debt would reduce the carrying costs on the \ninterest, and there is a great deal to be said for that. But my sense \nis the temper of the times is that we are going to be looking at a tax \ncut to some extent. If we ameliorate, or reduce the tax cut from the \nproposed $792 billion to $500 billion, then we have more assurances \nthat we can take care of other needs of America.\n  There is a consensus that the Social Security fund ought to remain \ninviolate, ought to be preserved at all costs. I believe that it is \ntrue that the Social Security fund will be secure under any of the \npending proposals. But you can't be entirely certain of that because \nthat significant measure depends on the economic forecasts, the \nunemployment rate, and the interest rate.\n  Beyond Social Security, there is a commitment to preserve Medicare. A \nlesser tax cut would provide a better guarantee that funds will be \navailable for Medicare.\n  Then we have the issue of prescription drugs where, again, there is a \ngrowing sense that this is an issue which has to be taken into account. \nAgain, a lesser tax cut gives more flexibility for prescription drugs.\n  So when we look at the imponderables and the problems, there is much \nto recommend a lesser tax cut,\n\n[[Page S9690]]\n\nso that a figure in the $500 billion range appears preeminently \nreasonable.\n  Earlier today, about an hour ago, the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nWellstone, said he did not think the majority of the country favored \nany tax cut. Well, it is hard to assess where the majority of the \ncountry is. What is going to happen in the course of the next 6 weeks, \nprobably, presumably, likely, is that a tax cut will come out of the \nRepublican Congress. The plan is, if this tax cut is adopted, the \nSenate and House will go to conference, and there will be a resolution \nof the issue by the end of next week, before we start the August \nrecess.\n\n  Then there will be an opportunity for Americans to digest the \npositions taken by the Republican Congress, contrasted with the \nposition taken by the President's Administration and what the Democrats \nhave in mind.\n  I believe if the Senate were to enact this amendment on the $500 \nbillion tax cut, we would be in the position to have some realistic \nnegotiations. It is perfectly obvious, at this stage of the proceeding, \nthat the aura of politics is very heavy in this Chamber, very heavy in \nthe House Chamber, very heavy over all of America--less heavy, frankly, \noutside the beltway.\n  During the August recess, as I undertake my open-house town meetings, \nI am anxious to get guidance as to what the Congress ought to do from \nthe prevailing wisdom of Pennsylvanians and the wisdom of men and women \noutside of the beltway.\n  But I think a tax bill coming out of the Senate at $500 billion would \nset the stage for some serious discussions with the White House, and an \nimportant aspect of those discussions will be what is going to happen \nto the appropriations bills.\n  We are now operating under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. Speaking for \nmy subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over three major Departments--\nthe Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, and the Department of Labor--the allocation of $80 billion is \ntotally insufficient when we look at what we had appropriated last \nyear, what the inflation rate has been--however small, it is a factor. \nLooking at the financing of the National Institutes of Health, which \nhave made such dramatic achievements; the financing for Head Start, \nHealthy Start, and worker safety; that is a matter which has to be \nreconciled, has to be negotiated with the White House during September, \nbefore we go into October where we have the highly publicized \npossibility of the so-called train wreck.\n  But those are factors which have to be taken into account. There \nagain, an approach of $500 billion leaves greater flexibility to \naccommodate other pressing needs of the Government.\n  Later during the consideration of this tax bill, I will have an \nopportunity to speak about an amendment which I have pending, which is \nthe flat tax. That is a proposal to simplify taxes in America so they \ncould be filed on a single postcard.\n  I regret that this measure has not received greater attention, \nnotwithstanding the fact that it was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Majority Leader Armey in the fall of 1994, and I \nintroduced it--the first bill in the Senate--in March of 1995, which \nreally provides some very substantial relief on simplicity and breaks \nfor the American people. That is not to be, but I will have an \nopportunity a little later to explain, in some detail, the flat tax \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, inquiry as to how much time I have remaining of the 10 \nminutes allotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  In conclusion--the two most popular words of any speech--I believe \nthat America ought to be governed from the center; America needs to be \ngoverned from the center; and America wants to be governed from the \ncenter.\n  Where we have the competing proposals--the one which was defeated \nyesterday, the Democratic proposal at $295 billion; the competing \nproposal of $792 billion--the $500 billion figure will provide more \nflexibility for other needs of America, will move to the center, will \ngive better assurances that adequate funding will be available to \nprotect Social Security, to provide Medicare reform, to provide \nimportant programs such as prescription drugs, to provide for the kinds \nof funding necessary for the National Institutes of Health, the other \nimportant items yet to be resolved under an arrangement with the White \nHouse on the pending appropriations bills.\n  I join my colleagues in urging adoption of the Chafee-Breaux \nproposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair, and I shall not take the full 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, might I get some understanding of the \norder. I wonder if there is some way we could go back and forth.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was under the impression we were talking on \ndifferent sides of the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If we understand that the next speaker will be the \nSenator from New Jersey, that would be helpful.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the issue before us today is whether we \nshould replace the Finance Committee's tax relief bill with a smaller \n$500 billion tax relief bill. I commend the authors of the amendment \nfor their effort to provide tax relief to the American people, but I \nbelieve very strongly that the Finance Committee bill is a better, \nbalanced approach.\n  Let's examine it for a moment. For example, middle-class families \nwould receive far less relief under the $500 billion amendment because \nthe 15-percent bracket is not reduced. Moreover, the marriage penalty \nrelief in this amendment will not affect the 30 percent of married \ncouples who itemize deductions.\n  The biggest flaw in the authors' approach is their belief that this \n$500 billion tax cut would be approved by our President. He has stated \nalready he would not sign a tax bill, a $500 billion tax bill that cuts \ntaxes by more than $300 billion. And the Director of the OMB has \nindicated that a $500 billion tax cut would be vetoed. So we have a \nveto threat.\n  We also have a responsibility to the American taxpayer. As a member \nof the Finance Committee, I rise in strong support of the Taxpayer \nRefund Act as proposed by Finance Chairman Roth. I commend his \nchairmanship, the professional staff, and the Joint Tax Committee staff \nwho have worked so hard in putting this together. It has been very \ndifficult, but it is fair, it is balanced, and it is growing in \nsupport, as Americans and Members of this body recognize its \ncontribution from the standpoint of fairness and equity. Everybody \nshares. Everybody benefits. It is a great opportunity for the American \npeople to share in this prosperity associated with the surplus.\n  The Roth bill gives the overtaxed American family a refund of the \ntaxes they are now overpaying to the Federal Government which has \nresulted in the surplus. The Congressional Budget Office projects that \nthe total budget surplus over the next 10 years will be $2.9 trillion. \nNearly $1 trillion--that is, about $996 billion--of that surplus comes \nfrom overpayments of income and estate taxes. The American people \nshould share. They know to whom this refund belongs. It is an \nobligation of this body to give some of it back.\n\n  What Senator Roth and my colleagues on the Finance Committee have \ndone in this bill is to take about $791 billion of those tax \noverpayments and return that money to the American people, the hard-\nworking American taxpayers. All of the $1.9 trillion Social Security \nsurplus will be used solely for preserving Social Security. As a result \nof this bill, we will have more than $200 billion available for saving \nMedicare and paying down part of the debt.\n  We have heard from the President that he will veto this bill because \nthe tax refund is too large, and the liberal Washington press \nmindlessly parrot the President's statement and argue that we should \nnot provide such a large refund.\n  First of all, the President wasn't very supportive of any kind of a \nrefund. He is coming around now. Think of the media, the media that \nparrot an argument that has no foundation, that\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\nsomehow it is wrong for the American people to have a tax refund. Think \nabout that for a moment. What is wrong with the American people sharing \nin this surplus? After all, it belongs to them. What do you do if you \nget a tax refund? What do you do if your taxes are reduced? Well, you \nhave a couple of alternatives. You can save it, or you can go out and \nbuy something, spend something. That is going to increase somebody's \ninventory. Go out and buy a new bicycle; somebody has to put in more \nbicycles.\n  The point is that it addresses an alternative for the American \npeople. We should save more. We are going to have an opportunity to \nsave more.\n  The Democrats automatically jump to a conclusion: Interest rates are \ngoing to go up. There is no proof of that. There is no indication of \nthat. That is scare tactics, Mr. President. What is wrong with the \nAmerican people having more dollars in their jeans to spend or save if \nthey wish?\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield at the end of my statement. I will be \nhappy to at that time.\n  We only have to go back to December of 1980, under the Carter \nadministration. Some people have forgotten. Do you remember what the \ninflation rate was? The inflation rate was better than 11 percent. \nInterest on the prime rate in this country was 20.5 percent. Imagine \nthat. What was that due to? Partially the oil shock. So here we have an \nopportunity where we can have a significant refund, and the beneficiary \nis the American people.\n  The fact is that what the President wants us to do is not to provide \na tax refund to the American people. Instead, he wants to take that \nsurplus to finance $1 trillion in new spending. Despite his claim that \nhe wants to cut taxes by $300 billion, CBO has scored the President's \nbudget as actually raising taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 \nyears. In other words, at a time when we are running a real surplus in \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars, this President comes along and \nwants to impose even more higher taxes on the American people so he can \nfinance a big and growing Government.\n  The bill before us should not be vetoed because it provides a tax \nrefund to every single American who pays taxes. The lion's share of the \ntax cut, more than $410 billion, results from cutting the 15-percent \nrate to the 14-percent rate and the almost total elimination of the \nmarriage penalty. Is that what President Clinton objects to--reducing \nthe tax rate paid by the lowest income taxpayer? Or does the President \nobject to elimination of the marriage penalty? That must be the case, \nbecause if our President had his way and we cut taxes by $300 billion, \nwe could not eliminate the marriage penalty, we could not cut the rate \npaid by the lowest income earners.\n  When the baby boomers are set to retire in 11 years, this bill \nexpands retirement incentives, allows increased competition by people \nover 50 years of age.\n  I commend the chairman, Mr. Roth, for upping the limit on \ncontributions to IRAs to $5,000. It has been over 20 years since we \nraised the $2,000 IRA limit. Upping the limit to $5,000 is long \noverdue, and it is incentive for the American people to save for \nretirement.\n  In recent months we have seen that America's savings rate is actually \na negative number. These incentives could well serve to increase our \nsavings rate. Is that what President Clinton objects to--retirement \nsavings incentives? Or does the President object to the health care \nprovisions in this bill, health care changes that bring a much-needed \nlevel of equity to the Tax Code?\n  Allowing the self-employed to deduct 100 percent of the cost of \nhealth insurance finally brings small businesses to parity with large \ncorporations. What is wrong with that? For the first time in our \nhistory, under the bill, employees who pay for more than half of their \nown health insurance will be able to take an above-the-line deduction \nfor those costs. It sounds fair to me. I thought the President was so \nconcerned about the uninsured. Why would he, if he was that concerned, \nveto a tax bill that finally provides health equity to employees and \nsmall business owners? I ask that question of the President.\n  Much overlooked in this bill are the more than $12 billion in \neducational changes that will make it easier for graduates to pay for \ntheir student loans. In addition, more than $1 billion of this bill \nwill help communities construct new schools. Does the President object \nto that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Alaska has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I urge support of the Finance Committee chairman's \nbill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding the 5 \nminutes. We have worked closely together on this bill. I am here to \nrecommend passage of it.\n  First of all, I commend my chairman, Senator Roth. I support many of \nthe provisions in his bill. Many of the provisions in his bill are in \nthis bill. I express my sincere hopes that the bill's good provisions \nwill stand. I agree with much of what Senator Specter said about some \nof the ramifications if we continue on our present course. This is \nbasically ``Roth lite'' as far as the bill goes.\n  It is very much modeled after it. It just cuts it back somewhat so we \ncan get sort of in the middle.\n  This $500 billion centrist alternative represents an attempt by some \nof us to find a middle ground. The Senate finance Committee has \napproved tax cuts of roughly $800 billion. The President has said he \nwill veto a bill of that size. The Senate Democrats have proposed tax \ncuts of $300 billion, and the President has signaled his willingness to \nsign a bill with that level of tax cuts.\n  The bad news in all this is that the parties are at an impasse. One \nside is dug in at $800 billion; the other will not budge from $300 \nbillion. The good news is that both sides agree that we can afford and \nachieve some level of tax cut. I certainly do. And since both sides \nagree that a tax cut is appropriate, sooner or later we will have one.\n  What those of us sponsoring his centrist amendment are saying is: \n``Let's compromise. Let us take a step toward the middle. Let us settle \non a figure we can agree on. And let us get this tax cut done--sooner, \nrather than later. If neither side can give ground, if we lock \nourselves into hard and fast positions, this whole process will come \ngrinding to a halt. How the process will ultimately play out is \nanybody's guess. It could mean we have another government shut-down. Or \nit could mean we end up with an omnibus bill like we had last year.\n  It does not have to be that way. This should not turn into a game of \n``chicken'' between political parties. But both sides will have to give \na little.\n  In the end, I think we will ultimately end up with a tax bill that is \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $800 billion--in other words, around \n$500 billion. I do not see why we can not settle on an acceptable mid-\npoint now.\n  You can get a lot of tax relief with $500 billion. The centrist \npackage will provide for broad-based tax relief for most taxpayers. \nTaxpayers who do not itemize deductions will see a big increase in the \nstandard deduction. This increase is not just tax relief. It is also \ntax simplification. With a larger standard deduction millions of \ntaxpayers will no longer have to itemize their deductions. Taxpayers \nwho itemize will also get a break, as the 15-percent bracket will be \nexpanded.\n  Up to $5,000 that was formerly taxed at 28 percent will now be taxed \nat 15 percent. This 13 percent reduction in tax will mean savings up to \n$650 for married couples.\n  Our centrist package also addresses the marriage penalty. It \neliminates the marriage penalty in the standard deduction, and \neliminates part of the marriage penalty in the earned income credit. \nOur Tax Code should not punish marriage--especially among the working \npoor. Right now two low-income people who marry often find themselves \nwith a smaller earned income credit than they would have had as single \ntaxpayers. That shouldn't be.\n  This alternative also encourages savings and investment. The first \n$1,500 of capital gains would be tax tree. Again, this is not just tax \nsavings; it's also tax simplification. During the tax filing season, \nthe complex schedule D was one of the things Vermont taxpayers\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\ncomplained about most often. Under our proposal, millions of people \nwith capital gains from mutual funds could avoid filing out schedule D.\n  Our alternative includes targeted provisions that serve important \nnational interests like retirement savings, education, and protection \nof the environment. When people move between jobs it will be easier for \nthem to take their pension benefits with them. More people will be able \nto claim the deduction for student loan interest. Long-term care \ninsurance would be deductible. The research and experimentation credit \nwould be permanent and the low-income housing tax credit would be \nextended. These are but a few of many tax issues addressed in our \nalternative package.\n  In the Finance Committee, I voted to move the bill out of committee \nand keep the process going. I applaud Chairman Roth for the reasoned \napproach he has taken in this bill.\n  With a projected surplus approaching a trillion dollars, I think we \ncan afford some tax relief. I must confess, however, I'm a little \nuneasy with the level of tax cuts in the Finance Committee bill. An \n$800 billion tax cut leaves little margin for error if the surplus \nprojections are not correct. An if these projections understate the \nsurplus, we can always come back and enact further tax cuts.\n  I'm also concerned that an $800 billion tax cut doesn't leave us a \ncushion sufficient to fund a Medicare prescription drug benefit, to pay \ndown our national debt or to address other areas of concern, like \neducation. I think we should go slower, be a little more cautious. Some \nwould call this the conservative approach.\n  Still, I want tax cuts. Our $500 billion alternative allows for \nmeaningful tax relief, while also leaving a significant chunk of the \nsurplus intact for other national priorities.\n  Mr. President, the American people are tired of gridlock. They're \nfrustrated that compromise is becoming a lost art. We don't need to \nwait for a veto before getting down to serious negotiations. We can get \nthis bill done today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I appreciate this opportunity to state my opposition to the \nChafee-Breaux amendment, which would provide a $500 billion tax cut.\n  The proposal is being put forward by some of the moderate Members of \nthis body, and I have tremendous respect for Senators Chafee, Breaux, \nand the other cosponsors. Its sponsors may be moderate, but this \namendment is not. If you really look at the numbers, I would say it is \nfiscally irresponsible.\n  It is always tempting to believe the best solution to a conflict is \nto split the difference. But that is not true when one side is taking \nan extreme position. That is what is happening.\n  In this case, splitting the difference would be terrible policy. It \nwould force either unreasonable cuts in education, defense, and other \npriorities or, more likely, it would eventually force excessive cuts in \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  Supporters of large tax cuts have been coming to the floor arguing \nthat we have a $3 trillion surplus to divide up. But that is wrong. I \nhave even heard the arguments being made about how well regarded the \noriginal Finance Committee bill of $792 billion was, and claiming that \nit is the only fair thing to do--to give it back to the people who paid \nthe bills in the first place. The fact of the matter is, we are all on \na mortgage; all of our citizens share a mortgage, all of us in this \nroom and outside in the countryside. It is our national debt.\n  I don't know any family that, given a chance to get a couple of bucks \nin their pockets--less than $150 in the tax cut for modest-income \nearners of $38,000--would not rather have their mortgage paid off for \nthem. That is the condition we ought to be in--paying off our mortgage \nand paying off our national debt, not giving it back in forms that \nproduce most of the benefits for people in the highest share of the \nincome strata. We were talking about people who are wealthy, who make \n$800,000 a year--by any judgment, they are pretty well off in this \ncountry--getting $23,000 a year worth of tax cuts in the original bill. \nNow we are in the compromise stage, and we are down at a level that \nstill, frankly, doesn't make economic sense.\n  It is expected that we are talking about a surplus. Well, first, I \nwant to point out it is a projected surplus. There is a big difference. \nHardly anybody who has looked at CBO's projections truly believes that \nthey are without question. To be fair to CBO, even they have \nacknowledged their estimates are uncertain.\n  They depend not only on guesses about our economy, but they depend on \nassumptions that the Congress will make drastic cuts in a broad range \nof popular programs from veterans' health care, to education, to law \nenforcement. If Congress merely maintains defense spending at the \nlevels requested by President Clinton, all of these other programs \nwould have to be cut about 40 percent.\n  Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is really the \nmost esteemed spokesman on the economic condition in our country, has \nsaid: Hey, be careful. The Fed Chairman told the Banking Committee in \nan article from the Washington Post this very day:\n\n       It would be unwise to cut taxes now altogether on the basis \n     of surplus forecasts that could be far off the mark. If \n     Congress goes ahead with a major tax cut, I think it also \n     has to be prepared to cut spending significantly in the \n     event that the forecasts on which they are based are \n     wrong.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thought I had 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes from the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is less time than I thought I would \nhave to speak on this subject. I have waited patiently. I guess I will \ntry to wrap it up now.\n  The projected surplus is truly a mirage. If Congress were to maintain \nbasic Government functions at this year's level, it would be a $1 \ntrillion non-Social Security surplus, yes, but it would be more like \none-tenth of that, or $100 billion, by the time we finish with this tax \ncut.\n  We are slashing prospectively important domestic programs such as VA \nand other programs, trying to find trick ways to satisfy our obligation \nto the Veterans' Administration and to the Census, which is clearly \nidentified in our Constitution as an obligation, now calling it \n``emergency'' spending.\n  What we are observing, I think, is some sleight-of-hand work. I hate \nto use that term, but that is what I see, ``cooking the books,'' making \nsure we take whatever forecasts suit the situation the best.\n  There is no way to do what we want to do, what we are obliged to do, \nif we are going to give away $500 billion in tax cuts. There are better \nways to deal with our financial or fiscal condition. Alan Greenspan \nconfirms that.\n  I hope this Senate will respond to the American people's desire. Get \nrid of the mortgage, pay down the debt, and then talk about tax cuts \nthat are targeted specifically to modest-income people.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague from Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in strong support and as a proud \ncosponsor of the Chafee-Breaux bipartisan compromise plan. I commend \nthe Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Rhode Island for their \nleadership in bringing Members together to craft this important \nproposal. This amendment represents a fair, prudent, and responsible \ncompromise between and among the competing proposals we have been \ndebating. It is a sensible bipartisan plan.\n  In crafting this proposal, our bipartisan coalition has been guided \nby several principles. The first is perhaps best summed up by the \nexpression, ``Don't count your chickens until they are hatched.'' We \nknow, based on CBO estimates for the next 10 years, that we may have a \nprojected surplus of $3 trillion. However, $1.9 trillion of that \nsurplus is due to a surplus in the Social Security trust fund. I don't \nthink we should spend a penny of the Social Security trust fund surplus \nfor either tax cuts or for spending increases on non-\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\nSocial Security-related programs. That should be reserved for paying \nSocial Security benefits and for Social Security reform.\n  That leaves roughly $1 trillion to decide how we are going to \nallocate. Our bipartisan coalition believes adopting a more prudent tax \nrelief goal of approximately $500 billion over the next 10 years will \nprovide millions of families in Maine and across the country with much-\nneeded tax relief, while at the same time guarding against the \npossibility that the current surplus projections may not be fully \nrealized in the years to come. Our proposal allows for additional \namounts of the public debt to be paid down, as well as reserving extra \nfunds that could be used to preserve and protect Medicare, to \nstrengthen education, and for other priority programs.\n\n  Our second principle is to target the tax relief we are providing. In \nthis time of economic good fortune, we should focus our tax relief on \nhard-working lower-income and middle-income families. Our proposal \nwould do just that. It allows for additional public debt to be paid off \nwhile removing 3 million low-income taxpayers from the tax rolls \naltogether. In addition, it slices the marginal tax rate nearly in half \nfor another 4 million Americans.\n  The third principle we have adhered to is quite simply pragmatism. In \norder to craft, to pass, and actually enact into law a tax relief bill, \nwe must offer a plan that enjoys bipartisan support. Our proposal meets \nthis test and in the process offers a blueprint for reasonable tax \nrelief that should and could become law. Indeed, I predict that \nultimately what will be signed into law will be very close to the \nproposal the bipartisan coalition has put forth today.\n  In addition to this broad-based tax relief, our proposal includes a \nnumber of compelling tax relief measures. For example, the amendment \nprovides substantial relief for the unfair marriage tax penalty that \ncauses many married couples to pay more taxes together than they would \nif they had remained separate. It also contains important health care-\nrelated tax proposals that I, along with many other Senators, have \nadvocated for some time. That includes a 100-percent deduction for \nself-employed individuals purchasing their own health insurance, as \nwell as the deduction for the purchase of long-term care insurance.\n  In addition, our amendment contains valuable estate tax relief \nprovisions to help our family businesses and our family farms stay in \nthe family. It includes provisions that I sponsored to help families \nsave for college education of their children as well as to encourage \nthe environmental benefits that come from biomass plants.\n  An astute, perhaps even a casual, observer might well notice that our \nbipartisan coalition's plan bears a striking resemblance to the plan \nput forth by the Finance Committee. It is, however, a slimmed down \nversion of the Finance Committee bill in that it trims about $300 \nbillion from the Finance Committee legislation.\n  I urge the adoption of the Chafee-Breaux amendment. It seems a good \nmiddle ground that best provides tax relief in a prudent way for \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 6 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth for this time.\n  I am pleased to rise in support of the tax relief act that has been \nproposed by Senator Roth and the Senate Finance Committee.\n  During this debate which has been going on some 15 hours and several \ndays before that, we heard many opponents of tax relief argue that we \nought to focus on paying down that external national debt, which now \nstands at about $3.6 trillion. Many on the other side have said our \nfocus on paying down that national debt should encourage Members to \nsupport the President's plan, which actually has very limited tax \nrelief in it. By the CBO's own estimates, it actually has a $95 billion \ntax increase, and people believe that somehow going with no tax cut in \nthe President's plan will pay down more of the national debt. But, in \nfact, if you look at the real numbers and look where the national debt \nwill be 10 years out, in the year 2009, you see that Senator Roth's \nplan and the Finance Committee plan pays down more of the national \ndebt, the external national debt, than the President's plan which has a \nnet tax increase of $95 billion.\n\n  In fact, under the Senate plan that is now before us, the national \ndebt will be paid down, the external national debt, will be paid down \nfrom $3.6 trillion to $l.5 trillion by the year 2009 versus only $1.8 \ntrillion under the President's plan. In other words, even with the tax \ncuts, we pay more of the external national debt, and we are in a better \nposition, therefore, in the future to take care of our ongoing \nobligations for Social Security and Medicare.\n  But I want to encourage my colleagues to step back from this whole \ndebate. We have heard all sorts of arguments about how much the surplus \nis projected to be--$3 trillion--and their plan will save that amount \nand this plan will cut taxes by this amount. But let us step back from \nthat issue and just look at where overall levels of taxation are right \nnow in our Nation's history.\n  Going back to 1941--this is from the Congressional Research Service--\nif you look at the levels of taxes in this country, Federal taxes as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product, you will see that our taxes \nright now are almost at an all-time high. Right now, Federal taxes as a \npercentage of our gross domestic product are 20.6 percent of our \neconomy.\n  When President Clinton first took office, taxes were 17.8 percent. If \nwe were to give the entire $3 trillion surplus back in the form of tax \ncuts, the tax burden would still be 18.8 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. You have to look back to 1944 and 1945, when we were in the \nmidst of World War II, to find such high levels of taxation on the \nAmerican people.\n  These are the seven heaviest tax burdens in U.S. history. Right now, \nin the year 1999, our tax burden is up here. To get equivalent high tax \nburdens, you have to look to the administration of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt in 1944, or Harry Truman in 1945 when we were attempting to \nthrow Hitler out of Europe, and when we were spending 38 percent of our \nmoney on our Nation's defense. Today, we are only spending about 23 \npercent. By historic standards, our taxes are enormously high. In fact, \nthey are unprecedented in our peacetime history, and we ought, \ntherefore, to be thinking about tax relief.\n  Another thing I would like to point out to you is that right now the \naverage family in America is paying nearly 40 percent of its family \nincome in combined Federal, State, and local taxes. That 40-percent \nburden means that in families in this country where you have two \nparents who are working, one of them is working for the government. I \ndon't happen to think that is right. We need to do what we can to \nalleviate that tax burden on our American families.\n  We talk all the time in Washington about government programs that can \nhelp our families, help our children, improve their education, but all \ntoo often we ignore the fact that the greatest single reform we could \nhave for our kids or for their futures would not be another government \nprogram but, in fact, more parental involvement in their lives.\n  But when you have a confiscatory level of taxation that is taking \nnearly 40 percent of the average family income where parents are \nworking two, and sometimes two and a half or even three jobs just to \npay the cut extracted by Uncle Sam----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time yielded to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Could I request 2 minutes taken from the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 additional minutes yielded by the \nmanager.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. In short, families right now in America are spending \nmore on taxes than they are on food, housing, and clothing combined. \nThe actual tax levels have increased by 35 percent. The combined \nFederal, State, and local tax burden has increased by 35 percent on \nAmerican families since the late 1950s. That tax burden is too high. We \nneed to alleviate it.\n  I compliment Chairman Roth for what he has done to structure a bill \nthat would eliminate that odious marriage tax penalty on 22 million \nAmerican married couples who are penalized\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nfor being married. It would also give serious major tax relief to \npeople in the lowest tax bracket--that 15-percent tax bracket which \nwould be lowered to 14 percent. That bracket would also be expanded in \nsize so that more Americans could pay taxes at that lower level.\n  I appreciate the time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question on the remaining \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I thought he had additional time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate as a part of a \nbipartisan group once again--this time to advocate a tax cut for the \nAmerican people that is fiscally responsible, that honors our values, \nand that can actually be done.\n  I am disappointed we will not have an opportunity to vote on this \nproposal today because I believe it is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people. Ultimately, I believe that if we are going to ever \nspan the partisan chasm that stretches before us, it will be on the \nground that I and others are staking out here today.\n  This proposal is fiscally responsible. It allows for paying down 94 \npercent of the publicly held Federal debt--94 percent of the publicly \nheld Federal debt. That is fiscally responsible. It, as the other \nproposals would do, extends the life of Social Security to the year \n2053--54 more years--by adding $1.8 trillion to Social Security. That, \ntoo, is fiscally responsible. It extends the life of Medicare to the \nyear 2020, adding $210 billion--allowing for that to extend the life of \nMedicare.\n  As my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, pointed out, on some \noccasions none of the proposals that are before us permanently solve \nevery issue of Medicare. All of them simply postpone the day of \nreckoning. Our proposal would do that and give us time for systemic \nreform. But, in the meantime, adding $210 billion to extend the life of \nMedicare is the fiscally responsible thing to do.\n  Finally, it allows for $500 billion of tax reductions for the men and \nwomen of our country, completely removing from the tax rolls 3 million \nhard-working Americans and moving 4 million people from the 28-percent \ntax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket.\n  I have listened to the eloquence of my colleagues, many of whom have \nmentioned the important needs of our Government--and our Government \ndoes have important needs--many of whom have mentioned the funding \npriorities for Government spending programs which are important.\n  I remind all of us about the needs of the American people, of \nfamilies, working men and women. What about their needs too? Many \nworking families across my State, even in this time of plenty with a \nstrong economy, are having trouble paying the mortgage, putting \nsomething away for retirement, affording a college education for their \nchildren. These families--at a time when we are adding $1.8 trillion to \nSocial Security, $210 billion for Medicare, and the other for \ndiscretionary spending--can very much use the $1,000 for an average \nfamily across my State to help meet their pressing needs. It is the \nright and appropriate thing to do.\n  This proposal honors our values--our most basic values--and \neliminates entirely the marriage penalty. No longer will people be \npenalized by the Federal Tax Code simply because they choose to get \nmarried. We should encourage marriage. We should not discourage \nmarriage.\n  This proposal makes child care, care for a sick parent, and health \ninsurance for those who are without it more affordable. These are the \nright things to do.\n  I think it is important to recognize that we can cherish our values \nand promote them by reducing taxes just as easily and sometimes better \nthan through increased public spending.\n  This proposal has room for a $45 billion drug benefit under Medicare, \nthe same amount of public spending required of the President's \nproposal, and still we would have $180 billion for additional \ndiscretionary spending over the next 10 years.\n  There has been a lot of talk and a good deal of disagreement about \nthe appropriate level for discretionary spending increases. I must say, \nwith all due respect, I cannot agree with my colleagues in the majority \nbecause I find the assumptions and accounting upon which their proposal \nis based are suspect at best. They ask us to believe they can hold to \nspending caps over the next 10 years that they have already admitted \nthey cannot abide by in this very year. That simply is not possible. \nYesterday I listened to one of my colleagues on the Senate Banking \nCommittee have an amazing colloquy with the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board in which he essentially said, Mr. Chairman, the reason I \nam supporting tax reductions is that I cannot keep from spending \nirresponsibly. He looked at the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and \nalmost asked him: Mr. Chairman, stop me before I spend again.\n  Colleagues, we have been elected to this body to make tough choices \nand set priorities. I believe we can and should. The prescription of \nthe majority is one for increased debt and deficit. This is a path I \nchoose not to travel. At the same time, I cannot find myself in \nagreement with those who show charts and list figures basically arguing \nfor an inflationary increase for Federal spending as far as the eye can \nsee, basically putting Federal spending on autopilot. I do not know of \nany working family in my State who has been guaranteed inflationary \nincreases in their family income for 10 years. Why should we treat the \nFederal Government any better than ordinary citizens? Of course we \nshould not.\n  I asked the Chairman of the Federal Reserve yesterday about \nproductivity increases. We are seeing amazing productivity increases in \nthe private economy. Shouldn't the Government be asked to become more \nefficient and productive as well, thereby decreasing the need for \nannual increases in spending? Of course we need to set priorities and \nmake difficult decisions, allowing us to live within our means, just as \nfamilies across my State and country are asked to live within their \nmeans.\n  This is a momentous debate. The consequences of our decisions will \nlast for many years to come. I believe we have set the right balance of \npriorities, fiscal responsibility, honoring our values, doing right by \nfuture generations in a bipartisan way. I appeal to the President and \nmy colleagues for support for this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment before \nthe Senate introduced by my friends from Rhode Island and Louisiana. \nBut in doing so, I rise to oppose all of the amendments that have been \noffered to cut taxes.\n  It is particularly difficult for me to rise and speak against this \namendment offered by this centrist group. It contains some of my \ndearest friends and closest collaborators in the Senate. I have parted \ncompany with them only after much consternation and consideration. I do \nso because, if they will allow me to say so, I think the centrist \ncourse we would best follow in this case is to stay right in the middle \nof the road that has brought the American economy to the extraordinary \npoint of growth and strength it occupies today, and that is the road of \nfiscal responsibility. It took a lot of hard work to get us to this \nplentiful place that we are enjoying today, with high growth, low \nunemployment, a surprisingly high stock market, and surprisingly low \ninflation.\n  I think the Federal Government helped to begin it all by creating the \nclimate for sustained economic growth by exercising some real fiscal \ndiscipline. Then most of the prosperity has come, as it always does in \nAmerica, from the private sector, from millions of businesses and \nindividuals, innovating, cooperating, and profiting. Now, as a result, \nfor the first time in a generation it looks as if the Federal \nGovernment may actually go into surplus--if we let it.\n  Oscar Wilde once wrote, ``I can resist everything except \ntemptation.'' I fear the same may well be said of this Congress as it \ngiddily proceeds to spend a surplus that no one knows is really\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nthere, that would take our Nation back into deficit and endanger the \ncritical economic gains we have made over the past several years.\n  So I ask, why not stay the course that has raised the standard of \nliving of millions of American families? Why not wait for at least \nanother year to see if the surplus projections are real, if the economy \nwill continue to grow, if Congress is prepared to exercise the required \nspending discipline? That is the question Senator Levin and I will ask \nlater on a motion to strike the entire tax cut before us, which would \nmean we would wait a year. It is the question that Senator Hollings \nwill ask in an amendment we will offer later which would recommit this \ntax cut to committee.\n  I must say, as all of us here, I suppose my reflex is to propose tax \ncuts, not to oppose them. I was very active in support of the tax cuts \nwe passed--just 2 years ago. I think sometimes we forget that in this \ndebate. Just 2 years ago, I cosponsored the cut in the capital gains \ntax and supported so many of the incentives that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee offered to increase savings in our country. I would \nwelcome the opportunity to vote for a balanced, thoughtfully crafted \ntax reduction package such as the one the Senators from Rhode Island \nand Louisiana have offered today if I were convinced we could afford \nit, if I were convinced the money was there to support the tax cut, or, \nin the alternative, if I thought, as Chairman Greenspan has suggested, \nthat the economy needed it, needed to be stimulated.\n  But the more I have looked at these protections of a $1 trillion \nsurplus over the next decade, the more it looks to me like a Potemkin \nsurplus--not a real one, a facade with nothing behind it because it is \nbased on projections of 2.4-percent growth over the next 10 years, \nwhich may happen but would extend what is already the longest peacetime \nexpansion of our economy in history. It is possible, but I would not \nbank on it, or at least I would not spend in tax cuts the profits of \nsuch unprecedented projected growth until I knew they were in the bank.\n\n  Of course, both baselines, OMB's and CBO's, assume cuts in spending \nthat are massive and unsustainable. These are cuts that few in either \nHouse would ever support and, in fact, are not supporting right now, as \nCongress simply exceeds the budget almost every day, exceeds the caps \nthrough transparent accounting gimmicks, calling excess spending \nemergency spending and double counting when necessary.\n  In other words, we do not have to wonder whether Congress over the \nnext decade will be able to hold the spending line on which the \nsurplus, which would fund these tax cuts, is contingent because \nCongress is already proving today that it cannot so control itself. The \nresult is that by passing a major tax cut, paid for by a surplus that \nprobably will not be there, we would likely incur sizable deficits for \nyears to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask the Senator from Delaware if I might have 2 more \nminutes off the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  On top of that, of course, we would leave little or no money \navailable for building the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, \nfor supporting our national security--defense--and we would thus raise \nthe specter of a major tax increase down the line to compensate for our \nprofligacy right now.\n  It seems quite clear from what Alan Greenspan is saying, if we cut \ntaxes now, the Fed will increase interest rates soon thereafter, which \nwould put a drag on the economy, slow down business investment, and \nprobably lower the stock market, and it would hit average working \nAmericans literally where they live, driving up the cost of their \nmortgages, car payments, credit card bills, and student loans to the \npoint where it would dwarf any tax benefit most Americans would receive \nfrom this bill.\n  In other words, we would be robbing Paul to pay--Paul, while \nsimultaneously robbing our economy of the dynamism we have labored so \nhard to create. And to what purpose? None that I have heard, except to \nreturn to the American people a surplus that is not going to be there.\n  What we need now, I argue, is a little more of the fiscal discipline \nand responsibility that helped bring this economy to the point of great \ngrowth it is at now.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I congratulate \nSenators Breaux, Chafee, Jeffords, and Kerrey for reigniting the \ncentrists on an issue that certainly is important to the American \npeople.\n  It is interesting that we are here today confronted with a major \nissue, and it is not surprising that various Members of this Senate, \nthe House, and the President have different positions on an issue of \nsuch significance. What we have tried to do with the package that has \nbeen offered by Senator Breaux and Senator Chafee is to bridge the gap \nbetween what the President has offered, what the House has offered, and \nthe package that has been offered by Senator Roth and the Senate \nFinance Committee. We are trying to bring the differences together to \npreserve the viability of a tax cut for the American people.\n  Lyndon Johnson once said: The good news is, I see the light at the \nend of the tunnel. The bad news is, it is the light of an oncoming \ntrain.\n  That is the prospect we are facing in Congress with the tax cut \nproposal because all the positions are different and everyone is taking \na very polarized position on this very important issue.\n  I hope our package will be one that can bridge the differences from \nall sides. That is why we have tried to stake out this position so that \nwe can have a bipartisan proposal that will avoid that train wreck.\n  Over the last few days, we have heard comments from the \nadministration and from Members of this body saying there is no room \nfor compromise; there is zero room for a consensus. I think that kind \nof intransigence is unacceptable because ultimately it will result in \nno tax cut at all, and that is not in the best interest of the American \npeople. We should not reject out of hand the possibility of developing \na consensus on this issue, and that is what this proposal is all about.\n  This proposal is certainly similar to ones that have been offered on \nthe floor by the Senate Finance Committee and by Senator Moynihan. So \nit is not a question of substance because if you look at the various \ncomponents of the tax cut package, they certainly exist in all of them.\n  It is a matter of size, and that is why we decided that instead of \nthe $792 billion package offered by the Senate Finance Committee or the \nPresident's package of $300 billion, we would come in the middle with \n$500 billion. That represents a consensus upon which I think we can all \nagree. That represents less than 40 percent of the $1.1 trillion \nprojected on-budget surplus over the next 10 years, less than 40 \npercent.\n  It comes in the middle between the President's package and the \nFinance Committee's package. I think that it is eminently sensible, it \nis prudent, and we have to err on the side of economic caution when it \ncomes to how much we are going to spend of the projected surpluses over \nthe next 10 years because those surpluses are just that, they are \nprojections. Some have referred to them as the hypothetical jackpot.\n  We have to be particularly cautious about how much we intend to spend \nover the next 10 years from projected surpluses. We want to save the \nadditional $300 billion so we can look at Medicare, so we can look at \nprescription drug plans, so we can look at Social Security, and all the \nother issues contained within discretionary spending that we think \nhappen to be a priority, or we can create a surplus reserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I hope, Mr. President, that Members of this body will give \nvery careful consideration to the compromise proposal we are offering \nbecause it keeps open the door of the tax cut for the American people.\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I inquire as to whether the distinguished \nchairman has additional time. We can rotate.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield 5 minutes to my distinguished colleague, Senator \nLandrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise to support my \nsenior colleague from Louisiana and thank him and Senator Chafee for \nbringing us together and for bringing this measure before the Senate \nand before the American people, a measure that, in my mind, is a very \ngood starting point for where we need to be and on what we need to be \nfocused.\n  It does a couple of things of which I am very proud and a couple of \nthings for which I believe I ran for the Senate to try to do. One, it \nis very fiscally responsible. It pays down a significant portion of the \npublicly held debt and gives tremendous benefits to the market and to \nour economy because of that savings approach.\n  It also sets aside a prudent amount of money, and under the \nleadership of my senior Senator, it enables us to not only throw more \nmoney at Medicare, which we need to do for prescription drugs, but it \nprovides a floor or a framework for us to really put in some systemic \nreforms if we could come to an agreement to strengthen a program that \nis depended on by almost everyone in our Nation.\n  It also gives us a starting point and a proposal to reduce taxes, not \nfor the very rich, not for those who have already benefited from this \nbooming economy, but it gives us an opportunity, through strategic tax \ncuts, to make it possible for more people to enjoy this new historic \neconomic boom that we are experiencing.\n  It does this in very strategic ways, and I will hit on a few in a \nmoment. Before I begin that point, I want to say that I have the \ngreatest respect for the Senators from Connecticut and particularly my \ngood friend, Senator Joe Lieberman, who just spoke. There is hardly a \ntime I ever disagree with him on an issue of this magnitude, but I have \nalso looked at the projections underlying the bipartisan plan of \nSenator Breaux and Senator Chafee.\n  I have learned through that review that over the last 50 years, the \naverage rate of growth has been 3.3 percent. This plan is based on a \nvery conservative projection, I believe, of a 2.4-percent growth. I do \nnot concede the point that these projections are off. I will concede \nthat on the other side, in terms of the spending projections, we are \ntight. But we have never, as Senator Bayh pointed out, spent the \ninflationary standard.\n  There is room to pay down our debt, provide for reform of Medicare, \nprovide a new and very much needed prescription drug benefit, leave \nroom for some reasonable, responsible new spending for programs, and \ngive some strategic relief to hard-working American families, families \nthat are struggling every day to put their children through school, \nfamilies who are struggling to keep an elderly person at home with the \nadded expense so they do not have to live alone or live in a nursing \nhome that perhaps is not appropriate for them.\n  There are many important parts of this bipartisan plan that help \naverage, hard-working families begin to be a part of this new economy.\n  One of the things I want to mention that is actually interesting but \nnot a part of this plan, and I hope as it is massaged and improved and \nperfected over the next weeks there can be some strategic tax relief to \nencourage low-income families to begin saving, just as we have the Roth \nIRA plan and the traditional IRA plan. Those have really helped a lot \nof middle-income Americans.\n  But today there are many Americans who live in Louisiana who do not \nmake enough money to set aside $2,000 a year. So there is a \npossibility, through this tax proposal, that we could structure some \ntax relief to enable these lower-income, hard-working Americans, to \nbegin savings accounts that can promote their wealth, promote their \neconomic fortune, and help them to participate in the new economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If I could have 30 seconds to wrap up.\n  So besides the program I have just described, there is family tax \nrelief, savings and investments, education--tax relief for small \nbusinesses; their No. 1 request to us is for some tax relief so they \ncan continue to afford insurance for themselves and small businesses \nthroughout this country. There are many others--tax credits for the \nrenovation of historic homes, and some other things that create jobs, \nstir investment, and give people the tools they need to participate in \nthis new economy.\n  I thank my senior Senator. I am proud to be a part of this bipartisan \neffort. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as a great political philosopher once \nsaid: You have to know when to hold them and know when to fold them; \nyou have to know when to walk away and you have to know when to run.\n  I do not think this is the time to run or to walk away, but neither \ndo I think that either of the two parties at this time is supportive of \nthe concept that has been offered by our centrist coalition.\n  However, while I think that time does not arrive yet today, I think \nsome time before the year's end both sides will come to reach an \nagreement that what we have offered on the floor is the right approach \nand one which will allow us to get something done with regard to this \ntype of a tax cut and reservation of funds to do what we need to do as \na government.\n  I hereby ask that my amendment at the desk be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1442) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I stress the admiration of this Senator, and I \nthink many, for the case that the Senator from Louisiana and the \nSenator from Rhode Island have made and their colleagues in the \ncentrist coalition.\n  I note the trenchant counsel of that philosopher from Bourbon Street: \nWhen to hold them, when to fold them. I say, it is very clear that \ntheir time will come again, sooner perhaps than we know.\n  With that, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Forgive me, sir. I withhold that. I think the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Just briefly, I congratulate my colleague, Senator \nBreaux, from Louisiana, for his presentation and organization of this \nwhole effort that we have had. I believe there is going to come a \ntime--not tomorrow, not the day after but before long--in which this \nproposal, which he and I and so many others have worked on, is going to \nbe accepted by this body. I certainly hope so.\n  I thank Senator Moynihan for the kind comments he made about the \nefforts we have made.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Again, I emphasize that this was a bipartisan effort, \nwith Senator Chafee on the Republican side. And I say to him, semper \nfi.\n  On that note, I yield to Senator John Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished ranking member.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work and the thinking that went \ninto the so-called centrist approach. I would like to associate myself \nwith that thinking and with the reasonableness that I think guides most \nof their actions.\n  But may I say, respectfully, that something is in the air in \nWashington that I think is clouding people's thinking a little bit, \nabout where we are on this whole tax bill.\n  I am all for giving a tax cut when you have the money to give as a \ntax cut. But everybody here understands\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\nsome plain truths. Notwithstanding those plain truths, the Senate has \nin front of it a $792 billion tax cut.\n  A moment ago we were talking about a $500 billion tax cut. The fact \nis that most of the analysis that is reasonable, dispassionate--and \ncertainly not pie-in-the-sky sort of dreaming about the future--\nsuggests we have nothing near a $1 trillion, let alone $3 trillion, \nsurplus.\n  Everyone here has accepted the fact that $2 trillion is going to go \nto pay down the debt and protect Social Security, and, indeed, a little \nbit for Medicare, hopefully. But that set aside, whatever prospect \nthere is for a surplus is outside of that $2 trillion. The problem is \nthat the hard reality already tells us an entirely different story from \nthat which Senators are acting on in voting on the size of the tax cut \non which we are voting.\n  We are already breaking the caps. There are appropriations bills that \neverybody knows are being marked up in a fictitious manner with an \nunderstanding that come September or October there is going to be an \nagreement to change the caps because you cannot meet the appropriations \nbills without changing the caps.\n  We are already $30 billion-some over the caps. We are doing it with \nthe fiction of emergency spending. We are calling the census an \nemergency spending.\n  Everybody knows these games are being played right now. Nevertheless, \nthe Senate is poised to act on this fictitious surplus.\n  I do not know one Senator who has gone back to their constituents and \nsaid: We're going to cut veterans' benefits. We're going to cut \nhighways. We're going to cut border guards. We're going to cut drug \nfighting. We're going to cut the Coast Guard. Nobody is saying we are \ngoing to cut these things. But the absolute inescapable reality of this \nbudget is that unless you increase the spending of discretionary by \nsomething reflecting inflation, you are going to cut.\n  I heard the Senator from Indiana say: What is it that says we're \ngoing to go out into the future increasing these budget accounts by \ninflation? The fact is, we have done it every year. We do it. That is \nwhat happens. It gets more expensive.\n  The Government isn't somehow exempt from the inflation figures and \nfactors to which the rest of the economy is subject. Prices go up. \nCosts of contracts for the Government go up. Fuel costs go up. \nInsurance--whatever it is. The fact is, we already know what is \nhappening to medical costs in the country. Yet everyone knows we are \nnot sufficiently laying out the amount of money that it is going to \ncost the Government to do its business. Not withstanding that, we are \npoised to carve out, to fix in concrete a measure of give-back that \npredicates that if you go down that road and you freeze Government at \nthe level that the figures are based on, you are going to have a 38-\npercent cut, or so, in all of the discretionary budget.\n  Tell me the year in which we have not increased defense spending. \nTell me the year, particularly, that the majority party has not set \nout, as a goal, to increase defense spending. But they did not even \nfigure that into the level of spending that we have here.\n  This is the reality. If you keep the current accounts at their \ncurrent level, plus inflation--and no one here has said to America they \nare going to reduce those accounts all across the board by X \npercentage--you are going to spend an additional $595 billion. So you \nhave to subtract that $595 billion from the so-called $1 trillion that \nhas been set aside from the $3 trillion because we are protecting \nSocial Security with $2 trillion.\n  That leaves about $400 billion. But every year we have had an average \nof $80 billion of emergencies. Are people suggesting there are going to \nbe no emergencies next year, even though every year we have had a \nbudget there has been an emergency expenditure? Just taking the average \nof $80 billion, you will have an absolute, predictable additional $31 \nbillion in Social Security Administration costs. Those aren't counted \ninto the Republican bill. You will have absolutely $178 billion of \nadditional interest rates because of the money you are not paying down \non the debt. You will have to pay that interest. That is not \ncalculated. That is an additional $178 billion. That leaves us \nconceivably with this little red block, not a trillion dollars, but \nthis little red block, which might amount to $112 billion or so, \ndepending on what we do for prescription drugs, for Medicare, and a lot \nof other issues facing America.\n  The real choice in front of the Senate is considerably different than \nthe fiction we are being fed. I heard the distinguished ranking member \nyesterday talk about the reality that we lived through in the 1980s, \nthe creation of fiscal crisis as a means of achieving ideological and \npolitical goals. I respectfully suggest that what we are looking at is \na form of Stockman 2. That is what is going on. This is Stockman 2. We \nare going to come in with a tax cut that has no money, that isn't \npredictable, and we are going to create a new crisis in our Government, \nwhere we are going to face a whole set of choices that a lot of people \nhere will love because we know they hate those particular expenditures. \nBut they are expenditures that time and again, year in and year out, \nour fellow citizens have said they want us to make. And time and again, \nthe Congress, when it has had that great clash with the President, has \ncapitulated and made them.\n  So this is a remarkable new kind of thinking, where if one big \nmistake is a mistake, we are going to come in and say we will make it a \nlesser mistake, but it is still somehow better thinking. So instead of \n$791 billion, some people would argue we ought to do 500 or 300. The \nfact is, all of those figures are out of sync with the reality of what \nwe have in front of us.\n  We don't even show a real budget surplus until the year 2006. In the \nyear 2006, assuming that you have spending plus some little measure of \ninflation, the way we have traditionally, you have only $29 billion of \nsurplus by the year 2006. That is the hard reality.\n  I hear my colleagues come to the floor and say: We have the highest \nmeasure of taxation against our gross domestic product that we have \never had. What they don't tell you is the reason it is so high is \nbecause so many people are cashing in on their capital gains. We \nlowered the capital gains tax. They don't tell you the capital gains \ntax isn't even counted in the measure of the gross domestic product. So \nyou have a completely artificial set of numbers, when they come in and \ntell you the tax rate is up.\n  That is the way it is supposed to work. That is why we have a \nprogressive tax structure. When the economy does brilliantly, you are \nsupposed to get a little more money into the Government so that you \nhave the ability to do the things that are important for the long-term \nof our country.\n  Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of high-tech \npresidents. And to a person, these people, who are fueling the engine \nof our productivity growth in America and creating the high value-added \njobs, will tell you they need an America that has a citizenry that is \neducated and capable, that depends on investment. You don't measure the \ndebt of this country by the figures that show up on debt. You measure \nthe debt of this country by the people who can't access those high \nvalue-added jobs, who don't have child care and the ability to live \nwith clean water and clean air and so forth.\n  Mr. President, I think we are measuring things backwards, wrong. I \nthink we are on a very dangerous track which will have long-term \nimplications for the full measure of the citizens of our country. I \nexpress that concern as we come, sometime, to a vote on this issue.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman has an amendment he \nwill offer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1462\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding investment in \n                               education)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the courtesy.\n  Mr. President, there is an amendment that I believe has been filed. I \nsend it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1462.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 371, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INVESTMENT IN \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Republican tax plan requires cuts in discretionary \n     spending of $775,000,000,000 over the next 10 years.\n       (2) If defense programs are funded at the level requested \n     by the President, funding for domestic programs, including \n     those providing funds for public schools, will have to be cut \n     by at least 38 percent by 2009.\n       (3) Such cuts in funding for public schools would deny--\n       (A) access to critical early education services to 430,000 \n     of the 835,000 young children who would otherwise be served \n     by Head Start in fiscal year 2009;\n       (B) services to 5,900,000 children under the program for \n     disadvantaged children under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, almost \\1/2\\ of those who \n     would otherwise be served;\n       (C) access to Reading Excellence programs to 480,000 \n     children, making those children less likely to reach the goal \n     of being able to read by the end of the third grade; and\n       (D) the opportunity to learn in smaller classes in the \n     earlier grades to 1,000,000 children.\n       (4) If discretionary cuts are applied across the board, \n     funding under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA) would be cut by $3,400,000,000 by the year 2009, \n     resulting in a reduction in the Federal share of funding, \n     rather than the increase in funding requested by school \n     boards and administrators across the Nation.\n       (5) If the Federal share under IDEA is increased from its \n     current level of 10 percent, then other education programs \n     would experience even deeper reductions, denying more \n     children access to services.\n       (6) The Pell grant, which benefits nearly 4,000,000 \n     students, would have the maximum grant level reduced to \n     $2175, from the current level of $3850.\n       (7) Such a level in Pell grants would be the lowest level \n     since 1987, and would deny low and middle income students \n     critical financial aid, increasing the cost of attending \n     college.\n       (8) Nearly 500,000 students would be denied the opportunity \n     to work their way through college with the help of the work-\n     study program.\n       (9) Nearly 500,000 disadvantaged students would be denied \n     extra help in preparing for college through the TRIO and \n     Gear-up programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that $132 million should be shifted from tax breaks that \n     disproportionately benefit upper income taxpayers to sustain \n     our investment in public education and prepare children for \n     the 21st Century, including our investment in programs such \n     as IDEA special education, Pell grant, and Head Start, and to \n     fully fund the class size initiative.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment has a very simple \npurpose. The purpose is to protect the current investment that we are \nmaking in education.\n  The amendment seeks to decrease the tax breaks that \ndisproportionately benefit upper-income taxpayers in order to sustain \nthe current level of funding for education with an increase, a small \nincrease for inflation. If the Republican tax bill we are considering \nis accepted as written, Congress must cut discretionary spending by \nmore than $775 billion over the next 10 years. When we say \ndiscretionary spending, of course, we are talking about domestic \ndiscretionary spending, which includes education, but we are also \ntalking about national defense, what we spend on our military.\n  If we say the portion of discretionary spending that is spent on our \nmilitary is likely to be funded at the level requested by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, which is very likely--in fact, we usually do better \nthan the Joint Chiefs' request--then domestic programs have to be cut \n38 percent. By those ``domestic programs,'' in this amendment I am \ntalking about education. If these cuts are spread across the board, it \nwould result in very substantial reductions in current educational \nprograms.\n  Let me show to my colleagues a chart that tries to make the point. I \nthink it makes it pretty well.\n  It shows with this red line, starting in the year 2000 and going to \nthe year 2009, we are spending nearly $34 billion on education in the \nFederal budget. That includes what we spend on education through the \nEducation Department but also Head Start. We have included Head Start \nbecause we consider that a program that assists greatly in preparing \nstudents for school. So we are spending a little below $34 billion this \nyear.\n  If you take the Republican plan, as I understand it, and take the \nlogical assumption that we are going to have the kind of cut in \ndomestic programs we have to have in order to get enough room for this \nsize tax cut, then you see that go from $34 billion down to a little \nover $19 billion by the year 2009.\n  An education freeze, of course, would keep it right at 34 billion, \nbut that would not make any provision for inflation. What we are doing \nin this amendment is saying that the Senate should go on record as \nrequesting that the tax cut be reduced by $132 billion so that we have \nroom not only to maintain Federal funding for education where it is \ntoday but also to allow it to increase as inflation increases.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made a very good point a few minutes \nago: The cost of buying services, of paying utility bills, of doing \neverything goes up for the government as it does for everyone else. It \ncertainly goes up for the schools.\n  Now, we have not built into this amendment, I should point out, any \nprovision for the fact that we are going to have tens and hundreds of \nthousands of new children coming into our school system in the next 10 \nyears, and we are not proposing increases in education funding to \naccount for that. We should be, quite frankly, but we are not. We are \nalso not proposing increases for any new education programs. I have \nbeen hearing Mr. Greenspan's testimony, as I am sure all of my \ncolleagues have, and he says: Start no new spending and cut no taxes. \nThat is his basic position, to let the surpluses run and let's get our \nfiscal house in order.\n  I don't agree with that position. I believe there are some areas in \nour Federal budget where we should increase spending. Education is the \nfirst priority, as I see it. But if we were to take the Republican plan \nas it is proposed, it would mean that 430,000 of the 835,000 children \nwho would otherwise be served by the Head Start program would lose \nservices by the time we get to the year 2009. It would mean that more \nthan 5.9 million of the 14.6 million children who live in high-poverty \ncommunities would lose essential education services under title I. The \ntitle I program is the largest education program we fund here in \nWashington. It would mean that 480,000 of the 1 million students who \ncurrently are served by the Reading Excellence Program would lose the \nopportunity to learn and to have that additional help by the time they \ncomplete the third grade. It also means that the chance of increasing \nthe Federal share of the cost of the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act, IDEA--the line item that we try to fund each year--the \nstated goal of many in this body has been that we should at least go to \n40 percent of what it costs to implement IDEA. But that would be \nclearly impossible under what I understand the Republican tax bill is \nto provide. Instead, we would be forced to cut special education by \n$3.4 billion by the time we get to the 10th year of the Tax Code.\n  Pell grants, which currently benefit nearly 4 million students--if we \nassume we are going to continue to provide a grant to 4 million \nstudents, then you have to slash that from $3,850 per year, which is \ntoday's level, down to $2,175 by the year 2009. Nearly 500,000 \ndisadvantaged students who need extra guidance and support through the \nTRIO Program and the GEAR UP Program would also lose that extra help.\n  In my home State, these statistics could be brought down to a very \nconcrete level. One example would be Head Start. We have about 8,000 \nyoung people in our Head Start Program in my State today, which is \nabout half of what we should have; that is, half of those who are \neligible. We would have about 3,000 fewer if this tax bill were agreed \nto.\n  I hope very much that we can get a strong vote of support. I believe \nthe American people do not want to see a tax cut adopted at the expense \nof continued support for education as we go into this new century. \nEveryone realizes that our future depends upon how well we can prepare \nyoung people for the opportunities they will have in their lives. It is \nnot responsible for us to be proposing tax cuts that are going to \nprevent us from at least maintaining the level of effort we have today \nin education. That is the difference. That is what we are trying to fix \nin this amendment. I hope very much that we will have a strong vote in \nfavor of it.\n  Before I yield the floor to my colleagues to speak in favor, I hope, \nof\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\nthis amendment, let me also say a couple of words about another motion \nI am going to propose and which will be voted on when we get into the \nlong list of motions. It is a motion to do something which is very \nmodest, as this amendment is very modest. This only involves $132 \nbillion. We have been talking about trillions for the last 2 days. This \nother motion would be to have the bill go back to the Finance Committee \nwith instructions to report back with an amendment providing that an \nadditional $100 billion be applied to debt reduction. That is a small \nthing to ask. I think of it more as a tithe than anything else.\n\n  If we are talking about nearly $800 billion in tax reduction over the \n10 years, we ought to say let's go back and at least take $100 billion \nof that, which is surplus that we can anticipate, and commit that to \ndebt reduction. That will be another item that I believe is very \nmeritorious. I think all Senators should support it. I think it is the \nresponsible thing to do. I do it because, in my State, whereas there is \ndisagreement about new spending programs and whether we should fund \nthose, and where there is disagreement about a lot of other items we \nare debating, there is a strong consensus that we need to make a \ndownpayment on debt reduction as part of this reconciliation bill. This \nreconciliation bill is a blueprint for where we intend to go in the \nnext 10 years.\n  I hope the blueprint we finally adopt shows that we intend to \nmaintain funding for education, at least at current levels. I will be \narguing each year I serve in the Senate that we should be increasing \nfunding for education, not cutting. We should at least maintain the \ncurrent level. I also hope we will adopt a roadmap for the next 10 \nyears that contemplates substantial debt reduction. And I will propose \nthis other motion, which we will vote on later in the debate, on that \nsubject.\n  I see I have some colleagues who wish to speak. I know the Senator \nfrom Maryland does. Let me yield her 10 minutes to speak on this, or \nthe bill, whichever she prefers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been cleared, as I understand it, on \nthe Republican side and over here that all votes will occur when all \ntime has been used on whatever amendments have been offered up to that \ntime.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it was brought up to me, but we haven't had \na chance to get it cleared.\n  Mr. REID. Mr President, perhaps we will offer the request in a few \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, later today Senator John Kerry, Senator \nRockefeller and I will make a motion which protects our senior citizens \nin the wake of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I would like to talk \nabout this but I also rise to support the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. As usual, his amendment is \nwell thought out. It brings intellectual rigor, sound public policy, \nand responsible fiscal policy to this debate, and really meets a \ncompelling human need.\n  How I wish the rest of this debate reflected the Bingaman amendment, \nbecause I believe we have embarked upon a debate on these tax cuts \nwhich are, indeed, reckless. I believe the other party is practicing \nvery reckless economics. First of all, we don't really have a surplus; \nwe have a promissory note of a surplus. No. 2, we are looking at an \narea where we are not sure what the projections will be, and we need to \nbe prudent. Therefore, we should use the taxpayers' dollars to meet \ncompelling human needs, national security, and stay the course in terms \nof our research and development.\n  While we are in the midst of debating bloated tax cuts, we have \nmarines who are on food stamps. I don't see how we can meet our \nnational security commitment, do a tax cut, and have marines on food \nstamps. The marines say ``semper fi''--``always faithful.'' They are \nfaithful to the United States and we have to be always faithful to the \nMarine Corps and to the military. Right over there in Quantico, they \nare getting food stamps and they run consignment shops. That is not \nright.\n  The Senator from New Mexico offers this excellent amendment that \nsays: Stay the course on education.\n  When I travel in my own State, people don't come up to me and say: I \nhave a marriage penalty. They say: I am married, I have children, and I \nwant them to have the same kind of good education I did. Barb, make \nsure we have sound public schools, well-trained teachers, and \nstructured afterschool activities. That is what the Bingaman amendment \ndoes--it lets reserve funds stay the course for our children.\n  While we are looking at Senator Bingaman's amendment, there is \nanother compelling human need that needs to be addressed. We have to \nreserve certain funds to correct the draconian effects of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 on Medicare. The motion that I am cosponsoring will \nprovide $20 billion to fix many of the problems in Medicare \nreimbursement. My colleagues might recall that in 1997 we passed a \nBalanced Budget Act. We were going to save money on Medicare. But we \nwent too far in our cuts. HCFA went too far in its regulations. Guess \nwhere we find ourselves? In my own home State, 34 home health care \nagencies have closed. I have 10 public home health agencies, primarily \nin rural counties, some who travel on snowmobiles to treat home-bound \npatients, and eight have closed because of the budget cuts. There is a \nterrible problem, and we need to go back and correct the draconian cuts \nof the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  We also have a situation where we have skilled nursing facilities \nthat are teeter-tottering on closing. Some might say: Oh, that is a \nprofit-making industry. Stella Morris isn't profit making. Hebrew Home \nisn't profit making. But I will tell you they will now have to find \nfunds through private, philanthropic dollars even though the Government \nshould be providing funds.\n  We have people in my own home State who are being turned away from \nnursing homes because they are so sick, they have such complicated \nillnesses, that the nursing home can't take them because of the skimpy, \nspartan reimbursement policies that are the result of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997.\n  Some of those spartan reimbursements went to Medicare HMOs. I always \nthought that Medicare HMOs for seniors were a risky proposition because \nour old-timers are sick. They need complicated prescription drugs. I \nthought that these HMOs that were essentially making a profit may have \nsome problems. However, these HMOs also provide seniors with extra \nhealth benefits that they cannot get in regular Medicare, oftentimes \nfor no extra money.\n  Now, I will tell you that the nonprofit HMO in my own State--Blue \nCross Blue Shield--is pulling out of 17 rural counties in my State, as \nof 3 weeks ago in 17 counties, and 18,000 people will lose their \nMedicare + Choice HMO. Why? Because Blue Cross Blue Shield is losing $5 \nmillion, and they can't afford to provide services.\n  Dear colleagues, I ask you to reexamine the premise under which we \nare operating.\n  No. 1, the surplus is not yet available. It is a promissory note. Let \nus move with prudence. Let us meet compelling human needs. Let us meet \nour national security responsibility and stay the course in research \nand development.\n  Let's support the Bingaman amendment on education. Let's deal with \nthe issues that came from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Let's make \nsure our marines aren't on food stamps.\n  Let's make sure that those on food stamps and their children have \naccess to public education so that in the next generation they won't \nhave to be on food stamps.\n  Then we truly have been responsible. We are then getting our country \nready for the millennium.\n  I would like to say one final word in closing. I thank the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for his strong advocacy for veterans, and particularly \nfor veterans with disabilities. The Senator knows that we have an 18-\nmonth backlog. He has spoken to me about this.\n  In his State, they have billboards complaining about the VA backlog.\n  I bring to the Senator's attention that in VA-HUD appropriations, we\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nhave under this budget allocation a 10-percent cut. We will not be able \nto deal with that backlog.\n  In fact, while we are opening tax loopholes, we might even be closing \nveteran hospitals.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher very insightful words and her kind comments about me but also for \nher leadership on these key issues.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Kathryn Olsen Senator and Gabe Mandujano \nof my staff be granted floor privileges during the pendency of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, Senator Reed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from New \nMexico for yielding the time but also for his farsightedness. He \nrecognizes, as the American people recognize, that the key to our \nfuture is investing in education. His amendment would precisely do \nthat. It would sustain our education investment at least at the rate of \ninflation.\n  We are here debating what to do with a surplus. This debate is a \ndirect result of some very difficult choices we made starting in 1993 \nand continuing for the last several years. We now have before us a \nsupposed $3 trillion surplus. But we all recognize and agree that $2 \ntrillion of that is the Social Security account. We are in various ways \nrecognizing that we don't want to disturb those accounts. So we are \nreally talking about roughly $1 trillion, or $965 billion.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts so eloquently pointed out and so \naccurately pointed out, within that surplus we have already made \nsignificant commitments.\n  One of the problems with the proposals that have been made by the \nRepublicans--the almost $800 billion tax cut, or the $500 billion tax \ncut--is that the assumptions they are using have to be seriously \nquestioned. They are theoretical assumptions, first, that we will enjoy \nthe same kind of economic growth over the next 10 years that we have \nenjoyed recently.\n  As Chairman Greenspan pointed out in his appearance both before the \nSenate Banking Committee and the comparable committee in the other \nbody, the business cycle has not been repealed. We will run into, \nparticularly over a 10-year time span, situations in which projections \ndo not provide the resources that we think of today.\n  But the second assumption and the one that is of critical importance \nto Senator Bingaman's amendment is the unrealistic assumption that we \nwill continue these caps on discretionary spending as we have proposed \nin the 1997 balanced budget amendment.\n  These discretionary caps are already constraining what we do. In \nfact, we have already violated these caps. As the Senator from \nMassachusetts suggested, we will probably in October somehow formally \nor informally avoid these caps.\n  But the premise of this supposed trillion-dollar surplus is that we \nwill live within these caps. You can see from Senator Bingaman's \npresentation that if we do not do our investment, education will \ncollapse. We will find ourselves underinvesting in education as we have \nin so many other programs.\n  The reality is, as was suggested before, that if we, in fact, simply \nfund the President's proposal by the year 2009, we will be spending 38 \npercent in domestic discretionary spending. There is no way that we can \ndo that. Frankly, the political reality is that there is no way we will \ndo that.\n  We have to recognize that we will be investing in these programs. We \nhave to recognize, as Senator Bingaman has said, that one of our first \npriorities is to continue to invest in education.\n  Looking at these Republican proposals, I am reminded of what happened \nin the early 1980s. George Bush, when he was campaigning against \nPresident Reagan, described his economics as ``voodoo economics.'' It \nturned out to be that way. The supply side theories of cutting taxes \nwill stimulate the economy, pay for themselves, and lead to surpluses \nproved dangerously in error during the 1980s.\n  Perhaps what we are talking about today when we look at these \nRepublican proposals is ``de ja voodoo economics.'' The theory is that \nwe will return to the same kind of deficits, the same kind of economic \ninstability that plagued us through the late 1980s and into the early \n1990s until we did take some difficult votes in 1993.\n  What Senator Bingaman is saying is let's recognize the reality. Let's \nrecognize that we have to fund educational programs at least at the \nlevel of inflation. If we do that, we will have to invest at least \nabout $132 billion.\n  That is what we should be doing. If we don't do that, we are going to \nlose out tremendously in the title I programs--a Federal program that \nprovides assistance and support for low-income students. Frankly, we \nunderstand the crisis in urban and rural education that this money is \nso effective in dealing with. Without it, urban systems and rural \nsystems would be situated even worse. Without it, we would be fostering \nand contributing to two separate and terribly unequal societies. We \nhave to keep our commitment to these young people.\n  We would also lose opportunities to reform education, for \nprofessional development programs, for opportunities to have smaller \nclass sizes, for opportunities to go ahead and fix crumbling school \nbuildings throughout the country. We would do something that all \nMembers say we would never want to do, and that is renege once again on \nour commitment to special education.\n  I don't know how many times I have been on the floor listening \nparticularly to my colleagues on the other side who have been talking \nabout how we have to put more money into IDEA, the Individuals with \nDisability Education Act, how we have imposed programs on localities \npromising robust spending, and we have never delivered. If we have not \ndelivered on IDEA yet, if these tax proposals pass, we will never have \na chance to deliver on our contribution to local school systems.\n  When we move to the area of higher education and Pell grants, work-\nstudy programs, the new LEAP program, which is an outgrowth of the \nState Student Center Grant Program, all of these provide opportunities \nfor Americans to educate themselves beyond high school. We all \nrecognize that might be the most critical issue we face as a nation--\neducating our citizens to enable them to assume challenging roles in \nthe next century.\n  Yet we dramatically cut these programs, denying opportunities to \nthousands and thousands of Americans. We say to them again: This is not \nthe land of opportunity; this is the land of advantage and affluence. \nAnyone lucky enough to pay for college with their own resources can go \nbut don't look to the Government to provide the kind of help provided \nin the last several years.\n  All of these cuts lead Members to ask a very simple question for the \nworking families of Rhode Island, for the working families of New \nMexico, for the working families across this country, when they lose \nthe Pell grants or see the urban school systems getting less and less \nsupport and local property taxes going up: are they better off with \nwhatever tax cut they receive than these proposed programs? I think \nnot.\n  One other aspect of the Republican proposal is a terribly distorted \nbenefit that goes to the very wealthy at the expense of middle- and \nlow-income America. Our constituents know education is the most \nimportant aspect facing our society. They want Congress to continue to \nsupport families. They want precisely what the Bingaman education \namendment does. I believe if we listen to those people who sent us \nhere, they will say vote for this amendment. They will say reject this \ndeja voodoo economics that is underlying the proposals by the majority \nparty. In fact, I hope we respond to that clarion call from our \nconstituents.\n  I commend and thank the Senator from New Mexico for his efforts and \nfor his time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about my \nsupport for Senator Bingaman's amendment, which urges restoration of a \nportion of the Republican cuts in several key education programs. There \nis nothing more important to me than doing the absolute best I can--and \nencouraging\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same--to push, push \nas hard as we possibly can to re-order our spending priorities so that \nthey better reflect the real concerns and circumstances of the lives of \nthose whom we represent who are trying to raise and educate their kids, \nor send them to college.\n  Our goal should to be approve a tax plan that will send a clear, \nunmistakable message that this Congress cares about education, that \nthis Congress wants to ensure sure that children come to school \nprepared to learn and are given every possible opportunity to grow, to \nsucceed, to excel. It is time to end photo op politics. It is easy for \nall of us to get our pictures taken with young children at schools, but \nthe question is, have we done enough? The answer: we have not. I \nbelieve my colleagues' proposal, modest as it is, moves us in the right \ndirection. I know there are technical reasons why we couldn't actually \ndirectly transfer funding for this year in the amendment--an approach \nwhich I wanted to take--but at least this amendment sends the right \nsignal regarding a re-ordering of our priorities.\n  I consider this a matter of national security issue, a national \npriority. Making sure that the young are ready to learn is good for our \ndemocracy, or economy, and our national defense. it is our \nresponsibility to make sure that teachers are qualified and equipped \nwith the right tools, and that the opportunities for learning will be \nthere in the afternoons long after the last class has been dismissed. I \ncannot say forcefully enough: this must be accomplished not at the \nexpense or detriment of our children but to their collective advantage.\n  I'm behind the proposal to shift these excessive tax breaks to a plan \nthat would fully fund the initiative to hire 100,000 qualified teachers \nto reduce class sizes. It's no mystery that smaller class sizes \ntranslate into greater opportunities for children to get more \nindividualized attention.\n  We've heard that the size of the Republican tax bill is such that it \nwill require significant cuts in crucial education programs. We've \nheard that if defense is funded at the level requested by the \npresident, we should anticipate at 38 percent ($180 billion) cut in \ndomestic discretionary spending. That is the worst possible news for \nthe millions of people who rely on vital initiatives like Title I, Head \nStart, and the Reading Excellence program. Absolutely ludicrous.\n  For instance, under this proposal: Nearly 6 million disadvantaged \nchildren would lose Title I services that help them meet basic academic \nneeds; 270,000 summer jobs and training opportunities would be \neliminated for low-income young people; 375,000 children would be \ndenied Head Start services that help them come to school ready-to-\nlearn; and 549,000 children would be cut from the Reading Excellence \nprogram, denying them the extra help they need to read well by the 4th \ngrade.\n  Mr. President, allow me to share some examples from my own \nexperience. Minnesota, like most states, receives only a portion of the \nTitle I money it desperately needs as it is. Our current allocation is \nabout $88 million. If fully funded, we would receive approximately a \nquarter-billion dollars and over a hundred million additional dollars \nfor concentration grants, according to the Minnesota Department of \nChildren, Families and Learning. Well, I suppose that's a start. A cut \nof even half a percent on a program like Title I would be disastrous. \nBut I can see it coming.\n  One-fourth of Minnesota's Title I dollars goes to only two cities, \neither to Minneapolis or St. Paul, because both cities have high \nconcentrations of poverty. How can we expect to eliminate the learning \ngaps among our children when so many others are left without \nopportunities or options?\n  Right now elementary and secondary education receive on average about \neight percent of its funding from the federal government. It is \nimperative that we take bold steps to pass a tax measure that will, at \nthe absolute least, serve to move us closer to providing the resources \nso badly needed in so many areas of education. But it seems clear we \nwill not do that here.\n  Another area that I believe is a vital component of our national \ninfrastructure is our schools. That is why I am an original cosponsor \nof Senator Robb's school modernization effort that we will hear more \nabout later. I think it too is a step in the right direction and I \nhonestly believe it's another sure way to say to our kids, ``You \nmatter. Your schools matter. Your future matters.'' In Minnesota alone, \nthere is a one-point-five billion dollar unmet need for school \nconstruction. Our average school is over 50 years old. Eighty-five \npercent of Minnesota schools report a need to upgrade or rebuild their \nbuilding just to achieve ``good'' overall condition. Sixty-six percent \nreport at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor like air \nquality, ventilation, acoustics, heating, or lighting.\n  My staff and I have visited nearly a hundred schools over the past \neight months and we've heard stories of pathetic conditions throughout \nthe state. I know many of you have heard these stories in your own \nstates. In my state, for example, Two Harbors High School, which is on \nthe north shore of Lake Superior is representative. Two Harbors is a \nthriving community, but each day its students must enter a facility \nthat can't meet some of their most basic educational needs. Three \nseparate studies were conducted to assess Two Harbors' facilities. The \nstudies identified twenty-seven critical needs that are characteristic \nof so many of our schools. The original facility is sixty years old. \nThe facility does not comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThere are no teacher offices. The school does not permit the separation \nof middle level and senor high school level students. The list is \nextensive. I know we've heard it all before--the crumbling schools, the \nlousy physical environments, and the resulting distractions that once \nagain detract from our children's ability to learn. The question is \n``When are we going to wake up and actually do something about it?''\n  Mr. President, I could go on but the time for talk is long past. The \ntime for pondering our next move is over. The time to move and to move \ndeftly is at hand. My colleagues' proposal urges a major transfer of \nfunding that goes straight to the heart of where our priorities ought \nto be. It calls for a real investment in real people, people who truly \ndeserve it. Smaller class sizes. Access to quality education at an \nearly age. A fairer share for individuals with disabilities. Help for \nlow and middle income students who deserve every opportunity to attend \ncollege.\n  These are some of the most fundamental elements in a strong education \nsystem that values all its children, leaving none of them behind. What \nis the Republican alternative? Denying our children access to the very \nthings that would prepare them for healthy, happy, productive lives in \nthe 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we should be doing all we can to help \nimprove public schools to ensure a brighter future for children and the \nnation. We should help communities improve teacher training and teacher \nrecruitment; reduce class sizes, especially in the early grades; expand \nafter-school programs; build new schools, and modernize crumbling and \novercrowded schools; provide up-to-date-technologies in every \nclassroom; and make college more accessible and affordable to all \nfamilies across the country.\n  But, the Republicans insist on an excessive tax cut at the expense of \neducation and children. We should be making a strong investment in \neducation--not undermining education.\n  The Republican budget denies 5.9 million children in high-poverty \ncommunities the extra support they need to meet basic academic \nstandards through the Title I program, including 81,547 children in \nMassachusetts. It denies 480,000 children the assistance they need to \nlearn to read well by the 4th grade through the Reading Excellence Act. \nIt denies more than a million children the opportunity to learn in \nsmaller classes where they will get the individual attention they need \nto succeed in school. It denies 430,000 children the Head Start \nservices that help them come to school ready to learn. It denies \n215,000 students the after-school and summer school programs they need \nto stay off the streets and out of trouble. It denies 500,000 \ndisadvantaged students the extra guidance and support they need to \nprepare for college through the TRIO and GEAR-UP programs. It cuts\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\nIDEA by $3.4 billion, resulting in a reduction in the federal share of \nthe funding, rather than the increase requested by school boards and \nadministrators across the country.\n  The Republican assault on education doesn't stop with young \nchildren--it affects college students, too. It makes college less \naffordable for nearly 4 million low- and middle-income students--by \nslashing the maximum Pell grant to $2,175, the lowest level since 1987. \nIt denies 500,000 students the opportunity to work their way through \ncollege.\n  Education for the nation's children must be a higher priority than \ntax breaks for the rich. The American people tell us that improving \npublic schools is one of their top priorities. They support reducing \nclass sizes. They support after-school programs to help children learn, \nand to reduce juvenile crime. They agree that every classroom should \nhave a well-qualified teacher. They believe technology should be part \nof the classroom. They believe that all children should have the \nopportunity to meet high standards of achievement. They want us to make \ncollege more accessible and affordable.\n  Instead of offering new tax breaks for the wealthy, Congress should \nbe addressing the priority education needs of children and families \nacross the country--and help all children get a good education.\n  Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student \nmorale. Students in small classes in the early grades make more rapid \nprogress than students in larger classes. The benefits are greatest for \nlow-achieving, minority, and low-income children. Smaller classes also \nenable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have \nlearning disabilities, and reduce the need for special education in \nlater grades.\n  The nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class \nteachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many \ncommunities across the country fail to achieve that standard. The \nlatest international survey of math and science achievement confirms \nthe urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, \nteachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's twelfth \ngraders ranked among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in the \ninternational survey of math and science.\n  The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire \nuncertified teachers, or ask certified teachers to teach outside their \narea of expertise. Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers \nenter the classroom. One in four new teachers does not meet state \ncertification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no \nteacher training at all. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% \nchance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In \nMassachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have \na minor degree in their field.\n  Another high priority is to meet the need for more after-school \nactivities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years \nold, are left home alone after school. Juvenile delinquency peaks in \nthe hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children left unsupervised are more \nlikely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive \npatterns of behavior.\n  We need to do more--not less--to meet workers' needs for additional \njob training opportunities, and to meet families' needs for affordable \ncollege education. The nation's workers require strong skills to \ncompete in the new global economy. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, 42 percent of all jobs created between 1996-2006 will \nrequire education beyond high school.\n  Education is the key to future earning power. A college graduate \nearns almost twice as much as a high school graduate earns, and close \nto three times what a high school dropout earns.\n  Those who complete a post-secondary vocational degree or certificate \nare more likely to be employed than those who do not pursue post-\nsecondary education. But the average student debt is skyrocketing. In \n1995-96, the average debt for undergraduates who borrowed was almost \n$10,000, an increase of 24 percent just since 1992-93. For graduates of \nfour-year schools, the average debt was $12,000. In the 1990s, students \nhave borrowed more in student loans than in the three preceding decades \ncombined.\n  The time is now to do all we can to improve education across the \ncountry.\n  The time is now to meet our commitment to help communities reduce \nclass size, so that students get the individual attention they need.\n  The time is now to expand after-school opportunities, so that \nconstructive alternatives are available to students.\n  The time is now to provide greater resources to modernize and expand \nschools to meet the urgent need for up-to-date facilities.\n  The time is now to expand support for IDEA, so that more children \nwith disabilities receive a high-quality education.\n  The time is now to provide better training for current and new \nteachers, so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards.\n  The time is now to increase funding for critical programs to raise \nacademic standards for all children.\n  The time is now to make college and job training more accessible and \naffordable for all students.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bingaman's Sense of the \nSenate commitment to support increased funding for education. Now is \nthe time to do what it takes to give every child a good education.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nBingaman amendment. As I read the amendment, it suggests we shift $132 \nbillion from tax breaks that disproportionately benefit upper-income \ntaxpayers to sustain our investment in public education and prepare \nchildren for the 21st century, including our investment programs such \nas IDEA, special education, Pell grant, Head Start, and to fully fund \nthe class size initiative.\n  I will comment on every aspect of that particular statement. This \namendment presents a false choice. It suggests to my colleagues and to \nthe American people Members either have to be for tax relief for the \nAmerican people or to be for public education, but Members can't be for \nboth. If Members really support public education, then they will want \nto shift $132 billion out of the suggested tax relief and put it into \nvarious aspects of public education. That is a false choice.\n  It proves one thing conclusively, the concern many Members have had \nas we hear the arguments on the other side as they repeatedly say: We \nshouldn't give tax relief to the American people because we need to pay \ndown the national debt.\n  We have suggested it won't ever go to pay down the national debt but \nany left will immediately be used for more spending. Before the ink is \neven dry from the passage of this tax relief bill, the proposals are \ncoming forth in a torrent as to how we should spend the $792 billion \nproposed tax relief package for the American people.\n  If we do not pass the $792 billion tax relief, that money will not go \nto paying down the national debt. It will, as already suggested in the \nspeeches on the other side in the last few minutes, immediately go into \nmore spending.\n  IDEA funding is an important issue for school districts across the \nNation. It is important in Arkansas but not an issue to be addressed by \nreducing the amount of hard-earned dollars that are returned to \nAmerican taxpayers.\n  In addition, the Class Size Reduction Program is only in its first \nyear. It has not even been authorized. It was first included in last \nyear's omnibus appropriations bill and is being considered during this \nyear's reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nThat is where it should be considered. We should not be setting aside \nfunds for a program that has never been authorized and has, quite \nfrankly, done very little right now in reducing class size across the \ncountry.\n  The Class Size Reduction Program already forces too many regulations \non to school districts. Many States have already implemented class size \nreduction programs at a level of 19 or 20 students per year. The \nFederal class size program mandates a ratio of 18 students for every \nteacher. This forces States to slightly alter their State plan to \nreceive any Federal funding. Many school districts in my home State \nhave chosen not to participate in the Class Size Reduction Program \nbecause of the excessive regulations that\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\ngovern the use of funds. Any school district that does not receive \nenough funds to hire a new teacher must form a consortium in order to \ndo so.\n  Given the fact in my home State of Arkansas there are 311 school \ndistricts, 167 school districts, 54 percent will be forced to form a \nconsortium even to hire a single teacher because their allocations are \nless than $20,000. Some school districts, such as Randolph County, \nreport they cannot form a consortium and they share a teacher within \nthe consortium because of geographic reasons.\n\n  Class size reduction has not proven to be effective unless class size \nis significantly reduced to 12 or 13 students, which is not even \nenvisioned in the President's Class Size Reduction Program.\n  Class size has been reduced significantly over the past 30 years, \nfrom 27.4 students per classroom in 1955 to 17 students per classroom \nin 1997, but the interesting thing is, as we have seen this dramatic \ndecrease in average class size across the country, we have not seen a \ncorresponding increase in academic achievement and standardized tests \nacross the country.\n  The State of Arkansas will receive about 1.15 new teachers per school \ndistrict, or half a teacher per elementary school. This program has not \nbeen authorized, and to suggest we will take well-deserved tax relief \nfrom the American people and put it into a program not yet authorized I \nthink fails to make a lot of sense.\n  Once again this year we are authorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. We have spent months conducting hearings to learn about \nFederal elementary and secondary education policy. We will continue to \nwork on ESEA throughout the year. I believe that is the appropriate \nplace for class size reduction and many of these other education issues \nto be addressed properly.\n  Before we set aside Federal funds that should be rightly returned to \nthe taxpayers, we should consider whether we even want this program \nauthorized and appropriated in this year's legislation. This is the \nwrong way to do it.\n  As I think about the need for IDEA, I support increased funding for \nIDEA. We have done a terrible job in appropriately funding IDEA. But if \nwe think about what is being suggested, taking it from tax relief for \nthe American people, it is the wrong way to go. In the $3 trillion \nsurplus, $13 to $14 billion can be found to fully fund IDEA without \ntaking it away from tax relief for the American people. IDEA is \ncurrently funded at $4.3 billion, which is about 10 percent of the cost \nof educating special education students. Therefore, about $17 billion \nwould be needed to meet the federally-authorized commitment of 40 \npercent. This works out to an appropriation of an additional $13 \nbillion to fully fund IDEA. I suggest to my colleagues, that $13 \nbillion can certainly be found in the projected $3 trillion surplus for \nthis obligation over the next 10 years.\n\n  This is a wrongheaded amendment, and it is the wrong place to do \nthis. But it certainly proves that this $792 billion will not go to \ndebt reduction. It will go to extensive additional spending programs.\n  I could not vote for this proposed amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, apart from the $132 billion that it suggests \nwe take away from tax relief, because it improperly characterizes the \nRepublican tax relief package by saying it disproportionately benefits \nupper-income taxpayers. I suggest this is one of the great myths being \nperpetrated about Senator Roth's tax relief package that has been \nproduced by the Finance Committee.\n  This proposal will reduce the lowest personal income tax rate, the \nlowest rate, from 15 percent to 14 percent, beginning in 2001 and then \nwould gradually expand the bracket so more people would pay that lowest \nrate. It would benefit 70 million Americans; 55 percent of Americans \nwould benefit from that provision alone. That is not a tax break for \nthe wealthy, and I wish my honest and true colleagues on the other side \nwould quit characterizing it as such. This amendment should not be \nvoted for because it says it ``disproportionately benefits the \nwealthy,'' and it does not.\n  In the State of Arkansas there will be 683,000 people, 61 percent of \nthe taxpayers in Arkansas, who will receive tax relief from this single \nprovision, apart from the marriage penalty, apart from the estate tax \nrelief. The single provision of lowering that rate from 15 percent to \n14 percent and expanding the bracket will benefit 61 percent of the \npoorest people in Arkansas.\n  So, in all honesty, let's tell the American people the truth. This is \nnot a tax break for the wealthy. It is a tax break for hard-working \nAmericans who are paying far more than they should be in taxes.\n  Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest \nlevel in peacetime, a level of 21 percent of GDP--21 percent. In my \nhome State of Arkansas, that amount translates into $7,352 in taxes per \ncapita in 1998. I plead with my colleagues, let us not agree to this \namendment. Let us not begin to dilute that which is already far too \nlittle relief for hard-working Americans who have a difficult enough \ntime making ends meet each month.\n  Oh, we can talk about wonderful Federal programs to benefit people, \nand they do. But if we start down that road, there is no stopping \npoint. Let's take more of the $800 billion tax cut and let's spend it \non this program and this program and this program because, after all, \ndon't we know best here in Washington? And we do not.\n  At the root and at the core of the debate going on in the Senate is \nmore than just a debate over a tax package. It is more than a debate \nover how much relief we can provide the American people. It is a debate \nover philosophy. It is a debate whether your faith is in Government and \nyour faith is in Washington and your faith is in more taxes and central \ncontrol, or whether your faith is in the people of this country. We \nwill do well to put our faith in the people and return that which \nbelongs to them in passing the Roth tax cut bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the chairman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise also in support of the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico. It is a smart amendment. It invests in the \nfuture of our country by making certain that, at a time when our \nschools all across the Nation do not have the resources necessary to \nprepare students for the future, we will do so as a matter of priority.\n  I must say I was struck by the Senator from Arkansas a moment ago. He \nsaid this benefits not the wealthy but, rather, it benefits 61 percent \nof the people in his State. He was only pointing to one component of \nthe program; that is, the lowering of the tax bracket from I think 15 \npercent to 14 percent. That is about a $150 billion part of the $791 \nbillion.\n  But when you add in the other parts of the $791 billion, here is \nexactly what happens. In the whole tax package the Republicans are \ngiving, the lowest 20 percent of income earners in America will get \n$22, the second 20 percent will get $120, the middle 20 percent will \nget $276, and the top 1 percent gets $22,964. The next 4 percent gets \n$3,400, and the next 15 percent gets $1,500. You have to be in the \nupper-income brackets to get the larger amount.\n  The Republicans will always come to the floor and say, Gee, Democrat \nSenator, did you just wake up to the fact that that is how it works? If \nyou earn more money, you get more money? If you are a bigger taxpayer, \nyou get more money back?\n  I understand that. I understand basic mathematics. But basic \nfairness, basic decency, dictates if you are really trying to help the \nlower-income person, you set the figures of the tax break so the person \nwith the smaller income gets the bigger amount.\n  Why is it that the lowest 20 percent doesn't get $100 and the top 1 \npercent gets maybe $1,000 back? It is because that is the way they \nrigged the bill. That is the difference in approach and philosophy. It \nis a difference that fundamentally divides us.\n  Let me speak for a moment, if I may, to an issue in one of the \namendments that will be coming up very shortly, but we will not have \ntime to do full measure on it, and that is the question\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nof where we are with respect to Medicare. There is an amendment \nSenators Rockefeller, Mikulski, I, and others have introduced to ask \nthe Finance Committee to go back and set aside $20 billion, about 3 \npercent of the total size of the tax cut, in order to guarantee that we \nwill undo the damage the Balanced Budget Act is currently doing to \nAmerica's health care system. Today, despite the fact that we have a \nremarkable economy, there are 43 million individuals in our Nation who \ndo not have health insurance--1 out of every 6 Americans. Experts \nanticipate that is going to increase by 1.5 million per year.\n  For the uninsured, academic health centers, the teaching hospitals of \nour country, have created an enormous safety net. Teaching hospitals \nhave stood by to ensure there is care available to everyone in our \ncountry when it is absolutely needed. Today, at a time when teaching \nhospitals are more important than ever before, the combination of cost \ncontainment measures imposed by managed care and the effects of the \nBalanced Budget Act in reducing Medicare payments has literally made \nthe future of our Nation's academic medical centers unclear.\n  I would like my colleagues to think about the impact of what is \nhappening today because of the reduction of Medicare reimbursements. At \nthe Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, the training facility for \nthe State university system's medical school, officials are now raising \nroom fees by an average of 28 percent and they are increasing the cost \nof lab tests and other services by 10 percent.\n  In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University recently decided it can no longer \naccept Medicare patients from outside the State.\n  In March, Massachusetts General Hospital eliminated 130 positions and \nraised prices.\n  In New York City, which has the Nation's largest concentration of \nteaching hospitals, city hospitals have cut their staffs by 10 percent \nsince 1993.\n  In California, Medicare cuts are largely to blame for the loss of \nover 1,250 jobs at the USFF, Stanford Health Care Network.\n  In May, the University of Pennsylvania health system announced it was \ngoing to lay off 450 people, 9 percent of its total health care \nworkforce. Detroit's hospitals have eliminated 4,500 jobs since \nJanuary, but as my colleagues will tell you, the problems associated \nwith the Balanced Budget Act are not unique to hospitals. In \nMassachusetts, as of mid-June, 20 home health care agencies have closed \nsince late 1997.\n\n  The administration may be busy sort of brushing off some of this as \nthe simple corrections of market inefficiencies, but I could not \ndisagree more, and I think many of my colleagues would disagree with \nthat.\n  I do not direct my colleagues' attention to statistics to debate the \nbottom line for health care providers. This has never been a debate \nabout the interest of hospitals or nursing homes. It is a debate about \nthe fact that if we do not act, we will further reduce the access to \nquality care so critical for our Nation's elderly, our Nation's poor, \nand our Nation's rural communities. It means something to real people. \nIn Massachusetts alone, in South Shore, in the last 2 years the South \nShore Hospital has had to lay off close to 50 of their visiting nurses. \nThey have had to close their satellite offices, and their budget is \nmore than 40 percent less than they require just to meet the needs of \nelderly and disabled patients. Who suffers as a result of that?\n  Let me share with you a real elderly couple, a man and a woman with \nheart disease, lung disease, asthma, and hypertension. The wife of this \ngentleman has heart disease. They are 89 and 90 years old, and one of \ntheir greatest hopes has been to live together in the home they saved \nfor years to buy, living as independently as they can in old age. They \nhave been able to do it with the help of a visiting nurse from the \nSouth Shore Hospital. But now that is gone. Now, because the services \nare being cut because the Medicare reimbursements are so low, the \nimpact is that those people can no longer continue to do it.\n  I recently received a letter from another constituent named Harlan \nSmith. He says the following:\n\n       Dear Senator Kerry: My 80-year-old father was discharged \n     from my hospital to his home Friday afternoon, and we are \n     meeting with home health care nurses and physical therapists \n     today to plan a strategy for my 80-year-old mother and us to \n     manage him at home. This is ironic since the cuts from the \n     Balanced Budget Act have caused my hospital to cut services \n     to the point where my mother and family now have to hire the \n     required help privately.\n\n  They cannot afford it.\n  These days, that story is repeated in countless communities across \nthe country. When the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 passed, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected the 335 provisions of the law \nwere going to cut Medicare payments by $103 billion over 5 years. But \ntoday, CBO estimates that Medicare spending is going to drop $205 \nbillion--a 100-percent increase above what the expectations were \nsupposed to be.\n  The projected net on-budget surplus for fiscal years 1998 through \n2002 is $100 billion. You are seeing the surplus we will have in the \ncountry is basically going to come out of the hides of elderly infirm \npatients, people who cannot afford it, hospitals that are being forced \nto close, and medical care that is being reduced.\n  When the Balanced Budget Act passed, total Medicare spending \ninflation was expected to drop from almost 10 percent in 1997 to \napproximately 5 percent in the outyears. But in April, the Treasury \nDepartment reported that total Medicare spending in the first half of \nthe year had fallen by over 2 percent.\n  In 1999 alone, the BBA was projected to cut Medicare spending by less \nthan $16 billion. Instead, we anticipate Medicare spending is going to \nfall by $38 billion in 1999--$22 billion more than was expected. \nMedicare hospital spending is plummeting, and the quality of care is \nplummeting with it.\n  When the Balanced Budget Act passed, CBO had projected a 2.5-percent \nincrease in part A spending, hospital insurance, for 1999. But \nactually, spending fell almost 5 percent during the first half of the \nyear, and the impact on hospitals is clear.\n\n  Total hospital Medicare margins are expected to decline from 4.3 \npercent in 1997 to only 0.1 percent this year. We have a fundamental \ncrisis. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as we \nare busy giving back this tax money, we need to consider the impact on \nour hospitals, on health care, on home health care, and rural \ncommunities. I beg my colleagues to try to find the money that is going \nto save us from the loss of the crown jewels of the American health \ncare system--our teaching hospitals.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes off the bill to the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                                Flat Tax\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chairman.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about my flat tax \namendment which will be voted on by the Senate either this evening or \ntomorrow.\n  The most dramatic way to show what the flat tax is, is to hold up a \npostcard which is an income tax return on the flat tax. This postcard \nwill take 15 minutes to fill out. Here is an enlargement of the flat \ntax which lists the identity of the taxpayer, the total compensation, \npersonal allowance, number of dependents, two deductions allowed, \nmortgage interest up to $100,000, charitable contributions up to \n$2,500, and then a flat 20-percent tax. It will take 15 minutes on tax \nsimplification to fill out this return.\n  Contrast that, if you will, with the fact that we have a Tax Code \nwith 7.5 million words; a Pledge of Allegiance which has 31 words; the \nGettysburg Address which has 267 words; the Declaration of \nIndependence, about 1,300 words; the Bible with 1,773,000 words; and \nthe U.S. Tax Code with 7.5 million words with the pending legislation, \nwhich I have in my hand, which is another thick book of 443 pages to be \nadded.\n  In offering an amendment on the flat tax, I have no illusion about \nits passing because the train is in operation to have a tax cut. The \nflat tax would be a total substitute on a comprehensive tax bill which \nwould do great things for America.\n  First of all, the flat tax would eliminate double taxation so there \nwould be no tax on estates. They have already\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\nbeen taxed; all the money is going into the estate. There would be no \ntax on dividends; that has all been taxed before it gets into earned \nsurplus. There would be no tax on capital gains; that has already been \ntaxed.\n  This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers the tax \nburden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For example in the 1998 \ntax year, the standard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, \n$6,250 for a head of household and $7,100 for a married couple filing \njointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is \n$2,700. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does \nnot itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over $17,900--that \nis personal exemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100. \nBy contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a \npersonal exemption of $27,500, and would pay tax on only income over \nthat amount.\n  A family of four with $35,000 in income would owe $2,569 in taxes \nunder current law, but would only owe $1,500 under this flat tax--that \nis a savings of $1,065. A family of four with $50,000 would have a \nsaving of $752.\n  Why is this possible? It is possible because the tax loopholes enable \nwrite-offs to save some $393 billion a year. What is eliminated under \nthe flat tax are the loopholes, the deductions in this complicated code \nwhich can be deciphered, interpreted, and found really only by the \n$500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to the taxpayers. $120 billion \nwould be saved by the elimination of fraud because of the simplicity of \nthe Tax Code, the taxpayer being able to find out exactly what they \nowe.\n  This bill is modeled after legislation organized and written by two \nvery distinguished professors of law from Stanford University, \nProfessor Hall and Professor Rabushka. Their model was first introduced \nin the Congress in the fall of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I \nintroduced the flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, \n1995, Senate bill 488. I reintroduced the bill in the 105th Congress, \nand re-reintroduced the bill in this Congress on April 15, 1999--income \ntax day--in a bill denominated S. 822.\n  So the bill has been well thought out, has been well documented, as \nbeing revenue neutral by Professors Hall and Rabushka at 19 percent.\n  My bill has added two deductions--one for interest on home mortgages \nfor borrowing up to $100,000 for middle-income Americans and a \ndeduction for charitable contributions for up to $2,500. These two \ndeductions have been obtained because of the practical impossibility of \nhaving a Tax Code which eliminates those two deductions which is really \nthe mainstay of America. But aside from those two modest deductions, it \nis a flat tax.\n  One percent has been added on my bill to the Hall-Rabushka formula to \naccommodate $35 billion in losses due to the home interest deduction \nand $13 billion in tax losses due to the deduction on interest on \ncharitable contributions. So we have a system which is tax neutral.\n  Another major advantage of the flat tax is that it would vastly \nincrease productivity because people would no longer be looking to what \nthey could save on tax loopholes. Instead, Americans would be devising \ntheir affairs on what would be most productive, because it would not do \none any good to construct a tax loophole, diverting a lot of energy to \ntry to save taxes, but, instead, the energies of productive Americans \nwould be devoted to what is productive and what can be accomplished.\n  This model, under Hall-Rabushka, projects that these savings --which \nwould be tremendously increased--would far outweigh for the individual \ntaxpayer any of the benefits that they would receive at the present \ntime.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka project there would be an increase in \nthe gross national product of some $2 trillion within 7 years, which \nwould be an enormous boon to America.\n  As I say, this tax bill is well on the road. The train has left the \nstation; and it is not to be derailed by any substitute measure. But I \ndo ask my colleagues to seriously consider the flat tax and, if nothing \nmore, to cast a protest vote against the existing Tax Code which has 75 \nmillion pages, and the current bill which would add 443 pages to that \nmountainous monstrosity.\n  The flat tax is enormously popular with the American people. The \npolls show that 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax.\n  I can personally attest to the fact that in my open house town \nmeetings, the reference to the flat tax and the display of this \npostcard tax return is the only applause item in my speech. You might \nattribute that to the dull balance of the speech, but the flat tax is \nan applause producer.\n  When people think about the time they spend on their tax returns, and \nthe regulatory system, and the complexity of the tax returns, the fact \nthat Americans spend 5.4 billion hours filling out tax returns, this is \nan enormously attractive matter.\n  I do not believe that the Senate has voted on a flat tax proposal \nyet. We Senators always hear that this group or that group is going to \nbe watching a specific vote, and it is going to be a recorded vote on \nthe scorecard. I suggest that a vote on the flat tax is going to be a \nvote on the big scorecard for America.\n\n  People do know what the flat tax is. They do have an idea about it. \nIt is overwhelmingly popular. 61 percent of the public favors it; \nleaving only 39 percent, most of whom probably do not know about it. \nAnybody who knows about the flat tax, that they could get their tax \nreturn done on a postcard in 15 minutes, would be very proud to have \nhis or her Senator vote in favor of this flat tax.\n  In essence, the flat tax would vastly simplify the code. It would \neliminate most of the 117,000 IRS Internal Revenue Service employees, \nwould save most of the $7 billion now spent on the Internal Revenue \nService, and would be a very strong signal to the Finance Committee in \nthe Senate to take up the flat tax seriously. That has not been done.\n  It would be a strong signal to the Ways and Means Committee of the \nHouse of Representatives to take a good look at the flat tax.\n  Because Americans will see that they could fill out their tax return \non a postcard, save the laborious hours and the complications and all \nthose letters from the IRA saying, you owe $19.14 cents--which \ntaxpayers like myself would rather pay but you can't do that; you have \nto go back through all of your records--the release in productivity, \nthe elimination of the capital gains tax, the estate tax, the tax on \ndividends, all of which has been paid.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce my \nflat tax legislation as an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax Reconciliation \nbill. I had reintroduced this legislation on April 15th, 1999 to \nprovide for a flat 20 percent tax on individuals and businesses. In the \n104th Congress, I was the first Senator to introduce flat tax \nlegislation and the first Member of Congress to set forth a deficit-\nneutral plan for dramatically reforming our nation's tax code and \nreplacing it with a flatter, fairer plan designed to stimulate economic \ngrowth. My flat tax legislation was also the first plan to retain \nlimited deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable \ncontributions.\n  As I traveled around the country and held town hall meetings across \nPennsylvania and other states, the public support for fundamental tax \nreform was overwhelming. I would point out in those speeches that I \nnever leave home without two key documents: (1) my copy of the \nConstitution; and (2) a copy of my 10-line flat tax postcard. I soon \nrealized that I needed more than just one copy of my flat tax \npostcard--many people wanted their own postcard so that they could see \nwhat life in a flat tax world would be like, where tax returns only \ntake 15 minutes to fill out and individual taxpayers are no longer \nburdened with double taxation on their dividends, interest, capital \ngains and estates.\n  Support for the flat tax is growing as more and more Americans \nembrace the simplicity, fairness and growth potential of flat tax \nreform. An April 17, 1995, edition of Newsweek cited a poll showing \nthat 61 percent of Americans favor a flat tax over the current tax \ncode. Significantly, a majority of the respondents who favor the flat \ntax preferred my flat tax plan with limited deductions for home \nmortgage interest and charitable contributions. Well before he entered \nthe 1996 Republican presidential primary, publisher Steve\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nForbes opined in a March 27, 1995, Forbes editorial about the \ntremendous appeal and potency of my flat tax plan.\n  Congress was not immune to public demand for reform. Jack Kemp was \nappointed to head up the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax \nReform and the Commission soon came out with its report recognizing the \nvalue of a fairer, flatter tax code. Mr. Forbes soon introduced a flat \ntax plan of his own, and my fellow candidates in the 1996 Republican \npresidential primary began to embrace similar versions of either a flat \ntax or a consumption-based tax system.\n  Unfortunately, the politics of that Presidential campaign denied the \nflat tax a fair hearing and momentum stalled. On October 27, 1995, I \nintroduced a Sense of the Senate Resolution calling on my colleagues to \nexpedite Congressional adoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which \nwas introduced as an amendment to pending legislation, was not adopted.\n  I reintroduced this legislation in the 105th Congress with slight \nmodifications to reflect inflation-adjusted increases in the personal \nallowances and dependent allowances. While my flat tax proposal was \nfavorably received at town hall meetings in Pennsylvania, Congress \nfailed to move forward on any tax reform during the 105th Congress. I \ntried repeatedly to raise the issue with leadership and the Finance \nCommittee to no avail. I think the American people want this debate to \nmove forward and I think the issue of tax reform is ripe for \nconsideration.\n  In this period of opportunity as we commence the 106th Session of \nCongress, I am optimistic that public support for tax reform will \nenable us to move forward and adopt this critically important and \nnecessary legislation.\n  My flat tax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax \ncode, with its myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This \nlegislation would institute a simple, flat 20% tax rate for all \nindividuals and businesses. It will allow all taxpayers to file their \nApril 15 tax returns on a simple 10-line postcard. This proposal is \nbased on three key principles which are critical to an effective and \nequitable taxation system: simplicity, fairness and economic growth.\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the \nstudy of the complexities of the tax code 40 years ago as a law student \nat Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my practice in \nmy early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1962, I \npublished a law review article in the Villanova Law Review, ``Pension \nand Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for Closely Held \nCorporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova L. Rev. 335, \nwhich in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt retirement \nbenefits available to some kinds of businesses but not others. It was \napparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities of the Internal \nRevenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to some.\n  Before I introduced my flat tax bill early in the 104th Congress, I \nhad discussions with Congressman Richard Armey, the House Majority \nLeader, about his flat tax proposal. In fact, I testified with House \nMajority Leader Richard Armey before the Senate Finance and House Ways \n& Means Committees, as well as the Joint Economic Committee and the \nHouse Small Business Committee on the tremendous benefits of flat tax \nreform. Since then, and both before and after introducing my original \nflat tax bill, my staff and I have studied the flat tax at some length, \nand have engaged in a host of discussions with economists and tax \nexperts, including the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, to \nevaluate the economic impact and viability of a flat tax. Based on \nthose discussions, and on the revenue estimates supplied to us, I have \nconcluded that a simple flat tax at a rate of 20 percent on all \nbusiness and personal income can be enacted without reducing federal \nrevenues.\n  A flat tax will help reduce the size of government and allow ordinary \ncitizens to have more influence over how their money is spent because \nthey will spend it--not the government. By creating strong incentives \nfor savings and investment, the flat tax will have the beneficial \nresult of making available larger pools of capital for expansion of the \nprivate sector of the economy--rather than more tax money for big \ngovernment. This will mean more jobs and, just as important, more \nhigher-paying jobs.\n  As a matter of federal tax policy, there has been considerable \ncontroversy over whether tax breaks should be used to stimulate \nparticular kinds of economic activity, or whether tax policy should be \nneutral, leaving people to do what they consider best from a purely \neconomic point of view. Our current tax code attempts to use tax policy \nto direct economic activity. Yet actions under that code have \ndemonstrated that so-called tax breaks are inevitably used as the basis \nfor tax shelters which have no real relation to solid economic \npurposes, or to the activities which the tax laws were meant to \npromote. Even when the government responds to particular tax shelters \nwith new and often complex revisions of the regulations, clever tax \nexperts are able to stay one or two steps ahead of the IRS bureaucrats \nby changing the structure of their business transactions and then \nclaiming some legal distinctions between the taxpayer's new approach \nand the revised IRS regulations and precedents.\n  Under the massive complexity of the current IRS Code, the battle \nbetween $500-an-hour tax lawyers and IRS bureaucrats to open and close \nloopholes is a battle the government can never win. Under the flat tax \nbill I offer today, there are no loopholes, and tax avoidance through \nclever manipulations will become a thing of the past.\n  The basic model for this legislation comes from a plan created by \nProfessors Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute at \nStanford University. Their plan envisioned a flat tax with no \ndeductions whatever. After considerable reflection, I decided to \ninclude in the legislation limited deductions for home mortgage \ninterest for up to $100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions \nup to $2,500. While these modifications undercut the pure principle of \nthe flat tax by continuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying \nand charitable contributions, I believe that those two deductions are \nso deeply ingrained in the financial planning of American families that \nthey should be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and \nalso political practicality. With those two deductions maintained, \npassage of a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, \nprobably impossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19% \nrate, is based on a well documented model founded on reliable \ngovernmental statistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19% to \n20% to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and \ncharitable deductions. A preliminary estimate in the 104th Congress by \nthe Committee on Joint Taxation places the annual cost of the home \ninterest deduction at $35 billion, and the cost of the charitable \ndeduction at $13 billion. While the revenue calculation is complicated \nbecause the Hall-Rabushka proposal encompasses significant revisions to \nbusiness taxes as well as personal income taxes, there is a sound basis \nfor concluding that the 1 percent increase in rate would pay for the \ntwo deductions. Revenue estimates for tax code revisions are difficult \nto obtain and are, at best, judgment calls based on projections from \nfact situations with a myriad of assumed variables. It is possible that \nsome modification may be needed at a later date to guarantee revenue \nneutrality.\n  This legislation offered today is quite similar to the bill \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Armey and in the Senate late in \n1995 by Senator Richard Shelby, which were both in turn modeled after \nthe Hall-Rabushka proposal. The flat tax offers great potential for \nenormous economic growth, in keeping with principles articulated so \nwell by Jack Kemp. This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their \nsource, so that there is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, \ncapital gains, gifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code \ncan become a powerful incentive for savings and investment--which \ntranslates into economic growth and expansion, more and\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nbetter jobs, and raising the standard of living for all Americans.\n  In the 104th Congress, we took some important steps toward reducing \nthe size and cost of government, and this work is ongoing and vitally \nimportant. But the work of downsizing government is only one side of \nthe coin; what we must do at the same time, and with as much energy and \ncare, is to grow the private sector. As we reform the welfare programs \nand government bureaucracies of past administrations, we must replace \nthose programs with a prosperity that extends to all segments of \nAmerican society through private investment and job creation--which can \nhave the additional benefit of producing even lower taxes for Americans \nas economic expansion adds to federal revenues. Just as Americans need \na tax code that is fair and simple, they also are entitled to tax laws \ndesigned to foster rather than retard economic growth. The bill I offer \ntoday embodies those principles.\n  My plan, like the Armey-Shelby proposal, is based on the Hall-\nRabushka analysis. But my flat tax differs from the Armey-Shelby plan \nin four key respects: First, my bill contains a 20 percent flat tax \nrate. Second, this bill would retain modified deductions for mortgage \ninterest and charitable contributions (which will require a 1 percent \nhigher tax rate than otherwise). Third, my bill would maintain the \nautomatic withholding of taxes from an individual's paycheck. Lastly, \nmy bill is designed to be revenue neutral, and thus will not undermine \nour vital efforts to balance the nation's budget.\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are three-fold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts, and as interest rates drop.\n  Under this tax plan, individuals would be taxed at a flat rate of 20 \npercent on all income they earn from wages, pensions and salaries. \nIndividuals would not be taxed on any capital gains, interest on \nsavings, or dividends--since those items will have already been taxed \nas part of the flat tax on business revenue. The flat tax will also \neliminate all but two of the deductions and exemptions currently \ncontained within the tax code. Instead, taxpayers will be entitled to \n``personal allowances'' for themselves and their children. The personal \nallowances are: $10,000 for a single taxpayer; $15,000 for a single \nhead of household; $17,500 for a married couple filing jointly; and \n$5,000 per child or dependent. These personal allowances would be \nadjusted annually for inflation after 1999.\n  In order to ensure that this flat tax does not unfairly impact low \nincome families, the personal allowances contained in my proposal are \nmuch higher than the standard deduction and personal exemptions allowed \nunder the current tax code. For example in the 1998 tax year, the \nstandard deduction is $4,250 for a single taxpayer, $6,250 for a head \nof household and $7,100 for a married couple filing jointly, while the \npersonal exemption for individuals and dependents is $2,700. Thus, \nunder the current tax code, a family of four which does not itemize \ndeductions would pay tax on all income over $17,900 (personal \nexemptions of $10,800 and a standard deduction of $7,100). By contrast, \nunder my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a personal \nexemption of $27,500, and would pay tax only on income over that \namount.\n  My legislation retains the provisions for the deductibility of \ncharitable contributions up to a limit of $2,500 and home mortgage \ninterest on up to $100,000 of borrowing. Retention of these key \ndeductions will, I believe, enhance the political salability of this \nlegislation and allow the debate on the flat tax to move forward. If a \ndecision is made to eliminate these deductions, the revenue saved could \nbe used to reduce the overall flat tax rate below 20 percent.\n  With respect to businesses, the flat tax would also be a flat rate of \n20 percent. My legislation would eliminate the intricate scheme of \ncomplicated depreciation schedules, deductions, credits, and other \ncomplexities that go into business taxation in favor of a much-\nsimplified system that taxes all business revenue less only wages, \ndirect expenses and purchases--a system with much less potential for \nfraud, ``creative accounting'' and tax avoidance.\n  Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the cost of \ncapital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, structures \nand land, and to do so in the year in which the investments are made. \nThe business tax would apply to all money not reinvested in the company \nin the form of employment or capital formation--thus fully taxing \nrevenue at the business level and making it inappropriate to re-tax the \nsame monies when passed on to investors as dividends or capital gains.\n  Let me now turn to a more specific discussion of the advantages of \nthe flat tax legislation I am reintroducing today.\n  The first major advantage to this flat tax is simplicity. According \nto the Tax Foundation, Americans spend approximately 5.3 billion hours \neach year filling out tax forms. Much of this time is spent burrowing \nthrough IRS laws and regulations which fill 17,000 pages and have grown \nfrom 744,000 words in 1955 to 5.6 million words in 1995.\n  Whenever the government gets involved in any aspect of our lives, it \ncan convert the most simple goal or task into a tangled array of \ncomplexity, frustration and inefficiency. By way of example, most \nAmericans have become familiar with the absurdities of the government's \nmilitary procurement programs. If these programs have taught us \nanything, it is how a simple purchase order for a hammer or a toilet \nseat can mushroom into thousands of words of regulations and \nrestrictions when the government gets involved. The Internal Revenue \nService is certainly no exception. Indeed, it has become a \ndistressingly common experience for taxpayers to receive computerized \nprint-outs claiming that additional taxes are due, which require \nrepeated exchanges of correspondence or personal visits before it is \ndetermined, as it so often is, that the taxpayer was right in the first \nplace.\n  The plan offered today would eliminate these kinds of frustrations \nfor millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us to scrap the \ngreat majority of the IRS rules, regulations and instructions and \ndelete most of the five million words in the Internal Revenue Code. \nInstead of tens of millions of hours of non-productive time spent in \ncompliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would spend \nonly the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-sized \nform. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find valuable \nhours freed up to engage in productive business activity, or for more \ntime with their families, instead of poring over tax tables, schedules \nand regulations.\n  The flat tax I have proposed can be calculated just by filling out a \nsmall postcard which would require a taxpayer only to answer a few easy \nquestions. Filing a tax return would become a manageable chore, not a \nseemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers.\n  Along with the advantage of simplicity, enactment of this flat tax \nbill will help to remove the burden of costly and unnecessary \ngovernment regulation, bureaucracy and red tape from our everyday \nlives. The heavy hand of government bureaucracy is particularly onerous \nin the case of the Internal Revenue Service, which has been able to \nextend its influence into so many aspects of our lives.\n  In 1995, the IRS employed 117,000 people, spread out over countless \noffices across the United States. Its budget was in excess of $7 \nbillion, with over $4 billion spent merely on enforcement. By \nsimplifying the tax code and eliminating most of the IRS' vast array of \nrules and regulations, the flat tax would enable us to cut a \nsignificant portion of the IRS budget, including the bulk of the \nfunding now needed for enforcement and administration.\n  In addition, a flat tax would allow taxpayers to redirect their time, \nenergies and money away from the yearly morass of tax compliance. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, in 1996, the private sector spent over \n$150 billion complying with federal tax laws. According to a Tax \nFoundation study, adoption of\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\nflat tax reform would cut pre-filing compliance costs by over 90 \npercent.\n  Monies spent by businesses and investors in creating tax shelters and \nfinding loopholes could be instead directed to productive and job-\ncreating economic activity. With the adoption of a flat tax, the \nopportunities for fraud and cheating would also be vastly reduced, \nallowing the government to collect, according to some estimates, over \n$120 billion annually.\n  The third major advantage to a flat tax is that it will be a \ntremendous spur to economic growth. Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson \nestimates adoption of a flat tax like the one offered today would \nincrease future national wealth by over $2 trillion, in present value \nterms, over a seven year period. This translates into over $7,500 in \nincreased wealth for every man, woman and child in America. This growth \nalso means that there will be more jobs--it is estimated that the $2 \ntrillion increase in wealth would lead to the creation of 6 million new \njobs.\n  The economic principles are fairly straightforward. Our current tax \nsystem is inefficient; it is biased toward too little savings and too \nmuch consumption. The flat tax creates substantial incentives for \nsavings and investment by eliminating taxation on interest, dividends \nand capital gains--and tax policies which promote capital formation and \ninvestment are the best vehicle for creation of new and high paying \njobs, and for a greater prosperity for all Americans.\n  It is well recognized that to promote future economic growth, we need \nnot only to eliminate the federal government's reliance on deficits and \nborrowed money, but to restore and expand the base of private savings \nand investment that has been the real engine driving American \nprosperity throughout our history. These concepts are related--the \nfederal budget deficit soaks up much of what we have saved, leaving \nless for businesses to borrow for investments.\n  It is the sum total of savings by all aspects of the U.S. economy \nthat represents the pool of all capital available for investment--in \ntraining, education, research, machinery, physical plant, etc.--and \nthat constitutes the real seed of future prosperity. The statistics \nhere are daunting. In the 1960s, the net U.S. national savings rate was \n8.2 percent, but it has fallen to a dismal 1.5 percent. Americans save \nat only one-tenth the rate of the Japanese, and only one-fifth the rate \nof the Germans. This is unacceptable and we must do something to \nreverse the trend.\n  An analysis of the components of U.S. savings patterns shows that \nalthough the federal budget deficit is the largest cause of \n``dissavings,'' both personal and business savings rates have declined \nsignificantly over the past three decades. Thus, to recreate the pool \nof capital stock that is critical to future U.S. growth and prosperity, \nwe have to do more than just get rid of the deficit. We have to very \nmaterially raise our levels of private savings and investment. And we \nhave to do so in a way that will not cause additional deficits.\n  The less money people save, the less money is available for business \ninvestment and growth. The current tax system discourages savings and \ninvestment, because it taxes the interest we earn from our savings \naccounts, the dividends we make from investing in the stock market, and \nthe capital gains we make from successful investments in our homes and \nthe financial markets. Indeed, under the current law these rewards for \nsaving and investment are not only taxed, they are overtaxed--since \ngains due solely to inflation, which represent no real increase in \nvalue, are taxed as if they were profits to the taxpayer.\n  With the limited exceptions of retirement plans and tax free \nmunicipal bonds, our current tax code does virtually nothing to \nencourage personal savings and investment, or to reward it over \nconsumption. This bill will change this system, and address this \nproblem. The proposed legislation reverses the current skewed \nincentives by promoting savings and investment by individuals and by \nbusinesses. Individuals would be able to invest and save their money \ntax-free and reap the benefits of the accumulated value of those \ninvestments without paying a capital gains tax upon the sale of these \ninvestments. Businesses would also invest more as the flat tax allowed \nthem to expense fully all sums invested in new equipment and technology \nin the year the expense was incurred, rather than dragging out the tax \nbenefits for these investments through complicated depreciation \nschedules. With greater investment and a larger pool of savings \navailable, interest rates and the costs of investment would also drop, \nspurring even greater economic growth.\n  Critics of the flat tax have argued that we cannot afford the revenue \nlosses associated with the tremendous savings and investment incentives \nthe bill affords to businesses and individuals. Those critics are \nwrong. Not only is this bill carefully crafted to be revenue neutral, \nbut historically we have seen that when taxes are cut, revenues \nactually increase, as more taxpayers work harder for a larger share of \ntheir take-home pay, and investors are more willing to take risks in \npursuit of rewards that will not get eaten up in taxes.\n  As one example, under President Kennedy when individual tax rates \nwere lowered, investment incentives including the investment tax credit \nwere created and then expanded and depreciation rates were accelerated. \nYet, between 1962 and 1967, gross annual federal tax receipts grew from \n$99.7 billion to $148 billion--an increase of nearly 50 percent. More \nrecently after President Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980's, \ngovernment tax revenues rose from just under $600 billion in 1981 to \nnearly $1 trillion in 1989. In fact, the Reagan tax cut program helped \nto bring about one of the longest peacetime expansion of the U.S. \neconomy in history. There is every reason to believe that the flat tax \nproposed here can do the same--and by maintaining revenue neutrality in \nthis flat tax proposal, as we have, we can avoid any increases in \nannual deficits and the national debt.\n  In addition to increasing federal revenues by fostering economic \ngrowth, the flat tax can also add to federal revenues without \nincreasing taxes by closing tax loopholes. The Congressional Research \nService estimates that for fiscal year 1995, individuals sheltered more \nthan $393 billion in tax revenue in legal loopholes, and corporations \nsheltered an additional $60 billion. There may well be additional \nmonies hidden in quasi-legal or even illegal ``tax shelters.'' Under a \nflat tax system, all tax shelters will disappear and all income will be \nsubject to taxation.\n\n  The growth case for a flat tax is compelling. It is even more \ncompelling in the case of a tax revision that is simple and \ndemonstrably fair.\n  By substantially increasing the personal allowances for taxpayers and \ntheir dependents, this flat tax proposal ensures that poorer taxpayers \nwill pay no tax and that taxes will not be regressive for lower and \nmiddle income taxpayers. At the same time, by closing the hundreds of \ntax loopholes which are currently used by wealthier taxpayers to \nshelter their income and avoid taxes, this flat tax bill will also \nensure that all Americans pay their fair share.\n  The flat tax legislation that I am offering will retain the element \nof progressivity that Americans view as essential to fairness in an \nincome tax system. Because of the lower end income exclusions, and the \ncapped deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable \ncontributions, the effective tax rates under my bill will range from 0% \nfor families with incomes under about $30,000 to roughly 20% for the \nhighest income groups.\n  My proposed legislation demonstrably retains the fairness that must \nbe an essential component of the American tax system.\n  The proposal that I make today is dramatic, but so are its \nadvantages: a taxation system that is simple, fair and designed to \nmaximize prosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages \nare:\n  Simplicity: A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms \nand attachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 5.3 \nbillion hours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Cuts government: The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS \nrules, regulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 \nwords in 1955 to 5.6 million words and 12,000 pages currently. It would \nalso allow us to slash the mammoth IRS bureaucracy of 117,000 \nemployees.\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\n  Promotes economic growth: Economists estimate a growth of over $2 \ntrillion in national wealth over seven years, representing an increase \nof approximately $7,500 in personal wealth for every man, woman and \nchild in America. This growth would also lead to the creation of 6 \nmillion new jobs.\n  Increases efficiency: Investment decisions would be made on the basis \nof productivity rather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to \neven greater economic expansion.\n  Reduces interest rates: Economic forecasts indicate that interest \nrates would fall substantially, by as much as two points, as the flat \ntax removes many of the current disincentives to savings.\n  Lowers compliance costs: Americans would be able to save up to $224 \nbillion they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  Decreases fraud: as tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is \nsimplified, there will be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and \nfraud, which now amounts to over $120 billion in uncollected revenue \nannually.\n  Reduces IRS costs: Simplification of the tax code will allow us to \nsave significantly on the $7 billion annual budget currently allocated \nto the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years \nof enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent \nincrease in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and \nincreased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 \nincrease in the personal income of all Americans.\n  No one likes to pay taxes. But Americans will be much more willing to \npay their taxes under a system that they believe is fair, a system that \nthey can understand, and a system that they recognize promotes rather \nthan prevents growth and prosperity. The legislation I introduce today \nwill afford Americans such a tax system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the charts and exhibits \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       1999 Individual Tax Return\n\n\n                   form 1--individual wage tax--1999\n\n       Your first name and initial (if joint return, also give \n     spouse's name and initial): ____________________\n       Your social security\n     number: ____________\n       Home address (number and street including apartment number \n     or rural route): ____________________\n       Spouse's social security\n     number: ____________\n       City, town, or post office, state, and ZIP code: \n     ____________________\n\n1.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity today in my \ncapacity as Co-Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, known as the Helsinki Commission, to draw the attention of \nmy Senate colleagues to the growing problem of official and unofficial \ncorruption abroad and the direct impact on U.S. business.\n  Last week I chaired a Commission hearing that focused on the issues \nof bribery and corruption in the OSCE region, an area stretching from \nVancouver to Vladivostok. The Commission heard that, in economic terms, \nrampant corruption and organized crime in this vast region has cost \nU.S. businesses billions of dollars in lost contracts with direct \nimplications for our economy here at home.\n  Ironically, Mr. President, in some of the biggest recipients of U.S. \nforeign assistance--countries like Russia and Ukraine--the climate is \neither not conducive or outright hostile to American business. This \nweek a delegation of Russian officials led by Prime Minister Sergei \nStepashin are meeting with the Vice President and other administration \nofficials to seek support of the transfer of billions of dollars in \nloans and other assistance, money which ultimately comes from the \npockets of U.S. taxpayers.\n  I recently returned from the annual session of the OSCE Parliamentary \nAssembly in St. Petersburg, Russia, where I had an opportunity to sit \ndown with U.S. business representatives to learn from their first-hand \nexperiences and gain a deeper insight into the obstacles they face. \nDuring the 105th Congress, I introduced legislation--the International \nAnti-Corruption Act--to link U.S. foreign aid to how conducive \nrecipient countries are to business investment. I intend to reintroduce \nthat legislation shortly, taking into account testimony presented \nduring last week's Commission hearing.\n  The time has come to stop doing business as usual with the Russians \nand others who gladly line up to receive our assistance then turn \naround and fleece U.S. businesses seeking to assist with the \nestablishment of legitimate operations in these countries. An article \nin the Washington Post this week illustrates the type of rampant and \nblatant corruption faced by many in the U.S. business community, \nincluding companies based in my home state of Colorado.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being on objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Investors Fear ``Scary Guy'' in Russia Talks\n\n                           (By Steven Mufson)\n\n       Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin arrived in Seattle \n     on Sunday to court American investment in his country's \n     ailing economy, but his entourage included a regional \n     governor who has been accused of using strong-arm tactics to \n     wrest assets from foreign investors.\n       The controversial member of Stepashin's delegation is \n     Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of Primonsky province in \n     Russia's Far East, who is embroiled in several disputes with \n     foreign business leaders.\n       ``Basically the governor is a pretty scary guy,'' said \n     Andrew Fox, who sits on the boards of more than 20 companies \n     in the region and is the honorary British consul in \n     Valdivostok. Fox said that Nazdratenko summoned him on June 3 \n     and threatened to send him ``on an excursion to visit a very \n     small room'' where Fox would be kept until he agreed to give \n     the governor control of a crucial stake in a shipping company \n     and leave the company's existing management intact. Fox left \n     that week and is now in Scotland.\n       David Gens, finance director of Seattle-based Far East \n     Maritime Agency, said the Russian partner of one of the \n     company's affiliates was ordered to contribute 10 percent of \n     revenue for the rest of the year to Nazdratenko's reelection \n     campaign.\n       In yet another dispute, an American investor has alleged \n     that Nazdratenko packed the board of a company, diluted the \n     ownership interest of foreign investors and diverted funds to \n     coffers for his December reelection campaign.\n       Senior administration officials said Nazdratenko would not \n     be included in meetings with President Clinton, Vice \n     President Gore or other top U.S. officials today in \n     Washington. But several business leaders said the mere \n     presence of the Vladivostok politician, who accompanied \n     Stepashin in Seattle for a tour of a Boeing plant and a \n     dinner hosted by Washington Gov. Gary Locke (D), was sending \n     a bad signal to investors.\n       Russia has defaulted on its debts, it has a lot of economic \n     problems, it should be extra\n\n[[Page S9738]]\n\n     careful to woo foreign investors, said a Moscow-based \n     spokesman for a group of foreign investors in a dispute with \n     Nazdratenko over a Vladivostok-based fishing company. ``To \n     bring the poster boy of corruption along to the United States \n     is just staggering.''\n       Nazdratenko has repeatedly and forcefully denied \n     allegations in the Russian media of tolerating corruption and \n     organized crime. As the governor of an immense territory with \n     valuable forests and rich fishing grounds north of Japan, \n     Nazdratenko is a political powerhouse and runs his region \n     with little supervision from authorities in faraway Moscow.\n       In Seattle, Stepashin told business leaders: ``There are \n     good prospects for investment in Russia, so please don't lose \n     any time.''\n       But Fox, who has lived in Vladivostok for seven years and \n     represents foreigners with more than $100 million invested in \n     the area, says he would like to ask Stepashin: ``Which bits \n     of Russia are you talking about?''\n       ``Everyone knows it is a risky thing to invest in Russia,'' \n     Fox added. ``But it's so outrageous what's being done'' in \n     Vladivostok. ``It's total lawlessness. Is that where Russia \n     is heading?'' Fox asked. ``If so, then there is no sense in \n     spending money there, and Russia is going to go backwards.''\n       Acknowledging the complaints of many foreign investors, \n     Stepashin told members of a U.S.-Russia business council in \n     Washington last night that ``all investments have to be \n     protected not only in word, but in deed.'' He said, ``We \n     understand that investors have every reason to be weary,'' \n     but added that ``we are dead set on changing our attitude.''\n       Many of those who have suffered from the fickle nature of \n     Russia's economic system are in Seattle, the first stop in \n     Stepashin's U.S. visit.\n       Gens estimates that one Vladivostok fishing trawler \n     company, Zao Super, owes tens of millions of dollars to \n     Seattle-area suppliers of nets, fuel, spare parts and \n     maintenance services. Yet the Russian Committee of Fisheries \n     on July 2 transferred most of Zao Super's main assets--the \n     fishing boats--to another company whose major shareholder and \n     chairman is a close associate of Nazdratenko.\n       Zao Super, which allegedly was told to divert money to \n     Nazdratenko's campaign, has $350 million in debts being \n     renegotiated by the Paris Club, a creditors' group comprised \n     of the governments of leading industrialized nations.\n       Despite these and other economic problems, Stepashin is \n     widely expected to receive support in Washington for Russia's \n     quest for $4.5 billion in loans from the International \n     Monetary Fund and up to $2 billion from the World Bank. He \n     will meet with officials of those institutions on Wednesday. \n     The IMF funding is important to negotiations on rescheduling \n     Russia's crushing debts. Russia, which has $17 billion in \n     debt payments due this year, already has defaulted on many \n     obligations.\n       The IMF has been reluctant to support Russia since a \n     combination of capital flight, poor tax collection, weak \n     budget controls, corruption and lumbering state enterprises \n     led to a collapse of the Russian currency, the ruble, in \n     August 1998.\n       But senior U.S. and IMF officials have been equally \n     reluctant to isolate Russia by cutting off economic \n     assistance.\n       ``We are going ahead with a package which I hope is \n     credible, which I hope will be implemented fully,'' Alassane \n     Quattara, deputy managing director of the IMF, told Reuters. \n     ``The first intentions and the first measures taken by the \n     new government are quite positive. . . . The board knows the \n     parameters, the difficulties and the risks.''\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, instead of jumping on the bandwagon to \npump billions of additional tax dollars into a black hole in Russia, \nthe administration should be pressing the Russian leadership, including \nPrime Minister Stepashin, to root out the kinds of bribery and \ncorruption described in this article that have an overall chilling \neffect on much needed foreign investment. Left unchecked, such \ncorruption will continue to undermine Russia's fledgling democracy and \nthe rule of law and further impede moves toward a genuine free market \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9738-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9738-S9740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VA HEALTH CARE SHORTFALLS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I address the Chair on a subject that is critical to the \nveterans of the armed forces of our nation, and to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, which I am privileged to chair: the budget for the \nhealth care system of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor of the United States Senate today \nto draw attention to a sure crisis in VA health care. Congress and the \nAdministration must ask ourselves: what is the crisis, and what may be \nthe acceptable remedy? It seems that the Department of Veterans Affairs \nmust choose among difficult options of providing care for fewer \nveterans--that is, ``disenroll'' veterans already expecting care from a \nVA provider or plan; increase waiting times; cut VA staff; lower \nquality of care; close and consolidate numerous facilities, or Congress \nmust increase VA's budget. For my money, Mr. President, the choice is \nclear and simple: we must act to increase VA's appropriation, and we \nmust do so now.\n  Yesterday after years of denial, the Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Jacob Lew made an amazing discovery--that \nthere are problems in the VA health care system due to funding \nshortfalls. I ask unanimous consent that the text of OMB Director Jacob \nLew's letter of July 26, 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 1999.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Later this week we plan to send a fully \n     offset budget amendment to add $1 billion to support the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care system. \n     Since the publication of our budget, we have become \n     increasingly concerned about reports of increased waiting \n     times and other operational problems in the system.\n       Much has changed since January. As the VA has moved from a \n     largely inpatient system to an outpatient one, we have found \n     that the analysis and execution of these profound shifts are \n     more complex than initially believed. For example, in FY 1999 \n     alone, we expect to open 70 new community-based outpatient \n     clinics from resources previously used for inpatient \n     services. The movement of these resources has proven more \n     difficult this year than in the first years of the \n     transformation of VA. As VA has improved access to care \n     through community clinics and continuity through universal \n     primary care provider teams, additional veterans have sought \n     care in VA. While the net cost of these new users is not \n     fully understood yet, they have stressed parts of the system \n     where management and operational flexibility is minimal. For \n     example, waiting times in primary care have increased in \n     several geographic areas.\n       The nationwide enrollment of veterans for medical care \n     services was required for the first time in 1999. It was \n     decided in this first year to open enrollment to all \n     veterans, including higher-income non-service disabled \n     veterans who were traditionally treated on a space-available \n     basis only. As of April 30, we have provided treatment to \n     almost 2.7 million veterans, 0.4 million of whom are new \n     users of the system.\n       The resources needed for this mixture of complex dynamics \n     are greater than expected when the President's FY 2000 budget \n     was prepared. We will be requesting $800 million in \n     additional funds to ensure quality and reduce waiting times \n     that have grown significantly over the last few months. To \n     ensure proper funding for spinal cord injury and \n     homelessness, the Department will forward to the Congress a \n     detailed description of how it will allocate a portion of \n     these additional funds to these two areas.\n       Waiting times are also aggravated by an infrastructure not \n     conducive to rapid change. VA is saddled with an \n     infrastructure that no longer meets geographical and \n     treatment needs. Recently, GAO reported that VA is spending \n     $1 million per day on unneeded, outmoded facilities. We will \n     be requesting $100 million for construction activities that \n     will begin to ease the immediate problem and to plan for the \n     long-range solution. We hope to work with the Congress over \n     the next few months to address this critical issue on a broad \n     and sweeping basis.\n       The additional resources we are requesting are also \n     necessary to meet the critical challenge of providing long-\n     term care. The overwhelming response to the introduction in \n     Congress of the so called ``Millennium Bill'' combined with \n     the President's commitment to long-term care for all \n     Americans has convinced us that we must increase available \n     funds immediately to meet these needs of our veterans. As our \n     veterans population ages, the need for long-term care is \n     increasing. We are committed to providing a range of home- \n     and community-based care for those high-priority veterans who \n     do not have access to such services. While we have concerns \n     with the mandatory approach of the Millennium Bill, we do \n     agree with the intent of the Bill. Consequently, we will be \n     including in our request $100 million for long-term non-\n     institutional community-based care, targeted to VA's top \n     priority category of veterans with disabilities of 50% or \n     greater.\n       At the same time that we add resources to the system, we \n     need to ensure that we are on target to provide care of the \n     highest quality, and that we are not overburdening the \n     system. We will therefore be discontinuing the enrollment of \n     category 7 veterans until such time as we feel confident that \n     we can accommodate these veterans in the system without \n     adverse consequences for service-disabled and lower-income \n     veterans. All veterans currently enrolled in the system will \n     continue to receive care. We believe that this action is \n     necessary to ensure that quality is maintained, that wait \n     times are reduced, and that we adhere to congressional \n     guidance. The House Committee on Veterans Affairs issued \n     report language along with the VA enrollment law stating that \n     ``VA may not enroll or otherwise attempt to treat so many \n     patients as to result either in diminishing the quality\n\n[[Page S9739]]\n\n     of care to an unacceptable level or unreasonably delaying the \n     timeliness of VA's care delivery.''\n       We are convinced that through these aggressive steps VA \n     will be able to provide better care, and more timely care to \n     the veterans that are in most need. We look forward to \n     working with you, the other members of your respective \n     committees, and the Congress as a whole to make these \n     proposals a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. OMB postures--implausibly--that much has changed since \nJanuary 1999, but veterans organizations in their Independent Budget \nhave been warning Congress and the Administration for the past three \nyears running that VA health care is in dire straits. On April 30 of \nthis year, 50 of my colleagues joined Senator Rockefeller and me in \nsigning a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nAppropriations Committee, requesting that VA health care be \nsupplemented with $1.7 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. My discussions \nwith VA officials lead me to believe that, while such a supplement will \nnot eliminate VA's problems, these funds will go a long way to easing \nits crisis and will back-fill gaps that we have permitted to occur \nbased solely on resource shortages. In his July 26 letter, Director Lew \nrefers to the need for $100 million in new health-related construction; \nas Chairman of the authorizing committee for VA major construction, I \ncannot reply, not having seen a proposal for sites or specific \njustifications. He also admits that so-called ``category 7'' veterans \ncannot continue to be enrolled in VA care for fear that quality of care \nfor higher priority poor and service-disabled veterans will suffer. \nWhile I concur with Director Lew's premise that we do no harm to those \nalready enrolled in VA health care, I must reserve judgment until I see \nthe basis for this conclusion about the middle class veteran. The \nAdministration is proposing $1 billion is emergency funding, but I \nbelieve, as I have since last year, that this level still would be \ninsufficient overall.\n  Mr. President, as to more recent developments even than OMB's late-\ncoming realization of need, I appreciate the work of the House \nAppropriations Sub-Committee last evening to add $1 billion in \nadditional spending to the VA health care appropriation for the new \nyear. Like my counterparts in the House, I want to help the system help \nveterans, as we all do. I want to do so with great care, as we all do. \nHowever, as I said earlier about the Administration's $1 billion, I say \nthat the House's $1 billion is only enough to push the problem down the \nroad a little further. We need to solve the problem, not push it down \nthe road. We can do that with a substantial increase of $1.7 billion in \nthe Medical Care appropriation for Fiscal Year 2000--a supplement that \nwould take VA health care funding to the unprecedented level of $19 \nbillion--and let us join together to see what kind of sustained funding \nlevel VA truly needs to carry out its important and vital mission for \nAmerica's veterans. I proposed then, and remind the Senate now, that \n$1.7 billion is needed to keep VA's head above water.\n  America's veterans put a human face on freedom. Veterans agreed to \nput their lives on the line, or certainly they were prepared to do so, \nto defend the very freedoms all of us enjoy. Most of them sought \nnothing in return. They served honorably, then returned to civilian \nlife. However, some of these veterans whom we turned to for assistance \nin our time of need have now turned to the nation in their time of \nneed. I am referring specifically to those who were disabled during \ntheir service to the nation and those who for one reason or another \nhave been left behind in this competitive economy and cannot sustain \nthemselves. For these people in particular we established the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and its many programs for veterans and \ntheir families.\n\n  We have given VA a mission, one most astutely described by President \nAbraham Lincoln during his second inaugural address when the President \nsaid, the Nation's mission was ``. . . to care for him who shall have \nborne the battle and for his widow and his orphan.'' Lincoln's eloquent \nwords describe VA's success for most of its existence. It is a system \nwhose sole purpose is to recognize that veterans make a special \ncontribution to society, and therefore deserve special status and \nattention by a grateful nation. It saddens me to report to the Senate \nthat this Administration is failing our veterans. But I do not intend \nto sit idly by and allow veterans' needs to go unnoticed and unmet.\n  In Fiscal Year 1999, Congress appropriated $17.3 billion to fund the \nhealth care activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. I know \nthat many of my colleagues have heard while traveling throughout your \nrespective states that this amount was barely enough to allow VA to \nprovide decent care for veterans. Earlier this year, the President sent \nCongress a budget that requested precisely the same amount for next \nyear. Mr. President, that request is completely unacceptable to me, and \nI know it is for all my colleagues here.\n  The VA, under the leadership of the most recent Under Secretary for \nHealth, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, made remarkable changes in the way health \ncare is provided to eligible and enrolled veterans. The VA launched a \nveritable revolution in its delivery system by changing the basic \nstructure of care delivery from one that treated patients in a so-\ncalled ``sickness model,'' a mostly reactive stance that was premised \non a veteran seeking care for a specific ailment, to one of a \nfunctioning health care system that offers a basic benefits package of \nservices to enrolled veterans, including preventive medical treatment, \nprimary care, alternatives to institutionalization, pharmaceuticals and \nlimited long term care programs, all premised on maintining a veteran's \nhealth. Further, according to testimony given before the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, VA has opened hundreds of local community-based \noutpatient clinics, reduced the number of days patients must spend in \nhospitals and, according to testimony by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, still treats any veteran who arrives at VA's doorstep. \nUnfortunately, both the Secretary and the President of the United \nStates have failed to recognize that this system, like any health care \nsystem, needs sufficient funding to function properly. It is impossible \nto increase the quality of care provided, increase the number of places \nat which care can be obtained and increase the number of people who can \nreceive care without providing any additional resources. This is \nimpossible on its face, Mr. President--impossible.\n  The budget the President sent to Congress would not even permit the \nVA to maintain the current services it provides to veterans today. In \nfact, in order to maintain today's level of service, the budget admits \nthat VA must ``streamline'' itself to the tune of $1.14 billion in FY \n2000. But we already know that VA cannot maintain the status quo. There \nare so many challenges facing the system and the veterans it treats \nthat we as a Congress, and the President as Chief Executive, must \naddress. For example, the package of benefits available to our veterans \ntoday does not include basic emergency care services. Today, if a \nveteran must visit a private hospital emergency room for treatment, in \nmost cases payment is out-of-pocket, or through a third party insurance \nclaim, Medicare or Medicaid, that may cover this care. The only \nexception to this policy is for service connected conditions in limited \nemergency situations, for which VA will reimburse expenses. A bill \nrecently reported out of my Committee would correct this injustice and \nmandate that any veteran enrolled in VA care be provided basic, covered \nemergency services if they are needed. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that this provision will cost $80 million in the first year \nand approximately $400 million over five years.\n  Emergency care is just the tip of the VA's health care ``iceberg.'' \nFor example, another very important issue is one that dramatically \naffects Vietnam veterans. According to a recent VA survey, nearly 18% \nof veterans in VA care could be afflicted with the disease hepatitis C. \nHepatitis C is a serious disease that has been associated with \nbattlefield injuries, blood transfusions and intravenous drug use. \nHepatitis C causes liver damage and, as one can imagine, ultimately \nhepatitis C can be fatal. Fortunately, there are a number of new drug \ntherapies  available that will help control or arrest the progress of \nhepatitis C. However, treatment is expensive. VA estimates that they \nneed\n\n[[Page S9740]]\n\napproximately $135 million in FY 2000 to screen, test and car for \nveterans suffering from hepatitis C, and much more in the future. This \nspecial funding for hepatitis C would be in addition to the amount \nneeded to maintain the status quo in VA health care that the President \nhas otherwise proposed.\n\n  Frankly, Mr. President and colleagues, the most difficult challenge \nfacing the Department into the foreseeable future is its ability to \ncare for our aging veteran population. Many World War II and Korean War \nveterans are nearing the end of life. But hundreds of thousands of them \nneed long term care services, and the numbers grow dramatically while \nthe overall veteran population declines. VA maintains over 120 nursing \nhomes now, and has thousands of contracts with private nursing \nfacilities and other long term care providers. If the VA is going to do \nmore than simply maintain these programs--which I argue may be \nexceedingly difficult to do, given other challenges--rather than expand \nthem to fit the changing demographic face of VA's patient population, \nadditional resources will be needed. There is no question about this \nfact, Mr. President, and no real choice but to do it, in my view.\n  Until yesterday, in response to all of these challenges, the \nAdministration proposed to make one major move to address the crisis \nsituation: cut health care off. As incredible as it may seem, VA is \nproposing employee ``buyout'' authority for the Veterans Health \nAdministration. Based on my analysis of this request and its \nimplications, I concluded that buyout legislation was really a sell \nout, offering a golden handshake to those whom really needed to stay. \nIt is the wrong move, and I am most pleased to say so.\n  VA proposes to buy out--that means reduce--its current workforce by \nabout 15,000 staff over a five-year period, by use of a voluntary \nseparation incentive payment of up to $25,000 to each such employee who \nleaves by retiring. I think most of you would agree that health care is \nan enterprise that needs, above all else, trained staff. So, as I \nmentioned earlier, VA says it strives to increase quality, access and \nthe number of patients enrolled, but would do so without additional \nfinancial resources and with a greatly reduced work force. I cannot \nforesee how these kinds of results are at all possible. How could it be \nso? A retirement bonus is a fine gesture, but how does it help \nveterans?\n  The VA buyout proposal was accompanied by a weak ``strategic plan.'' \nVA cannot say with any degree of confidence how it could continue to \nprovide care to all of the veterans the Secretary has admitted to the \nsystem with his ``open door'' policies, if the staff were so severely \nreduced. In fact, it appeared to me that what VA intended to do in its \n``real'' strategic plan--a plan that is yet to be revealed to us--was \nsimply to increase waiting time which already is at unacceptably high \nlevels in many places across the country. As but one small example, Mr. \nPresident, let me review for you the most recent facts on VA waiting \ntimes from VA medical centers in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \nThese statistics deal only with primary care appointments, not \nspecialty care: 34 days of waiting in Altoona; 31-60 days in Lebanon; \nup to 54 days in Pittsburgh; up to 64 days at the Sayre clinic; and up \nto 94 days of waiting in Wilkes-Barre. Looking at a medical specialty \nthat is crucial for aging veterans, let me report to my colleagues \nwaiting times for VA urology clinics in Pennsylvania: 85 days in \nAltoona; 90 days in Philadelphia; up to 95 days in Pittsburgh.\n  I know that the distinguished Ranking Member of my Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, has been very concerned about waiting times at VA \nhospitals in West Virginia; Senator Campbell is alarmed about the \nsituation at the Medical Center in Fort Lyon, Colorado and has said so; \nand Senator Murray has relayed her concerns about the status of VA \nfacilities in the state of Washington. But these problems are \neverywhere, Mr. President. These kinds of delays in care are not \nacceptable for our veterans. In fact, I would argue that a waiting time \nof 60 days for an outpatient primary care appointment or an enrolled \nveteran constitutes nothing; such a patient is not really receiving \ncare from VA.\n  I ask my colleagues: is this a situation that you are comfortable in \ndefending? I am not, and I am not willing to remain silent while \nveterans receive nothing from a grateful nation. VA needs these funds, \nand this need is clear. Let the United States Senate not shrink from \nits duty. Let us do the right thing for America's veterans by providing \nan emergency supplement of $1.7 billion in funding in Fiscal Year 2000 \nto help VA help our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9740-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9740-S9741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RABBI SOLOMON SCHIFF\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is a tremendous honor to welcome a \ndistinguished religious leader and member of the South Florida \ncommunity to the United States Senate: Rabbi Solomon Schiff of the \nGreater Miami Jewish Federation's Community Chaplaincy Service.\n  This morning, my colleagues and I were privileged to have Rabbi \nSchiff participate in a long-standing tradition by leading the Senate \nin prayer. His eloquence reminds us that while our legislative efforts \nto make the United States a better place to live, work, and raise our \nfamilies is important, it pales in contrast with our responsibilities \nto the Almighty. On behalf of every member of the United States Senate, \nI want to thank Rabbi Schiff for his words of inspiration.\n  It is no accident that Solomon Schiff was asked to lead us in our \ndaily devotions. His long record of service to individuals in Florida, \nAmerica, and around the world has distinguished him as not only a \nprominent spiritual leader but also a leader in his community.\n  Since his graduation from Brooklyn College, the University of Miami, \nand the Hebrew Theological Seminary in Illinois, Rabbi Schiff has \nserved as Chairman of the Board of License of the Central Agency for \nJewish Education, President of both the South Florida and Florida \nChaplains Association, Chairman of the Metropolitan Dade Community \nRelations Board, Chairman of the Chaplaincy Service Advisory Council \nfor the Florida Department of Corrections, and Secretary, Vice \nPresident, and President of the Rabbinical Association of Greater \nMiami.\n  Rabbi Schiff's current leadership positions confirm his dedication to \nservice. In addition to his duties as Director of the Greater Miami \nJewish Federation's Community Chaplaincy Service, he serves as Chairman \nof the National Council of Executives of Boards of Rabbis, Chairman of \nthe Community Hospice Council in South Florida, and as a member of the \nExecutive Committee of the National Rabbinic Cabinet of United Jewish \nAppeal.\n  Mr. President, Rabbi Solomon Schiff is a shining example of the moral \nand community leadership that our communities need as we enter a new \ncentury. I will conclude today by asking that a November 27, 1998, \narticle from the Sun-Sentinel of South Florida be included with my \nremarks. It discusses Awakening 2000, an interfaith initiative that \nencourages Floridians to engage the power of prayer and spiritual \nhealing in their daily lives and interactions with others.\n  Rabbi Schiff, a leader in this faith-based effort, was quoted as \nsaying that ``a total commitment by responsible people to try and bring \nsociety to a level of decency is the only way . . . that our society \nwill survive with a positive future.'' Mr. President, it gives me great \nreassurance that Solomon Schiff's wise counsel will help guide us into \nthat future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article I referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Sun-Sentinel--Ft.

Lawton Chiles and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush may differ on \n     politics, but the two have agreed to pray, forgive, smile and \n     sacrifice to get ready for the next millennium.\n       It's all part of an interfaith initiative called Awakening \n     2000, a project organized by Jim Towey, a former top state \n     official who picked Thanksgiving week to announce his \n     campaign for a spiritual renewal in Florida.\n       ``We feel we can build a better Florida one heart and soul \n     at a time by focusing on our spiritual resources, our \n     spiritual treasures,'' Towey said on Wednesday. ``And by \n     remembering God.''\n\n[[Page S9741]]\n\n       In getting ready for the future, Towey pointed to the past. \n     When Abraham Lincoln issued his Thanksgiving proclamation 135 \n     years ago, he said Americans had ``forgotten God.''\n       ``What he said in 1863 is absolutely true today,'' Towey \n     said.\n       Awakening 2000 will try to change that by getting \n     Floridians to sign pledge cards reminding them to pray each \n     day, reach out to people in need and perform several other \n     spiritual exercises.\n       The project also will sponsor a ``Summit of Faith'' next \n     fall and serve as an advocate for Florida's needy and \n     neglected, especially those who are dying.\n       After leaving state government, Towey formed a nonprofit \n     commission on Aging with Dignity that launched the popular \n     ``Five Wishes'' living will last year. Awakening 2000 is \n     sponsored by the same commission.\n       Several state leaders have agreed to participate in the \n     project, starting with Chiles, a Democrat and Presbyterian \n     who will be governor until Bush, a Republican and Catholic, \n     takes over on Jan. 5.\n       Towey, a Democrat like Chiles and a Catholic like Bush, \n     experienced a spiritual renewal in 1985 when he met Mother \n     Teresa. He said he was inspired to launch an interfaith \n     project by the late nun, a devout Catholic who respected and \n     cared for Hindus, Muslims and Jews.\n       Rabbi Solomon Schiff, director of chaplaincy at the Greater \n     Miami Jewish Federation, said he had signed onto the project \n     because the moral fiber of American society has been \n     devastated.\n       ``A total commitment by responsible people to try to . . . \n     bring it to a level of decency is the only way really that \n     our society will survive with a positive future,'' Schiff \n     said.\n       The list of people who have committed to take part in \n     Awakening 2000 includes Chief Justice Major Harding, \n     legislative leaders, Cabinet leaders, a federal judge and \n     Christian and Jewish leaders.\n       Chiles and Bush plan to sign the commitment cards in early \n     December.\n       But Towey said ``the fundamental driving force'' of the \n     campaign is the focus on the needy.\n       ``At Thanksgiving we remember the poor,'' he said. ``But \n     they need more than just a hot meal on a Thursday.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9741-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9741-S9742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE TAXPAYER REFUND ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we stand here today to celebrate good news. \nThis country is now facing the longest peacetime expansion in its \nhistory; the economy is growing; and the federal government is \npredicted to be running a surplus of $2.9 trillion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  The news is not all good. We are facing some pressing problems as \nwell. The world is seeing a shift in demographics. The impending \nretirement of the baby boom generation affects the workplace, \nretirement policy, and entitlement spending. Most notably, both the \nSocial Security system and Medicare are in financial trouble and need \nsubstantive reform. Public debt and the interest payments that go with \nit are continuing to grow. These issues cannot be ignored because of a \nstrong economy and good times.\n  The bill before us today represents a balanced package that takes \ninto account the problems as well as sharing in the good times. The \nbill will provide fiscally responsible tax relief over the next ten \nyears while reducing the public debt $200 billion more than the \nPresident's budget and still save the $1.9 trillion Social Security \nsurplus.\n  We all agree that the Social Security surplus should be reserved for \nthe Social Security system. That is not the debate. The big debate here \ntoday is how do we best handle the non-Social Security surplus in the \nfederal budget.\n  Many of my colleagues have argued that this bill is too large--that \n$792 billion is too much. They argue that we should save this money for \nMedicare and other spending. I strongly disagree. It is important that \nwe not forget those who are responsible for the surplus--hard-working, \nover-paying taxpayers. After all, what is a surplus--it is excess \nrevenues over the amount needed to fund government operations.\n  Taxes in this country are at their highest levels since World War II. \nAmerican families have seen the percentage of their personal income \nthat goes to pay taxes grow from 23 percent in 1990 to 26%. The average \ntaxpayer from Utah, or any other state in America, will pay nearly \n$7,000 more in taxes over the next 10 years than the federal government \nneeds, excluding the Social Security program. This is where the surplus \nis coming from--individual taxpayers who are turning over their hard-\nearned wages to pay taxes. It is only fair that we return this surplus \nto the rightful owners. After all, we would expect the electric or \npower company to rebate an overpayment, we should be able to expect the \nsame from the federal government.\n  The $2.9 trillion surplus is large enough to balance our priorities. \nThe Taxpayer Refund Act shows that we can provide meaningful tax cuts, \nprovide for Medicare reform, and reserve the Social Security surplus.\n  The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 provides a tax refund for everyone \nwho pays taxes by cutting the 15% tax rate and putting more middle \nclass taxpayers into lowest income bracket. 98 million taxpayers, 80 \nmillion with annual income under $75,000 would get a tax cut.\n  In addition, 19 million two-earner families filing married returns \nwill see their marriage penalty eliminated. It is sending the wrong \nsignal to American taxpayers when a couple with two incomes in Utah \nfaces a higher tax bill when they marry than they do as singles.\n  The bill also addresses the need for enhanced retirement security \nthrough enhanced employer plans and expanded IRAs. The demographics of \nthe American workforce are changing and our pension laws must adapt to \nmeet these new realities. By improving retirement systems to increase \naccess, simplify the rules, increase portability and provide small \nbusiness incentives, we help employers design and offer pension plans \nto meet the needs of today's employees.\n  Another important enhancement to our retirement security is making \ntax-preferred savings more widely available through expanded IRAs. This \nis particularly true for those without employer-provided pension and \nmiddle income taxpayers. In 1994, the median income of families owning \nan IRA was $48,600--hardly wealthy by any measure. This bill would make \nit easier for people to increase their savings for retirement.\n  This tax bill helps our families struggling to finance a quality \neducation for themselves and their children through tax-free treatment \nfor participants in college savings or prepaid tuition plans and \nrecipients of employer-provided educational assistance. The bill would \nalso expand the student loan interest deduction. This is real relief \nthat will help make education more affordable.\n  There are important provisions relating to school construction in \nthis bill. The need for more resources and innovative ideas to address \nthe issue of school construction and rehabilitation is reaching crisis \nproportions. My home state of Utah is expected to build 10-15 new \nschools a year. In the Jordan school district alone, 6 schools are \ncurrently under construction. In addition, Utah will spend $350 million \na year in new repairs. This bill would reduce the burden on small \nschool bond issuers in complying with cumbersome arbitrage rebate rules \nand will allow school districts to engage in public-private \npartnerships. The reduction in the cost and time of school construction \nprojects will result in more schools being built.\n  We have all heard about the challenge that providing adequate health \ncare that is facing the American families. The Taxpayer Refund Act \nprovides meaningful help for those who are struggling with the costs of \ninsurance through tax benefits for the self-employed, employees not \ncovered by employer plans, and consumers of long-term care insurance. \nThere is also an additional personal exemption for care-givers.\n\n  The bill also contains provisions that would help keep the economy \ngrowth strong. There is a package of international tax relief that \nprovides simplification and helps American companies which have \noperations overseas remain competitive and continue to grow.\n  The expiring tax credits are extended for five years and the research \nand experimentation tax credit is made permanent. This tax credit \nenhances and encourages the development of new technologies and \nproducts. This is the only way the U.S. can maintain its leadership in \nthe high-tech world of today into the next millennium. This is very \nimportant to future economic growth. It has been said that innovation \nis the leading factor driving increased productivity and job creation. \nInnovation predominantly derives from the private sector research and \ndevelopment which are encouraged by the tax credit.\n\n[[Page S9742]]\n\n  This bill is not perfect, however, and there are some things that I \nwould like to change. For instance, the bill does provide some relief \nfrom the estate tax by cuts in the top estate tax rate and an exemption \nthat rises to $1.5 million per estate. This will provide tax relief for \nestates of all sizes. However, I strongly believe that we should go \neven further and repeal this tax altogether.\n  The ``death tax'' is unfair and inefficient. For every dollar that we \ncollect, roughly 65 cents is spent complying and collecting this tax. \nThis is the wrong way to use up our resources. I know that many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have labeled this a tax on \nthe wealthy. They are wrong. The wealthy hire lawyers and advisers to \ncreate trusts and do estate planning to minimize the amount of tax they \nwill pay. It is the small business owners and family farmers that are \nhit the hardest by this tax. We must find a way to remove this crushing \nburden from their backs.\n  Another important area that is not addressed in this bill is the \ncapital gains tax rate. This too has often been labeled as a tax cut \nfor the rich. This is not true. Million of Americans are becoming \ninvestors. They purchase stock and mutual funds directly or they invest \ndirectly through stock options, employee stock ownership plans or \n401(k)s. Roughly half of American households now have some sort of \nstock ownership, and the number grows every year.\n  A recent DRI study has shown that the 1997 capital gains tax rate \ncuts contributed to the strong economic growth we have experienced in \nthe last couple of years. Cutting the capital gains tax rate from 28 \npercent to 20 percent reduced the cost of capital, increased business \ninvestment and contributed to the increase in stock prices. We need to \ncontinue along the same path and continue to reduce the capital gains \nrates.\n  It is easy to get lost in the debate over numbers and how we should \nspend the surplus. But we must remember who sent us the revenue that \ncreated the surplus. We are talking about families struggling to make \nends meet, provide an education for their children, or save for their \nretirement. They are the family running the corner grocery store or \nlandscaping business. They are bus drivers, day care providers, \ncarpenters and students. They work 3 hours a day on average just to pay \ntheir taxes.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 is a balanced tax cut package that \nprovides relief for middle class taxpayers. It gives American families \na well-deserved tax break, simplifies the tax code, and provides pro-\ngrowth incentives to help keep the economy strong and growing. This \n$792 billion bill is the biggest tax cut since the Ronald Reagan \npresidency. Yet, it still represents a rebate of only one quarter of \nthe surplus dollars that the federal government has collected. We owe \nthe American taxpayers that much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9742-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to assess \nopportunities to increase carbon storage on national forests derived \nfrom the public domain and to facilitate voluntary and accurate \nreporting of forest projects that reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide \nconcentrations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n      THE FOREST RESOURCES FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE ECONOMY ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Senator Craig and I are introducing a \nbill that will help protect the global climate system by improving \nlocal natural resource management and strengthening the economy in \nrural communities. The Forest Resources for the Environment and the \nEconomy Act of 1999 will expand the nation's forested lands and provide \neffective tools for including forests in our national efforts to fight \nglobal warming. The bill focuses on forests because they are the lungs \nof our planet. Investing in healthy forests is an investment in the \nhealth of our environment today and the well-being of our planet for \ndecades to come.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, forests are more than critical \nenvironmental resources--they are also a cornerstone of our economy. In \ndebates about forest policies, there are those who have advocated an \nexclusively environmental pathway, and others who have stressed an \nexclusively economic pathway. This bill is part of what I believe is a \nthird pathway through the woods--a path to both stronger rural \neconomies and healthier forests. It will reduce the buildup of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere and help protect our global climate \nfor ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. It will provide \nimproved wildlife and fish habitats and protect our waterways. It will \nenhance our national forests by reducing water pollution within their \nwatersheds. It will provide jobs in the forestry sector in areas that \nhave been hard hit by declining timber harvests. And it will grow \nadditional timber resources on underproductive private lands.\n  The legislation does all of this through an entirely voluntary, \nincentive-based approach. The bill makes new resources available to \nprivate landowners through state-operated revolving loan programs that \nprovide assistance for tree planting and other forest management \nactions. By quantifying forests' contribution to climate protection, \nthe bill puts the free market to work at turning the initial Federal \ninvestment into a long-term source of non-federal funding for forestry \nprojects. And the bill takes an important first step toward reducing \ngreenhouse gases on Federal lands by directing the Forest Service to \nreport to Congress on options to increase carbon storage in our \nnational forests.\n  I am deeply concerned about the risks that we are taking with our \nunprecedented experiment with the global climate system. Global climate \nchange may jeopardize critical forest and other natural resources that \nare closely tied with Oregon's economy and our citizens' quality of \nlife. Water managers in the Northwest may be faced with daunting \nchallenges if the predicted climate changes, such as drier, hotter \nsummers, complicate protection and management of water supplies. Over \nthe last Century, the average temperature in Corvallis, Oregon has \nincreased 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit, and average temperatures across \nOregon could increase by 5 degrees or more over the next century, \nputting the elderly in Oregon especially at risk from more intense heat \nwaves. And sea level rise resulting from global warming could eliminate \nthe salt marshes along Tillamook and Coos Bay regions. Given these \npotential hazards of global warming, the challenge is to find \nstrategies to protect our quality of life that won't cause an economic \nmeltdown.\n  One of the key strategies for meeting this challenge is something \nthis planet has been doing for more than 300 million years--growing \nabundant and healthy forests. Forests are a critical part of our global \nclimate system. The total amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere \ndepends in part on the efficiency of forests and other natural \n``sinks'' that absorb carbon dioxide--the most significant greenhouse \ngas--from the atmosphere. In fact, the world's forests contain 200 \ntimes as much carbon as is emitted to the atmosphere each year from \nburning fossil fuels. The implications are as simple as they are \nscientifically sound--if we grow more trees, bigger trees, and \nhealthier trees, we will remove more greenhouse gases from the \natmosphere and help protect the global climate. According to the \nPacific Forest Trust, our forest lands in the United States are only \nstoring one-quarter of the carbon they can ultimately store. Just \ntapping a portion of this potential by expanding and increasing the \nproductivity of the nation's 737 million acres of forests is an \nimportant part of a win-win strategy to slow global warming.\n  And here's the good news--an ounce of investment in our forests is \nworth not only a pound of global warming cure, but also two pounds of \njobs and three pounds of protection for our waterways and wildlife. The \nbill that I am introducing today will not only protect our global \nenvironment, but also will\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\nprovide immediate dividends in terms of watershed and habitat \nprotection. It will provide jobs today for tree planting and forest \nmanagement, and jobs tomorrow in carbon accounting and monitoring to \nensure that greenhouse gas reductions are real and verifiable.\n  I recognize that global warming is a large problem that cannot be \nsolved by forestry actions alone. We need a portfolio of approaches, \nand I continue to strongly support research, development and deployment \nof energy efficient and renewable technologies that reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. But increasing our nation's forest lands is a key part \nof the solution and something we can do immediately. Forests may not be \na silver bullet that will solve the entire global warming problem, but \nthey are a silver lining to the problem that can provide jobs around \nthe country while taking a big step to reverse the buildup of \ngreenhouse gas in the atmosphere.\n  It is sometimes hard to believe that seven years ago Senators from \nboth parties proclaimed their universal support for taking action to \nprotect the climate system and reducing the buildup of greenhouse gases \nin the atmosphere. When the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change was ratified by the Senate, Senators from both parties \ncame to the floor to applaud this commitment to begin reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. We cannot afford to let the current debates \nabout international treaties paralyze this Congress into inaction when \nthere are opportunities here at home to protect our environment in ways \nthat also provide jobs and economic growth.\n  Forests are one of those opportunities. This bill will take the money \nthat polluters pay when they are caught violating the Clean Air Act and \nClean Water Act and use it to expand our forests, protect streams and \nrivers and help remove greenhouse gases from the air. In fiscal year \n1998, $45 million of these environmental penalties were assessed \nagainst polluters. There are currently no guarantees that these \npenalties, which revert to the General Fund, are used to improve our \nenvironment. This bill would make this money available as loans to \nsmall and medium landowners to cover the upfront costs of tree planting \nand other projects that grow healthy, productive forests and provide \nbetter wildlife habitats.\n\n  This bill is supported by the National Association of State Foresters \nand the Society of American Foresters. It responds to recent \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences by providing \nassistance to overcome the capital constraints that prevent non-\nindustrial, private forest land owners from growing healthy forests. \nAlmost 10 million landowners in the United States own 42 percent of \nnon-industrial, private forest land in parcels of less than 100 acres. \nAccess to these low-interest loans can empower these landowners to \nimprove their lands while providing global environmental protection.\n  Under the bill, State Foresters will be able to give loans for forest \nprojects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere while \nimproving habitats and protecting waterways. For example, loans will be \navailable for planting trees as buffer zones along salmon streams and \nrivers in areas that are currently being used by livestock or for crop \nproduction. Loans will be available to turn thin and poorly stocked \nforest lands into healthier and more productive lands that remove \ngreater amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and provide \nadditional timber resources on private lands. And loans will be \navailable to grow trees for use in bioenergy facilities that can \nprovide energy without increasing the greenhouse gases in our \natmosphere.\n  These loans must be repaid with interest--money that will be \nreinvested in additional loans to double and triple the impact of every \nfederal dollar over time. Loans may not be provided for reforestation \nactivities already required under any state or local laws. And the bill \nensures that people aren't paid to cut their existing trees in order to \nreceive funding for replanting afterwards.\n  A critical element of the bill is that it harnesses the power of the \nfree market to allow responsible businesses to invest in the nation's \nforests. Across the nation, companies are voluntarily seeking ways to \nreduce greenhouse gases. Some companies are going as far as sending \nmoney oversees to protect forests in other countries. Forests in Brazil \nare important, but forests in Bend, Oregon, can do just as good a job \nat fighting off global warming. In fact, our Northwest forests are some \nof the best carbon ``sinks'' in the world. This bill provides a way for \ncompanies to invest in American forests and know with accuracy the \namount of greenhouse gases that are removed from the atmosphere due to \ntheir investments. Once businesses recognize that the nation's forests \nare an opportunity for environmental investment, their entrepreneurial \ningenuity will generate new opportunities for consumers and other \nbusinesses to tap into this win-win opportunity.\n  We know that this approach works because of the leadership of my home \nState of Oregon. The loan program is modeled after the innovative \nForest Resource Trust, which was established in Oregon in 1993, and is \njust one of the many ways Oregon continues to lead the nation in state \nactions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am pleased to say that \nPacifiCorp announced last month that it is contributing $1.5 million to \nthe Forest Resource Trust to support tree planting and reduce \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leadership by PacifiCorp will \ncreate forestry jobs in Oregon, protect salmon and fish habitat, create \nnew wildlife habitats, and remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. \nI am introducing this bill to make sure that we take advantage of these \nopportunities across the country and encourage more businesses to \ninvest in the nation's forests.\n  In addition to establishing the state revolving loan programs, the \nbill makes important changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to \nstrengthen the voluntary accounting and verification of greenhouse gas \nreductions from forestry activities. The bill directs the Secretary of \nAgriculture to develop new guidelines on accurate and cost-effective \nmethods to account for and report real and credible greenhouse gas \nreductions. These guidelines will be developed with the input of a new \nadvisory board representing industry, foresters, states, and \nenvironmental groups.\n  This bill is about taking advantage of a clear win-win opportunity. \nIt's a win for the global environment. It's a win for sustainable \nforestry. It's a win for local water protection. And it's a win for \nrural communities.\n  For these reasons, the bill is already supported by timber companies \nand environmental organizations alike. I have already received \nsupportive letters from: American Forest and Paper Association, \nAmerican Forests, Environmental Defense Fund, Governor John A. \nKitzhaber of Oregon, National Association of State Foresters, \nPacifiCorp, Society of American Foresters, The Nature Conservancy, and \nThe Pacific Forest Trust.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that we \npursue this common-sense good step toward protecting the environment \nand supporting our forest workers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Section-by-Section Analysis of the \nForest Resources for the Environment and the Economy Act be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n The Forest Resources For The Environment And The Economy Act--Section-\n                          by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       The purpose of the bill is to promote sustainable forestry \n     in the United States by increasing forest carbon \n     sequestration, improving forest health, enhancing wildlife \n     and fish habitats, improving water quality, providing \n     employment and income to rural communities, providing new \n     sources of forest products and increasing use of renewable \n     biomass energy that improves the energy security of the \n     United States. The bill achieves these purposes through four \n     major actions:\n       (1) State Revolving Loan Programs. The bill provides \n     assistance to nonindustrial private forest landowners and \n     Indian tribes to grow new forests and increase the \n     productivity of existing forests in order to increase carbon \n     sequestration, protect watersheds and fish habitats and \n     improve wildlife diversity. Assistance to landowners will be \n     provided through State-based loan\n\n[[Page S9746]]\n\n     programs. The Federal share of funding for these State loan \n     programs will come from penalties that are being assessed \n     against violators of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water \n     Act (civil penalties assessed in FY 1998 totaled $45 \n     million).\n       (2) Guidelines for Accurate Carbon Accounting for Forests. \n     The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish \n     scientifically-based guidelines for accurate reporting, \n     monitoring and verification of carbon storage from forest \n     management actions. The bill establishes a multi-stakeholder \n     Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council to assist USDA in \n     developing the guidelines.\n       (3) Report on Options to Increase Carbon Storage on Federal \n     Lands. The bill directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     report to Congress on forestry options to increase carbon \n     storage in National Forests.\n       (4) National Forest Watershed Restoration Cooperative \n     Agreements. The bill allows the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     enter into cooperative agreements with willing State and \n     local governments, Indian tribes, private and nonprofit \n     entities, and landowners for protection, restoration and \n     enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other resources \n     on public land, Indian land or private land in a national \n     forest watershed.\n\n\n                         SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       The title of the bill is the ``Forest Resources for the \n     Environment and the Economy Act''.\n\n\n                    SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES\n\n       This section states the purpose of the bill, which is to \n     promote sustainable forestry in the United States by \n     increasing forest carbon sequestration, improving forest \n     health, enhancing wildlife and fish habitats, improving water \n     quality, providing employment and income to rural \n     communities, providing new sources of forest products and \n     increasing use of renewable biomass energy that improves the \n     energy security of the United States.\n       This section also states the findings of the bill, \n     including:\n       The Federal Government should increase the forest carbon \n     storage on public land while pursuing existing statutory \n     objectives, but insufficient information exists on the \n     opportunities to increase carbon storage on public land \n     through improvements in forest land management;\n       Important environmental benefits to national forests can be \n     achieved through cooperative forest projects that enhance \n     fish and wildlife habitats, water and other resources on \n     public or private land located in national forest watersheds;\n       Forest projects also provide economic benefits, including \n     employment and income that contribute to the sustainability \n     of rural communities and future supplies of forest products;\n       Monitoring and verification of forest carbon storage \n     provides an important opportunity to create employment in \n     rural communities and substantiate improvements in natural \n     habitats or watersheds due to forestry activities; and\n       Sustainable production of biomass energy feedstocks \n     provides a renewable source of energy that can reduce carbon \n     dioxide emissions and improve the energy security of the \n     United States by diversifying energy fuels.\n\n\n                         SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS\n\n       This section defines terms used in the bill, including the \n     following:\n       ``Forestry carbon activity'' is defined as a forest \n     management action that increases long-term carbon storage and \n     has a positive impact on watersheds, fish habitats and \n     wildlife diversity.\n       ``Forest carbon reservoir'' is defined as trees, roots, \n     soils or other biomass associated with forest ecosystems or \n     products from the biomass that store carbon.\n       ``Forest carbon storage'' is defined as the quantity of \n     carbon sequestered from the atmosphere and stored in forest \n     carbon reservoirs, including forest products.\n       ``Forest land'' is defined as land that is, or has been, at \n     least 10 percent stocked by forest trees of any size, \n     including land that had such forest cover and that will be \n     naturally or artificially regenerated, and including a \n     transition zone between a forested and nonforested area that \n     is capable of sustaining forest cover.\n       ``Forest management action'' is defined as the practical \n     application of forestry principles to the regeneration, \n     management, utilization and conservation of forests to meet \n     specific goals and objectives, while maintaining the \n     productivity of the forests. ``Forest management action'' \n     includes management of forests for aesthetics, fish, \n     recreation, urban values, water, wilderness, wildlife, wood \n     products and other forest values.\n       ``National forest watershed'' is defined as a watershed \n     that contains national forest land, that consequently has \n     unique interest to Federal land managers, and in which all \n     landowners, including the Federal Government, share interest \n     and influence in the management and health of the watershed.\n       ``Reforestation'' is defined as the reestablishment of \n     forest cover naturally or artificially, including planned \n     replanting, reseeding and managed natural regeneration.\n\n\n  section 4. carbon management on federal land; carbon monitoring and \n                        verification guidelines.\n\n       This section directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report \n     to Congress on carbon management on Federal land, and directs \n     the Secretary of Agriculture to develop guidelines for the \n     voluntary reporting, monitoring and verification of carbon \n     storage resulting from forest management actions. This \n     section is accomplished through amendment of Title XVI \n     (``Global Climate Change'') of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n       (a) Definitions. This subsection amends the Energy Policy \n     Act to add the definitions for ``forest carbon storage,'' \n     ``carbon storage program,'' ``forest carbon reservoir,'' \n     ``forest management action'' and ``sequestration'' that were \n     specified in Section 3.\n       (b) Carbon Management on Federal Land. This subsection \n     directs the Secretary of Agriculture to report to Congress \n     within one year on the quantity of carbon contained in the \n     forest carbon reservoir on Western national forests (i.e., \n     ``national forests derived from the public domain''). The \n     report will include an assessment of forest management \n     actions that can increase carbon storage on these national \n     forest lands while providing positive impacts on watersheds \n     and fish and wildlife habitats. Finally, the report will \n     include an assessment of the role of forests in the carbon \n     cycle and the contributions of forestry to the global carbon \n     budget. This subsection is accomplished by amendment to \n     section 1604 of the Energy Policy Act (``Assessment of \n     Alternative Policy Mechanisms for Addressing Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions'').\n       (c) Monitoring and Verification of Carbon Storage. This \n     subsection amends section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act \n     (``Voluntary Reporting'') by directing the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to review the existing Federal guidelines on \n     reporting, monitoring, and verification of carbon storage \n     from forest management actions. Within 18 months of enactment \n     and following an opportunity for public comment on the \n     existing guidelines, the Secretary of Agriculture will make \n     recommendations to the Secretary of Energy for amendment of \n     the guidelines.\n       Carbon and Forestry Advisory Council: This subsection also \n     directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an 18-\n     member, multi-stakeholder Carbon and Forestry Advisory \n     Council for the purpose of advising the Department of \n     Agriculture on: the development of the guidelines for \n     accurate voluntary reporting of greenhouse gas sequestration \n     from forest management actions; evaluating the potential \n     implementation of the guidelines; estimating the effect of \n     proposed implementation on atmospheric carbon mitigation; \n     reviewing and updating the guidelines; reporting to Congress \n     on the results of the carbon storage program established in \n     Section 5 of this bill; and assessing the vulnerability of \n     forests to climate change. The Advisory Council includes \n     experts on carbon sequestration representing Federal \n     agencies, the forestry industries, forestry workers and \n     professionals, States, environmental organizations and \n     landowners, as well as independent scientists. Terms of the \n     Advisory Council are staggered to ensure continuity from year \n     to year.\n       Criteria: The guidelines developed by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture must be based on: (1) measuring increases in \n     carbon storage in excess of that which would have occurred in \n     the absence of the forest management actions; and (2) \n     comprehensive carbon accounting that reflects net increases \n     in the carbon reservoir and takes into account any carbon \n     emissions resulting from disturbance of carbon reservoirs \n     existing at the start of forest management actions. The \n     guidelines must include options for estimating possible \n     leakage of carbon emissions to other lands, and for \n     quantifying the expected carbon storage over various time \n     periods, taking into account the likely duration of carbon \n     stored in the carbon reservoir.\n       Recommended practices: The guidelines must also include \n     recommended practices for monitoring, measurement and \n     verification of carbon storage from forest management actions \n     that, to the maximum extent practicable: are based \n     on statistically sound sampling strategies, are cost-\n     effective and allow pooled assessments across lands with \n     multiple owners.\n       Guidance to States: The guidelines will include guidance to \n     States for reporting, monitoring and verifying carbon storage \n     achieved under the carbon storage program established in \n     Section 5 of the bill.\n       Biomass energy projects: The guidelines will include \n     guidance on calculating net greenhouse gas reductions from \n     biomass energy projects, including net changes in carbon \n     storage resulting from changes in land use, and the effect \n     that using biomass to generate electricity (including \n     cofiring of biomass with fossil fuels) has on the \n     displacement of greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels.\n       Adoption of recommendations by DOE: The subsection directs \n     the Secretary of Energy,\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\n     acting through the Administrator of the Energy Information \n     Administration, to revise the existing voluntary reporting \n     guidelines to include the recommendations provided by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture.\n       Periodic review of guidelines: At least every 24 months, \n     the Secretary of Agriculture must convene the Advisory \n     Council, review the guidelines and revise the guidelines as \n     necessary, including to ensure consistency with any future \n     Federal laws that provide recognition, credit or reward for \n     reductions of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations \n     resulting from forest management actions.\n       Monitoring of State revolving loan programs: States \n     participating in the revolving loan program established in \n     Section 5 of the bill must report annually to the Secretary \n     of Agriculture on the results of the program. If a company or \n     non-governmental organization provides funding to the State \n     for specific projects, then the State shall report the carbon \n     achieved by those projects. The Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall review each of these reports, certify reports that are \n     in compliance with the guidelines established by USDA and \n     submit the certified report to the EIA Administrator for \n     inclusion in the 1605(b) voluntary reporting data base.\n\n\n      SECTION 5. CARBON STORAGE AND WATERSHED RESTORATION PROGRAM\n\n       This section directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     establish a program to provide assistance through State \n     revolving loan funds to Indian tribes and owners of \n     nonindustrial private forest land to undertake forestry \n     carbon activities. This section also allows the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements to protect \n     and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and other resources.\n       (a) National Forest Watershed Restoration Cooperative \n     Agreements. This subsection allows the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to enter into cooperative agreements with willing \n     State and local governments, Indian tribes, private and \n     nonprofit entities and landowners for protection, restoration \n     and enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other \n     resources on public land, Indian land or private land in a \n     national forest watershed. Projects under such a cooperative \n     agreement are eligible for loans discussed in the next \n     subsection. This subsection extends appropriations \n     authorities that were first provided under Section 334 of the \n     Interior and Related Appropriation Act for FY 1998 (``the \n     Wyden Amendment'').\n       (b) State Revolving Loan Funds. This subsection establishes \n     a program to provide assistance through State revolving loan \n     funds to Indian tribes and owners of not more than 5,000 \n     acres of nonindustrial private forest land. The assistance is \n     in the form of loans to support forestry carbon activities \n     that increase long-term carbon storage or provide new sources \n     of biomass feedstocks for renewable energy generation, and \n     that have a positive impact on watersheds, fish habitats and \n     wildlife diversity. The program will be administered by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture.\n       Guidance: USDA, in collaboration with States, will provide \n     guidance on eligible forestry carbon activities based on the \n     criteria of the bill, recognizing that States should have \n     maximum flexibility to achieve the purposes of the bill in \n     ways most appropriate for each State.\n       Prohibitions: Loans will not be issued for activities \n     required under other applicable Federal, State or local laws, \n     nor for costs incurred before entering into a loan agreement \n     with the State.\n       Limitation on land considered for funding: States shall not \n     enter into new loan agreements under the bill to fund \n     reforestation of land that has been harvested after enactment \n     if the landowner receives revenues from the harvest \n     sufficient to reforest the land.\n       Native species: Funding of reforestation activities shall \n     be provided only for a species that is native to a region, \n     with preference given to species that formerly occupied the \n     land.\n       Sustainable forest management plan: States must give \n     priority to projects on land under a sustainable forestry \n     management program or forest stewardship plan, if the \n     projects are consistent with the program or plan.\n       Loan amount: Loans can cover up to 100 percent of total \n     project costs, not to exceed $100,000 during any 2-year \n     period.\n       Repayment: Loans must be repaid to the State with interest \n     at a rate of at least 5 percent per annum. Loans are to be \n     repaid when the land is harvested, or in accordance with any \n     other repayment schedule determined by the State (for \n     example, a portion of proceeds from each timber sale to be \n     paid over more than one rotation).\n       Risk: Landowners do not have to repay loans for timber that \n     is lost to natural catastrophes or that cannot be harvested \n     because of government-imposed restrictions on timber \n     harvesting.\n       Lien: The loan terms will include a lien on all timber, \n     forest products and biomass grown on land covered by the \n     loan, with an assurance that the terms of the lien shall \n     transfer with the land on sale, lease or transfer of the \n     land.\n       Buyout option: The loan terms will specify financial terms \n     allowing the owner to pay off the loan with interest prior to \n     harvesting the timber specified in the loan.\n       Greenhouse gas reductions: A loan agreement must include \n     recognition that, until the loan is paid off or otherwise \n     terminated, all reductions in atmospheric greenhouse gases \n     achieved by projects funded by the loan are attributable to \n     the State that provides funding for the loan, or to any \n     company or NGO that provides funding for the loan via the \n     State program.\n       Permanent conservation easements: Loan recipients can \n     cancel the loan by donating to the State or another \n     appropriate entity a permanent conservation easement that \n     permanently protects the land and resources at a level above \n     what is required under applicable Federal, State and local \n     law and furthers the purposes of the bill, including managing \n     the land in a manner that maximizes the forest carbon \n     reservoir of the land.\n       Reinvestment of funds: All repayments collected by a State \n     must be reinvested in the program and used by the State to \n     make additional loans.\n       Records: The State Forester shall maintain all loan records \n     and make them available to the public.\n       Matching funds: A State must match Federal funding by at \n     least 25% beginning in the second year of participating in \n     the program.\n       Funding Distribution: Not later than 180 days after \n     enactment, the Secretary will report to Congress on a formula \n     under which Federal funds will be distributed among eligible \n     States. The formula will be based on maximizing the potential \n     for meeting the objectives of the bill, and give appropriate \n     consideration to:\n       The acreage of unstocked or underproducing private forest \n     land in each State within national forest watersheds; the \n     potential productivity of such land; the potential long-term \n     carbon storage of such land; the potential to achieve other \n     environmental benefits, such as restoration of native forest \n     communities in riparian areas; the number of owners eligible \n     for loans in each State; and the need for reforestation, \n     timber stand improvement, or other forestry investments \n     consistent with the objectives of the bill.\n       The formula will give priority to States that have \n     experienced or are expected to experience significant \n     declines in employment levels in the forestry industries due \n     to declining timber harvests on Federal land.\n       Private funding: A revolving loan fund may accept and \n     distribute as loans any funds provided by nongovernmental \n     organizations, businesses or persons in support of the \n     purposes of this Act.\n       Bonneville Power Administration (BPA): States served by BPA \n     (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana) may apply for funding \n     from BPA for purposes of funding loans that meet both the \n     objectives of this Act and the fish and wildlife objectives \n     of BPA under current law. Any such application will be \n     subject to the same rules and procedures as any other \n     application.\n       Authorization of Appropriations: For the state revolving \n     loan program, this subsection authorizes funding from FY 2001 \n     to FY 2010 at amounts equal to civil penalties collected \n     under the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, which \n     currently revert to the Treasury as General Revenues. In \n     fiscal year 1998, $45 million in penalties were assessed. \n     Because penalty assessments can not be accurately predicted \n     in advance, authorization in any given year would be based on \n     the penalties assessed two years preceding.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1458. A bill to provide for a reduction in the rate of adolescent \npregnancy through the evaluation of public and private prevention \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                     teen pregnancy reduction bill\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, despite the recent declines in teen birth \nrates in general, the overall teen birth rate for 1996 is still higher \nthan it was in the early to mid-1980s, when the rate was at its lowest \npoint. In fact, United States has the highest rates of teen pregnancy \nand births in the western industrialized world. More than 4 out of 10 \nyoung women in the U.S. become pregnant at least once before they reach \nthe age of 20--nearly one million a year.\n  Unfortunately, my home state of Nevada has the highest teen pregnancy \nrate in the country--140 pregnancies per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in \n1996.\n  Teen pregnancy affects us all. Teen mothers are less likely to \ncomplete high school, and more likely to end up on welfare (nearly 80 \npercent of unmarried teen mothers end up on welfare). Teen pregnancy \ncosts the United States at least $7 billion annually. The children of \nteenage mothers have lower birth weights, are more likely to perform \npoorly in school, and are at greater risk of abuse and neglect. The \nsons of teen mothers are 13 percent more likely to end up in prison \nwhile teen daughters are 22 percent more likely to become teen mothers \nthemselves.\n  Teen pregnancy has become a significant problem in America's fastest \ngrowing ethnic group--the Hispanic community. Latinos currently \nconstitute approximately 11 percent of the total U.S. population. By \n2010, Latinos will be the largest minority group, and by 2050 \napproximately one-quarter of the U.S. population will be Latino.\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\n  Latinas have the highest teen birth rate among the major racial/\nethnic groups in the United States. In 1997, the birth rate for Latina \n15- to 19-year-olds was 97.4 per 1,000, nearly double the national rate \nof 52.3 per 1,000. Approximately one-quarter of the births in 1997 to \nteens aged 15 to 19 were to Latinas. Further, the teen birth and \npregnancy rates for Latinas have not decreased as much in recent years \nas have the overall U.S. teen birth and pregnancy rates.\n  To combat the plague of teen pregnancy in this country, I am \nintroducing the ``Teenage Pregnancy Reduction Act of 1999.'' In so \ndoing, I join Congresswoman Lowey, who has introduced the House \ncompanion bill.\n  The Teenage Pregnancy Reduction Act of 1999 will provide in-depth \nevaluation of promising teenage pregnancy prevention programs. Experts \non teen pregnancy have informed us that such an evaluation is very \nneeded. This three year evaluation will be funded at $3.5 million per \nyear. The bill requires that a report of the evaluation's results be \nmade to Congress, and the results be disseminated to the administrators \nof prevention programs, medical associations, public health services, \nschool administrators and others. In addition, the bill provides for \nthe establishment of a National Clearinghouse on Teenage Pregnancy \nPrevention Programs. Lastly, the bill provides $10 million for a one-\ntime incentive grant to programs that complete the evaluation and are \nfound to be effective.\n  Social problems like teen pregnancy are not happening in a vacuum, \nindependent from other social problems. Nevada has the highest teen \npregnancy rate, and it also has the highest high school dropout rate. \nObviously, these two issues are related. Only one-third of teen mothers \nreceive a high school diploma.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have offered a dropout bill similar to the \nteen pregnancy bill I introduce today. Both bills look to what states \nand communities are doing now and focus on those programs that are \nworking. We can then help states and communities replicate these \nsuccessful programs. But we are not going to totally solve problems \nlike teen pregnancy through programs and legislation--we need to talk \nto our children. Studies show that teenagers who have strong emotional \nattachments to their parents are much less likely to become sexually \nactive at an early age. We cannot legislate parents talking to their \nchildren, but we can provide the information and programs that will \nhelp parents work with their teens.\n  I would like to acknowledge the National Campaign to Prevent Teen \nPregnancy, whose mission is to reduce the teen pregnancy rate by one-\nthird between 1996 and 2005. I think that we can accomplish this goal, \nand I will do all that I can to help.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Robb):\n  S. 1459. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprotect the right of a Medicare beneficiary enrolled in a \nMedicare+Choice plan to receive services at a skilled nursing facility \nselected by that individual; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  MEDICARE RETURN TO HOME ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nMrs. Feinstein, Mr. Helms and Mr. Robb, in sponsoring the Medicare \nReturn to Home Act of 1999.\n  This legislation will ensure that senior citizens enrolled in \nMedicare+Choice health plans who normally reside in continuing care \nretirement communities or nursing homes have the opportunity to return \nto the same facility after a period of hospitalization. Many of the \nretirement communities contain fully licensed facilities established to \nprovide skilled nursing services to their residents when required them. \nOften, people choose a continuing care retirement community because of \nthe different levels of care that will be available to them as they age \nin that community. These living arrangements allow couples and \nindividuals to maintain their independence by having the ability to \nmove in and out of various levels of care according to their needs over \ntime. People who are fully independent when they move into a \nresidential community often require assisted living, skilled nursing \ncare or some other assistance over the course of their lifetime in \nresidence.\n  An increasing number of seniors have chosen Medicare+Choice plans as \nthe way that they wish to receive health care services under Medicare. \nThese plans reduce the potential for substantial out-of-pocket costs \nfor the very sick which might be the experience with the traditional \noriginal Medicare plan.\n  One unfortunate consequence of the Medicare+Choice option involves \nthe inability of seniors to return to their chosen community or nursing \nhome where they resided following a period of hospitalization. Some \nMedicare+Choice plans will only permit patients to be discharged from \nthe hospital to a facility with which the Medicare+Choice plan has a \ncontract. Then, patients cannot return to the residential community \nthat they selected, which may have been chosen because it included a \nskilled nursing facility. Nor can they return to the nursing home in \nwhich they had previously resided. This can be traumatic for frail \nelderly patients and may contribute to their disorientation and impede \ntheir recovery. It places them in an unfamiliar setting away from home, \npossibly separating them from a spouse and friends. Staff at their \nchosen retirement community or nursing home may also be familiar with \ntheir individual needs and habits which could only assist in their \nreturn to wellness. It makes little sense for them to be sent elsewhere \nupon discharge from a hospital.\n  Passage of this legislation ensures the ability of Medicare+Choice \nbeneficiaries to return to the residential home facility of their \nchoice or nursing home in which they previously resided following \nhospitalization under the following conditions:\n  1. The enrollee chooses to return to the residential community \nfacility where they had been living.\n  2. The facility is licensed and qualified under state and federal law \nto provide the required services.\n  3. The residential community or nursing home agrees to accept the \nmanaged care plan's payment which must be similar to the payment made \nto contracted facilities.\n  This legislation provides for continuity in the lives of the elderly \nfollowing a period of hospitalization. It does not increase costs to \nMedicare+Choice plans or to beneficiaries.\n  It allows people to return to their loved ones in the facility where \nthey have chosen to live.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Return To Home Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et \nseq.) to protect consumers and promote electronic commerce by \nprohibiting the bad-faith registration, trafficking or use of Internet \ndomain names that are identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive \nof distinctive trademarks or service marks; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today, along with my \ncolleague, the Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, to introduce legislation that will address a growing problem for \nconsumers and American businesses online. At issue is the deliberate, \nbad-faith, and abusive registration of Internet domain names in \nviolation of the rights of trademark owners. for the Net-savy, this \nburgeoning form of cyber-abuse is known as ``cybersquatting.'' for the \naverage consumer, it is basically fraud, deception, and the bad-faith \ntrading on the goodwill of others. Whatever you call it, it is an issue \nthat has a great impact on American consumers and the brand names they \nrely on as indications of source, quality, and authenticity.\n  As anyone who has walked down the aisle in the grocery store knows, \ntrademarks serve as the primary indicators of source, quality, and \nauthenticity in the minds of consumers. How else do you explain the \nprice disparity between various brands of toothpaste, laundry \ndetergent, or even canned beans. These brand names are valuable in that \nthey convey to the consumer reliable information regarding the source \nand quality of goods and services, thereby facilitating commerce and \nspurring confidence in the marketplace. Unauthorized uses of others' \nmarks undercuts the market by eroding consumer confidence and the \ncommunicative value of the brand names we all rely on. For that very \nreason, Congress has enacted a number of statutes addressing the \nproblems of trademark infringement, false advertising and unfair \ncompetition, trademark dilution, and trademark counterfeiting. Doing so \nhas helped protect American businesses and, more importantly perhaps, \nAmerican consumers.\n  As we are seeing with increased frequency, the problems of brand-name \nabuse and consumer confusion are particularly acute in the online \nenvironment. The fact is that a consumer in a ``brick and mortar'' \nworld has the luxury of a variety of additional indicators of source \nand quality aside from a brand name. For example, when one walks in to \nthe local consumer electronics retailer, he is fairly certain with whom \nhe is dealing, and he can often tell by looking at the products and \neven the storefront itself whether or not he is dealing with a \nreputable establishment. These protections are largely absent in the \nelectronic world, where anyone with Internet access and minimal \ncomputer knowledge can set up a storefront online.\n  In many cases what consumers see when they log on to a site is their \nonly indication of source and authenticity, and legitimate and \nillegitimate sites may be indistinguishable in cyberspace. In fact, a \nwell-known trademark in a domain name may be the primary source \nindicator for the online consumer. So it a bad actor is using that \nname, rather than the trademark owner, an online consumer is at serious \nrisk of being defrauded, or at the very least confused. The result, as \nwith other forms of trademark violations, is the erosion of consumer \nconfidence in brand name identifiers and in electronic commerce \ngenerally.\n  Last week the Judiciary Committee heard testimony of a number of \nexamples of consumer confusion on the Internet stemming from abusive \ndomain name registrations. For example, Anne Chasser, President of the \nInternational Trademark Association, testified that a cybersquatter had \nregistered the domain names ``attphonecard.com'' and \n``attcallingcard.com'' and used those names to establish sites \npurporting to sell calling cards and soliciting personally identifying \ninformation, including credit card numbers. Chris Young, President of \nCyveillance, Inc.--a company founded specifically to assist trademark \nowners police their marks online--testified that a cybersquatter had \nregistered the name ``dellspares.com'' and was purporting to sell Dell \nproducts online, when in fact Dell does not authorize online resellers \nto market its products. We heard similar testimony of an offshore \ncybersquatter selling web-hosting services under the name \n``bellatlantics.com''. And Greg Phillips, a Salt Lake City trademark \npractitioner that represents Porsche in protecting their famous \ntrademark against what is now more than 300 instances of \ncybersquatting, testified of several examples where bad actors have \nregistered Porsche marks to sell counterfeit goods and non-genuine \nPorsche parts.\n\n[[Page S9750]]\n\n  Consider also the child who in a ``hunt-and-peck'' manner mistakenly \ntyped in the domain for ``dosney.com'', looking for the rich and \nfamily-friendly content of Disney's home page, only to wind up staring \nat a page of hard-core pornography because someone snatched up the \n``dosney'' domain in anticipation that just such a mistake would be \nmade. In a similar case, a 12-year-old California boy was denied \nprivileges at his school when he entered ``zelda.com'' in a web browser \nat his school library, looking for a site he expected to be affiliated \nwith the computer game of the same name, but ended up at a pornography \nsite.\n  In addition to these types of direct harm to consumers, \ncybersquatting harms American businesses and the goodwill value \nassociated with their names. In part this is a result of the fact that \nin each case of consumer confusion there is a case of brand-name \nmisappropriation and an erosion of goodwill. But, even absent consumer \nconfusion, there are many many cases of cybersquatters who appropriate \nbrand names with the sole intent of extorting money from the lawful \nmark owner, of precluding evenhanded competition, or even very simply \nof harming the goodwill of the mark.\n  For example, a couple of years ago a small Canadian company with a \nsingle shareholder and a couple of dozen domain names demanded that \nUmbro International, Inc., which markets and distributes soccer \nequipment, pay $50,000 to its sole shareholder, $50,000 to a charity, \nand provide a lifetime supply of soccer equipment in order for it to \nrelinquish the ``umbro.com'' name. Warner Bros. was reportedly asked to \npay $350,000 for the rights to the names ``warner-records.com'', \n``warner-bros-records.com'', ``warner-pictures.com'', ``warner-bros-\npictures'', and ``warnerpictures.com''. And Intel Corporation was \nforced to deal with a cybersquatter who registered the ``pentium3.com'' \ndomain and used it to post pornographic images of celebrities.\n  It is time for Congress to take a closer look at these abuses and to \nrespond with appropriate legislation. In the 104th Congress, Senator \nLeahy and I sponsored the ``Federal Trademark Dilution Act,'' which has \nproved useful in assisting the owners of famous trademarks to police \nonline uses of their marks that dilute their distinctive quality. \nUnfortunately, the economics of litigation have resulted in a situation \nwhere it is often more cost-effective to simply ``pay off'' a \ncybersquatter rather than pursue costly litigation with little hope of \nanything more than an injunction against the offender. And \ncybersquatters are becoming more sophisticated and more creative in \nevading what good case law has developed under the dilution statute.\n\n  The bill I am introducing today with the Senator from Vermont is \ndesigned to address these problems head on by clarifying the rights of \ntrademark owners online with respect to cybersquatting, by providing \nclear deterrence to prevent such bad faith and abusive conduct, and by \nproviding adequate remedies for trademark owners in those cases where \nit does occur. While the bill shares the goals of, and has some \nsimilarity to, legislation introduced earlier by Senator Abraham, it \ndiffers in a number of substantial respects.\n  First, like Senator Abraham's legislation, our bill allows trademark \nowners to recover statutory damages in cybersquatting cases, both to \ndeter wrongful conduct and to provide adequate remedies for trademark \nowners who seek to enforce their rights in court. Our bill goes beyond \nsimply stating the remedy, however, and sets forth a substantive cause \nof action, based in trademark law, to define the wrongful conduct \nsought to be deterred and to fill in the gaps and uncertainties of \ncurrent trademark law with respect to cybersquatting.\n  Under our bill, the abusive conduct that is made actionable is \nappropriately limited to bad faith registrations of others' marks by \npersons who seek to profit unfairly from the goodwill associated \ntherewith. In addition, the bill balances the property interests of \ntrademark owners with the interests of Internet users who would make \nfair use of others' marks or otherwise engage in protected speech \nonline. Our bill also limits the definition of domain name identifier \nto exclude such things as screen names, file names, and other \nidentifiers not assigned by a domain name registrar or registry. it \nalso omits criminal penalties found in Senator Abraham's earlier \nlegislation.\n  Second, our bill provides for in rem jurisdiction, which allows a \nmark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of an \ninfringing domain name by filing an in rem action against the name \nitself, where the mark owner has satisfied the court that it has \nexercised due diligence in trying to locate the owner of the domain \nname but is unable to do so. A significant problem faced by trademark \nowners in the fight against cybersquatting is the fact that many \ncybersquatters register domain names under aliases or otherwise provide \nfalse information in their registration applications in order to avoid \nidentification and service of process by the mark owner. Our bill will \nalleviate this difficulty, while protecting the notions of fair play \nand substantial justice, by enabling a mark owner to seek an injunction \nagainst the infringing property in those cases where, after due \ndiligence, a mark owner is unable to proceed against the domain name \nregistrant because the registrant has provided false contact \ninformation and is otherwise not to be found.\n  Additionally, some have suggested that dissidents and others who are \nonline incognito for legitimate reasons might give false information to \nprotect themselves and have suggested the need to preserve a degree of \nanonymity on the Internet particularly for this reason. Allowing \na trademark owner to proceed against the domain names themselves, \nprovided they are, in fact, infringing or diluting under the Trademark \nAct, decreases the need for trademark owners to join the hunt to chase \ndown and root out these dissidents or others seeking anonymity on the \nNet. The approach in our bill is a good compromise, which provides \nmeaningful protection to trademark owners while balancing the interests \nof privacy and anonymity on the Internet.\n\n  Third, like the Abraham bill, our bill encourages domain name \nregistrars and registries to work with trademark owners to prevent \ncybersquatting by providing a limited exemption from liability for \ndomain name registrars and registries that suspend, cancel, or transfer \ndomain names pursuant to a court order or in the implementation of a \nreasonable policy prohibiting the registration of infringing domain \nnames. Our bill goes further, however, in order to protect the rights \nof domain name registrants against overreaching trademark owners. Under \nour bill, a trademark owner who knowingly and materially misrepresents \nto the domain name registrar or registry that a domain name is \ninfringing is liable to the domain name registrant for damages \nresulting from the suspension, cancellation, or transfer of the domain \nname. Our bill also promotes the continued ease and efficiency users of \nthe current registration system enjoy by codifying current case law \nlimiting the secondary liability of domain name registrars and \nregistries for the act of registration of a domain name.\n  Finally, our bill includes an explicit savings clause making clear \nthat the bill does not affect traditional trademark defenses, such as \nfair use, or a person's first amendment rights, and it ensures that any \nnew remedies created by the bill will apply prospectively only.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important piece of legislation that \nwill promote the growth of online commerce by protecting consumers and \nproviding clarity in the law for trademark owners in cyberspace. It is \na balanced bill that protects the rights of Internet users and the \ninterests of all Americans in free speech and protected uses of \ntrademarked names for such things as parody, comment, criticism, \ncomparative advertising, news reporting, etc. It reflects many hours of \ndiscussions with senators and affected parties on all sides. I want to \nthank Senator Leahy for his cooperation in crafting this particular \nmeasure, and also Senator Abraham for his cooperation in this effort. I \nexpect that the substance of this bill will be offered as a Committee \nsubstitute to Senator Abraham's legislation when the Judiciary \nCommittee turns to that bill tomorrow, and I look forward to broad \nbipartisan support at that time. I similarly\n\n[[Page S9751]]\n\nlook forward to working with my other colleagues here in the Senate to \nreport this bill favorably to the House, and I urge their support in \nthis regard.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1461\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.\n\n       Section 32(2) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1114) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) by striking \n     ``under section 43(a)'' and inserting ``under section 43 (a) \n     or (d)''; and\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (E) \n     and inserting after subparagraph (C) the following:\n       ``(D)(i) A domain name registrar, a domain name registry, \n     or other domain name registration authority that takes any \n     action described under clause (ii) affecting a domain name \n     shall not be liable for monetary relief to any person for \n     such action, regardless of whether the domain name is finally \n     determined to infringe or dilute the mark.\n       ``(ii) An action referred to under clause (i) is any action \n     of refusing to register, removing from registration, \n     transferring, temporarily disabling, or permanently canceling \n     a domain name--\n       ``(I) in compliance with a court order under section 43(d); \n     or\n       ``(II) in the implementation of a reasonable policy by such \n     registrar, registry, or authority prohibiting the \n     registration of a domain name that is identical to, \n     confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another's mark \n     registered on the Principal Register of the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office.\n       ``(iii) A domain name registrar, a domain name registry, or \n     other domain name registration authority shall not be liable \n     for damages under this section for the registration or \n     maintenance of a domain name for another absent a showing of \n     bad faith intent to profit from such registration or \n     maintenance of the domain name.\n       ``(iv) If a registrar, registry, or other registration \n     authority takes an action described under clause (ii) based \n     on a knowing and material misrepresentation by any person \n     that a domain name is identical to, confusingly similar to, \n     or dilutive of a mark registered on the Principal Register of \n     the United States Patent and Trademark Office, such person \n     shall be liable for any damages, including costs and \n     attorney's fees, incurred by the domain name registrant as a \n     result of such action. The court may also grant injunctive \n     relief to the domain name registrant, including the \n     reactivation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain \n     name to the domain name registrant.''.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 45 of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1127) is \n     amended by inserting after the undesignated paragraph \n     defining the term ``counterfeit'' the following:\n       ``The term `Internet' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 230(f)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 230(f)(1)).\n       ``The term `domain name' means any alphanumeric designation \n     which is registered with or assigned by any domain name \n     registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name \n     registration authority as part of an electronic address on \n     the Internet.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall affect any defense available to a \n     defendant under the Trademark Act of 1946 (including any \n     defense under section 43(c)(4) of such Act or relating to \n     fair use) or a person's right of free speech or expression \n     under the first amendment of the United States Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstances is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n     SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall apply to all domain names registered before, \n     on, or after the date of enactment of this Act, except that \n     statutory\n\n[[Page S9752]]\n\n     damages under section 35(d) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 \n     U.S.C. 1117), as added by section 4 of this Act, shall not be \n     available with respect to the registration, trafficking, or \n     use of a domain name that occurs before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Section by Section Analysis--S. 1461, the ``Domain Name Piracy \n                       Prevention Act of 1999.''\n\n\n                   section 1. short title; references\n\n       This section provides that the Act may be cited as the \n     ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999'' and that any \n     references within the bill to the Trademark Act of 1946 shall \n     be a reference to the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for \n     the registration and protection of trademarks used in \n     commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved \n     July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.), also commonly referred \n     to as the Lanham Act.\n\n\n                          section 2. findings\n\n       This section sets forth Congress' findings that \n     cybersquatting and cyberpiracy--defined as the registration, \n     trafficking in, or use of a domain name that is identical to, \n     confusingly similar to, or dilutive of a distinctive \n     trademark or service mark of another with the bad faith \n     intent to profit from the goodwill of that mark--harms the \n     public by causing consumer fraud and public confusion as to \n     the true source or sponsorship of goods and services, by \n     impairing electronic commerce, by depriving trademark owners \n     of substantial revenues and consumer goodwill, and by placing \n     unreasonable, intolerable, and overwhelming burdens on \n     trademark owners in protecting their own marks. Amendments to \n     the Trademark Act would clarify the rights of trademark \n     owners to provide for adequate remedies for the abusive and \n     bad faith registration of their marks as Internet domain \n     names and to deter cyberpiracy and cybersquatting.\n\n\n                   section 3. cyberpiracy prevention\n\n       Subsection (a). In General. This subsection amends section \n     the Trademark Act to provide an explicit trademark remedy for \n     cybersquatting under a new section 43(d). Under paragraph \n     (1)(A) of the new section 43(d), actionable conduct would \n     include the registration, trafficking in, or use of a domain \n     name that is identical to, confusingly similar to, or \n     dilutive of the trademark or service mark of another, \n     provided that the mark was distinctive (i.e., enjoyed \n     trademark status) at the time the domain name was registered. \n     The bill is carefully and narrowly tailored, however, to \n     extend only to cases where the plaintiff can demonstrate that \n     the defendant registered, trafficked in, or used the \n     offending domain name with bad-faith intent to profit from \n     the goodwill of a mark belonging to someone else. Thus, the \n     bill does not extend to innocent domain name registrations by \n     those who are unaware of another's use of the name, or even \n     to someone who is aware of the trademark status of the name \n     but registers a domain name containing the mark for any \n     reason other than with bad faith intent to profit from the \n     goodwill associated with that mark.\n       Paragraph (1)(B) of the new section 43(d) sets forth a \n     number of nonexclusive, nonexhaustive factors to assist a \n     court in determining whether the required bad-faith element \n     exists in any given case. These factors are designed to \n     balance the property interests of trademark owners with the \n     legitimate interests of Internet users and others who seek to \n     make lawful uses of others' marks, including for purposes \n     such as comparative advertising, comment, criticism, parody, \n     news reporting, fair use, etc. The bill suggests a total of \n     eight factors a court may wish to consider. The first four \n     suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate an absence of \n     bad-faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a mark, and \n     the last four suggest circumstances that may tend to indicate \n     that such bad-faith intent exists.\n       First, under paragraph (1)(B)(i), a court may consider \n     whether the domain name registrant has trademark or any other \n     intellectual property rights in the name. This factor \n     recognizes, as does trademark law in general, that there may \n     be concurring uses of the same name that are noninfringing, \n     such as the use of the ``Delta'' mark for both air travel and \n     sink faucets. Similarly, the registration of the domain name \n     ``deltaforce.com'' by a movie studio would not tend to \n     indicate a bad faith intent on the part of the registrant to \n     trade on Delta Airlines or Delta Faucets' trademarks.\n       Second, under paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a court may consider \n     the extent to which the domain name is the same as the \n     registrant's own legal name or a nickname by which that \n     person is commonly identified. This factor recognizes, again \n     as does the concept of fair use in trademark law, that a \n     person should be able to be identified by their own name, \n     whether in their business or on a web site. Similarly, a \n     person may bear a legitimate nickname that is identical or \n     similar to a well-known trademark, such as in the well-\n     publicized case of the parents who registered the domain name \n     ``pokey.org'' for their young daughter who goes by that name, \n     and these individuals should not be deterred by this bill \n     from using their name online. This factor is not intended to \n     suggest that domain name registrants may evade the \n     application of this act by merely adopting Exxon, Ford, or \n     other well-known marks as their nicknames. It merely provides \n     a court with the appropriate discretion to determine whether \n     or not the fact that a person bears a nickname similar to a \n     mark at issue is an indication of an absence of bad-faith on \n     the part of the registrant.\n       Third, under paragraph (1)(B)(iii), a court may consider \n     the domain name registrant's prior use, if any, of the domain \n     name in connection with the bona fide offering of goods or \n     services. Again, this factor recognizes that the legitimate \n     use of the domain name in online commerce may be a good \n     indicator of the intent of the person registering that name. \n     Where the person has used the domain name in commerce without \n     creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source or origin \n     of the goods or services and has not otherwise attempted to \n     use the name in order to profit from the goodwill of the \n     trademark owner's name, a court may look to this as an \n     indication of the absence of bad faith on the part of the \n     registrant.\n       Fourth, under paragraph (1)(B)(iv), a court may consider \n     the person's legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the mark \n     in a web site that is accessible under the domain name at \n     issue. This factor is intended to balance the interests of \n     trademark owners with the interests of those who would make \n     lawful noncommercial or fair uses of others' marks online, \n     such as in comparative advertising, comment, criticism, \n     parody, news reporting, etc. The fact that a person may use a \n     mark in a site in such a lawful manner may be an appropriate \n     indication that the person's registration or use of the \n     domain name lacked the required element of bad-faith. This \n     factor is not intended to create a loophole that otherwise \n     might swallow the bill by allowing a domain name registrant \n     to evade application of the Act by merely putting up a \n     noninfringing site under an infringing domain name. For \n     example, in the well known case of Panavision Int'l v. \n     Toeppenn, 141 F.3d 1316 (9th Cir. 1998), a well known \n     cybersquatter had registered a host of domain names mirroring \n     famous trademarks, including names for Panavision, Delta \n     Airlines, Neiman Marcus, Eddie Bauer, Lufthansa, and more \n     than 100 other marks, and had attempted to sell them to the \n     mark owners for amounts in the range of $10,000 to $15,000 \n     each. His use of the ``panavision.com'' and ``panaflex.com'' \n     domain names was seemingly more innocuous, however, as they \n     served as addresses for sites that merely displayed pictures \n     of Pana Illinois and the word ``Hello'' respectively. This \n     bill would not allow a person to evade the holding of that \n     case--which found that Mr. Toeppen had made a commercial use \n     of the Panavision marks and that such uses were, in fact, \n     diluting under the Federal Trademark Dilution Act--merely by \n     posting noninfringing uses of the trademark on a site \n     accessible under the offending domain name, as Mr. Toeppen \n     did. Rather, the bill gives courts the flexibility to weigh \n     appropriate factors in determining whether the name was \n     registered or used in bad faith, and it recognizes that one \n     such factor may be the use the domain name registrant makes \n     of the mark.\n       Fifth, under paragraph (1)(B)(v), a court may consider \n     whether, in registering or using the domain name, the \n     registrant intended to divert consumers away from the \n     trademark owner's website to a website that could harm the \n     goodwill of the mark, either for purposes of commercial gain \n     or with the intent to tarnish or disparage the mark, by \n     creating a likelihood of confusion as to the source, \n     sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site. This \n     factor recognizes that one of the main reasons cybersquatters \n     use other people's trademarks is to divert Internet users to \n     their own sites by creating confusion as to the source, \n     sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement of the site. This is \n     done for a number of reasons, including to pass off inferior \n     goods under the name of a well-known mark holder, to defraud \n     consumers into providing personally identifiable information, \n     such as credit card numbers, to attract eyeballs to sites \n     that price online advertising according to the number of \n     ``hits'' the site receives, or even just to harm the value of \n     the mark. Under this provision, a court may give appropriate \n     weight to evidence that a domain name registrant intended to \n     confuse or deceive the public in this manner when making a \n     determination of bad-faith intent.\n       Sixth, under paragraph (1)(B)(vi), a court may consider a \n     domain name registrant's offer to transfer, sell, or \n     otherwise assign the domain name to the mark owner or any \n     third party for substantial consideration, where the \n     registrant has not used, and did not have any intent to use, \n     the domain name in the bona fide offering of any goods or \n     services. This factor is consistent with the court cases, \n     like the Panavision case mentioned above, where courts have \n     found a defendant's offer to sell the domain name to the \n     legitimate mark owner as being indicative of the defendant's \n     intent to trade on the value of a trademark owner's marks by \n     engaging in the business of registering those marks and \n     selling them to the rightful trademark owners. It does not \n     suggest that a court should consider the mere offer to sell a \n     domain name to a mark owner or the failure to use a name in \n     the bona fide offering of goods or services is sufficient to \n     indicate bad faith. Indeed, there are cases in which a person \n     registers a name in anticipation of a business venture that \n     simply never pans out. And someone who has a legitimate \n     registration of a domain name that mirrors someone else's \n     domain name, such as a trademark owner that is a lawful \n     concurrent user of that name with another trademark owner, \n     may, in fact, wish to sell\n\n[[Page S9753]]\n\n     that name to the other trademark owner. This bill does not \n     imply that these facts are an indication of bad-faith. It \n     merely provides a court with the necessary discretion to \n     recognize the evidence of bad-faith when it is present. In \n     practice, the offer to sell domain names for exorbitant \n     amounts to the rightful mark owner has been one of the most \n     common threads in abusive domain name registrations.\n       Seventh, under paragraph (1)(B)(vii), a court may consider \n     the registrant's intentional provision of material and \n     misleading false contact information in an application for \n     the domain name registration. Falsification of contact \n     information with the intent to evade identification and \n     service of process by trademark owners is also a common \n     thread in cases of cybersquatting. This factor recognizes \n     that fact, while still recognizing that there may be \n     circumstances in which the provision of false information may \n     be due to other factors, such as mistake or, as some have \n     suggested in the case of political dissidents, for purposes \n     of anonymity. This bill balances those factors by limiting \n     consideration to the person's contact information, and even \n     then requiring that the provision of false information be \n     material and misleading. As with the other factors, this \n     factor is nonexclusive and a court is called upon to make a \n     determination based on the facts presented whether or not the \n     provision of false information does, in fact, indicate bad-\n     faith.\n       Eighth, under paragraph (1)(B)(viii), a court may consider \n     the domain name registrant's acquisition of multiple domain \n     names that are identical to, confusingly similar to, or \n     dilutive of others' marks. This factor recognizes the \n     increasingly common cybersquatting practice known as \n     ``warehousing'', in which a cybersquatter registers multiple \n     domain names--sometimes hundreds, even thousands--that mirror \n     the trademarks of others. By sitting on these marks and not \n     making the first move to offer to sell them to the mark \n     owner, these cybersquatters have been largely successful in \n     evading the case law developed under the Federal Trademark \n     Dilution Act. This bill does not suggest that the mere \n     registration of multiple domain names is an indication of bad \n     faith, but allows a court to weigh the fact that a person has \n     registered multiple domain names that infringe or dilute the \n     trademarks of others as part of its consideration of whether \n     the requisite bad-faith intent exists.\n       Paragraph (1)(C) makes clear that in any civil brought \n     under the new section 43(d), a court may order the \n     forfeiture, cancellation, or transfer of a domain name to the \n     owner of the mark.\n       Paragraph (2)(A) provides for in rem jurisdiction, which \n     allows a mark owner to seek the forfeiture, cancellation, or \n     transfer of an infringing domain name by filing an in rem \n     action against the name itself, where the mark owner has \n     satisfied the court that it has exercised due diligence in \n     trying to locate the owner of the domain name but is unable \n     to do so. As indicated above, a significant problem faced by \n     trademark owners in the fight against cybersquatting is the \n     fact that many cybersquatters register domain names under \n     aliases or otherwise provide false information in their \n     registration applications in order to avoid identification \n     and service of process by the mark owner. This bill will \n     alleviate this difficulty, while protecting the notions of \n     fair play and substantial justice, by enabling a mark owner \n     to seek an injunction against the infringing property in \n     those cases where, after due diligence, a mark owner is \n     unable to proceed against the domain name registrant because \n     the registrant has provided false contact information and is \n     otherwise not to be found, provided the mark owner can show \n     that the domain name itself violates substantive trademark \n     law. Paragraph (2)(B) limits the relief available in such an \n     in rem action to an injunction ordering the forfeiture, \n     cancellation, or transfer of the domain name.\n       Subsection (b). Additional Civil Action and Remedy. This \n     subsection makes clear that the creation of a new section \n     43(d) in the Trademark Act does not in any way limit the \n     application of current provisions of trademark, unfair \n     competition and false advertising, or dilution law, or other \n     remedies under counterfeiting or other statutes, to \n     cybersquatting cases.\n\n\n                    section 4. damages and remedies\n\n       This section applies traditional trademark remedies, \n     including injunctive relief, recovery of defendant's profits, \n     actual damages, and costs, to cybersquatting cases under the \n     new section 43(d) of the Trademark Act. The bill also amends \n     section 35 of the Trademark Act to provide for statutory \n     damages in cybersquatting cases, in an amount of not less \n     than $1,000 and not more than $100,000 per domain name, as \n     the court considers just. The bill requires the court to \n     remit statutory damages in any case where the infringer \n     believed and had reasonable grounds to believe that the use \n     of the domain name was a fair or otherwise lawful use.\n\n\n                   section 5. limitation on liability\n\n       This section amends section 32(2) of the Trademark Act to \n     extend the Trademark Act's existing limitations on liability \n     to the cybersquatting context. This section also creates a \n     new subparagraph (D) in section 32(2) to encourage domain \n     name registrars and registries to work with trademark owners \n     to prevent cybersquatting through a limited exemption from \n     liability for domain name registrars and registries that \n     suspend, cancel, or transfer domain names pursuant to a court \n     order or in the implementation of a reasonable policy \n     prohibiting cybersquatting. This section also protects the \n     rights of domain name registrants against overreaching \n     trademark owners. Under a new section subparagraph (D)(iv) in \n     section 32(2), a trademark owner who knowingly and materially \n     misrepresents to the domain name registrar or registry that a \n     domain name is infringing shall be liable to the domain name \n     registrant for damages resulting from the suspension, \n     cancellation, or transfer of the domain name. In addition, \n     the court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name \n     registrant by ordering the reactivation of the domain name or \n     the transfer of the domain name back to the domain name \n     registrant. Finally, in creating a new subparagraph (D)(iii) \n     of section 32(2), this section codifies current case law \n     limiting the secondary liability of domain name registrars \n     and registries for the act of registration of a domain name, \n     absent bad-faith on the part of the registrar and registry.\n\n\n                         section 6. definitions\n\n       This section amends the Trademark Act's definitions section \n     (section 45) to add definitions for key terms used in this \n     Act. First, the term ``Internet'' is defined consistent with \n     the meaning given that term in the Communications Act (47 \n     U.S.C. 230(f)(1)). Second, this section creates a narrow \n     definition of ``cybersquatting'' to target the specific bad \n     faith conduct sought to be addressed while excluding such \n     things as screen names, file names, and other identifiers not \n     assigned by a domain name registrar or registry.\n\n\n                       section 7. savings clause\n\n       This section provides an explicit savings clause making \n     clear that the bill does not affect traditional trademark \n     defenses, such as fair use, or a person's first amendment \n     rights.\n\n\n                        section 8. severability\n\n       This section provides a severability clause making clear \n     Congress' intent that if any provision of this Act, an \n     amendment made by the Act, or the application of such \n     provision or amendment to any person or circumstances is held \n     to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the Act, the \n     amendments made by the Act, and the application of the \n     provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be \n     affected by such determination.\n\n\n                       section 9. effective date\n\n       This section provides that new statutory damages provided \n     for under this bill shall not apply to any registration, \n     trafficking, or use of a domain name that took place prior to \n     the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

We have worked hard to craft this legislation in a balanced \nfashion to protect trademark owners and consumers doing business \nonline, and Internet users who want to participate in what the Supreme \nCourt has described `` `a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide \nhuman communication.' '' Reno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997).\n  Trademarks are important tools of commerce. The exclusive right to \nthe use of a unique mark helps companies compete in the marketplace by \ndistinguishing their goods and services from those of their \ncompetitors, and helps consumers identify the source of a product by \nlinking it with a particular company. The use of trademarks by \ncompanies, and reliance on trademarks by consumers, will only become \nmore important as the global marketplace becomes larger and more \naccessible with electronic commerce. The reason is simple: when a \ntrademark name is used as a company's address in cyberspace, customers \nknow where to go online to conduct business with that company.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is having a positive effect on the \neconomies of small rural states like mine. A Vermont Internet Commerce \nreport I commissioned earlier this year found that Vermont gained more \nthan 1,000 new jobs as a result of Internet commerce, with the \npotential that Vermont could add more than 24,000 jobs over the next \ntwo years. For a small state like ours, this is very good news.\n  Along with the good news, this report identified a number of \nobstacles that stand in the way of Vermont reaching the full potential \npromised by Internet commerce. One obstacle is that ``merchants are \nanxious about not being able to control where their names and brands \nare being displayed.'' Another is the need to bolster consumers' \nconfidence in online shopping.\n  Cybersquatters hurt electronic commerce. Both merchant and consumer \nconfidence in conducting business online are undermined by so-called \n``cybersquatters'' or ``cyberpirates,''\n\n[[Page S9754]]\n\nwho abuse the rights of trademark holders by purposely and maliciously \nregistering as a domain, name the trademarked name of another company \nto divert and confuse customers or to deny the company the ability to \nestablish an easy-to-find online location. A recent report by the World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) on the Internet domain name \nprocess has characterized cybersquatting as ``predatory and parasitical \npractices by a minority of domain registrants acting in bad faith'' to \nregister famous or well-known marks of others--which can lead to \nconsumer confusion or downright fraud.\n  Enforcing trademarks in cyberspace will promote global electronic \ncommerce. Enforcing trademark law in cyberspace can help bring consumer \nconfidence to this new frontier. That is why I have long been concerned \nwith protecting registered trademarks online. Indeed, when the Congress \npassed the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, I noted that:\n\n       [A]lthough no one else has yet considered this application, \n     it is my hope that this antidilution statute can help stem \n     the use of deceptive Internet addresses taken by those who \n     are choosing marks that are associated with the products and \n     reputations of others. (Congressional Record, Dec. 29, 1995, \n     page S19312)\n\n  In addition, last year I authored an amendment that was enacted as \npart of the Next Generation Internet Research Act authorizing the \nNational Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences to study \nthe effects on trademark holders of adding new top-level domain names \nand requesting recommendations on expensive and expeditious procedures \nfor resolving trademark disputes over the assignment of domain names. \nBoth the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (I-CANN) \nand WIPO are also making recommendations on these procedures. Adoption \nof a uniform trademark domain name dispute resolution policy will be of \nenormous benefit to American trademark owners.\n  The ``Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act of 1999,'' which we introduce \ntoday, is not intended in any way to frustrate these global efforts \nalready underway to develop inexpensive and expeditious procedures for \nresolving domain name disputes that avoid costly and time-consuming \nlitigation in the court systems either here or abroad. In fact, the \nbill expressly provides liability limitations for domain name \nregistrars, registries or other domain name registration authorities \nwhen they take actions pursuant to a reasonable policy prohibiting the \nregistration of domain names that are identical, confusingly similar to \nor dilutive of another's trademark. The I-CANN and WIPO consideration \nof these issues will inform the development by domain name registrars \nand registries of such reasonable policies.\n  The Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 has been used as I \npredicted to help stop misleading uses of trademarks as domain names. \nOne court has described this exercise by saying that ``attempting to \napply established trademark law in the fast-developing world of the \nInternet is somewhat like trying to board a moving bus . . . ``Bensusan \nRestaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997). Nevertheless, the \ncourts appear to be handling ``cybersquatting'' cases well. As \nUniversity of Miami Law Professor Michael Froomkin noted in testimony \nsubmitted at the Judiciary Committee's hearing on this issue on July \n22, 1999, ``[i]n every case involving a person who registered large \nnumbers of domains for resale, the cybersquatter has lost.''\n  For example, courts have had little trouble dealing with a notorious \n``cybersquatter,'' Dennis Toeppen from Illinois, who registered more \nthan 100 trademarks--including ``yankeestadium.com,'' \n``deltaairlines.com,'' and ``neiman-marcus.com''--as domain names for \nthe purpose of eventually selling the names back to the companies \nowning the trademarks. The various courts reviewing his activities have \nunanimously determined that he violated the Federal Trademark Dilution \nAct.\n  Similarly, Wayne State University Law Professor Jessica Litman noted \nin testimony submitted at the Judiciary Committees hearing that those \nbusinesses which `'have registered domain names that are confusingly \nsimilar to trademarks or personal names in order to use them for \npornographic web sites . . . have without exception lost suits brought \nagainst them.''\n\n  Enforcing or even modifying our trademark laws will be only part of \nthe solution to cybersquatting. Up to now, people have been able to \nregister any number of domain names in the popular ``.com'' domain with \nno money down and no money due for 60 days. Network Solutions Inc. \n(NSI), the dominant Internet registrar, announced just last week that \nit was changing this policy, and requiring payment of the registration \nfee up front. In doing so, the NSI admitted that it was making this \nchange to curb cybersquatting.\n  In light of the developing case law, the ongoing efforts within WIPO \nand ICANN to build a consensus global mechanism for resolving online \ntrademark disputes, and the implementation of domain name registration \npractices designed to discourage cybersquatting, the legislation we \nintroduce today is intended to build is intended to build upon this \nprogress and provide constructive guidance to trademark holders, domain \nname registrars and registries and Internet users registering domain \nnames alike.\n  Other Anti-cybersquatting Legislation Is Flawed. This is not the \nfirst bill to be introduced this session to address the problem of \ncybersquatting, and I appreciate the efforts of Senators Abraham, \nToricelli, Hatch, and McCain, to focus our attention on this important \nmatter. They introduced S. 1255, the ``Anticybersquatting Consumer \nProtection Act,'' which proposed making it illegal to register or use \nany ``Internet domain name or identifier of an online location'' that \ncould be confused with the trademark of another person or cause \ndilution of a ``famous trademark.'' Violations were punishable by both \ncivil and criminal penalties.\n  I voiced concerns at a hearing before the Judiciary Committee last \nweek that S. 1255 would have a number of unintended consequences that \ncould hurt rather than promote electronic commerce, including the \nfollowing specific problems:\n  The definition in S. 1255 is overbroad. S. 1255 covers the use or \nregistration of any ``identifier,'' which could cover not just second \nlevel domain names, but also e-mail addresses, screen names used in \nchat rooms, and even files accessible and readable on the Internet. As \none witness pointed out, `` the definitions will make every fan a \ncriminal.'' How? A file document about Batman, for example, that uses \nthe trademark ``Batman'' in its name, which also identifies its online \nlocation, could land the writer in court under that bill. \nCybersquatting is not about file names.\n  S. 1255 threatens hypertext linking. The Web operates on hypertext \nlinking, to facilitate jumping from one site to another. S. 1255 could \ndisrupt this practice by imposing liability on operators of sites with \nlinks to other sites with trademark names in the address. One could \nimagine a trademark owner not wanting to be associated with or linked \nwith certain sites, and threatening suit under this proposal unless the \nlink were eliminated or payments were made for allowing the linking.\n  S. 1255 would criminalize dissent and protest sites. A number of Web \nsites collect complaints about trademarked products or services, and \nsue the trademarked names to identify themselves. For example, there \nare protest sites named ``boycotts-cbs.com'' and \n``www.PepsiBloodbath.com.'' While the speech contained on those sites \nis clearly constitutionally protected, S. 1255 would criminalizes the \nuse of the trademarked name to reach the site and make them difficult \nto search for and find online.\n  S. 1255 would stifle legitimate warehousing of domain names. The bill \nwould change current law and make liable persons who merely register \ndomain names similar to other trademarked names, whether or not they \nactually set up a site and use the name. The courts have recognized \nthat companies may have legitimate reason for registering domain names \nwithout using them and have declined to find trademark violations for \nmere registration of a trademarked name. For example, a company \nplanning to acquire another company might register a domain name \ncontaining the target company's name in anticipation of the\n\n[[Page S9755]]\n\ndeal. S. 1255 would make that company liable for trademark \ninfringement.\n  For these and other reasons, Professor Litman concluded that this \n``bill would in many ways be bad for electronic commerce, by making it \nhazardous to do business on the Internet without first retaining \ntrademark counsel.'' Faced with the risk of criminal penalties, she \nstated that ``many start-up businesses may choose to abandon their \ngoodwill and move to another Internet location, or even to fold, rather \nthan risk liability.''\n  The Hatch-Leahy Domain Name Piracy Prevention Act is a better \nsolution. The legislation we introduce today addresses the \ncybersquatting problem without jeopardizing other important online \nrights and interests. This bill would amend section 43 of the Trademark \nAct (15 U.S.C. Sec. 11125) by adding a new section to make liable for \nactual or statutory damages any person, who with bad-faith intent to \nprofit from the goodwill of another's trademark, registers or uses a \ndomain name that is identical to, confusingly similar to or dilutive of \nsuch trademark, without regard to the goods or services of the parties. \nthe fact that the domain name registrant did not compete with the \ntrademark owner would not be a bar to recovery. Significant sections of \nthis bill include:\n  Definition. Domain names are narrowly defined to mean alphanumeric \ndesignations registered with or assigned by domain name registrars or \nregistries, or other domain name registration authority as part of an \nelectronic authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet. \nSince registrars only second level domain names this definition \neffectively excludes file names, screen names, and e-mail addresses \nand, under current registration practice, applies only to second level \ndomain names.\n  Scienter requirement. Good faith, innocent or negligent uses of \ndomain names that are identical or similar to, or dilutive of, \nanother's mark are not covered by the bill's prohibition. Thus, \nregistering a domain name while unaware that the name is another's \ntrademark would not be actionable. Nor would the use of a domain name \nthat contains a trademark for purposes of protest, complaint, parody or \ncommentary satisfy the requisite scienter requirement. Bad-faith intent \nto profit is required for a violation to occur.\n  This requirement of bad-faith intent to profit is critical since, as \nProfessor Litman pointed out in her testimony, our trademark laws \npermit multiple businesses to register the same trademark for different \nclasses of products. Thus, she explains:\n\n       [a]lthough courts have been quick to impose liability for \n     bad faith registration, they have been far more cautious in \n     disputes involving a domain name registrant who has a \n     legitimate claim to use a domain name and registered it in \n     good faith. In a number of cases, courts have refused to \n     impose liability where there is no significant likelihood \n     that anyone will be misled, even if there is a significant \n     possibility of trademark dilution.\n\n  The legislation outlines the following non-exclusive list of eight \nfactors for courts to consider in determining whether such bad-faith \nintent to profit is proven: (i) the trademark rights of the domain name \nregistrant in the domain name; (ii) whether the domain name is the \nlegal or nickname of the registrant; (iii) the prior use by the \nregistrant of the domain name in connection with the bona fide offering \nof any goods or services; (iv) the registrant's legitimate \nnoncommercial or fair use of the mark at the site under the domain \nname; (v) the registrant's intent to divert consumers from the mark's \nowner's online location in a manner that could harm the mark's \ngoodwill, either for commercial gain or with the intent to tarnish or \ndisparage the mark, by creating a likelihood of confusion as to the \nsource, sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the site; (vi) the \nregistrant's offer to sell the domain name for substantial \nconsideration without having or having an intent to use the domain name \nin the bona fide offering of goods or services; (vii) the registrant's \ninternational provision of material false and misleading contact \ninformation when applying for the registration of the domain name; and \n(viii) the registrant's registration of multiple domain names that are \nidentical or similar to or dilutive of another's trademark.\n  Damages. In civil actions against cybersquatters, the plaintiff is \nauthorized to recover actual damages and profits, or may elect before \nfinal judgment to award of statutory damages of not less than $1,000 \nand not more than $100,000 per domain name, as the court considers \njust. The court is directed to remit statutory damages in any case \nwhere the infringer reasonably believed that use of the domain name was \na fair or otherwise lawful use.\n  In Rem actions. The bill would also permit an in rem civil action \nfiled by a trademark owner in circumstances where the domain name \nviolates the owner's rights in the trademark and the court finds that \nthe owner demonstrated due diligence and was not able to find the \ndomain name holder to bring an in persona civil action. The remedies of \nan in rem action are limited to a court order for forfeiture or \ncancellation of the domain name or the transfer of the domain name to \nthe trademark owner.\n  Liability limitations. The bill would limit the liability for \nmonetary damages of domain name registrars, registries or other domain \nname registration authorities for any action they take to refuse to \nregister, remove from registration, transfer, temporarily disable or \npermanently cancel a domain name pursuant to a court order or in the \nimplementation of reasonable policies prohibiting the registration of \ndomain names that are identical or similar to, or dilutive of, anothers \ntrademark.\n  Prevention of reverse domain name hijacking. Reverse domain name \nhijacking is an effort by a trademark owner to take a domain name from \na legitimate good faith domain name registrant. There have been some \nwell-publicized cases of trademark owners demanding the take down of \ncertain web sites set up by parents who have registered their \nchildren's names in the .org domain, such as two year old Veronica \nSams's ``Little Veronica'' website and 12 year old Chris ``Pokey'' Van \nAllen's web page.\n  In order to protect the rights of domain name registrants in their \ndomain names the bill provides that registrants may recover damages, \nincluding costs and attorney's fees, incurred as a result of a knowing \nand material misrepresentation by a person that a domain name is \nidentical or similar to, or dilutive of, a trademark. In addition, the \ndomain name or the transfer or return of a domain name to the domain \nname registrant.\n  Cybersquatting is an important issue both for trademark holders and \nfor the future of electronic commerce on the Internet. Any legislative \nsolution to cybersquatting must tread carefully to ensure that any \nremedies do not impede or stifle the free flow of information on the \nInternet. In many ways, the United States has been the incubator of the \nWorld Wide Web, and the world closely watches whenever we venture into \nlaws, customs or standards that affect the Internet. We must only do so \nwith great care and caution. Fair use principles are just as critical \nin cyberspace as in any other intellectual property arena.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Hatch and I, along with Senators Abraham, \nTorricelli, and Kohl have worked together to find a legislative \nsolution that respects these considerations. We also stand ready to \nmake additional refinements to this legislation that prove necessary as \nthis bill moves through the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1462. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npermit importation in personal baggage and through mail order of \ncertain covered products for personal use from Canada, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n         Personal Use Prescription Drug Importation Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \ntakes another positive step toward the goal of providing access to \naffordable prescription drugs for patients in my state of Vermont, and \nmany other patients across the United States.\n  The high cost of prescription drugs is an issue that faces many \nAmericans every single day, as they try to decide how to make ends \nmeet, and whether they can afford to fill the prescription given to \nthem by their doctor. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to hear of \npatients who cut pills in half, or skip dosages in order to make \nprescriptions\n\n[[Page S9756]]\n\nlast longer. This is a serious health problem, and I am committed to \nlegislative solutions that we can enact that provides immediate \nassistance to those who need it. I will soon introduce legislation that \nwill provide prescription drug insurance for low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries. And today I am introducing legislation that will allow \nAmericans of all ages who do not have sufficient coverage for \nprescription drugs, to purchase the medicines they need at prices they \ncan afford.\n  Mr. President, it is well documented that the average price of \nprescription medicines is much lower in Canada than in the United \nStates, with the price of some drugs in Vermont being twice that of the \nsame drug available only a few miles away in a Canadian pharmacy. This \nis true even though many of the drugs sold in Canada are actually \nmanufactured, packed, and distributed by American companies that sell \nthe same products in both markets, but at drastically different prices. \nThat is why many residents of my home state travel the short distance \nacross the border into Canada to buy their prescription medicines at \nthe lower price. Unfortunately, in most cases this is a violation of \nFederal law. This does not seem fair to many Vermonters, and it does \nnot seem fair to me.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will change that, so that \nAmericans who want to buy prescription medicines in Canada can legally \ndo so. This legislation will require the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) to promulgate new regulations permitting patients to import \nprescription medications purchased in Canada. Currently, it is illegal \nfor Americans to go to Canada and purchase drugs to be brought back to \nthe United States. But FDA and U.S. Customs employ a ``discretionary \nenforcement policy'', allowing some Americans to enter the U.S. with \ndrugs that they bought in Canada.\n  My legislation does a number of things. First, it requires the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations that \nwill allow individuals to import prescription FDA-approved medicines \nfrom Canada in personal baggage, so long as the appropriate use is \nidentified and the product does not represent a significant health \nrisk. Under this bill, patients could also be asked to identify the \nlicensed U.S. health professional responsible for treatment, and to \naffirm that the product is for personal use, and provide other \nnecessary information so that the FDA can continue to ensure the safety \nof the U.S. drug supply. All information collected under this provision \nwill be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974.\n  Under this proposal, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will \nalso be required to promulgate regulations regarding importation of \nprescription drugs from Canada by mail order. The Secretary will \nestablish criteria which will ensure the safety of patients in the \nUnited States that wish to purchase drugs by mail order from Canada.\n  Finally, this legislation will require the Secretary of HHS to study \nthe safety and purity of the prescription drug products that are \nimported under this Act.\n  Mr. President, it has often been said that we have the international \ngold standard when it comes to drug safety. Well, we have the platinum \nstandard when it comes to prices. I want to emphasize, again, my \ncommitment to helping Vermonters and all Americans have access to the \nprescription drugs that they need at prices that they can afford. As \nChairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the \nsafety of American patients is always one of my top priorities, and I \nam committed to achieving the goal of affordable prescription drugs \nwithout putting patients' lives at risk. This is a responsible proposal \nto help Vermonters and all Americans with the high prices of drugs, and \nI hope my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWine (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Torricelli, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1463. A bill to establish a program to provide assistance for \nprograms of credit and other financial services for microenterprises in \ndeveloping countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n             Micro-Enterprise for Self Reliance Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould ensure the future success of international micro-enterprise grant \nand loan programs. Many members of Congress have seen the success of \nmicro-enterprise programs around the world. These programs reach the \npoorest of the poor with small loans to help them work their way out of \npoverty. These have proven to be very worthwhile and successful \nprograms administered worldwide by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID).\n  Unlike other assistance programs, we do not give funds away. Instead, \nwe lend these funds to people once considered credit risks. The record \nof these programs boasts a client repayment rate of between 95% to 98%. \nMicro-enterprise programs are proof that with access to credit, the \npoor can and do better their lives while repaying their loans.\n  To ensure the future of these programs and provide continued hope to \nothers seeking to build out of poverty, I introduce today the Micro-\nEnterprise for Self Reliance Act of 1999. I am pleased to be \nintroducing the legislation along with Senators Snowe, Torricelli, \nCollins, Durbin, Feinstein, Mikulski, Schumer, Bingaman, Chafee and \nKennedy. This bill would strengthen the foundations of these programs \nto ensure their survival and provide the mechanisms necessary for their \ncontinued success as financial institutions. First, it would provide \ngrant assistance to micro-enterprise programs to increase availability \nof credit and other services. We also target half of all micro-\nenterprise resources to support programs that serve the poorest of the \npoor with loans of $300 or less. This is a key provision of the bill \nand would give strong direction to USAID to work with sections of \nsociety that respond best to micro-lending programs.\n  Second, this bill would authorize credits to micro-lending programs. \nThese credits generally are used to expand already successful programs. \nFurther, we seek to guarantee these programs' survival by establishing \na facility to help rescue micro-lending institutions that are imperiled \nby war, currency movements or natural disasters. The facility would \nprovide for loans to successful institutions to help them get back on \ntheir feet.\n  Finally, we are interested in encouraging the future development and \nstability of these programs. Our bill calls for a report by USAID that \nwould recommend other steps that could be taken to further the \ndevelopment of micro-lending institutions such as networks, \nregulations, a federal charter, financial instruments and coordination \nwith multilateral institutions.\n  We believe that this investment in micro-enterprise programs now will \nreduce the need for foreign assistance in the future. Congress now has \nthe chance to ensure the future of these very successful programs, and \nhelp provide a sense of hope and a future of possibilities for the poor \nin developing countries. I thank my fellow cosponsors for their support \nfor this legislation and look forward to working with them to gain \ncongressional approval.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Micro-\nEnterprise for Self-Reliance Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Microenterprise for Self-\n     Reliance Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings and declarations:\n       (1) According to the World Bank, more than 1,200,000,000 \n     people in the developing world, or one-fifth of the world's \n     population, subsist on less than $1 a day.\n       (2) Over 32,000 of their children die each day from largely \n     preventable malnutrition and disease.\n       (3)(A) Women in poverty generally have larger work loads \n     and less access to educational and economic opportunities \n     than their male counterparts.\n       (B) Directly aiding the poorest of the poor, especially \n     women, in the developing world has a positive effect not only \n     on family incomes, but also on child nutrition, health\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\n     and education, as women in particular reinvest income in \n     their families.\n       (4)(A) The poor in the developing world, particularly \n     women, generally lack stable employment and social safety \n     nets.\n       (B) Many turn to self-employment to generate a substantial \n     portion of their livelihood. In Africa, over 80 percent of \n     employment is generated in the informal sector of the self-\n     employed poor.\n       (C) These poor entrepreneurs are often trapped in poverty \n     because they cannot obtain credit at reasonable rates to \n     build their asset base or expand their otherwise viable self-\n     employment activities.\n       (D) Many of the poor are forced to pay interest rates as \n     high as 10 percent per day to money lenders.\n       (5)(A) The poor are able to expand their incomes and their \n     businesses dramatically when they can access loans at \n     reasonable interest rates.\n       (B) Through the development of self-sustaining microfinance \n     programs, poor people themselves can lead the fight against \n     hunger and poverty.\n       (6)(A) On February 2-4, 1997, a global Microcredit Summit \n     was held in Washington, District of Columbia, to launch a \n     plan to expand access to credit for self-employment and other \n     financial and business services to 100,000,000 of the world's \n     poorest families, especially the women of those families, by \n     2005. While this scale of outreach may not be achievable in \n     this short-time frame, the realization of this goal could \n     dramatically alter the face of global poverty.\n       (B) With an average family size of five, achieving this \n     goal will mean that the benefits of microfinance will thereby \n     reach nearly half of the world's more than 1,000,000,000 \n     absolute poor people.\n       (7)(A) Nongovernmental organizations, such as those that \n     comprise the Microenterprise Coalition (such as the Grameen \n     Bank (Bangladesh,) K-REP (Kenya), and networks such as Accion \n     International, the Foundation for International Community \n     Assistance (FINCA), and the credit union movement) are \n     successful in lending directly to the very poor.\n       (B) Microfinance institutions such as BRAC (Bangladesh), \n     BancoSol (Bolivia), SEWA Bank (India), and ACEP (Senegal) are \n     regulated financial institutions that can raise funds \n     directly from the local and international capital markets.\n       (8)(A) Microenterprise institutions not only reduce \n     poverty, but also reduce the dependency on foreign \n     assistance.\n       (B) Interest income on the credit portfolio is used to pay \n     recurring institutional costs, assuring the long-term \n     sustainability of development assistance.\n       (9) Microfinance institutions leverage foreign assistance \n     resources because loans are recycled, generating new benefits \n     to program participants.\n       (10)(A) The development of sustainable microfinance \n     institutions that provide credit and training, and mobilize \n     domestic savings, are critical components to a global \n     strategy of poverty reduction and broad-based economic \n     development.\n       (B) In the efforts of the United States to lead the \n     development of a new global financial architecture, \n     microenterprise should play a vital role. The recent shocks \n     to international financial markets demonstrate how the \n     financial sector can shape the destiny of nations. \n     Microfinance can serve as a powerful tool for building a more \n     inclusive financial sector which serves the broad majority of \n     the world's population including the very poor and women and \n     thus generate more social stability and prosperity.\n       (C) Over the last two decades, the United States has been a \n     global leader in promoting the global microenterprise sector, \n     primarily through its development assistance programs at the \n     United States Agency for International Development. \n     Additionally, the United States Department of the Treasury \n     and the Department of State have used their authority to \n     promote microenterprise in the development programs of \n     international financial institutions and the United Nations.\n       (11)(A) In 1994, the United States Agency for International \n     Development launched the ``Microenterprise Initiative'' in \n     partnership with the Congress.\n       (B) The initiative committed to expanding funding for the \n     microenterprise programs of the Agency, and set a goal that, \n     by the end of fiscal year 1996, half of all microenterprise \n     resources would support programs and institutions that \n     provide credit to the poorest, with loans under $300.\n       (C) In order to achieve the goal of the microcredit summit, \n     increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the \n     poorest will be critical.\n       (12) Providing the United States share of the global \n     investment needed to achieve the goal of the microcredit \n     summit will require only a small increase in United States \n     funding for international microcredit programs, with an \n     increased focus on institutions serving the poorest.\n       (13)(A) In order to reach tens of millions of the poorest \n     with microcredit, it is crucial to expand and replicate \n     successful microcredit institutions.\n       (B) These institutions need assistance in developing their \n     institutional capacity to expand their services and tap \n     commercial sources of capital.\n       (14) Nongovernmental organizations have demonstrated \n     competence in developing networks of local microfinance \n     institutions and other assistance delivery mechanisms so that \n     they reach large numbers of the very poor, and achieve \n     financial sustainability.\n       (15) Recognizing that the United States Agency for \n     International Development has developed very effective \n     partnerships with nongovernmental organizations, and that the \n     Agency will have fewer missions to carry out its work, the \n     Agency should place priority on investing in those \n     nongovernmental network institutions that meet performance \n     criteria through the central funding mechanisms of the \n     Agency.\n       (16) By expanding and replicating successful microcredit \n     institutions, it should be possible to create a global \n     infrastructure to provide financial services to the world's \n     poorest families.\n       (17)(A) The United States can provide leadership to other \n     bilateral and multilateral development agencies as such \n     agencies expand their support to the microenterprise sector.\n       (B) The United States should seek to improve coordination \n     among G-7 countries in the support of the microenterprise \n     sector in order to leverage the investment of the United \n     States with that of other donor nations.\n       (18) Through increased support for microenterprise, \n     especially credit for the poorest, the United States can \n     continue to play a leadership role in the global effort to \n     expand financial services and opportunity to 100,000,000 of \n     the poorest families on the planet.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make microenterprise development an important \n     element of United States foreign economic policy and \n     assistance;\n       (2) to provide for the continuation and expansion of the \n     commitment of the United States Agency for International \n     Development to the development of microenterprise \n     institutions as outlined in its 1994 Microenterprise \n     Initiative;\n       (3) to support and develop the capacity of United States \n     and indigenous nongovernmental organization intermediaries to \n     provide credit, savings, training and technical services to \n     microentrepreneurs;\n       (4) to increase the amount of assistance devoted to credit \n     activities designed to reach the poorest sector in developing \n     countries, and to improve the access of the poorest, \n     particularly women, to microenterprise credit in developing \n     countries; and\n       (5) to encourage the United States Agency for International \n     Development to coordinate microfinance policy, in \n     consultation with the Department of the Treasury and the \n     Department of State, and to provide global leadership in \n     promoting microenterprise for the poorest among bilateral and \n     multilateral donors.\n\n     SEC. 4. MICROENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT GRANT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Chapter 1 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating the second section 129 (as added by \n     section 4 of the Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-320)) as section 130; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 131.

Advisory committee.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-170; 110 Stat. 1489), enacted on August 3, 1996, made \n     many major modifications to section 408 of the Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) that require the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     consider new kinds of information and use additional criteria \n     in regulating pesticide chemical residues and in reviewing \n     tolerances for pesticide chemical residues that had \n     previously been found to be adequate to protect the public \n     health.\n       (2)(A) Amendments made by the Food Quality Protection Act \n     of 1996 prescribe the use of a number of new risk assessment \n     criteria that require the development of major modifications \n     to regulatory policies and procedures used by the \n     Administrator to regulate pesticide chemical residues.\n       (B) Since the enactment of the Food Quality Protection Act \n     of 1996, it has become clear that several of the new concepts \n     embodied in that Act involve a high degree of complexity.\n       (C) Practical implementation of the concepts demands new \n     scientific tools in addition to the tools that were available \n     when the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 was enacted.\n       (3)(A) To reach sound, suitably protective decisions on \n     tolerance reviews under the new criteria, the Administrator \n     also will need a great deal of new data, not only on the \n     newly considered nondietary routes of exposure, but also, in \n     some cases, on dietary exposure and toxicity, so that the \n     Administrator can determine whether pesticide chemicals \n     residues that were found safe under the former criteria \n     satisfy the new criteria as well.\n       (B) Some data collection efforts are underway to obtain new \n     data for tolerance reviews, but will not yield results for 1 \n     or more years.\n       (C) In some areas, the need for new data depends on \n     decisions not yet made by the Administrator about what kinds \n     of tests should be conducted and which compounds should be \n     tested, for tolerance reviews.\n       (4)(A) The Administrator has instituted public proceedings, \n     relating to the regulations and tolerance reviews, on such \n     topics as what new interpretations and policies are needed, \n     what new kinds of data are needed, how the new data would be \n     used, and how the needed regulatory transition can be \n     achieved.\n       (B) These proceedings are not yet finished, and on some \n     issues public notice and comment proceedings have been \n     scheduled but have not yet begun.\n       (5)(A) The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 amended the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) \n     by adding several provisions that provide flexibility to the \n     Administrator in making the transition to the new approach to \n     regulating pesticide chemical residues.\n       (B) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act allows a \n     continuing process of refinement and improvement in tolerance \n     decisionmaking, as additional information is collected and as \n     new policies and methods are developed and adopted for the \n     practical implementation of the new requirements in that Act.\n       (C) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides that \n     the data requirements for tolerances must be set out clearly \n     in regulations and guidelines, so that the regulated \n     community will know what types of information the \n     Administrator requires and what\n\n[[Page S9760]]\n\n     testing procedures should be used to develop the information.\n       (D) Amendments made by the Food Quality Protection Act of \n     1996 relating to risk assessments affecting tolerances allow \n     only the use of reliable information regarding nondietary \n     exposure routes, which were not previously considered in risk \n     assessments affecting tolerances.\n       (E) Congress did not anticipate that a tolerance would be \n     revoked because of reliance by the Administrator on estimates \n     or assumptions stemming from absence of that information, \n     without first providing notice of what information is needed \n     and a reasonable opportunity to collect the information.\n       (F) When a tolerance is under review and the Administrator \n     determines that additional information is needed to support \n     the continuation of the tolerance, the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act authorizes the Administrator to postpone the \n     effective date of any tolerance rule resulting from the \n     review, and this authority can be utilized as appropriate in \n     cases in which additional information is pertinent to a \n     tolerance review.\n       (G) The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act permits the \n     Administrator to conduct a tolerance review in stages, as \n     allowed by the available, reliable information.\n       (6)(A) Although the authorities described in subparagraphs \n     (F) and (G) of paragraph (5) already are provided by law, it \n     appears that further congressional guidance is needed to \n     ensure that decisions of the Administrator relating to \n     tolerance reviews are reasonable, well supported, and \n     balanced, and to avoid disruptions in agriculture, other \n     sectors of the economy, and international trade.\n       (B) During the transition to revised standards, procedures, \n     and requirements for the regulation of pesticide chemical \n     residues, the Administrator must ensure that decisions are \n     balanced, reasonable, and understandable, and are based on \n     and supported by sound information, in order to avoid \n     unnecessary disruptions in agriculture, the economy, and \n     international trade, and to maintain the public trust in the \n     food supply.\n       (7) Unless the Administrator implements section 408 of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a) \n     carefully and wisely, decisions made under that section could \n     cause great harm to--\n       (A) the safe and affordable food supply of the United \n     States;\n       (B) the agricultural system of the United States (including \n     food, fiber, nursery, and forestry production, food storage, \n     and transportation);\n       (C) related industries; and\n       (D) other private and public sector activities, such as--\n       (i) public health protection against bacteria and other \n     microorganisms;\n       (ii) control of insects and diseases; and\n       (iii) residential and business pest control.\n\n            TITLE I--ISSUANCE AND CONTINUATION OF TOLERANCES\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for congressional review of rules establishing or increasing \ntaxes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                     taxpayer's defense act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Taxpayer's \nDefense Act of 1999. I am pleased to be working with my good friend \nfrom Missouri, John Ashcroft, who has been a leader on this issue in \nthe Senate. I also want to thank Chairman George Gekas for all of his \nhard work and leadership in the House. Our objective is clear and \nsimple: no federal agency should set or raise a tax without the \napproval of Congress.\n  America was founded on the principle that there should be no taxation \nwithout representation. In The Second Treatise of Government, John \nLocke said, ``[I]f any one shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on \nthe people * * * without * * * consent of the people, he thereby * * * \nsubverts the end of government.'' Consent, according to Locke, could \nonly be given by a majority of the people, ``either by themselves\n\n[[Page S9763]]\n\nor their representatives chosen by them.'' The Boston Tea Party \ncelebrated Americans' opposition to taxation without representation. \nAnd the Declaration of Independence listed, among the despotic acts of \nKing George, his ``imposing Taxes on us without our Consent.'' First \namong the powers that the Constitution gave to the Congress, our new \ngovernment's representative branch, was the power to levy taxes.\n  The logic of allowing only Congress to establish federal taxes is \nclear: Congress considers and weighs the economic and social issues \nthat rise to national importance. While any agency or government office \nmay view its own priorities as paramount, only Congress can decide \nwhich goals of the people merit spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars. \nOnly Congress can determine how many taxpayer dollars should be spent. \nCongress' decisions are made through an open political process that the \npublic can see and participate in. And if the public is unhappy with a \ntax, they can hold Congress and the President responsible on election \nday.\n  The accountability of lawmakers is a core feature of our \nrepresentative democracy. But over time, Congress has delegated more \nand more of its legislative authority to unaccountable federal \nagencies. The Taxpayer's Defense Act would help restore constitutional \nbalance and authority by requiring congressional approval for a rule \nthat sets or raises a tax before the rule could take effect. Unelected \nagency officials could not directly establish or raise a tax, but would \nstill have a chance to advance their proposals through an open \npolitical process in Congress.\n  Few would publicly dispute the American principle of no taxation \nwithout representation. But increasingly, in ways often subtle or \nhidden, federal agencies are taking on--or receiving from Congress--the \npower to tax. Federal agency taxes pass the costs of government \nprograms on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. These \nsecret taxes often are regressive--hitting many who struggle to get by. \nThey also put a drag on the economy. These taxes take money from \neveryone, and they are imposed without accountability.\n  One big example of agency taxation is the Federal Communications \nCommission's Universal Service Tax. ``Universal service'' is the idea \nthat everyone should have access to affordable telecommunications \nservices. It originated at the beginning of the century when the nation \nwas still being strung with telephone wires. The Telecommunications Act \nof 1996 included provisions that allowed the FCC to extend universal \nservice, ensuring that telecommunications are available to all areas of \nthe country and to institutions that benefit the community, such as \nschools, libraries, and rural health care facilities.\n\n  Most importantly, the Act gave the FCC the power to decide the level \nof ``contributions''--taxes--that telecommunications providers would \nhave to pay to support universal service. The FCC must determines how \nmuch can be collected in taxes to subsidize a variety of ``universal \nservice'' spending programs. It charges telecommunications providers, \nwho pass the costs on to consumers in the form of higher telephone \nbills. The FCC recently nearly doubled the tax to $2.5 billion per \nyear, and Administration's budget have projected a rise to $10 billion \nper year. This agency tax is already out of control.\n  The FCC's provisions for universal service have many flaws. These \ninclude the three ``administrative corporations'' set by the FCC. The \nGeneral Accounting Office determined that the establishment of these \ncorporations was illegal, and the FCC has collapsed them into one, no \nless questionable corporation. The head of one of these corporations \nwas originally paid $200,000 per year--as much as the President of the \nUnited States.\n  It seems that the more you look, the more you find that a number of \nfederal agencies have been given, or discovered on their own, the power \nof tax. Congress has given taxing authority to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Because these taxes \nare within statutory parameters, we have less concern with them than \nothers, but they are still taxes. And an important principle is at \nstake: no taxation within representation. The Constitution gives the \ntaxing power only to Congress. In practice, we often see a direct \ncorrelation between an agency taxing and the agency overspending \ntaxpayer dollars. Congress must retain the power and accountability of \nthe purse.\n  More egregious examples are those where agencies have spontaneously \ndiscovered the power to tax. There's the FCC's telecommunications tax, \nand two new taxes, past and proposed, on Internet domain name \nregistration. The first, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, \ncollected more than $60 million before a federal judge put a stop to \nit. The second, under the aegis of the Commerce Department, proposes to \ncharge $1 per Internet domain name per year. What Commerce Department \nofficial stands to be voted out of office if he or she sponsors an \nincrease in this tax?\n  The burden of this activity falls, of course, on the American \ntaxpayer, whose money is being taken, laundered through the Washington \nbureaucracy, and returned (in dramatically reduced amounts) for \npurposes set by unelected agency staffers. This is why we must require \nthe FCC, and all agencies, to get the approval of Congress before \nsetting future tax rates.\n  Some of my colleagues may question why Congress should shoulder the \nresponsibility for taxes. Let me just note that in a recent fee-dispute \ncase, the FCC argued, amazingly, that it had the unreviewable power to \nraise taxes. As the Court of Appeals put it:\n\n       [A]ccording to counsel, the Commission could impose a tax \n     on an unregulated railroad or a tax on an individual for \n     eating ice cream . . . . This is a preposterous position, one \n     that we will not countenance. As this court [has] said . . . \n     ``it goes without saying that the bald assertion of power by \n     [an] agency cannot legitimize it. Unable to link its \n     assertion of authority to any statutory provision, the \n     [FCC's] position in this case amounts to be bare suggestion \n     that it possesses plenary authority to act within a given \n     area simply because Congress has endowed it with some \n     authority to act in that area. We categorically reject that \n     suggestion.''--Comsat Corporation v. FCC, 114 F. 3d 223, 227 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).\n\n  Should tax dollars be used for federal programs? In what amounts? Or \nshould Americans spend what they earn on their own, locally determined \npriorities? Requiring Congress to review agency taxes would answer this \nquestion.\n  This legislation would create a new subchapter within the \nCongressional Review Act for mandatory review of certain rules. The \nportion of any agency rule that establishes or raises a tax would have \nto be submitted to Congress and receive the approval of Congress and \nthe President before the agency could put it into effect. The Act would \nallow the agencies to formulate tax proposals for Congress to consider \nunder existing rulemaking procedures. It is a version of a bill \nintroduced last Congress by Chairman Gekas in the House and John \nAshcroft in the Senate.\n  Once submitted to Congress, a bill noting the taxing portion of a \nregulation would be introduced (by request) in each House of Congress \nby the Majority Leader. The bill would then be subject to expedited \nprocedures, allowing a prompt decision on whether or not the agency may \nput the rule into effect. The rule could take effect once a bill \napproving it was passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the \nPresident. If the rule were approved, the agency would retain power to \nreverse the regulation, lower the amount of the tax, or take any \notherwise legal actions with respect to the rule.\n  Mr. President, the rallying cry of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation'' has been heard in America before, and now we are \nhearing it again. Congress must not allow unelected bureaucrats \ndetermine the amount of taxes hardworking Americans must pay. While \npreserving needed flexibility, the Taxpayer's Defense Act will allow \nelected officials alone to decide whether to raise taxes, and where to \ndirect precious tax dollars.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Taxpayer's Defense Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 1466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED FOR \n                   ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING AND TAX INCENTIVES \n                   FOR EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE \n                   COMMUNITIES AUTHORIZED AND DESIGNATED PURSUANT \n                   TO 1997 AND 1998 LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) providing Federal tax incentives and other incentives \n     to distressed communities across the Nation to help them \n     rebuild and grow was one of the important goals of the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Omnibus Consolidated and \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999;\n       (2) to help reach that goal, the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     1997 authorized 20 additional empowerment zones, 15 urban and \n     5 rural, followed by 20 new rural enterprise communities \n     authorized in 1998;\n       (3) the 1997 law authorizing this second round of \n     empowerment zones (EZs) was also significant and important \n     because it broadened empowerment zone eligibility, for the \n     first time, to Indian tribes and rural regions suffering from \n     massive out-migration;\n       (4) many of our urban and rural communities are not sharing \n     in the benefits of the prolonged economic expansion now \n     enjoyed by many other parts of our country;\n       (5) a total of more than 250 economically distressed urban \n     and rural communities competed for the 20 new empowerment \n     zones and 20 new rural enterprise communities, and those \n     areas designated as zones and communities should be provided \n     with the Federal incentives and encouragement they need to \n     attract new businesses, and the jobs they provide, in order \n     to stimulate economic growth and improvement;\n       (6) unfortunately, those areas that are designated EZs or \n     ECs under the 1997 and 1998 laws or rural economic area \n     partnerships (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture, are \n     not given the full advantage of Social Services Block Grant \n     funds, tax credits, and some other Federal incentives that \n     Congress provided to the first round of empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized pursuant to 1993 budget \n     legislation;\n       (7) Congress should act swiftly to provide such designated \n     areas an equal share of tax incentives, grant benefits, and \n     other Federal support at aggregate levels of at least that \n     provided by Congress to distressed urban and rural \n     empowerment zones and enterprise communities pursuant to the \n     1993 omnibus budget reconciliation bill; and\n       (8) a fully funded second round of EZs and ECs is estimated \n     to create and retain about 90,000 jobs and stimulate \n     $10,000,000,000 in private and public investments over the \n     next decade.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) if Congress and the President agree to a substantial \n     tax relief measure, it should ensure that such measure \n     includes full funding for the second round of empowerment \n     zones and enterprise communities authorized in 1997 and 1998 \n     as well as those areas currently designated rural economic \n     area partnerships (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture; \n     and\n       (2) all such designated distressed areas, rural and urban, \n     should equally share at least the same aggregate level of \n     funding, tax incentives, and other Federal support that \n     Congress provided to urban and rural empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized by the 1993 omnibus budget \n     reconciliation bill.\n\n                BREAUX (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENTS NO. 1442\n\n  Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bayh, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Collins) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, S. 1429, supra; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INVESTMENT IN \n                   EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Republican tax plan requires cuts in discretionary \n     spending of $775,000,000,000 over the next 10 years.\n       (2) If defense programs are funded at the level requested \n     by the President, funding for domestic programs, including \n     those providing funds for public schools, will have to be cut \n     by at least 38 percent by 2009.\n       (3) Such cuts in funding for public schools would deny--\n       (A) access to critical early education services to 430,000 \n     of the 835,000 young children who would otherwise be served \n     by Head Start in fiscal year 2009;\n       (B) services to 5,900,000 children under the program for \n     disadvantaged children under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, almost \\1/2\\ of those who \n     would otherwise be served;\n       (C) access to Reading Excellence programs to 480,000 \n     children, making those children less likely to reach the goal \n     of being able to read by the end of the third grade;

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in 1975, the Federal Government promised to pay 40 \n     percent of the costs associated with part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.), which guarantees each special education child the \n     right to a free and appropriate public education;\n       (2) the Administration's fiscal year 2000 budget request \n     provides a .07 percent increase in funding for part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which is less \n     than an adjustment for inflation, and the Administration's \n     budget request represents a decrease in real funding for \n     educating children with disabilities;\n       (3) in the 3 years preceding 1999, Congress has increased \n     funding for part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act by nearly 80 percent, however, the increase is \n     still far short of the nearly $15,000,000,000 needed to live \n     up to the originally promised funding level for such part;\n       (4) fulfilling the Federal obligation to fund part B of \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act at the originally \n     promised level will allow State and local governments, some \n     of whom spend up to 19 percent of their local dollars on \n     special education costs, to have more flexibility to spend \n     their local resources to meet the unique educational needs of \n     all of their students;\n       (5) the recent United States Supreme Court decision Cedar \n     Rapids Community School District v. Garret F., 119 S. Ct. \n     992; (1999) will increase the amount of funding that school \n     districts will need to dedicate to educating, and providing \n     related services to, their special needs children; and\n       (6) because the need for the Federal Government to fulfill \n     such obligation is so great, part B of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act should be fully funded at the \n     originally promised level of 40 percent before federal funds \n     are appropriated for any new federal education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BAYH AMENDMENT NO. 1484\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n\n[[Page S9854]]\n\n  Mr. BAYH submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, S. 1429, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress, recognizing the importance of statistical \n     information in the development of national priorities and \n     policies and in the administration of public programs, finds \n     that--\n       (1) improved coordination and planning among the \n     statistical programs of the Federal Government is necessary--\n       (A) to strengthen and improve the quality and utility of \n     Federal statistics; and\n       (B) to reduce duplication and waste in information \n     collected for statistical purposes;\n       (2) while the demand for statistical information has grown \n     substantially over the 30-year period preceding the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the lack of coordinated planning \n     within the decentralized Federal statistical system has \n     limited the usefulness of statistics in defining problems and \n     determining national policies to deal with complex social and \n     economic issues;\n       (3) the establishment of a unified statistical policy for \n     the Federal Government to ensure that--\n       (A) data available from Federal statistical programs are \n     responsive to the information needs of the President and \n     Congress in developing national policies; and\n       (B) necessary statistical information is collected with the \n     least reporting burden imposed on individuals, businesses, \n     and public entities;\n       (4) a central statistical policy and coordination office is \n     necessary--\n       (A) to develop and implement a Federal statistical policy;\n       (B) to establish priorities for Federal statistical \n     programs;\n       (C) to oversee and evaluate the statistical programs of the \n     Government; and\n       (D) to ensure that data collected for statistical purposes \n     by the Government are collected and reported in accordance \n     with established standards; and\n       (5) it is conducive and integral to a sound Federal policy \n     that the heads of major statistical agencies within a Federal \n     department or agency have direct access to the head of such \n     department or agency.\n\n     SEC. 502. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Chief Statistician.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a more centralized statistical system is integral to \n     efficiency;\n       (2) with increased efficiency comes better integration of \n     research, methodology, survey design, and taking advantage of \n     economies of scale;\n       (3) the Chief Statistician should have the authority, \n     personnel, and other resources necessary to carry out the \n     duties of that office effectively, including duties relating \n     to statistical forms clearance;\n       (4) statistical forms clearance at the Office of Management \n     and Budget should be better\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\n     distinguished from regulatory forms clearance; and\n       (5) recognizing that the Chief Statistician has numerous \n     responsibilities with respect to statistical policy and \n     coordination, the Chief Statistician should have a direct \n     reporting relationship with the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (b) Confidentiality.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) entities of the Federal Government (including the \n     Federal Council on Statistical Policy and the Interagency \n     Council on Statistical Policy) and private entities should \n     examine the efficacy of replacing the individual \n     confidentiality provisions of statistical agencies with a \n     single, uniform standard that guarantees confidentiality \n     across the affected agencies; and\n       (2) those entities should also examine the sharing of \n     confidential data for statistical purposes within the Federal \n     Statistical Service and special arrangements to permit the \n     sharing of confidential data for statistical purposes with \n     State agencies cooperating with Federal agencies in \n     statistical programs.\n       (c) Decennial Censuses.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the budget and functions of the Bureau of the Census relating \n     to any decennial census of population should be segregated \n     from the other budget and functions of the Bureau of the \n     Census.\n\n     SEC. 503.

and\n       (9) Congress should consider expanding the existing \n     expensing provision to cover investments in storefront \n     improvements and other depreciable real property in any \n     reform legislation that results from this study or, if \n     possible, in any earlier legislation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) many small businesses trying to improve their \n     storefronts on Main Street or investing to upgrade their \n     property would benefit if Congress expanded the existing \n     expensing provision to cover investments in depreciable real \n     property;

Mr. President, there is no way to measure the costs \nof gun crime in our society. There are estimates that put the price at \n$75 billion for one year of pain, suffering, and loss of quality of \nlife caused by gun violence, but there is no real way to determine the \nincalculable human cost of gun-related crime. There is, however, a \nmethod to measure other financial costs associated with firearm crime. \nFor instance, the estimated cost of health care for firearms related \ninjuries in the United States was $4 billion in 1995. The average per-\nperson cost of a firearm fatality is $373,000 per death, higher than \nany injury-related death. And, on average, it costs more than $14,000 \nto treat each child wounded by a firearm.\n  Cities spend millions each year on these costs and others associated \nwith gun related emergencies. The expenses incurred by cities include \nmedical treatment for victims, additional police protection, and \ncounseling services for survivors of murder victims. These additional \ncosts are the basis of the class-action lawsuits against the firearm \nmanufacturers, distributors and dealers. Nearly two dozen local \ngovernments, including Wayne County and Detroit, have filed suit \nagainst the manufacturers and distributors of firearms to recoup the \ncosts of firearm related crime. And following their lead, the NAACP \nfiled a lawsuit that does not seek monetary damages, but instead, seeks \nto put an end to the emotional costs of gun violence incurred by the \nAfrican-American community.\n  The recent wave of class-action lawsuits against the firearms \nindustry are based on the industry's failure to monitor the \ntransmission of their product to the underground markets. These class-\naction lawsuits seek to alter the marketing, distribution and sales of \nfirearms. More specifically, they are an attempt to remedy the \nindustry's failure to prevent unauthorized users from obtaining access \nto firearms, change the distribution system that permits firearms to be \neasily trafficked from the legal marketplace to the illegal \nmarketplace, and eliminate deceptive advertising regarding the risks \nposed by having firearms in the home. Stated simply, these lawsuits are \nabout distributing firearms responsibly.\n  The NAACP lawsuit is slightly different because it does not seek to \nrecover monetary damages, but the effect of the lawsuit would be the \nsame. It seeks to change the sale, marketing, and distribution of the \ngun industry, whose alleged negligence permits the free flow of weapons \nin to the hands of juveniles and criminals. It asks for a court order \nto limit the number of firearms a single buyer can purchase each month \nand would require gun manufacturers to train retailers about ``straw'' \npurchases, and supervise the sales practices of firearms distributors \nand retailers. It would also require that dealers operate from a fixed \nretail location, and ensure that handguns are manufactured with safety \ndevices.\n  If the gun industry is found liable, it will draw a direct line of \nresponsibility from the gun manufacturers to the unscrupulous \ndistributors and dealers who provide firearms to felons. The gun \nindustry would no longer be able to oversupply certain markets, thereby \nallowing guns to flow into the hands of juveniles and criminals. \nManufacturers would no longer be able to turn a blind eye to the \ncarnage produced by their products. If the gun industry is found \nliable, it may put an end to a majority of the gun violence caused by \nthe unlawful, unregulated, underground firearm market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9879-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9879-S9880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING LANCE ARMSTRONG\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I recognize the \nremarkable achievements of Lance Armstrong, winner of the prestigious \nTour de France bicycle race. On Sunday, July 25, less than 3 years \nafter being diagnosed with testicular cancer, he sprinted to an \ninspirational victory in Paris. Lance Armstrong is a Texan who is an \nexample of strength and courage to all cancer patients and athletes. He \nis only the second American in history to win the Tour de France, one \nof the world's most grueling athletic contests, and he is the first \ncancer survivor to achieve the feat.\n  Lance Armstrong was born in Dallas, Texas, and grew up in nearby \nPlano. He first competed in athletics as a swimmer and took up the \ntriathlon, which includes swimming, running, and cycling, at age 14. At \n17, after his potential was recognized by the U.S. national cycling \nteam coach, he switched to cycling full-time. Lance Armstrong\n\n[[Page S9880]]\n\ntrained and competed at the highest level in the world, and began \nfocusing on distance bicycle racing in his early twenties. Then, in the \nfall of 1996, when he was just twenty-five years old, Armstrong was \ndiagnosed with advanced testicular cancer, which had already spread to \nhis abdomen, lungs and brain. He was given a fifty percent chance of \nsurvival and underwent two operations and twelve weeks of chemotherapy. \nThroughout his fight with the disease, Lance Armstrong never gave up. \nAfter each one-week cycle of chemotherapy, he would ride 30 to 50 miles \nper day on his bicycle. By the summer of 1997, Armstrong had conquered \ncancer and began to pursue bicycle racing with new determination.\n  Lance Armstrong dominated this year's Tour de France and after three \nweeks, 2,290 miles, and two mountain ranges, he won cycling's most \nprestigious and rugged race by more than 7\\1/2\\ minutes. Lance \nArmstrong dedicated his victory to other cancer survivors, whom he \nhoped would be inspired by his success. He was motivated by his \ndetermination to encourage other cancer patients and said upon winning, \n``I hope this sends out a fantastic message to all survivors: We can \nreturn to what we were before--and even better.''\n  Lance Armstrong is one of the success stories in our ongoing fight \nagainst cancer. After overcoming the disease he dedicated himself, not \nonly to cycling, but also to fighting cancer by founding the Lance \nArmstrong Foundation, whose mission is ``Fighting Urological Cancer \nthrough Education, Awareness, and Research.''\n  Unfortunately, Lance Armstrong is not alone in his battle with \ncancer. Rates of testicular cancer have increased sharply over the past \nthirty years, especially among young men. The American Cancer Society \nestimates that about 7,600 new cases of testicular cancer are diagnosed \neach year in the U.S. But due to advances in early detection and \ntreatment, many of them the result of research funded by the National \nInstitutes of Health, U.S. statistics show a 70% decline in death rates \nfrom testicular cancer since 1973. As our commitment to cancer research \ncontinues to grow hand-in-hand with advances in the fight against \ncancer, and as more and more courageous Americans like Lance Armstrong \nshow cancer can be beat, I am increasingly confident that we will beat \nthis dreaded disease.\n  I am proud that Lance Armstrong is an American and a Texan. His \nathletic victory and personal triumph make him a role model, not just \nto cancer survivors, but to all Americans. His remarkable achievements \nand inspirational influence on others can be simply summarized in the \nwords written on a banner which was flown along the course of the Tour \nde France on Sunday: ``Victory is sweet. Living is triumph. Where \nthere's a will, there's a way. Thank you for showing us a winning \none.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9880-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO ``THE FOUR SEAS'' OF CENTERVILLE\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to recognize an outstanding business in Centerville, \nMassachusetts, ``The Four Seas'' ice cream parlor. Our family has known \nfor decades that the Four Seas has always produced excellent ice cream.\n  I am delighted to bring my colleagues' attention today to a New York \nTimes article last Sunday on ``The Four Seas'' and owner Richard \nWarren's extraordinary relationship with his employees and the entire \ncommunity. The article recognizes ``The Four Seas'' as a business which \nmakes some of the best ice cream on Cape Cod, and which also treats its \nemployees with the respect and generosity that make it a model for \nother employers.\n  It is gratifying to see the Four Seas receive this recognition that \nit eminently deserves. It is an honor to pay tribute to this \nextraordinary institution that is so beloved at Cape Cod. I ask that \nthe New York Times article may be printed in the Record.\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 25, 1999]\n\n              Prized Ice Cream Jobs Create Extended Family\n\n                            (By Sara Rimer)\n\n       Centerville, MA.--Cory Sinclair, 17, was scooping ice cream \n     at the Four Seas as fast as he could and talking about the \n     future.\n       ``I want to be President,'' he said. ``I'm serious.''\n       Kelly O'Neil, 18, had more prosaic concerns. ``I'm sorry, \n     we don't have jimmies,'' she informed a customer. (As any \n     Four Seas regular knows, jimmies don't belong on good ice \n     cream.)\n       Mixing up a batch of coconut, Bryan Schlegel, 22, was \n     feeling restless and wistful.\n       ``It's time to move on,'' he said. ``I've been here six \n     summers.''\n       The Four Seas, a white cottage with blue shutters and a \n     white formica counter with 12 blue stools, has been an \n     institution on South Main Street of this Cape Cod village for \n     65 summers.\n       The owner, Richard Warren, 64, who has been on the job for \n     45 years, makes what is indisputably delicious ice cream. He \n     uses fresh peaches, strawberries, blueberries and ginger, \n     expensive chocolate and loads of buttercream, and he tastes \n     every batch himself. He does not add candy or try bizarre \n     flavors.\n       But what also distinguishes the Four Seas is the help.\n       Summer after summer, the young men and women behind the \n     counter seem as unchanging as the decor, the ice cream and \n     the oldies on the radio. They are clean-cut and sport no \n     visible tattoos or strange piercing. They are alert and \n     polite, even when the customers are rude.\n       They are the class presidents, newspaper editors and honor \n     roll regulars from Barnstable High School who have been \n     handpicked by Mr. Warren, a retired math teacher and guidance \n     counselor there.\n       They start serving up cones at 16, and they stay through \n     college, ending their careers--and career is the word they \n     use--as ice cream makers and managers, like Mr. Schlegel.\n       ``It's the best job you can get on the Cape,'' said Tava \n     Ohlsen, 18, who graduated at the top of her class in June, \n     plans to go to medical school and moved up this summer from \n     ice cream scooper to sandwich maker. ``People say, `Oh, you \n     work at the Four Seas. You're a good student; you're good \n     with people.' ''\n       From the week before Memorial Day until the week after \n     Labor Day, the staff races from the counter to the ice cream \n     and back to keep up with the crowds. There are higher paying \n     summer jobs--the Four Seas is minimum wage, with tips \n     bringing it to about $10 an hour--but Mr. Warren never has \n     any trouble finding help.\n       He solicits recommendations from the faculty at Barnstable \n     High, and summons those with the highest ratings for \n     interviews.\n       ``It's known that you can't apply,'' Mr. Sinclair said.\n       To be called by Mr. Warren is to become a member of his \n     extended family.\n       ``He's like a second dad,'' said Jahni Clarke, 19. ``I tell \n     him about everything, from school to money to my love life.''\n       At the end of every summer Mr. Warren throws a staff party, \n     with dinner and a live band. He organizes an all-expenses-\n     paid ski weekend in New Hampshire every winter. He writes his \n     employees' college recommendations, and when they get to \n     college, he visits them.\n       He brings ice cream to their weddings (romance, \n     predictably, blooms behind the counter, and there have been \n     seven Four Seas marriages so far.\n       He has periodic reunions; at the last one, in 1988, only 4 \n     Four Seas alums, out of more than 200, were not able to make \n     it.\n       Mr. Warren is married, with four grown children. Each \n     season he gives out scholarships totaling several thousand \n     dollars in memory of his son Randy, who was killed in 1983 \n     when he was hit by a car while crossing the street in Fort \n     Lauderdale, Fla. He was 21.\n       ``I was never close to my dad,'' said Mr. Warren, who was \n     talking recently between greeting customers and making ice \n     cream. ``He was 46 when I was born. I longed for a \n     relationship with my children. Randy and I were so close. We \n     won the state father-son golf tournament. We'd ski all day, \n     play tennis till we dropped. He wanted to run this place \n     someday.\n       Randy lives on, in a way, Mr. Warren said, in the young \n     people who work beside him each summer. ``Bryan is like a \n     son,'' he said as he and Mr. Schlegel poured frozen pudding \n     ice cream into cartons. ``We just played in the father-son \n     golf tournament.''\n       Mr. Schlegel graduated this spring from the University of \n     Massachusetts at Amherst. He was recently called for an \n     interview in the customer service department of a Boston \n     investment banking firm. By fall, he said, he hopes to have a \n     permanent job.\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Clarke, who is a junior at the University of \n     Massachusetts, just moved up to manager. ``I'm the first \n     black manager,'' said Mr. Clarke, who was freshman class \n     president, and editor of the newspaper at Barnstable High, \n     which is mostly white.\n       Things do change at the Four Seas. As hard-working as his \n     25 employees are, Mr. Warren said that most do not want to \n     put in the hours that previous generations did.\n       ``They don't need the money as much,'' he said, adding that \n     whereas workers from summers past arrived on foot or by \n     bicycle, or were dropped off by their parents, almost all of \n     the employees now drive their own cars.\n       But the biggest change, the one everyone is talking about, \n     is that Mr. Warren's son Doug, 36, is back from Las Vegas, \n     where he had been running a restaurant and selling computer \n     software. The plan is for him to take over the ice cream \n     parlor. The elder Mr. Warren is talking about retiring in a \n     couple of years.\n       His staff is skeptical. ``The chief will never retire,'' \n     Ms. O'Neil said.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9881-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9881]]\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE HENIKA PUBLIC LIBRARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nHenika Public Library on its historic one hundredth anniversary.\n  Recently named a district library, Henika library has served Allegan \ncounty since 1899 when Ms. Julia Robinson Henika bequeathed two \nthousand dollars to the Wayland Ladies Library Association for \nconstruction of a library building. At that time there were only 500 \nvolumes of literature, none of which could be checked out. Since then, \nthe library has grown to over 35,000 volumes.\n  In 1916, Fannie Hoyt was hired as the first librarian and, for the \nfirst time, books could be checked out of the library. Between 1916 and \n1986 only four librarians have managed the Henika Public Library. This \nstability helps explain the unique environment that has allowed this \nlibrary to prosper for one hundred years.\n  In the mid 1990's the library underwent a series of renovations. The \nfinal result of this remodeling is an historic building, complete with \nVictorian charm, that can accommodate the most recent information \ntechnology. After serving Allegan county for almost the entire 20th \ncentury, Henika Public Library is now ready to take on the 21st \ncentury.\n  This library is truly one of the great educational tools in our \ncountry with a value matched by few others. We owe a great deal of \nthanks to the women of the Ladies Library Club as well as to all of the \npeople who have worked at this great institution for the last one \nhundred years. I know I speak for all of Michigan when I commend those \nwho have supported this fine institution for its 100 years of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9881-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CARLY FIORINA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to salute Carleton (Carly) \nFiorina of California, who was recently named president and chief \nexecutive officer of Hewlett-Packard Company. I wish to congratulate \nMs. Fiorina and express my best wishes for success in her new position.\n  Founded by technology pioneers William Hewlett and David Packard, \nHewlett-Packard (HP) is the world's second-largest computer company. \nBased in Palo Alto, California, HP employs more than 120,000 people \nworldwide and had a total revenue of $47.1 billion in its fiscal year \n1998, including $39.5 in computer-related revenue. The company is a \nleader in the industry and a cornerstone of California's economy.\n  In succeeding Lewis Platt, Ms. Fiorina has some big shoes to fill. In \nLew Platt's seven years as CEO, HP raised its revenues 187 percent and \nits earnings 436 percent.\n  But Carly Fiorina is prepared to build on HP's success and guide the \ncompany into new territory. She comes to HP with nearly 20 years of \nexperience in technology and telecommunications at AT and Lucent \nTechnologies. As president of Lucent's Global Service Provider \nBusiness, she led the division to dramatic increases in its growth \nrate, revenues, and market share. She has a well-earned reputation for \ndeveloping clear corporate strategies, building strong leadership \nteams, and accelerating growth in large technology businesses.\n  Carly Fiorina's move to the top of Hewlett-Packard has implications \nbeyond the company, the industry, and our state. That is because she is \nthe first woman to be named CEO of a Fortune 50 company or a company \nlisted in the Dow-Jones Industrial Average. So this important \naccomplishment for her as an individual is also an important milestone \nfor American women. It is only fitting that a pioneering company in \nsuch a forward-looking industry would break this critical barrier.\n  HP chose Ms. Fiorina to lead the company because of her merits, not \nher gender. That is clear. However, her selection is important for \nevery American woman. In July 1999, the same month that the U.S. \nwomen's soccer team inspired millions of American girls, Carly Fiorina \ninspired American women to raise the bar and reach for the top.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9881-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE SANDERS-CUNNINGHAM FAMILY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the Sanders/\nCunningham family as they celebrate their fifth annual reunion. This \nextended family of more than 100 members has traced its roots back to a \nGeorgia plantation in 1750, and before that to Ghana and Sierra Leone.\n  As descendants of Wiley and Annie Cunningham Sanders of Aberdeen, \nMississippi, they will gather together this weekend, July 30th through \nAugust 1st, in Springfield, Illinois, to celebrate their history, their \ncommon bonds, and their future.\n  The Sanders/Cunningham family considers their reunion to be an \nEmpowerment Summit, an opportunity to dispel false stereotypes, reject \nnegative images, and celebrate who they are. They have noted Dr. Martin \nLuther King Jr.'s statement that ``when the history books are written \nthey will tell of a Great People, a Proud People, a Black People.'' \nThey know they are part of that people and that their heritage is a \ncause for joy. With an extended family that includes doctors and \nlawyers, business owners and farmers, educators and blue collar \nworkers, they come together to celebrate their unity.\n  This 6th generation family is diverse, unique, and special. The \nSanders/Cunningham family's unity and strength is an example of what an \nAmerican family should represent. Additionally, this family is full of \nrich history. The family matriarch is 94 years young, Edna Sanders \nBrandon. She is a mother of five, a grandmother of 12, a great-\ngrandmother of 16, an aunt, and a great aunt to many. Edna has \nwitnessed events spanning the invention of the automobile to man's \nwalking on the moon, to the birth of the Internet.\n  All of us can benefit from an appreciation of our roots and our place \nin history. Knowing where we came from can be a helpful step in knowing \nwhere we are going. I applaud the Sanders/Cunningham family for their \nsense of heritage, their oneness, and their sense of empowerment. I \nwish them all the best as they gather in Springfield to celebrate who \nthey are, where they have come from, and what they have become, and as \nthey look forward to what they are yet to be.\n  In closing, I would like to pay special recognition to Steven E. \nRichie, a 4th generation member of this family who has spent countless \nhours researching and preparing for this grand family event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9881-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9881-S9882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MR. FRANCIS WILSON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. \nFrancis M. Wilson and his wonderful and admirable life.\n  Mr. Wilson served as a tech-sergeant during World War II in Germany \nwhen he was only 18 years old. He was a teacher in the Detroit Public \nSchool District, a devoted family man, and an active citizen. The \nchallenges he successfully faced in these capacities have distinguished \nhim within his family, his town, his state, and his country.\n  As a very young boy, he sold ``Liberty'' magazines to supplement his \nfamily's income during the Great Depression. Growing up during a time \nof financial strife led him to find solace in nature. Mr. Wilson was \nexposed to nature during his experience in the military and developed a \nlove and knowledge of it. As a young adult he was able to identify a \nvariety of birds, insects, trees, and flowers. He then went on to form \nand preside over a group of citizens that forced new construction to \nadhere to guidelines designed to protect nearby lakes.\n  Once he reached adulthood, Mr. Wilson found his real love, Dolores. \nTogether they found great joy in their children and grandchildren. Mr. \nWilson wanted to ensure that they received all the advantages that he \ndid not have. He inspired his children to put themselves through \ncollege. He provided them with the opportunity to grow up in a safe \nenvironment, allowing them to mature at a more deliberate pace than the \none that was forced upon him. His wife, Dolores, expresses the best \ntribute to Mr. Wilson when she writes ``this brave, honest, dedicated, \nordinary man was to his family and America `the staff of life' that \nfuels generations to come.''\n  Mr. Wilson expressed his passion for education through his \ninvolvement with children as a teacher of thirty\n\n[[Page S9882]]\n\nyears in the Detroit Public Schools. He gave and received respect from \nall he knew. He not only led by lecture but, more importantly and \neffectively, by example. He never left any doubt as to where he stood \nin a debate and firmly believed in right and wrong. Mr. Wilson offered \nlittle patience for individuals passing on responsibility as an excuse \nfor negligent or bad behavior. Personifying Winston Churchill's \nstatement, We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what \nwe give,'' Mr. Francis M. Wilson left this world an honorable, loyal, \nselfless servant to his country and a loved and missed father, \ngrandfather and husband.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9882-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANNIVERSARY OF THE PURPLE HEART MEDAL\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the \nanniversary of the Purple Heart Medal.\n  This medal has been given to U.S. soldiers for wounds received in \nmilitary action ever since George Washington invented the award during \nthe Revolutionary War. Recipients of this award have demonstrated \ncourage and love of country. Many of its recipients have made the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of freedom. We must never forget the \nsacrifices made by Americans who have fought for our democracy and \nprosperity.\n  In celebration of this anniversary and to stand as a permanent token \nof America's gratitude for the sacrifices made by recipients of this \ndistinguished medal, a memorial will be dedicated at Fort Snelling \nNational Cemetery in the great State of Minnesota on August 7, 1999. I \nwish to publicly thank those who made the memorial a reality, and I \nespecially wish to publicly thank those veterans who have earned the \nPurple Heart Medal by giving selflessly for democracy and our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9882-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY AT 100\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President. I rise today to offer my \ncongratulations to San Francisco State University as its friends, \nfaculty, staff and students celebrate its Centennial Year.\n  On March 22, 1899, the California Legislature established the San \nFrancisco State Normal School to provide training for the region's \nteachers for an initial student body of 31. Today San Francisco State \nUniversity has evolved into a major metropolitan university serving \nsome 27,000 students and offering more than 200 undergraduate and \ngraduate degrees. From nationally recognized biology, creative writing \nand journalism programs to the Nation's largest multimedia studies \nprogram, San Francisco State University is a vibrant academic force for \nits students and a valuable resource for the entire Bay Area.\n  For 100 years, San Francisco State University has been a leader in \nproviding quality, accessible higher education for California \nresidents. I am confident that the University's second century will be \ndistinguished by creating an even stronger educational experience for \nstudents through promoting excellence in teaching and learning, \nembracing diversity and fostering community partnerships that will \nenrich the cultural and economic life of the Bay Area.\n  I commend and congratulate San Francisco State University for all of \nits successes over the last 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/29/senate-section/article/S9882-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONGRATULATING THE BLACK BEARS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MAINE\n\n  Mr. ROTH.
