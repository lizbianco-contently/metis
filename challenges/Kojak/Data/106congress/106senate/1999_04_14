Mr. President, not very long ago it would have been \ndifficult to find anyone in this country who had heard of Kosovo, that \npart of the former Yugoslavia which is today engulfed in a humanitarian \ncalamity and where NATO is conducting the first combat operation in its \n50 year history.\n  During the past three weeks we have watched the catastrophe in Kosovo \nunfold. Over 600,000 Kosovar-Albanians have fled their homes or been \nherded onto trains with little more than the shirts on their backs, \nsimply because of their ethnicity and because they are Muslim.\n  Today they are struggling to survive in the mud and squalor of camps \nin Macedonia and Albania, or in third countries. Families have been \ntorn apart. Men and boys have been taken away and their fate is \nunknown. Women and girls have been raped. Children have been lost or \nabandoned.\n  Another 200-500,000 people are said to be displaced inside Kovoso, \nwith little access to food or medicine. Luckily it is not winter, but \nit is still a humanitarian disaster on a scale not seen in Europe for \nhalf a century.\n  I supported NATO's decision to attack Serbian President Milosevic's \nforces.\n  We could debate how we got to this point, about the way the \nnegotiations were handled at Rambouillet and whether he might have \nrefrained from invading Kosovo had the diplomacy been conducted \ndifferently.\n  Legitimate questions have been asked about whether the ultimatum put \nto the Serbs at Rambouillet, which would have led to the partition of \ntheir country, was realistic or sustainable. Many knowledgeable people \nhave argued that administration officials did not fully understand the \nhistory of the former Yugoslavia or the importance of Kosovo to the \nSerbs, that they seriously underestimated Milosevic, took a bad \nsituation and have made it worse.\n\n  We could also ask whether our relations with Russia, which have been \nbadly damaged in recent weeks, could\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nhave been managed better, and what role the Russians should be \nencouraged to play in helping to resolve this crisis.\n  But after the collapse of the Rambouillet talks, and after Milosevic \nhad ignored dozens of United Nations resolutions, violated every \nagreement he had signed, continued to slaughter innocent Kosovar-\nAlbanians and amassed tens of thousands of troops and armor on the \nKosovo-Serbia border--and there apparently is evidence that Milosevic \nplanned the expulsion of ethnic Albanians well before the NATO bombing \nbegan--we had but two choices:\n  Do nothing as Milosevic's forces rolled through Kosovo while savagely \nbeating or executing and burning the homes of every man, woman and \nchild who refused his ``ethnic cleansing''; or try to deter him with \nforce. I favored the latter.\n  Like so many others who hoped that Milosevic would accept autonomy \nfor Kosovo secured by an international peacekeeping force, I have seen \nmy worst fears realized.\n\n  The NATO air attacks have damaged Serbia's military infrastructure, \nbut they have failed to achieve their primary goal: preventing the \nethnic cleansing of Kosovo.\n  Milosevic's forces have swept through Kosovo burning whole villages, \nbrutalizing and killing civilians, leaving nothing in their wake and \nforcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee. It may not be on the \nscale of Nazi Germany, but it is certainly reminiscent of those days.\n  Mr. President, not many people would have anticipated the magnitude \nof the catastrophe that has befallen Kosovo today. But many people \npredicted that Milosevic would fight to hold on to Kosovo, and many \ndoubted that air power alone would stop him.\n  I favored the use of force. But, like many others, I have been \ndisappointed by the way this air campaign has been carried out.\n  We probably could not have stopped Milosevic's forces from invading \nKosovo after the Rambouillet talks collapsed. Forty thousand of his \nsoldiers, with tanks, were poised on the border ready to invade.\n  But I certainly expected that we would hit him with enough firepower \nso that among the first targets bombed would be those Serbian forces. \nInstead, they encountered almost no resistance as they emptied Kosovo \nof its inhabitants, destroyed their homes, and achieved complete \ncontrol over Kosovo in a matter of days--the very result we had sought \nto prevent.\n  Now his soldiers are hiding in the villages and rugged terrain of \nKosovo, and we are facing the far more difficult, dangerous and costly \nchallenge of forcing them to withdraw and creating a safe environment \nfor the refugees to return and rebuild their lives.\n\n  Despite claims by NATO and Pentagon officials that they predicted \neverything, the United States and the rest of NATO were clearly \nunprepared for the debacle that has unfolded. I suspect historians may \nnot look kindly on the Administration officials who did not have a \ncontingency plan if Milosevic refused to back down after a few days or \nweeks of NATO bombing, who seem to have no strategy except more \nbombing, and who apparently selected their targets by committee.\n  The fact that NATO leaders have been scrambling to get more aircraft \nto Kosovo, and that we are told that it will take weeks to put a few \nApache helicopters into service there, is perhaps the best evidence of \nthis.\n  Having said that, we should not lose sight of the reasons we are in \nKosovo. Had it not been for the Secretary of State, I doubt that anyone \nin the Administration would have argued as passionately for using force \nto try to prevent crimes against humanity.\n  I applaud her for it, because I believe that today, in the year of \nthe 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, NATO could not have \nturned its back on the ethnic cleansing of thousands of defenseless \npeople in the heart of Europe.\n  The alternative was to give a green light to Milosevic and other \nwould-be Milosevic's, and to severely curtail NATO's future role as an \nenforcer of international humanitarian law in Europe.\n\n  Some have suggested that because we did not act to prevent the \nslaughter in Rwanda, or in Sierra Leone, or Sudan, or any number of \nother places, that NATO should not intervene here.\n  I disagree. In fact, I believe that we and our allies in and outside \nof Africa should have tried to protect the innocent in Rwanda, where \nhalf a million people, in the span of only three months, were murdered \nbecause of their ethnicity.\n  If we have learned anything from that experience and others, it is \nthat by not acting, by allowing genocide to occur, we diminish \nourselves and we invite similar atrocities elsewhere.\n  Others have opposed our involvement in Kosovo on the grounds that we \nrisk becoming bogged down in another Vietnam. As one who in 1974 cast a \ndeciding vote against the Vietnam war, I am sympathetic to those \nconcerns.\n  But we and our NATO allies have been at war in Kosovo for a total of \nthree weeks. For the first four years of the Vietnam War, our \nGovernment's policy was strongly supported by the Congress and the \nAmerican people. It was only when the Pentagon's credibility was \nshattered by the 1968 Tet offensive, and it became clear that the war \ncould not be won, that the country turned against the war.\n  It is also interesting that some of the most vocal opponents of \nNATO's use of force in Kosovo are the very Members of Congress who \nstrongly supported our involvement in Vietnam.\n  Some of them have argued that since the Serbian people have rallied \nbehind President Milosevic we should recognize that our policy is not \nworking and find a way out. The reaction of the Serbian people is very \ntroubling, but it is a predictable consequence of war and Milosevic's \ntight control of the press. We saw the same thing in Iraq, despite \nSaddam Hussein's brutal repression of his own people.\n  One does not have to equate Milosevic with Hitler. But let us not \nforget that millions of Germans supported Adolf Hitler. That was hardly \na reason not to fight him.\n  And contrary to the lies of Serbian officials that the ethnic \nAlbanians who were rounded up and forced to flee were only trying to \nescape the NATO bombing, the refugees, many of whom saw their relatives \nmurdered, see NATO as their only hope.\n  The facts are:\n  Whether or not we believe that diplomacy handled differently might \nhave achieved a different result;\n  Whether or not the NATO military campaign should have been conducted \ndifferently once the decision to use force was made;\n  Whether or not the President should have publicly ruled out the use \nof ground forces;\n  Whether one likes it or not--we need to recognize the unavoidable \nfact of which the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, has so \nconsistently reminded us: Our country is the leader of NATO and NATO is \nfighting a war. Now that we are in it we need to win it. If we fail we \nwill all be the losers.\n  This is not the time to debate what might have been or to obfuscate \nor to hedge one's bets. It is a time to stand up as a country united \nbehind the President, the Secretary of State, the Pentagon, our \nsoldiers and our NATO allies in support of a cause that is just, and a \ncause that will determine the credibility, effectiveness, and future \nmission of NATO.\n  Let us remember. It is President Milosevic who is destroying the \nlives of the people of Kosovo, the very people whom he claims to \nrepresent. It is he who has driven them from their homes. It is his \nforces who are killing, raping and pillaging. It is his forces who are \nlaying landmines where refugees are fleeing.\n  And let us remember that this is not the first time President \nMilosevic has laid waste to an entire country. In Bosnia his troops \nmurdered thousands and buried them in mass graves, and uprooted \nhundreds of thousands, again because of their ethnicity.\n  We should all be concerned by the damage the NATO military campaign \nhas caused to our relations with Russia.\n  I am told that the Russian people are united in their anger at the \nUnited States like never before since the end of the Cold War.\n  They have seen their country transformed from a superpower to a \ncrippled giant. They felt that NATO's expansion was unnecessary and an \nattempt to gain advantage over Russia. They see\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nthe air attacks against Serbia as one more example of the unchecked \nmisuse of American power.\n  I am told that our policy has only strengthened the hard-liners in \nRussia.\n  I am disturbed by the photographs of Russian Prime Minister Primakov \ncoddling President Milosevic. We have also heard threatening statements \nby President Yeltsin and other Russian officials, opposing the NATO air \nstrikes and intimating that Russia might act militarily to defend its \ninterests in the Balkans.\n  No one can deny the overriding importance of our relations with \nRussia and the need to find a way for Russia to join with us in trying \nto resolve this crisis. Perhaps that includes a major role for Russian \nsoldiers in any international security force in Kosovo.\n  But the fact remains that it would be foolhardy for Russia to become \nmilitarily involved in Kosovo. The NATO attacks against Milosevic are \nnot in any way directed at Russia. All of NATO's members are \ncollectively standing up against genocide in Europe. Russia's long-term \neconomic and security interests are clearly better served by joining \nwith the United States and Europe, rather than casting its lot with the \nlikes of Milosevic.\n  We must also reflect on the reaction of the people of Serbia and \nMontenegro. For years our policy has failed to account for the \ncomplexities of the history of the Balkans, and we are paying a price \nfor that today.\n\n  We have a tendency to oversimplify and over-personalize our foreign \npolicy, to forget that in the past the Serbian people have suffered, \ntoo. But while we know that they also have been victimized by President \nMilosevic, we cannot excuse them for rallying to his defense when all \nof Europe is united against everything he represents.\n  Mr. President, there has been a great deal of talk, both pro and con, \nabout the deployment of American soldiers as part of a NATO ground \nforce, in Kosovo.\n  As much as I hope that ground troops are not necessary, I felt it was \nunwise to rule them out because I believe it only emboldened President \nMilosevic.\n  I also know of no one who thinks this mission can be accomplished by \nair power alone, and the administration needs a more realistic \nstrategy. We need policy based on solid plans--not policy based on \npolls.\n  Again, I think we should heed the advice of Senator McCain. What are \nour goals--NATO's goals--today? In my mind, it is to force Milosevic to \nagree to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of his forces from Kosovo, the \nsafe return of the refugees secured by an international force, and \nautonomy for Kosovo.\n  If we can prove the experts wrong and accomplish that with air power \nalone, so much the better.\n  But if we cannot, if ground troops are necessary to achieve our \ngoals, we must use them, and NATO should be making preparations for the \npossibility that they will be needed. The bulk of those forces should \ncome from Europe, but as the leader of NATO we would have a \nresponsibility to contribute our share.\n\n  To those who complain that Kosovo is not worth the life of a single \nAmerican soldier, I would say this: As Americans we cherish the life of \nevery American soldier, and we give our armed forces the best available \ntraining and technology to defend themselves. Military missions always \ninvolve danger. In this mission, an enormous amount is at stake for our \ncountry, for NATO, for the people of Kosovo, and for humanity.\n  What is the alternative? To give in to ethnic cleansing after taking \na principled stand against it? That would be a terrible defeat for \nNATO, and for the cause of international justice and security. It would \nbe a terrible precedent for us to bequeath to the generations that will \nfollow us in the next century.\n  No one can predict how long this war will last, or how it will end. \nLet us hope that President Milosevic soon recognizes that he risks \nlosing everything.\n  In the meantime, we owe our gratitude and our support to our \nsoldiers, and to the humanitarian relief organizations that are \nproviding emergency food, shelter and medical assistance to the \nrefugees.\n  They have been heroic.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about a disturbing report I \nreceived this morning that United States forces have used landmines \nagainst the Serbs.\n  I am told that these are anti-tank mines, but they are mixed with \nanti-personnel mines, which are prohibited under an international \ntreaty which unfortunately the United States has not signed.\n  However, every one of our NATO allies except for Turkey is a party to \nthat treaty, and I wonder if they are aware of this since our planes \nare using airfields located in those countries.\n  In fact, at last count 135 nations had signed the treaty, and 71 have \nratified. The United States should be among them.\n  Nobody would argue that the United States is bound by a treaty it has \nnot ratified. But it is very disappointing that at the same time that \nthe Administration is holding itself out as a leader in the worldwide \neffort to ban landmines, it is using mines itself.\n  Mr. President, I have asked the Pentagon to confirm whether or not \nthis report is true. I hope it is not.\n  But if it is true, it is only a matter of time before innocent people \nare maimed or killed by these weapons.\n  It sends the wrong message to the rest of the world. And frankly, \nwhile I support the Administration's use of force against Milosevic I \ndo not know anyone who believes we need landmines to achieve our goals. \nIt is unnecessary, it is wrong, and it will only further erode the \nAdministration's credibility on an issue that cries out for the United \nStates to set the example.\n  Mr. President, I am hoping this report is not true. But we will find \nout because if it is, we should stop using them. It is a disturbing \nthing that we would be so different from the rest of our allies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3669-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 76) commending the Purdue University \n     women's basketball team on winning the 1999 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association women's basketball \n     championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak not only on my own \nbehalf but on behalf of my senior colleague, Dick Lugar, who, \nunfortunately, could not be with us at the last moment. I know he will \nbe submitting his own remarks on behalf of the Lady Boilermakers and \ntheir outstanding victory in the NCAA women's basketball tournament \nthis year. I know the rules prohibit me from pointing anybody out in \nthe galleries, but I want to say how much I appreciate the presence of \nseveral constituents today; in particular, the mayor of West Lafayette, \nIN, several officials representing Purdue University, and several of \nour distinguished citizens from Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, and \nelsewhere across our State.\n  Mr. President, basketball is perhaps synonymous with the State of \nIndiana, not only because we love to play the game, not only because we \nbelieve in physical fitness, but because of the character, the \ndetermination, and the other fine attributes associated with that sport \nthat are necessary for success in it.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n  This year's Purdue women's basketball team, perhaps better than any \nother, exhibits those character traits. They are an example of Indiana \nat its finest and the United States of America at its finest. So I rise \ntoday to salute them both as individuals and as a team for their \naccomplishments.\n  Mr. President, this team was an example of near perfection. Their \nrecord was an outstanding 34 victories and only 1 defeat. They are the \nfirst women's championship team representing any Big Ten university in \nany sport. Their coach, Carolyn Peck, an outstanding individual, is not \nonly the youngest coach to lead a winning team to the NCAA tournament, \nbut she is also the first African American one to do it. One of their \nstar players, Stephanie White-McCarty, is not only a first-team \nathletic all-American, but also an academic all-American. As a matter \nof fact, Mr. President, she represents the rest of the team very well \nin that regard.\n  The team, as a whole, had a combined grade point average of 3.0, \nwhich is very good by today's standards, particularly with regard to \nthe athletic community.\n  Mr. President, once again, I salute the Lady Boilermakers for their \noutstanding contributions not only on the basketball court, but because \nof the outstanding individuals they are.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague from \nIndiana as a cosponsor of this Senate resolution commending the Purdue \nUniversity women's basketball team on winning the 1999 National \nCollegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) basketball championship.\n  The Lady Boilermakers this year have made Indiana history in becoming \nthe first women's sport to bring home a national championship title for \nPurdue University. They are also the first women's basketball team in \nthe Big Ten Athletic Conference to win the NCAA title.\n  This resolution is a fitting tribute and a deserving honor for Coach \nCarolyn Peck and the team members who persevered throughout the long \nseason and the playoffs to win the national title. Their commitment and \ndedication to this tremendous effort is demonstrated by their winning \nrecord of 34 games--including a string of 32 consecutive victories. \nThroughout this storied season, the Lady Boilers' skill and dedication \nwas matched only by the grace and dignity with which they carried \nthemselves as a team en route to the national title.\n  For departing seniors Ukari Figgs and Stephanie White-McCarty, this \nvictory is truly special as they complete their studies at Purdue and \nlook toward the future. Winning the NCAA title is an historic and \nspecial occasion--placing this team among a select company of national \nchampions. Their triumph will be remembered at Purdue and throughout \nour State for years to come.\n  The dedication and sportsmanship demonstrated throughout the season \nby the Lady Boilers reaffirm our strong basketball tradition in \nIndiana. The team's competitive spirit and commitment to excellence \nmake them deserving recipients of the accolades of the nation and the \nhonor of this special Senate resolution.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nand preamble be agreed to en bloc and that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, without intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Mr. President, baseball season began earlier this month \nand already the Senate is lagging behind the home run pace of Mark \nMcGwire. Last summer I began comparing the Senate's lack of progress on \njudicial nominations with home run pace of McGwire and other major \nleaguers. I had tried everything else I could think of: I had lectured \nthe Republican majority about the Senate's duty to the judicial branch \nunder the Constitution, I had cited the caseloads and backlogs in many \ncourts around the country, I had introduced legislation to prevent the \nSenate from going on vacation while the Second Circuit was experiencing \nan unprecedented emergency declared by Chief Judge Winter in the face \nof five vacancies out of 12 authorized members of the court.\n  I recently attended an historic meeting of the Baltimore Orioles \nmajor league baseball team and the Cuban team in Havana. During the \nEaster recess the Nation's Capital witnessed exhibition baseball \nbetween the Montreal Expos and the St. Louis Cardinals and got to see \nBig Mac in person. Maybe another baseball comparison can inspire the \nSenate into action on Federal judges this year.\n  It is already mid-April and the Senate has yet to act on a single \njudicial nominee. Worse yet the Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to \nhold or even schedule a confirmation hearing. At this rate, I will have \nto start comparing the Senate's pace for the confirmation of Federal \njudges to the home run pace of American League pitchers. Since they do \nnot bat, the Senate has a chance of keeping up with them.\n  Of course, last year the Senate had gotten off to an early lead on \nMark McGwire. Last January through the end of April, the Senate had \nconfirmed 22 judges. By the All Star break last July, the Senate had \nconfirmed 33 judges. It took Big Mac 10 weeks to catch and pass the \nSenate last year.\n  This year, McGwire passed the Senate's total on opening day. That is \nbecause this year the Senate has yet to confirm a single Federal judge. \nThat is right: In spite of the 33 judicial nominations now pending, in \nspite of the fact that at least a dozen of those nominees have been \npending before the Senate for more than 9 months, in spite of the fact \nthat four of those nominations were favorably reported by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and were on the Senate calendar last year, in spite \nof the 67 vacancies including 28 judicial emergency vacancies, the \nSenate has yet to confirm a single Federal judge all year. Incredibly \nMark McGwire is still on pace with what he accomplished last year. \nRegrettably, the Senate is not on even or on a slower pace than it was \nlast year; it has no pace at all.\n  By the end of last year, the Senate finally picked up its pace and \nconfirmed 65 Federal judges--the highest total since the Republican \nmajority took control of the Senate. That was 65 of the 91 nominations \nreceived for the 115 vacancies the Federal judiciary experienced last \nyear. Together with the 36 judges confirmed in 1997, the total number \nof article III Federal judges confirmed during the last Congress was a \n2-year total of 101--the same total that was confirmed in 1 year when\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nDemocrats last made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. Of course, \nthe Senate fell short of the record-setting 70 home run total of Mark \nMcGwire and 66 homers hit by Sammy Sosa.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States has recommended that \nCongress authorize an additional 69 judgeships besides, in order for \nthe Federal courts to have the judicial resources they need to do the \njustice. These are in addition to the 67 current vacancies. That means \nthat the Federal courts need the equivalent of 136 more judges. I \ncannot remember a time when the resource needs of the Federal courts \nwere so neglected by the Congress.\n  During the four years that the Republican majority has controlled the \nSenate, it has barely kept up with attrition when it comes to judicial \nvacancies. Even with the confirmations achieved last year, the current \nvacancies number as many as existed at the time the Senate recessed in \n1994. The Senate has not made the progress it should have in filling \nthe longstanding vacancies that continue to plague the Federal \njudiciary. The Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and others \ncontinue to speak of the problem of too few judges and too much work. \nIn 1997 the Chief Justice noted: ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high \nlevels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that \ntraditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.''\n  Both the Second Circuit and the Ninth Circuit have had to cancel \nhearings over the past couple of years due to judicial vacancies. The \nSecond Circuit has had to declare a circuit emergency and to proceed \nwith only one circuit judge on their three-judge panels.\n  The New York Times ran a front-page story recently on how the \ncrushing workload in the Federal appellate courts has lead to what the \nTimes called a ``two-tier system'' for appeals. In testimony and \nstatements over the last few years, I have seen Chief Judge Winter and \nformer Chief Judge Newman of the Second Circuit, Chief Judge Hug and \nJudge Trott of the Ninth Circuit and Chief Judge Hatchett of the \nEleventh Circuit all warn of the problem of too few judges and too much \nwork. I deeply regret that these twin problems have combined to lead to \nthe perception that the Federal appellate courts can no longer provide \nthe same attention to individual cases that has marked the Federal \nadministration of justice in the past.\n  Appellate courts have had to forgo oral argument in more and more \ncases. Litigants are being denied any opportunity to see the judges who \nare deciding their causes. Law clerks and attorney staff are being used \nmore and more extensively in the determination of cases as backlogs \ngrow. As caseloads grow, bureaucratic imperatives seem to be replacing \nthe administration of justice. These are not the ways to engender \nconfidence in our system of justice, acceptance of the judicial \nprocess, support for the decisions being rendered or respect for \ncourts. Congress needs to support the judicial branch with the judges \nand other resources it needs.\n\n  Instead of sustained effort by the Senate to close the judicial \nvacancies gap, we have seen extensive delays continue and unexplained \nand anonymous ``holds'' become regular order.\n  The only thing the Judiciary Committee does not ``hold'' any more is \njudicial confirmation hearings. I recall in 1994--the most recent year \nin which the Democrats constituted the majority --when the Judiciary \nCommittee held 25 judicial confirmation hearings, including hearings to \nconfirm a Supreme Court Justice. By April 15, 1994, we had held 5 \nhearings involving 21 nominees, and the Committee had reported 18 \nnominations. Even last year, the Committee had held four confirmation \nhearings by this time. This year the Committee has not held a single \nhearing on a single judicial nomination.\n  The Senate continues to tolerate upwards of 67 vacancies in the \nFederal courts with more on the horizon--almost one in 13 judgeships \nremains unfilled and, from the looks of things, will remain unfilled \ninto the future. The Judiciary Committee needs to do a better job and \nthe Senate needs to proceed more promptly to consider nominees reported \nto it.\n  We made some progress last year, but if last year is to represent \nreal progress and a change from the destructive politics of the two \npreceding years in which the Republican Senate confirmed only 17 and 36 \njudges, we need to better last year's results this year. The Senate \nneeds to consider judicial nominations promptly and to confirm without \nadditional delay the many fine men and women President Clinton is \nsending us.\n  Already this year the Senate has received 33 judicial nominations. I \nam confident that many more are following in the days and weeks ahead. \nUnfortunately, past delays mean that 28 of the current vacancies, over \n40 percent, are already judicial emergency vacancies, having been empty \nfor more than 18 months. A dozen of the nominations now pending had \nbeen received in years past. Ten are for judicial emergency vacancies. \nThe nomination of Judge Paez to the Ninth Circuit dates back over 3 \nyears to January 1996.\n  In his 1998 Year-End Report of the Federal Judiciary, Chief Justice \nRehnquist noted: ``The number of cases brought to the federal courts is \none of the most serious problems facing them today.'' Criminal cases \nrose 15 percent in 1998, alone. Yet the Republican Congress has for the \npast several years simply refused to consider the authorization of the \nadditional judges requested by the Judicial Conference.\n  In 1984 and in 1990, Congress did respond to requests for needed \njudicial resources by the Judicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a \nDemocratic majority in the Congress created judgeships during a \nRepublican presidential administration.\n\n  In 1997, the Judicial Conference of the United States requested that \nan additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the country. This year \nthat request has risen to 69 additional judgeships.\n  In order to understand the impact of judicial vacancies, we need only \nrecall that more and more of the vacancies are judicial emergencies \nthat have been left vacant for longer periods of time. Last year the \nSenate adjourned with 15 nominations for judicial emergency vacancies \nleft pending without action. Ten of the nominations received already \nthis year are for judicial emergency vacancies.\n  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted the \nvacancy crisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency \nvacancies and observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a \nconsiderable time for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final \nfloor vote.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no \nobligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary \ntime for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.''\n  During the entire 4 years of the Bush administration there were only \nthree judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as \nlong as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a \nyear. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more \nthan 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended \nover a year to a year and one-half. In 1998 another 10 confirmations \nextended over 9 months: Professor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 \nmonths--the longest-pending judicial nomination in the history of the \nUnited States--Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki \nMollway's confirmation took 30 months, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 \nmonths, Margaret McKeown's confirmation took 24 months, Margaret \nMorrow's confirmation took 21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's \nconfirmation took 15 months, Rebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 \nmonths, Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 months, and Victoria \nRoberts' confirmation took 11 months.\n  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky \nnominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, \nthe Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of \ndays from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The \naverage rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the average number of days \nfrom nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again. From \ninitial nomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate \naction on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for \nthe first time in our history. It was 212 days.\n  Unfortunately, that time is still growing and the average is still \nrising to the detriment of the administration\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nof justice. Last year, in 1998, the Senate broke the record, again. The \naverage time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 judges \nconfirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. At each step of the process, \njudicial nominations are being delayed. Prime examples are Judge \nRichard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, and Marsha Berzon, who have each \nhad to be renominated again this year.\n  I again urge the Senate to take seriously its responsibilities and \nhelp the President fill the longstanding vacancies in the Federal \ncourts around the country. Today the score is running against the \nprompt and fair administration of justice--vacancies 67, nominations \n33, confirmations zero.\n  In conclusion, last year I talked about judicial nominations and Mark \nMcGwire. I talked about how well Mark McGwire had been doing. I \ncompared his home run numbers, and that he was going along a lot faster \nthan our judicial nominations. And I may do a little bit of that this \nyear, as well.\n  But I put a little magnifying glass up here to the chart. Here are \nthe number of vacancies of Federal judges. Of course, a person can \nbecome a Federal judge only after a nomination and confirmation by the \nSenate.\n  Here are the vacancies--67. I put a magnifying glass on the chart so \neverybody can see how many we have confirmed. Zero. Diddle squat. That \nis all we have done--no confirmations whatsoever. In fact, I don't \nthink we have even had a hearing. We are now in the fourth month of the \nyear and about to go into the fifth month. I don't think in my 25 years \nhere we have ever gone this long, especially in the middle of a \nPresident's term, without even having any hearings.\n  Mark McGwire is ahead of us in home runs, both on confirmations and \non nomination hearings. Last year we got a little bit ahead of him, at \nleast until the baseball season began. We had confirmed by the time of \nthe All-Star break in July something like 33 judges. It took Mark \nMcGwire almost 10 weeks to catch up and pass us last year. This time he \npassed us on the very first day he goes out to bat. The very first day \nthat he is playing he beats us.\n  I have heard it said that we can't confirm nominees that we don't \nhave. We have 33 nominees up here right now. They are here sitting \nbefore the Senate. Some have already had hearings last year, and they \njust sit there and sit there, and we don't vote on them. We don't \nconfirm them.\n  Look at how we have done in the past. Let's go a little backward. In \n1994, we confirmed 101. In 1999, we only confirmed 65. Mark McGwire hit \n70 home runs.\n  I think we will talk a little more about this as we go along. We have \nalso had a problem with the time between nomination and confirmation. \nAgain, it doesn't answer the question to say we can't confirm people if \nthey are not nominated. In fact, they are nominated, and they still \ndon't get confirmed and those that do are taking longer every year. In \n1993, it took the average time of 59 days to get them confirmed. Now it \ntakes 232 days. I know of people who have declined appointments to the \nFederal bench. Why? Because they can't get confirmed at all or \nconfirmed in a reasonable time.\n  So the bottom line, Mr. President, is here we are with 67 vacancies \nand zero confirmations. And I am willing to bet that, at the rate we \nare going, Mark McGwire is going to be way ahead of us all year long.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we would have an \nobjection to a measure that has already, in a sense, been initiated by \nthe President and deals with amelioration and comfort to the troops--\nour sons and daughters that are in harm's way today, as we have all \nbeen highly focused on Kosovo. This sends a very positive message--and \nit has been broadly agreed to--to their families and to the fighting \nmen and women, and it is a shame that we have to get balled up at a \ntime like this when we are under such duress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia that this is \nimportant legislation. It has bipartisan support and we should move \nforward with the legislation. There is nothing that indicates that \nanybody is going to prolong this debate unnecessarily. We simply think \nit is appropriate that this legislation be handled in the manner that \nlegislation has been handled in this body for many years--in fact, a \ncouple centuries.\n  We understand that we are going to help the fighting men and women of \nour country, and it is certainly appropriate to do it around tax time \nbecause that is what this matter relates to, the tax burdens that face \nsome of our people. There will be a delay, for example, as to when they \nhave to file their returns. We are willing to do that, but we are not \nwilling to enter into a restrictive agreement that just allows the \nmanager to submit an amendment and no one else. We are ready to move \nforward on this legislation. We should be debating it now. We could go \nforward with the legislation this very minute and have this wrapped up \nin a matter of a few hours.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank my good colleague from Nevada. \nI want to elaborate.\n  The reason is not to facilitate my own amendments. It is to \nfacilitate the issue for which, as he has acknowledged, there is broad \nagreement. I think that the thinking here was that this very simple \nproposal which would help our fighting men and women, for which there \nis broad agreement, could be handled and moved forward. It is very \nclear that a Member on your side of the aisle, who is purporting to \nwant to amend it, is talking about something that would be very \ncontroversial and would entangle the simple proposal that could be an \nimmediate gesture to our fighting men and women, to which the whole \nCongress has agreed. The\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nHouse passed it unanimously yesterday. I just reiterate that this is a \nneedless delay on something that is designed for our fighting men and \nwomen, no matter how you look at it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the needless delay is taking time here and \nbeing enmeshed in procedural matters that need not be enmeshed. I was \nasked to listen to a unanimous consent proposal that was advocated and \npropounded by my friend from Georgia. It is something that we believe \nis inappropriate. This legislation is going to pass and it is going to \npass quickly. I think it will pass with relatively no opposition. The \nsooner we get to the merits of this legislation, the better off we will \nbe.\n  I think it would not be untoward to allow a Member on that side or \nthis side to offer an amendment. If the amendment is no good, and \nunderstanding the underlying importance of this legislation, it will \neither be defeated or the person will withdraw it. But there may be \nways of improving this bill, ways that we can help the fighting men and \nwomen of our country in a manner different than is set forth in this \nlegislation. I say to my friend, let's move forward with the \nlegislation. It is now 1:25. I think this legislation could be passed \nby 4 o'clock with no trouble at all. So I hope we can move just as \nquickly as possible. This is important legislation for the people that \nare over in harm's way. We want to assist them in any way that we can.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me simply say, I think my friend is \ncorrect. I think we can pass this in 5 minutes. But it isn't going to \nbe passed because of the proposal that is being propounded. It has been \nvetted on both sides. As he said, there is broad agreement on this. \nAnything that would improve it would have been accepted. You are \ntalking about another debate completely out of context with the \nbenefits proposed in here. Those proposals are highly controversial. So \nthese soldiers and sailors are being held hostage for that view. I \nthink that is inappropriate.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the underlying bill is a pretty good bill, \nbut it is not perfect. I think we should have the opportunity to take a \nlook at it. Too often around here there is a group of people that get \ntogether and they agree on a piece of legislation which they think is \nmiraculous and will solve all the problems of a certain issue. There \nare 100 Members of the Senate, and five or six people get together and \nbring it to the floor, and the procedure we follow too often is if \nanybody wants to debate it, they are considered obstructionists, people \nwho don't believe in the underlying issue.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, that we on this side of the aisle \nbelieve in the underlying issue here. We want to provide tax relief for \nour fighting men and women, the soldiers, sailors and airmen who have \ngiven so much to this country in the last month. We also think that the \nlegislation should be seen in the light of day. There are 95 other \nMembers in the Senate that should have the opportunity to review this \nlegislation. We are saying on this side, let's give them an \nopportunity; let's let those people who haven't been in on this so-\ncalled deal to bring this legislation up. Let them also take a look at \nthis legislation. There may or may not be amendments offered, but there \nis going to be nothing done. We will prevent this bill from passing.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business for a period of 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the House Commerce Committee today, the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Power took the first step in what is fast \nbecoming a futile ritual here in Congress.\n  The subcommittee reported to the full committee a revised version of \nH.R. 45--the latest in a long string of legislative efforts to single \nthe State of Nevada out as the dumping ground for the nuclear power \nindustry's toxic high-level waste.\n  The bill approved by the subcommittee today consists of a now \nfamiliar assault on the environment and the health and safety of \nmillions of Americans, both in Nevada and along transportation routes \nthroughout the Nation.\n  It requires the expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars on a \ncompletely unnecessary and misguided ``interim storage'' facility in \nNevada.\n  It makes a mockery of the National Environmental Policy Act process, \nand preempts every local, State, and Federal statute or regulation that \ninterferes with the nuclear power industry's crusade to move high-level \nwaste to Nevada, no matter what the costs or consequences may be.\n  The bill is an unprecedented power grab by the nuclear power \nindustry, trampling on the most fundamental states' rights.\n  The bill overrides years of work by the Environmental Protection \nAgency in establishing a science based radiation standard, and \nsubstitutes by legislative fiat a standard more than six times less \nprotective than generally accepted for citizens anywhere else in the \nUnited States.\n  By shipping waste to Nevada in advance of determining the suitability \nor licensibility of the Yucca Mountain site, the bill also irreversibly \nprejudices the scientific work at the site.\n  Any hope for an objective evaluation of Yucca Mountain will be lost.\n  The bill approved by the subcommittee today is an environmental and \npublic health travesty.\n  Fortunately, as in the past two Congresses, the bill stands no chance \nof enactment into law.\n  President Clinton continues to oppose the nuclear power  industry's \nspecial interest legislation, and will veto the bill should it ever \nreach him.\n\n  Even the industry knows there is absolutely no doubt of the firmness \nof the President's veto threat.\n  Congress will vote to sustain the President's veto, and we will have \nonce again wasted years of time and effort on a useless battle of \nwills, when we could have be working together towards an equitable, \nreasonable, and safe resolution of any legitimate grievances the \nnuclear power industry has with the federal high-level nuclear waste \nprogram.\n  The nuclear power industry's obsession with moving its waste to off-\nsite, no matter what the consequences, defies all logic.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, and the industry itself agree that the waste can be stored \nsafely on site for the foreseeable future.\n  Somehow, though, moving waste off-site has become the ``holy grail'' \nof the industry.\n  Taking the liability for the industry's environmental travesty has \nbeen their only rallying cry.\n  Unfortunately for the industry, commercial nuclear power's problems \ncannot be solved by waste legislation, or anything else we may do here \nin Congress.\n  Nuclear power is a declining industry, unable to compete in an \nincreasingly competitive electricity marketplace.\n  An industry once touted as a technological marvel--one which we were \ntold could produce power ``too cheap to meter'' at thousands of reactor \nsites--has turned into an aged collection of ``white elephants,'' \nstruggling to keep operating.\n  As the electricity marketplace moves away from the regulated \nenvironment, an environment which virtually guaranteed full cost \nrecovery for utilities huge investments in nuclear plants, the cost of \nnuclear power continues to rise, due to increasingly expensive \nmaintenance and retrofit costs to keep the plants in operation.\n  While the industry likes to portray what they describe as ``radical \nenvironmentalists'' for its inability to compete, the true cause for \nnuclear power's demise is simple economics.\n  The value of nuclear power plants in today's electricity marketplace \nhas plummeted.\n  Nuclear plants that do sell barely fetch any price in today's \nmarkets, and 21 reactors have simply been allowed to shut down.\n  As the thoughtful newspaper article that I will insert in the Record \nmakes pretty clear, nuclear power is an industry with no future.\n  Unfortunately, the industry's last gasp, its last in a long series of \nstrategic miscalculations, appears to be to\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\ndeposit its legacy of high-level waste in Nevada.\n  Since its very inception, the nuclear power industry has shown a \ntotally irresponsible lack of foresight in dealing with its highly \ntoxic waste stream.\n  For decades, the industry has shut its eyes to its growing volume of \nhigh-level waste, and continued to generate waste with absolutely no \nrational plan to manage it.\n  The end result of this irresponsible lack of planning--or maybe the \nreal plan all along--has been simply a demand that the commercial \nutilities be permitted to shove the waste problem off on the American \npublic.\n  In 1982, the industry convinced Congress to accept responsibility for \ndisposing of the waste, and, ever since then, the industry's demands on \nthe Federal Government, and the Treasury, have only increased.\n  The nuclear power industry's surreal sense of entitlement got a jolt \nof reality last week.\n  For years, the industry has saturated Congress with frightening \nscenarios of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in supposed \ndamages at the expense of the American taxpayer resulting from delays \nin the Federal Government's high-level waste program.\n  Last week, the U.S. Court of Claims dismissed one of the utilities \nself-serving billion-dollar lawsuits.\n  The Court told Northern States Power, which had filed a claim for \nover $1 billion, to return to DOE, and seek appropriate adjustments \nunder the contract the utility had signed in the early 1980s.\n  More dismissals of utilities outrageous damage claims are sure to \nfollow.\n  While the math leading to the industry's claims of $80-$100 billion \nin damages was always very mysterious and suspect, last week's decision \nby the Court of Claims should lay this outrageous scare tactic to rest \nfor good.\n  The nuclear power industry, or, more accurately, its ratepayers, do \nhave some legitimate grievances with the DOE.\n  Since 1990, I have introduced legislation to help the Department of \nEnergy and the industry address problems created by the Department's \ninability to meet the 1998 waste acceptance deadline.\n  Under this legislation, utilities would be allowed credits against \nNuclear Waste Fund payments for the costs associated with storage of \nwaste the DOE was scheduled to accept.\n  Recently, numerous proposals have surfaced which call into question \nthe fundamental approach of legislation such as H.R. 45 and its \npredecessors.\n  On the House side, legislation has been introduced, based upon a \nprevious DOE proposal, which would allow utilities to escrow Nuclear \nWaste Fund payments, and use some of the investment income from these \nescrow accounts to pay the costs of on-site storage.\n  In the Senate, a proposal is being developed to seek at least a \npartial technological solution to the high-level waste problem, through \nresearch and development of transmutation technology.\n  This week, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research \nreleased a proposal which would store high-level waste on reactor \nsites, under the stewardship of a federally chartered non-profit \ncorporation.\n  The Secretary of Energy has his own very generous proposal to the \nutilities to address any inequities created by the DOE's failure to \nmeet the 1998 deadline.\n  As a settlement offer to the many utilities filing lawsuits against \nthe Department, the Secretary has offered to take title to the waste at \nreactor sites.\n  Under the Secretary's proposal, utilities would be relieved of both \nfinancial and legal responsibility for the waste, leaving full \nresponsibility for the waste in the hands of the federal government.\n  The Secretary's offer is more than generous. The modest adjustments \nin fees available to the utilities under the Standard Contract would be \nadequately addressed, in my view, by the Secretary's proposal.\n  Several utilities, including Commonwealth Edison, one of the largest \nnuclear utilities in the nation, recognizing the futility of the \nnuclear power lobby's continued insistence on interim storage in \nNevada, have indicated an interest in accepting the proposal.\n  As the details of the proposal continue to develop, and as the \nprospects for interim storage in Nevada continue to decline, other \nutilities are sure to follow.\n  In fact, for most utilities, the interim storage proposals currently \nbefore Congress provide little or no actual relief.\n  For many utilities, even the overly optimistic 2003 deadline for the \nstart of operation of an interim storage facility is too little, too \nlate.\n  By that time, many nuclear utilities intending to continue to operate \nnuclear plants will have already had to invest in additional on-site \nstorage.\n  For any of these utilities, the Secretary's offer of taking title \nprovides far greater opportunity for relief than the pending \nlegislation--even if the legislation had any chance of passage.\n  Any utility CEO who refuses to consider the Secretary's offer to take \ntitle would be doing the utility's shareholders, and ratepayers, a \ngrave disservice.\n  Until the nuclear power industry can recognize that the tired, futile \napproach they have adopted for more than 5 years is going nowhere, and \nis merely setting a course for yet another legislation train wreck, \nCongress cannot address in any reasonable fashion whatever legitimate \nissues the industry may raise.\n  It is well past the time that the industry should abandon its \npipedream of interim storage in Nevada, and come to the table to \nnegotiate an equitable financial and legal solution to its dispute with \nthe federal government over its high-level waste.\n  In case there is any question of the prospects for enactment for the \nbill marked up today by the Energy and Power Subcommittee, I will have \nprinted in the Record a letter from the Secretary of Energy, dated \nyesterday, which puts the committee on notice that any legislation \nestablishing interim storage in Nevada will be vetoed by the President.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Secretary of Energy, \ndated April 13, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Joe Barton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and Power, Commerce \n         Committee, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I was disappointed to learn that your \n     subcommittee will hold a markup tomorrow on interim storage \n     legislation, H.R. 45, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act Amendments \n     of 1999. I understand that there have been some discussions \n     between the Department's staff and your staff about my \n     alternative proposal to take title to spent fuel from \n     utilities at reactor sites, and I had hoped that some \n     agreement could be reached on this alternative prior to the \n     subcommittee taking action on legislation. I continue to \n     believe that taking title to spent fuel at reactor sites \n     could provide a basis for resolving many of the utilities' \n     concerns, particularly in light of the recent decision by the \n     U.S. Court of Federal Claims that the standard contract \n     provides an adequate remedy.\n       I appreciate the fact that your substitute includes \n     authority for the Department of Energy to take title to spent \n     fuel at reactor sites and provisions intended to minimize the \n     potential for continued litigation over the Department's \n     contracts with utilities. The Department has not done a \n     detailed analysis of these provisions of your substitute, but \n     they appear to address many of the Department's concerns \n     raised when I appeared before your subcommittee on March 12, \n     1999.\n       Let me reiterate, however, the Administration's opposition \n     to any legislation that would make a decision to place \n     interim storage in Nevada prior to completion of the \n     scientific and technical work necessary to determine where a \n     final repository will be located.\n       As you are well aware, the Department has completed \n     considerable technical work at Yucca Mountain and submitted \n     its viability assessment to the Congress and the President in \n     December 1998. While the viability assessment found no \n     technical showstoppers at Yucca Mountain, it identified a \n     number of scientific issues that remain to be addressed \n     before the Department will be able to make a judgment on the \n     suitability and licensability of the site. Making a decision \n     now to place interim storage in Nevada, in advance of \n     completion of the scientific and technical work at Yucca \n     Mountain, would prejudge the scientific work, would undermine \n     public confidence that a repository evaluation will be \n     objective and technically sound, and would jeopardize the \n     credibility of any future decisions related to Yucca \n     Mountain. It also does not make sense to transport spent fuel \n     across the country until we know where the final repository \n     will be.\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n       As we have discussed, both the Administration and the \n     Congress have been aware for some time that the overall \n     constraints of the federal budget process have the potential \n     to limit the availability of funding for the nuclear waste \n     program in the out-years. The Administration strongly opposes \n     provisions that would take the Nuclear Waste Fund off-budget \n     without fully paying for it, and that would exempt this \n     action from the pay-as-you-go provisions of the Balanced \n     Budget Act. However, I would like to continue to work with \n     you to assure that the repository program continues to be \n     adequately funded and that the revenues raised by the nuclear \n     waste fee remain available to complete the job of safe \n     management and disposal of nuclear waste.\n       Finally, the Administration also strongly objects to \n     provisions of the bill that would weaken existing \n     environmental standards by preemption of Federal, State, and \n     local laws.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Administration remains \n     opposed to the proposed interim storage legislation, and I \n     would recommend a veto if legislation containing these \n     provisions were presented to the President.\n       The Department has been discussing my alternative proposal \n     to take title to spent fuel at reactor sites with a number of \n     utilities and other interested parties, and we will continue \n     to do so. In the very near future, I hope to have a meeting \n     with a group of utility executives whose companies have \n     indicated an interest in discussing the proposal further. I \n     will keep you informed of our continued efforts to reach \n     agreement with the utilities on my proposal, and I look \n     forward to working with you on these issues.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                  Bill Richardson.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. In addition, the letter outlines numerous other \nenvironmental and fiscal concerns that the administration has with the \nrevised version of H.R. 45 and makes it absolutely clear that the bill \nmoving through the House in no way removes the administration's strong \nobjection to this legislation. I will also have printed for the Record \na letter from President Clinton earlier this year which repeats his \nveto threat in very clear and uncertain terms. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that letter to this Senator, dated February 16, 1999, \nand signed by the President of the United States, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dick: Thank you for your letter requesting a \n     restatement of my Administration's position on legislation \n     siting a centralized interim high-level nuclear waste storage \n     facility in Nevada.\n       As we have stated repeatedly in the past, if legislation \n     such as that passed by the Senate or the House in the 105th \n     Congress were presented to me, I would veto it. Such \n     legislation would undermine the credibility of our nuclear \n     waste disposal program, by, in effect, designating a \n     specified site for an interim storage facility before \n     adequate scientific information regarding the suitability of \n     that site as a permanent geological repository is available.\n       Thank you again for your interest in this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the bill approved by the House Energy and \nPower Subcommittee today is an environmental and fiscal travesty with \nabsolutely no chance of enactment.\n  I urge Congress to once again reject this misguided and dangerous \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \nappeared in the Las Vegas Review-Journal dated March 28, 1999, which \noutlines the dreadful prospect that the nuclear power industry has for \nany future, based upon the economics as I outlined in my statement.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Cost, Not Safety, Imperils Nuclear Power\n\n                             (By Jeff Donn)\n\n       SAN ONOFRE, Calif.--Surfers have been riding the thundering \n     breakers of this beach since the days of the steam \n     automobile, long before anyone cracked an atom to make \n     electricity.\n       Joe Higgs adopted this beach as his second home even before \n     bulldozers scraped away 1.5 million cubic yards of sandstone \n     bluff for the first of three nuclear reactors. He and the San \n     Onofre nuclear plant are uneasy neighbors to this day, \n     peering at each other through barbed-wire fencing.\n       ``I've learned to live with that. I love surfing, and I \n     love the ocean so much,'' he said, looking up at the plant's \n     three protective domes designed to seal in radioactivity \n     during an accident.\n       But then he added: ``I wish it wasn't here, to be \n     truthful.''\n       The way the nuclear industry is declining, his wish might \n     yet come true.\n       Since the Three Mile Island accident in Middletown, PA, 20 \n     years ago today, American attitudes toward nuclear power have \n     been characterized by paralyzing ambivalence and mood swings. \n     Under public pressure, the industry and government have \n     profoundly reworked safeguards at tremendous effort and cost. \n     Warily, the public has watched 51 commercial reactors hum to \n     life in the years since the accident. All of them had been \n     planned before Three Mile Island; none has been ordered \n     since.\n       Virtually no one in the industry can imagine building a \n     plant in the foreseeable future.\n       It is not runaway chain reactions but exploding costs that \n     have jeopardized this $43 billion a year business. With \n     barely a whimper, the nation has let 21 atomic reactors shut \n     down. That's 17 percent of its total of 125. They are victims \n     of the intertwined costs of safety changes and heavy \n     staffing, building debt, and mounting expense to replace \n     parts, clean up abandoned sites, and store radioactive waste.\n       Cranking up pressure, some states are making nuclear power \n     stand on its own as they drop guaranteed electric rates for \n     power monopolies to inject competition into energy \n     production.\n       The nuclear industry still supplies about one-fifth of the \n     country's power--second only to coal. But the U.S. Department \n     of Energy predicts it could wither away almost entirely \n     during the next 20 years. By just about any standard of \n     policy or politics, atomic power is looking like a lesson in \n     energy wasted.\n       ``We over-promised and under-delivered. We created fears \n     that are not appropriate, and the industry handled it all in \n     a very defensive, closed way,'' said consultant Roger Gale, \n     president of the Washington International Energy Group. ``We \n     took a good technology, and we blew it.''\n       It's a remarkable turnaround for a technology that began \n     with such hope. When the lights flickered on at Moorpark Nov. \n     12, 1957, the country was electrified.\n       CBS television captured the moment for history. The town of \n     1,146 people went black when it was cut off from Southern \n     California Edison Co.'s conventional power grid. A few \n     seconds later, thanks to the company's little atomic reactor \n     in the Santa Susana Mountains, Moorpark and the nation awoke \n     to the age of atoms for peace.\n       National leaders were eager to redeem the research and \n     destructive power of the atom bomb. They promoted and helped \n     finance the first round of nuclear energy plants and dreamed \n     aloud of electricity so cheap it would hardly be worth \n     metering, maybe 1,000 reactors by the year 2000.\n       In the 1970s, public worries about air pollution, the Arab \n     oil embargo and the limits of fossil fuel supplies boosted \n     the inherent high-tech appeal of nuclear power.\n       The backbone of the new industry's work force came from the \n     ranks of the nuclear Navy--a gung-ho breed that later proved \n     inept at dealing with a doubting public.\n       Decades of environmental and economic bruises have \n     thoroughly rubbed off the veneer of atomic technology as the \n     wonder boy of energy.\n       Public support for nuclear energy has slipped 70 percent \n     before Three Mile Island to 43 percent in 1997, according to \n     Roper Starch Worldwide, the polling company. Though some \n     still view the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission as too cozy \n     with the industry, the agency sees itself primarily as a \n     safety enforcer, not a booster.\n       ``Nobody is going to order a new nuclear plant: too much \n     political pressure and environmental pressure, and your \n     capital is at risk for so long,'' said Chris Neil, an \n     industry consultant with Resource Data International. \n     ``Nobody wants to take that risk.''\n       Southern California Edison is deciding whether to sell its \n     two big 1,100-megawatt reactors still active at San Onofre \n     south of Los Angeles. California's 30 million people draw \n     about one-quarter of their electricity from atomic plants, \n     more than any other state. But that could change as \n     California regulators complete the transition to competitive \n     energy making.\n       ``I don't think nuclear has changed that much. I think the \n     world around it has changed,'' said Harold Ray, the utility's \n     chief of generation.\n       Kara Thorndike, 14, sprawled in shorts on a blanket at San \n     Onofre beach, busy with homework and oblivious to the atomic \n     plant just a few hundred yards away.\n       ``They have to be safe,'' she said. ``If they weren't, I \n     don't think they'd put it in a public place.''\n       Even strong critics say the industry has greatly bolstered \n     safety since the partial meltdown of a reactor core at Three \n     Mile Island.\n       The nation's worst nuclear accident released little \n     radioactivity into the environment, but it exposed dangers \n     that shook government regulators into ordering expanded \n     training of nuclear operators. Plants were redesigned to give \n     operators better information on the state of reactors. \n     Training control rooms were built identical to the real ones, \n     down to the carpeting. Emergency command centers sprang up \n     and connected to hot lines at the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n       While basically on target, the government's reaction might \n     have at times been overzealous, according to William Travers, \n     the new director of the watchdog agency, who oversaw the \n     Three Mile Island cleanup through much of the 1980s.\n       Today, he said, the agency is ``looking to reduce the \n     unnecessary burden.''\n       Regulators are stripping back some rules, saying they do \n     not really bear on safety. Using downgraded risk predictions, \n     the agency allows more limited testing of some plant \n     materials and has a fast track for re-licensing old plants to \n     help the industry compete.\n       In reaction, critics are again fretting over safety. A \n     January report by the General Accounting Office, the \n     investigative arm of Congress, said ``safety margins may be \n     compromised'' as markets turn competitive.\n       Marybeth Howard, who markets computer hardware, was sunning \n     herself at San Onofre beach and basking in thoughts of \n     abundant electricity.\n       ``I've got the lights on all the time,'' she said. ``I've \n     got the stero cranked. I've got the microwave and the \n     dishwasher on. Everything! I don't care how much the bill is! \n     I don't even really pay attention.''\n       Her nonchalance sounds quaint in a world where ``energy \n     efficient'' and ``energy conservation'' long ago entered \n     common speech.\n       In the 1970s, the national appetite for power grew about 7 \n     percent annually, but the growth rate has shrunk to about 2 \n     percent a year--even with the strong economy. That makes it \n     harder for utilities to pay off nuclear construction debts.\n       In some cases, big debt paid for little but frustration. \n     The $5.5 billion Shoreham plant in Long Island, crippled by \n     safety fears, never opened.\n       Only two operating plants so far have asked to renew their \n     40-year licenses. The licenses of 56 reactors expire in the \n     next 20 years, but industry officials acknowledge some likely \n     will close long before.\n       For one thing, it often takes more than twice as many \n     workers to run a nuclear plant as an equivalent one with \n     fossil fuel.\n       For another, aging nuclear plants increasingly need big-\n     ticket replacement of generators, turbines and even reactor \n     cores made brittle by decades of neutron bombardment.\n       San Onofre has been installing new turbines for its two \n     active units at about $30 million each. Owners of Yankee Rowe \n     in Massachusetts, the granddaddy of plants, shut down in 1992 \n     after 32 years instead of buying a new $23 million reactor \n     vessel to cradle its radioactive core.\n       Meanwhile, in states such as Pennsylvania, regulators are \n     expected to bar utilities from recovering much of their \n     nuclear construction debt through consumer rates during the \n     changeover to competitive markets.\n       Some in the industry embrace two plant sales in the works \n     as a sign of hope. An international partnership has even \n     arranged to buy the Three Mile Island reactor that did not \n     melt down and later came back on line.\n       But it is going for just $23 million. It was built for $400 \n     million.\n       ``It appears to me the way to sell a nuclear plant is to \n     pay someone to take it off your hands,'' said Kennedy Maize, \n     editor of the Electricity Daily trade newspaper.\n       The General Accounting Office says up to 26 plants appear \n     vulnerable to shutdown simply because their production costs \n     are higher than the projected price of electricity.\n       The industry is banking heavily on an expanding market for \n     U.S. nuclear technology in Japan, Taiwan and other Asian \n     countries during the next 20 years. France depends on nuclear \n     plants for 78 percent of its power.\n       Environmental distaste, though, has dimmed nuclear \n     prospects in Germany, Sweden and Italy.\n       Much of the future growth is predicted in developing \n     nations without the centralized grids of power lines to \n     accommodate big nuclear plants. Fear of spreading material \n     and know-how for nuclear weapons is also braking nuclear \n     energy to other lands.\n       ``It's one of those things that seems to be good for a \n     while, and then something else comes along,'' said nuclear \n     physicist Thomas Johansson, who oversees international energy \n     development at the United Nations.\n       Many analysts say the nation could weather a slow death of \n     nuclear power fairly well.\n       They say natural gas, which supplies about 10 percent of \n     power, can and will do much more. Dozens of gas generators \n     are under construction.\n       But renewable resources, such as solar and wind power, have \n     progressed slowly.\n       Backers of nuclear power say the nation can't attain \n     international limits on greenhouse gases without atomic \n     energy.\n       James Hewlett, an economist with the Energy Department says \n     coal might be needed to pick up some slack. But Daniel \n     Becker, an energy expert at the Sierra Club environmental \n     group, says that's like ``giving up smoking and taking up \n     crack.''\n       Maybe nuclear power was fundamentally flawed: steeped in \n     danger and, as environmentalists sometimes suggest, the most \n     expensive way ever devised to boil water. Maybe nuclear \n     plants are just too big and centralized to thrive in an era \n     of smaller-is-better.\n       But others say a potentially enduring technology was simply \n     mishandled.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Yes, I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I am very happy, I say to my friend from Nevada, that I was \nhere on the floor when he came to bring us the bad news. But the \nquestion I direct to my friend from Nevada--and there is no one who has \nworked harder on this issue than he has--is that it is my understanding \nthat there is a consensus being developed by the administration and the \nSecretary of Energy, a number of the large utilities and somewhat \nsmaller utilities around the country, and Members of Congress who have \nnever been on this issue who are thinking that maybe the best thing to \ndo is have the United States assume ownership of the nuclear waste and, \nin effect, take care of it on-site until there is a permanent \ndepository. Is it true that there is an intensive development around \nhere in that regard?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. I think \nthere is a shaft of light at the end of the tunnel, if I may use that \nmetaphor, in which a number of thoughtful Members of Congress, working \ntogether with the administration and some responsible nuclear \nutilities, have come to recognize the futility of the process that my \nfriend, our senior colleague, knows only too well, and to try to work \nout something that addresses the legitimate concerns of ratepayers in \nStates where nuclear reactors exist and yet does not devastate our \nenvironmental laws and create a situation that is costly and dangerous \nto the American public.\n  Mr. REID. The last question I direct to my friend is this: Is it also \ntrue that this is being done outside of the auspices and outside of the \ncontrol and direction of the two Senators from Nevada?\n  Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct again. These are suggestions that \nhave been generated by thoughtful Members in the Senate, and in the \nHouse, by the administration, and increasingly the dialog has indicated \nthat, again, what I would call responsible and reasonable nuclear \nutilities are engaged in a dialog. And I am hopeful, as I know my \nsenior colleague is, that we can avoid this train wreck that occurs \nannually in the Congress and work out something that deals responsibly \nand legitimately with the concerns that ratepayers have in States with \nthese reactors, but does not involve this incredibly foolish effort to \ntransport 77,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste to the State \nof Nevada unnecessarily. And, as the Senator from Nevada knows, that is \nsimply not going to happen, because the administration and the \nDepartment of Energy's Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board all agree \nthat such an approach is unnecessary and unwise.\n  I thank my colleague for his thoughtful and insightful questions, and \nI look forward to working with him in developing a responsible approach \nto resolving this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the concurrent resolution (H. Con.

The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 68) have agreed to recommend and do \n     recommend to their respective Houses this report, signed by a \n     majority of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to announce to the Senate \nthat the budget resolution, which we have called up and which is being \nconsidered, was approved just a while ago by the House, passed there by \n220-208. So the remaining real business before we leave for this \nweekend is to get our budget passed here. I will say, if it is passed \ntoday, it would be historic. If it is passed tomorrow, it will still be \nhistoric, because we will have produced our budget resolution through \nboth Houses, setting the blueprint for the year before the 15th, which \nis the statutory date. I will say to the Senate, we have only done that \nonce in the 24-plus years history of the Budget Act.\n  I think our commitment to the Senate was helped by our various \ncommittee members, and help came from our ranking member, Senator \nLautenberg, to get the job done. No use to delay it. We have been on \nthe floor, gone through it. Yesterday we took a number of votes that we \ndon't normally take, with Senators exercising their prerogatives to \nmake us vote again on some of the issues. Today there will be a vote on \nfinal passage.\n  I remind Senators who might want to speak, whether they are on this \nside of the aisle or that side of the aisle, we have a unanimous \nconsent agreement already entered into, with the full concurrence of \nthe minority, that whenever we finish this evening--and that could be \nany time--there will be 5 hours remaining tomorrow. That is because \nthere is a statutory mandate of 10 hours unless agreed to to the \ncontrary.\n\n  That means that tomorrow we will be on for 5 hours and then vote. If \nSenators do not make it to the floor in the next hour or so--obviously, \nthey can come down here, and if they want to make it easy on everybody, \nmaybe they can tell Senator Lautenberg when they want to come and tell \nme when they want to come on this side, and we will accommodate them so \nthey don't have to stay down here and wait a long time while others \nspeak.\n  Having said that, I probably will reserve most of my time to answer \nwhat others might say about this budget resolution, but I would like to \ngive a summary of where things are. I do not think that will take over \n10 or 15 minutes. Then I will yield to Senator Lautenberg. I have \nalready told my friend that I have to go across the hall for a \nRepublican policy conference, and I will try to do that as soon as my \nremarks are completed.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly outline the conference report on the \nyear 2000 budget before us this afternoon. The conference report before \nus is very similar to the Senate-passed budget resolution back on March \n25 on a rollcall vote of 55-44. A similar but different House-passed \nbudget resolution required a conference. That conference resulted in \nsome modifications to the Senate-passed resolution which I will \nhighlight later in my remarks. The basic outline for entering the \nmillennium with a fiscal policy and a tax policy and a defense policy \nand an education policy, the basic content of that with some \nmodifications is, indeed, what the Senate has before it again today.\n  First, this is a 10-year budget resolution. We have done a 5-year \nresolution and 7-year resolution, but this year is the first time we \nhave used 10 years to make our projections and upon which to build the \nbuilding blocks for the first part of this new millennium.\n  Now, we have done 5-year budgets and we have done 7-year. Why did we \ndo 10? Well, the President's budget presentation in February was very \nunique, very different than any President has ever done before. The \nPresident and his staff tried to use 15 years, and that is 15-year \nnumbers, and in some cases, 15-year estimates. This 15-year timeframe \nwas a very convenient way to shade the fact that they were and are \ncounting on raiding the Social Security surplus in the early years by \n$158 billion over the first 5 years of the President's budget. Without \nany attempt to obfuscate, clearly it uses $158 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus for programs, for expenditures, so it was, indeed, a \nraid on that Social Security surplus, and then leave it to future \nPresidents and future Congresses to reimburse that trust fund for this \nadministration's early spending plans which would have used some of \nSocial Security's surpluses.\n  That is most interesting, especially because the President will be \nclaiming that he is trying to save the Social Security surplus. I put \nout the challenge to anyone who wants to review the President's \nproposal and this proposal and see if anybody is entitled to the claim \nthat we are saving Social Security's trust fund accumulations, \nexempting it, can't use it for taxes, can't use it for appropriated \naccounts. If you would like to look at it and see which does the most, \nI think you will find that the President puts $400 billion, that is \n``billion,'' less in the trust fund during the next decade, or let me \nput it another way, on a 10-year basis, it shortchanges the trust fund \nby $400 billion.\n  That is as compared with what really ought to be in the fund. We put \nin what really ought to be in the fund, and that is all of it, all of \nthe surplus year by year, not a portion of it over 15 years.\n\n  So we think we can properly say the first responsibility of this \nbudget was to make sure that we did everything possible to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund and to make it available for those who might \nwant to reform, or in a major way change the Social Security program to \nadd to its longevity and perhaps its fairness. But only for that \npurpose can any of that trust fund be used. That is the first big item. \nThe conference agreement accomplishes that first objective, protects \nSocial Security trust fund balances. Then we go on to three other major \nitems.\n  Two, we didn't see any way that we could produce a budget to enter \nthe millennium that did not maintain the fiscal discipline of the 1997 \nbudget agreement. The distinguished occupant of the Chair, a \ndistinguished member of the Budget Committee and other committees, \nknows that it wasn't very long ago that we set a fiscal discipline \npattern which has brought us a great deal of success. We said we are \nonly going to spend so much over the next 5 years. It wasn't over a \nprolonged period, just 5 years. That, plus some other good fortunes \nthat are attributable to economic growth and prosperity, has brought us \nthe best fiscal policy of any industrialized Nation in the world--\nsustained growth, manifold numbers of jobs, low inflation, and low \ninterest rates.\n  We thought it was best that we stay on that path. So the second point \nis that the fiscal discipline is retained from the 1997 agreement. Why \nshouldn't it? There are those who say it is too tough. There are those \nwho say we can't live by it.\n  There are those who say the President is going to force us to break \nthis budget. Well, we aren't going to let the President do that. If \nthat is what he thinks we ought to do, we will have to hear from him. \nWe are going to try hard to live within those prescribed limits, which \nbrought such credibility to the fiscal policy ideas of this Government \nthat I believe we ought to stick with them for awhile.\n  Now, the third is another idea that somehow or another has been \nchallenged here in the Congress, and that is that we want to return to \nthe American taxpayer their overpayments to the Federal Government. \nNow, what we on our side of the aisle--and we hope some Democrats join \nus before the year is over--would like to say is that when you have an \neconomy like this one,\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nwith surpluses that we have, you should not just be thinking about \nspending money; you ought to be thinking about the taxpayer, too. In \nfact, maybe you ought to say let's look at government and let's look at \nthe taxpayers and let's make sure we have as little government as \npossible, so that we consider the taxpayers to the maximum extent and \nhave them paying the lowest taxes possible within a good, sound policy.\n  So while some will say, ``I would like a tax cut but not this one,'' \nor, ``I would like a tax cut, but not now; I would like it later, but I \nwould like a little bit now and then wait for 5 or 6 years,'' we say \nthe policy is a clear one. The United States succeeds when we have low \ntaxes and we exceed our competitor countries in the world predominantly \non the premise that our businesses and our individuals pay less taxes \nthan those competing with us. That is a truism with regard to all of \nthe European countries that try to compete. They are heavily taxed; we \nare taxed at a low level. They have huge burdens on business to take \ncare of social welfare programs; we have far less.\n\n  As a result, business is flourishing in America and we are adding, if \nnot hundreds of thousands, then in a few of the past 6 years, even a \nfew million new jobs. And it is interesting to note, Mr. President, as \nwe consider this budget, if a poll were taken of American business, in \nparticular the medium-sized businesses that are flourishing in our \ncountry, and we were to ask them, ``Can't you grow a little more?'' \nthey would all answer, ``Yes.'' And then if we said, ``Why aren't \nyou?'' the No. 1 answer would be, ``We can't find enough skilled \nworkers to add to our workforce to grow as we could.''\n  Now, that is a very interesting thing for America, and it does mean \nthat there is one long-term problem we ought to be concerned about, \nwhich is the validity of our education system to give basic-skill \neducation and basic-skill development to more and more of the young \npeople and those who would like to be retrained in America.\n  I guess, as an aside, if that doesn't happen, then I know we should \nnot be talking about how we will be able to meet the needs of our \nbusinesses. But I surmise that if we don't create more educational \nskill opportunities for more and more of our people within a decade, we \nwill be looking at an American policy that is going to let more people \ncome in from outside our country to take our jobs.\n  I hope everybody listening to these remarks knows in what sequence I \nhave said it. Clearly, I would like very much to get to the next point \nin our budget, because within these fiscal restraints we have taken a \nlook at where the priorities for the expenditure of money, even in this \ncrimped manner, the budget following this fiscal restraint, should be.\n  I believe Americans would agree with us that we ought to increase \nspending on education. In fact, if you looked at the President's \nbudget, you would probably say that is not enough; it is sort of a \nnominal increase. We have said that, and we have increased our \nrecommendations for public education assistance significantly over the \nPresident's. In fact, if the recommendation of the Budget Committee \nwere accepted, we would increase, over the next 5 years, spending on \neducation by $28 billion.\n  Everybody should know, we don't pay for a lot of public education. \nLocal expenditures are, by far, most of it. Perhaps our country pays 7 \npercent of the bill; 93 percent is paid by local school districts, \nStates, et cetera. We asked that we put more in, but we expressed a big \nconcern--that in doing that we not provide targeted U.S. Government \nprograms mandating the school districts to do things our way, but \nrather that we have accountability and flexibility built into the \neducation programs that we add money for. So our budget does that.\n  Next, we created a non-Social Security surplus of about $92 billion \nfor unexpected contingencies, that is, we didn't spend it for tax cuts \nor on anything else. It starts in the fifth year. It is $92 billion for \nunexpected contingencies. That could be used for transition costs for \nimplementing fundamental reform in Medicare. Or if we did not use it \nfor any of those things, that is, contingencies and/or Medicare reform, \nthen they would further reduce the national debt.\n  Understanding that I started my remarks by saying we set aside $400 \nbillion more than the President in the first decade of the Social \nSecurity trust fund and lock it in a box that we are going to vote on \nlater, all of that is used to reduce the public debt until we use it \nfor Social Security. It dramatically reduces the public debt. That is \none of the best things we can do, and we did $400 billion more of debt \nreduction during the first decade than the President.\n\n  We are proud of that and we think it is the best use of the surplus, \nand the second best use is to return it to the taxpayers, so we return \nto them a substantial amount in tax reform, tax cuts, which is $778 \nbillion. So there will be no confusion, add up all of those numbers I \nspeak of and you keep the Social Security trust fund intact, you leave \n$102 billion for expected contingencies, and you cut the taxes of the \nAmerican people by $752 billion over a decade.\n  I don't want anybody to be surprised, but the Republican tax package \nwill not be big at the inception; it will be small. But in one bill, we \nwill pass tax changes that will wedge out and grow each year, and in \nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh years, you will be providing \nsignificant tax relief to the American taxpayer. Frankly, I believe \nthat is just about perfect.\n  Some are fearful of it because we provide it over 10 years. But I \nthink the American economy is experiencing a tremendous boon right now. \nI think these tax cuts are going to trigger in --I don't mean ``trigger \nin'' in the sense that anything will have to happen. I will use another \nword. It will come into play at just about the time when we need tax \ncuts for the American people and American business, so we can continue \nthe prosperity, growth, and opportunity that is so prevalent today.\n  In summary, those are the things we tried to do, and those are the \nthings that show up in this budget resolution. After conferring, almost \nall of those principles that started here in the Senate are kept. I am \npleased to indicate that some of the other things the Senate had in its \nbudget resolution are kept in this resolution. So let me tell you a \ncouple of those.\n  First, the conference adopted the Abraham-Ashcroft-Domenici sense-of-\nthe-Senate framework for protecting Social Security surpluses through a \nmechanism for retiring debt held by the public and made it a sense of \nthe entire Congress. That means that both the House and the Senate will \nuse every effort possible to try to pass what we will nickname here \ntoday ``lockbox'' legislation, which would be statutory preservation of \nthat fund, requiring a majority vote to dip into it. We will have more \nto say about that. It will then be perfected and introduced soon, after \nconsultation with more experts. We think we will have one that is \nflexible enough, yet rigid enough, to make sure that we don't spend \nthat money.\n  In addition, yesterday afternoon, for the second time, the Senate \nvoted on a child care proposal that had passed the Senate with a 57-40 \nvote, including 15 or 16 Republicans. Yesterday, in revisiting it, more \nSenators expressed their will for that.\n  While in conference, I was not able to get the House to give on it in \nits entirety. We got $6 billion. Half goes for the block grant that \nSenator Dodd and Senator Jeffords discussed, and half is indicated in \nthe tax package and should be used for tax relief that is child care \noriented for as many families in America as possible.\n  Now, I believe that the leadership of both the Senate and the House \nhave made a commitment in this conference report to go beyond the \nresolution before the Senate today to try to pass legislation to make \nsure for the first time in history we truly have made it almost \nimpossible in the future to spend the Social Security trust fund for \nthe ordinary expenditures of our budget as a ``basket'' from which we \nborrow for overextending our receipts.\n  This resolution maintains the fiscal discipline required by law. \nStatutory caps cannot be changed by a budget resolution, and they are \nnow written into the law. It does not assume any firewalls between \ndefense and nondefense discretionary spending. We are\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nnot trying to protect defense from domestic spending in this era of \ngreat demands on both. We will just let the good judgment of the \nCongress, in its collaborative efforts, do its will with reference to \nthe defense spending and the domestic spending.\n  However, in our recommendations, we do substantially increase defense \nbeyond that which the President requested. We do that forthrightly and \nopenly. We believed, even before the Kosovo situation, that the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense was being underfunded. We finally asked the Joint \nChiefs what they really needed. They expressed genuine concern, so we \nadded most of their requests to the defense assumptions.\n  This resolution makes no decision on the expansion or extension of \nthe caps beyond 2002. It assumes, on the other hand, that discretionary \nspending will grow over the decade, increasing at a rate of about half \nthe rate of inflation and expanding to a total of $2.9 trillion over \nthe next 5 years and $5.9 trillion over the next decade.\n  Within the aggregate numbers on the face of the resolution, and again \nas required by law, the level of appropriation is distributed by budget \nfunction for illustrative purposes, but everyone should know the final \ndecision will be a matter for the Appropriations Committee and the \nsubcommittees. Everybody is beginning to understand that the budget \nresolution was not intended to be a determiner of how much money each \nprogram gets, but rather the total that they must not exceed.\n  The conference report assumed the priorities I mentioned. I will add \none clarification on elementary and secondary education. In the first \nyear, we increased it $3.3 billion in our allocation assumption and $28 \nbillion over 5 years. That would be over and above the estimated $100 \nbillion that would be expended for these programs during the same time \nperiod.\n  We assume full funding of transportation programs adopted last year. \nWe assume full funding of the violent crime trust fund next year. We \nalso have assumed $1.7 billion in additional veterans' health care \nbenefits over the President's request for this year.\n  Within the spending restraints, it is assumed that the historic pay \nequity between civilian and military pay will be maintained. It assumes \nthat the Congress funds the President's request for the upcoming \ncensus, and it assumes we double the request for the National \nInstitutes of Health--double his increase.\n  I think that clearly puts us on the side that most Americans desire. \nWe increase defense, we increase education, we increase those functions \nof our Government that take care of crime and criminal justice in our \ncountry. In addition, we take care of our veterans. The President did \nnot even increase, to any extent, the veterans' medical appropriations. \nWe added about $1.7 billion.\n  Adding those up, and adding a return of tax dollars to the American \npeople with the kind of protection for Social Security and Medicare \nthat we have provided, I believe we have a very good format to begin \nthe millennium, the year 2000 budget.\n  To maintain the fiscal discipline of the caps and reorder spending \ntoward these and other national needs, it is clear that the Congress \nwill need to set priorities. If not, then some of the proposals I have \noutlined will likely not be possible.\n  What are some of those lesser priorities on the Federal taxpayers' \ndollars?\n  First, last year we appropriated over $106 billion for programs whose \nauthorizations did not exist. A good place to start looking for lower \npriority programs in the Federal Government might be in those areas \nwhere no authorization exists.\n  In addition to the unauthorized programs, as I have stated \npreviously, it would be helpful if the Congress reviewed the GAO's \nrecent high-risk series which lists 26 areas this year--nearly 40 \npercent which have been designated high risk for 10 years--areas that \nGAO has found to be vulnerable to waste, fraud, and error.\n  Second, it is clear that some programs will not grow, will remain at \ntheir 1999 level, and some will have to be reduced below a freeze as \nthe President's budget suggested. I would suggest that committees and \nthe administration take to heart the Government performance and results \nact that specifically identifies low performing and inefficient \nprograms.\n  Some programs, such as various transportation projects funded last \nyear outside TEA-21, were one time and we should not assume continued \nfunding of such programs next year.\n  The conference assumes that Ginnie Mae will become a private \noperation and its auction creates nearly $2.8 billion in offsets next \nyear.\n  And yes, the conference resolution assumes, some of the \nadministration's proposed offsets, fees, are assumed for various \nagencies in the Federal Government--FSIS and the President's proposed \n$200 million broadcasters lease fee.\n  In the area of mandatory savings. The resolution does not assume any \nof the President's nearly $20 billion reductions in Medicare over the \nnext 5 years. Medicare spending will indeed increase from $195 billion \nthis year by over $200 billion to a total of $395 billion in 2009, an \nannual increase of 7.3 percent.\n\n  And the resolution assumes $6.0 billion in additional resources will \nbe allocated to the Agriculture Committee to address the issue of \ndepressed incomes in that sector.\n  The Senate-passed resolution assumed that expiring savings provisions \nin 2002, that were enacted in the 1997 balanced budget agreement, would \nbe extended. This applied to all such provisions except expiring \nMedicare savings provisions. Between 2003 and 2009 these provisions \nwould save $20 billion.\n  In conference the Senate receded to the House position that did not \nassume any of these savings provisions. In part this accounts for the \nfact that the non-Social Security surplus over the next decade has \ndeclined to $92 billion.\n  The Senate-passed resolution included the Dodd-Jeffords amendment to \nadd $12 billion to child care spending over the next decade. The \nspending was offset with a reduction in the reconciled tax cut. The \nHouse had no such assumption.\n  The Senate voted yesterday to instruct the conference to adopt this \nprovision. The conference assumes half of these resources for families \nwith children to cover child care expenditures--$6 billion. These \nexpenditures reduced the non-Social Security surplus and did not reduce \nthe reconciled tax reduction.\n  For revenues the conference resolution assumes that tax reductions \nwill be phased in and over the next 5 years will return overpayments to \nthe American public of nearly $142 billion and $778 billion over the \nnext 10 years. For 2000, paid for tax cuts of up to $15 billion are \npossible.\n  How these tax reductions are carried out will, of course, be \ndetermined by the Finance Committee and ultimately the Congress and the \nPresident.\n  However, I believe elimination or reduction in the marriage penalty \ncould easily be accommodated within these levels as well as extension \nof expiring R tax credits, self-employed health insurance deductions, \ncertain education credits, and or general reductions in tax rates \nphased in over time.\n  Finally, the resolution, being cautious, over a 10-year period, \nprojects a non-budget surplus of over $92 billion. This money could be \nneeded for unexpected emergencies or contingencies, it also could \nsupport the cost of funding transition costs for Medicare reform, or if \nnothing else it will continue to further retire debt held by the \npublic.\n  Two procedural issues need to be noted--a rule change as it relates \nto defining emergencies and a clarification that when there is an on-\nbudget surplus, those amounts are not subject to pay-go rules.\n  The Senate-committee-reported resolution included a provision to make \nemergency spending items subject to a supermajority point of order. \nThis provision was adopted by the conference, while exempting Defense \nspending.\n  Let me close by saying that under this resolution, debt held by the \npublic will decline by nearly $463 billion more than under the \nPresident's budget.\n  This is true even if one treats the President's Government equity \npurchases as debt reduction.\n  Why do we reduce debt more than the President?\n  First, the President spends $158 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus over the next 5 years. In contrast, the conference resolution \nsaves the entire Social Security surplus.\n  And second, let me remind the Senate of one other thing about the \nPresident's spending proposal which may\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\nsurprise many--his spending costs more than the resolution's assumed \ntax reductions. This is true over both the 5-year and 10-year period.\n  The President's budget spends 35 percent of the Social Security \nsurplus over the next 5 years on programs unrelated to Social Security \nor Medicare.\n  That is why we can save the entire Social Security surplus and why he \ncan not.\n  Let me summarize. The conference report does four things: It protects \n100 percent Social Security surpluses; it maintains the fiscal \ndiscipline this Senate overwhelmingly supported in 1997 and was most \nrecently reaffirmed by the minority leader; it returns to the American \npublic their tax overpayments; and finally, it prudently and cautiously \nprojects on-budget surpluses for further debt reduction or for \nsupporting unexpected emergencies, and possible transition costs for \ntrue Medicare reform like the one recently voted on by 11 of the 17 \nmembers of the National Commission on the Future of Medicare.\n  It is a good resolution to close out the Budget Act's 25-year silver \nanniversary this year.\n  It is a good fiscal blueprint for the next century.\n  Commenting for a minute about the tax proposals in this bill, in the \nnext 5 years Congress will be permitted under this budget resolution to \nreduce taxes on the American people by $142 billion, and in the second \n5 years the total will be $778 billion.\n  The first and second year cannot be very big, depending on what \nloopholes are closed by the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means \nCommittee. We can have a goodly tax in the first 2 years, moving up in \na ``wedged'' manner to some very substantial return of taxes to the \nAmerican people over this next decade.\n  There may be remarks on the floor about what these tax cuts will look \nlike. Certain Republican Senators, including some of our leadership, \nmay say what they prefer. That permits the Democratic leadership and \nDemocratic Senators to get up and say they don't think we ought to give \ntax cuts to the rich, that we ought to spend it elsewhere rather than \ngiving it to the rich people of our country.\n  This budget resolution gives the Congress of the United States and \nits committees full latitude to have a tax cut bill of whatever type \nthe Congress and its committees ultimately approve and, hopefully, that \nthe President will sign. I am quite sure when that package is finally \nput together the good judgment of the tax-writing committees, with \nCongress exerting its concerns, it will be a balanced package, focused \non average Americans and on continuing the economic prosperity of our \ncountry.\n  If we do that, then I believe there may be disagreement between \nRepublicans and Democrats, but I do believe it will not be the package \nthat is constantly suggested by Democrats--that we are going to take \ncare of only the high-bracketed people, instead of spending it on \nprograms that are good.\n  I can do no better than that. I don't know that I will answer every \ntime we are accused of having a tax cut that takes care of only the \nwealthy in our country. The facts are as I have indicated. Whether or \nnot Senators have taken to the floor or given stump speeches or \notherwise saying what they would prefer, we probably ought to give some \nserious consideration to reducing the brackets, with taxation more \nproportionally on every group of people. I am sure the package will be \nfair in building American prosperity by cutting taxes in the right \nplaces for economic growth.\n  I make one last comment about the return of tax dollars to the \nAmerican people. I have been heard to say that as a Budget Committee \nmember and chairman somehow or another when we finally get to that \nplace where we can have surpluses for as far as the eye can see--\naccording to those who estimate for us--I have been heard to say that \nmaybe it is harder to manage surpluses than it is deficits. Yesterday \nmy good friend, Senator Lautenberg, indicated that probably that is how \nit should be, because it is human nature that when you have real \nassets, you fight over them; with deficits you do the best you can.\n  I have found it more difficult to give taxpayers tax relief when we \nhave had a surplus than I found as a budget chairman to give tax relief \nwhen we had deficits. That is rather incredible.\n  But I think the history will indicate that we have had many tax cuts, \ngiving back money to the taxpayers, when we had deficits. Now we have a \ncriticism of Republicans who want to give back tax money to those who \nhave overpaid, because we have more money than we need; that we should \nnot be doing it now. If you cannot do it when you have a surplus, when \ncan you? If you cannot do it with a surplus, when should you?\n  It seems to me the answer is we probably ought to have a major tax \nreduction bill. I would think before the year is out the President of \nthe United States will get into the act. He is probably still looking \nback to his first campaign, before he was elected, when he promised a \nmiddle-income tax cut. I know, in reading about the politics of the \nWhite House during the intervening years, that some of his consultants \nbrought up that issue regularly during his campaign and first year in \noffice--what about the tax cuts? Maybe they were not right in his \nscheme of things then, but I submit, with this kind of surplus, they \nare right now.\n  We look forward, after this budget resolution is passed--and \nhopefully that will be tomorrow--to working within the Congress--and \nhopefully Congress with the Executive--to take care of our public needs \nand take care of our taxpayers' needs. But we will always be vigilant \nthat we not put one over the other, since it is the taxpayers who make \nour Government capable of doing what it does.\n  With that, I yield the floor and repeat to Senators, if you do not \nget to speak this evening, there are 5 hours tomorrow. We will be glad \nto start taking names for tomorrow. It will be better than tonight. We \ncan get through early tomorrow and early tonight and still have a lot \nof debate time if most of you will sign up for tomorrow, which means we \ncould get out of here rather early this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to respond to the analysis just \ngiven us by our good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici. One thing about Senator Domenici, \nhe is always direct. He always calls it like he sees it. And therein \nlie, perhaps, some differences.\n  The expression, ``beauty is in the eyes of the beholder,'' is one \nthat fits well, I think, because I see it quite differently than \nSenator Domenici. As we begin consideration of the conference report, \nfor the benefit of those who do not know how we work here, the \nconference report is that report on the budget that has been agreed to \nby the House of Representatives, their Budget Committee people, and the \nSenate Budget Committee people. So I have to say at the outset that it \nis quite obvious that it is the majority's report we are looking at. \nEven though there are 45 Democrat Senators here, the fact is, with rare \nexception, all of the Democrats voted in opposition to the initial \nBudget Committee report and my view here is that we are probably going \nto see at least something as strong in opposition to the report that \nhas now been agreed upon by the House representatives on the budget and \nthe Senate representatives.\n  Look at this. Here we have a budget resolution, one that says this is \nthe way we ought to be spending our money. Mr. President, I remind \nthose who are in earshot, this is a toothless tiger. It does have the \nforce of a Senate-House conference committee agreeing that is what we \nought to be spending, but it is without law to support it, and it is \nnow an instruction to the various committees that have the jurisdiction \nto set up the spending as recommended by the Budget Committee.\n  But what a time this is. The economy has never been stronger. I have \nbeen around a long time--thank goodness, for my kids and me--but we \nhave never seen an economy like this. Unemployment is low, inflation is \nalmost unheard of, the stock market is booming, people are able to \ninvest in housing and education and plan their future and vacations. \nOur fiscal house is in order. We are now running surpluses, having come \na long way from 1992 when President Clinton took over, when we were\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nrunning annual deficits in the high $200 billion. Now we are running \nsurpluses. So we have done something good. I commend my colleague, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, for the hard work that he did--that \nwe did bilaterally, with the President of the United States--to get a \nbalanced budget in place. That, I think, has had a large effect on how \nit is we got to this current period of prosperity. But at the same time \nwe face serious long-term challenges. Most importantly, the baby \nboomers' retirement is going to put tremendous pressure on Social \nSecurity and on Medicare in the years ahead.\n  The key question facing Congress is whether we will meet those \nchallenges and prepare for the future at this time or whether we are \ngoing to yield to short-term temptation at the expense of the longevity \nof these programs. Democrats are committed to focusing on the future. \nOur top priority is to save Medicare and Social Security for the long \nterm by reducing our debt, keeping our debt in control, and increasing \nnational savings.\n  We also want to provide targeted tax relief for those who need it \nmost and that is the middle-class families, those who work hard for a \nliving, those who are dependent totally on wages and salary for their \nliving. We want to invest in education and other priorities that will \nenhance the lives of those who are not yet university age but who are \nlooking forward to having a job and career that gives them a decent \nlifestyle.\n\n  The Republicans, our friends on the other side of the aisle, have a \ndifferent view. Their plan as embodied in this conference report \nfocuses on huge tax breaks, largely for the wealthy. I want to give an \nexample of what it is I am talking about because so often our \nRepublican friends get irritated when we say ``focused on the \nwealthy.'' But if you are in the top 1 percent of the income earners--\nthat is starting at $300,000 but averaging $850,000 a year--if you are \none of the lucky ones, one of the skilled ones, or one of those who \ninherited wealth, and your income is $800,000 a year, you get a $20,000 \ntax break in this budget that is proposed before us.\n  On the other hand, if you work hard and you go to work every day and \nyou worry about how to educate your kids and you worry about how to pay \nyour mortgage and you earn $38,000 a year, you get $100--oh, $99, I am \nsorry; it is not even $100--a $99 tax break. Somehow or other that \ndoesn't seem right to me: $800,000 on the one hand gets a $20,000 tax \nbreak and on the other hand, if you make $38,000, slightly over $700 a \nweek to support your family, you get $99 and you can spend it in any \nway you want, the $99; buy a yacht, buy a vacation--whatever you want \nto do with the $99. So it does not seem right to me.\n  These tax breaks on top of the unfair balance between those who are \nthe wealthy and those who work hard for a living would cost the \ntaxpayer enormous sums in the future. It would absorb funding that is \nneeded to save Medicare. And that, when you get right down to it, is \nreally the main issue this conference report presents to the Senate.\n  Question: Should we provide huge tax cuts, many of which will benefit \nthe wealthy? Or should we use that money to save Medicare?\n  Of course, there is a lot more to the conference report before us, so \nI will take a little time now to explain why I strongly oppose and \nintend to vote against the acceptance of this conference report. There \nare four primary reasons.\n  First, it does not do anything to increase Medicare's life. In other \nwords, in 2015 Medicare is ready for bankruptcy, if things go as they \nare.\n  I have suggested that we ought not use funds needed for Medicare for \ntax cuts that are primarily for the wealthy.\n  Secondly, it threatens Social Security because it fails to extend \nSocial Security's life, but it allows the use of surpluses generated by \nthose who currently pay about 13 percent of wages; that is the worker \nand the company, for purposes other than Social Security.\n  Thirdly, it is fiscally dangerous. I used to run a big corporation, \nand I will tell you that this is not the way to plan the long-term \nfuture. It proposes tax cuts that do not cost much in the beginning, as \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee said, but he said it \nis going to cost over $700 billion. In 10 years, over $750 billion will \nbe used to provide that tax break.\n  Fourthly, it proposes extreme and unrealistic cuts in essential \nprograms that are necessary for the well-being of all our citizens. It \nwould devastate public services on which so many depend. Moreover, \nCongress will be unable to pass the bills that provide the funding that \nthese programs need, and it could lead eventually to a repeat of a \nterrible experience that we had a few years ago--a Government shutdown. \nThese are the kinds of programs that would be affected.\n  Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is now expected to become \nbankrupt in 2015. It is critical that we address this problem and do it \nnow. There is no doubt that we have to modernize and reform Medicare to \nmake it function more efficiently, but whatever reform process we pass, \nwe still need more resources--more money, to put it bluntly. In an \nattempt to find an overall solution, President Clinton proposed \nallocating 15 percent of projected budget surpluses, that is, the \nunified budget, for surpluses for Medicare. This would extend the life \nof the Medicare trust fund for another 12 years. Our Republican \ncolleagues deride this proposal. They say it amounts to adding \nmeaningless IOUs to Medicare, but they are wrong.\n  First, the President's proposal would reduce the debt that the public \nholds in bonds and investment in Government securities, which would \nsignificantly reduce interest costs in the future, which would help us \nactually pay for Medicare with the real dollars saved.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution we have in front of \nus totally rejects the President's proposal to extend Medicare \nsolvency. Instead of directly using these surpluses for Medicare, it \nuses almost all of that money for tax cuts. The document we have in \nfront of us--that was prepared exclusively by Republicans, I remind \nyou--does not specify how we are going to provide those tax cuts. They \nwill be drafted later in the Finance Committee. However, based on the \ncomments of the chairman of the Finance Committee, it is fair to assume \nthat most of the total benefits will flow to the wealthiest Americans. \nMr. President, these GOP tax breaks would come at the direct expense of \nMedicare. It is wrong.\n  Under the Republican plan, not one penny of projected surpluses is \nguaranteed for Medicare--not one cent. The resolution claims to reserve \nabout $90 billion for unspecified uses over 10 years and suggests that \nmaybe we can take some of that $90 billion for Medicare. However, that \nis far less than the $350 billion the President wants to put into \nMedicare over a 10-year period. And none of this $90 billion is \nactually reserved for Medicare.\n  In any case, there is nothing left for the Medicare program after \nthese funds are used up for unexpected emergencies. For example, \nemergency spending now averages $9 billion a year. That is emergency \nspending for natural disasters or some other disaster--fire, whatever \nyou have--in a community that is needed each and every year. It is \nreasonable to assume that future emergencies will consume all of this \nso-called reserve.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans' refusal to provide additional \nresources for Medicare would have a direct impact on the millions of \nAmericans who will depend on Medicare for their health needs in the \nfuture. The resolution almost certainly would mean higher health care \ncosts, higher copayments--that means for the beneficiary. If you have \nan incident or a matter that can be reimbursed by Medicare, you will \nhave a higher copayment, you will have higher deductibles, lower \nquality health care services, and probably fewer hospitals, all because \nthe Republicans insist on providing these huge tax breaks.\n  Beyond Medicare, the second major problem with the Republican \nresolution is that it poses a direct threat to Social Security.\n  Just yesterday, I offered a motion to instruct the conferees, those \nfrom the House and those from the Senate--but particularly it applied \nto the Senate because that is where we give our directions--that they \nensure that all Social Security surplus is used only to extend the life \nof Social Security. It was\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\nnot a close vote. The motion was adopted by a 98-0 vote. Ninety-eight \nSenators said, yes, this is the right kind of attitude we want to see. \nNinety-eight out of 100 Senators said, yes, we want to use all of our \nSocial Security surpluses to extend the life of Social Security.\n  But within just a few hours of that vote--the vote took place here, \nthen it went to conference over there in the House, and the conferees, \nthe group that was sitting around the table, our Republican friends, \napproved a provision that would allow Social Security surpluses to be \nused for other purposes. I find it astounding and, frankly, it is \noutrageous that 98 Senators stood up and voted aye, yes, we want all \nSocial Security surpluses to be spent on Social Security, and it went \nin the wastebasket within a few hours. Quite incredible.\n  The conference report establishes, as we heard, a lockbox that \nsupposedly protects Social Security surpluses. But it does not do that. \nIt establishes a largely meaningless 50-vote point of order against \nfuture budget resolutions but has a huge loophole for any legislation \nthat ``enhances retirement security.''\n  We do not know what the definition of ``retirement security'' is. \nWhat does it mean to enhance retirement security? It does not say \n``Social Security.'' This is a word game we play here. We say one \nthing, but it has a different meaning when we say it over here. Just a \nchange of a word or two: ``Retirement security'' versus ``Social \nSecurity.'' Presumably this retirement security plan could mean a wide \nrange of purposes.\n  Mr. President, it is unacceptable, it is outrageous, it deserves to \nbe condemned in the strongest possible terms. Social Security surpluses \nshould not be used for ``retirement security'' or anything that we do \nnot understand clearly. Sure, it should not be used for tax cuts. They \nshould not be used for risky new schemes and programs. They should be \nused to pay Social Security benefits, period.\n  The third problem with the conference report is that it is fiscally \nirresponsible. The resolution calls only for small tax cuts in the \nfirst year or two. We heard the chairman of the Budget Committee say \nso. But the cost of these tax cuts explode in the future.\n\n  Over the first 5 years, the total tax cuts that we would have would \ncost $142 billion, but over the second 5 years that cost increases to \n$636 billion, about 4\\1/2\\ times as high as the first 5 years. And that \nis another way of getting at things. It is kind of a little bit sleight \nof hand, I would say. That is to say, ``Oh, we can give these tax \nbreaks, give these tax cuts, and it's not going to cost anything.'' No, \nnot while most of us are still Members of this Senate. But 10 years \nhence, when we add up the scorecard, we will have spent almost three-\nquarters of a trillion dollars for tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, the final problem with the Republican plan is that it \nforces extreme cuts in programs for Americans here at home. Tax cuts, \non one hand, cost something for the ordinary Americans on the other \nhand.\n  I want to point out something. We Democrats are not opposed to tax \ncuts that are targeted, that means something for middle-class people, \nthat means something for hard-working people who have to watch if not \ntheir pennies, at least their nickels. That is the way we want to do \nour tax cuts. We want to encourage savings, we want to encourage child \ncare, we want it so people can have child care in case they do want to \nwork. We want to make sure there are funds there for long-term health \ncare for an elderly person. That is the kind of tax cut that we seek, \nnot this broad, across-the-board tax cut that will give these $800,000 \nwage-earners a $20,000 tax cut. So we will be losing, as a result of \nthat--programs that are here called nondefense discretionary programs--\nabout 7\\1/2\\ percent in the first year. But the real cut in most \nprograms would be much deeper.\n  Keep in mind, the Republican leadership has said they will increase \nor maintain funding for a handful of favored programs like new \ncourthouses, the transportation bill for the next half dozen years--we \ncall it TEA-21--the census, the National Institutes of Health, and some \ncrime and education programs. That leaves other unprotected programs \nfacing cuts of about 11 percent.\n  I want to point out what we are talking about. This is not just an \namorphous discussion about arithmetic. When we say 11 percent, we are \ntalking about everything from environmental protection to the National \nParks and the FAA. The FAA is responsible for the maintenance of our \naviation fleet and working hard to keep up with the new technologies \nand the needs as aviation expands its marketplace.\n  The Coast Guard. My gosh, everyone knows the Coast Guard is one of \nthe most important branches of service that we have in this country. \nThey do everything. They do drug interdiction. They maintain waterways. \nThey are out there picking up illegal immigrants who are trying to \nfloat their way to the American coast. They are on pollution patrol. \nThey watch it all. You want to cut that down? I do not think so. Eleven \npercent--that would be devastating.\n  I heard our Senators from States that border Central America about \nthe inadequacy of the number of Border Patrol members that they have. \nThis would take a big slice out of that so that we could no longer do \neven the protection of our borders as efficiently as we do now.\n  We would be losing lots of FBI agents, NASA would be hurt, our space \nprogram, job training, head Start, the program that gives kids who come \nfrom a disadvantaged background a little bit of a head start.\n\n  So what would it mean in real terms? Here are a few examples based on \nthe administration's estimates: 2,700 FBI agents would be lost; 1,350 \nBorder Patrol agents; 780 drug enforcement agents would be lost; 90,000 \nfewer dislocated workers would receive training for new jobs, job \nsearch assistance, and support services; 34,000 low-income children \nwould lose child care assistance--what a devastating thing that would \nbe to lots of families--over 1.2 million low-income women, infants and \nchildren--we call it the WIC Program--would lose nutrition assistance \neach month.\n  How can we face our conscience?\n  FAA operations would be cut by almost $700 million. It would lead to \ntravel delays, weakened security, lack of critical modernization \ntechnologies. The Superfund Program that cleans up these toxic waste \nsites left by our industrial past--unusable ground--that raise \npotential dangers to those who live nearby; we would lose 21 \nopportunities to clean up Superfund toxic waste sites, needlessly \njeopardizing public health.\n  Up to 100,000 children would lose the opportunity to benefit from \nHead Start; 73,000 training and summer job opportunities for young \npeople would be lost.\n  Mr. President, these types of cuts clearly are unacceptable. They are \nnot what the American people want.\n  Unfortunately, under this resolution the problem gets dramatically \nworse in later years. By 2004, these nondefense cuts--again, defense, \non one hand, nondefense on the other. Defense is a very favored account \nin this place, and I support a strong defense. And, boy, if we ever \ndoubted our need to fund it, we see now that we have to do it. But we \ndo not have to give them all of the new resources that we have.\n  By 2004, the nondefense program cuts grow to 27 percent. There isn't \na Senator here, who, when faced with reality, is going to vote for \nthose kinds of cuts. But they put their heads in the sand. They are not \nlooking at what the longer consequences of this budget resolution are \ngoing to be. And it does not even include any effects of inflation.\n  Mr. President, you really have to wonder whether our Republican \nfriends are serious about cutting domestic programs by 27 percent. It \nis hard to believe, especially when they are not giving us any details \nabout where those cuts would come from. Some Republicans have argued \nthat these cuts are required because of the discretionary spending caps \nwhich remain in effect through 2002. But that is not true. ``Spending \ncaps,'' again, is part of the vernacular here. Those are the levels of \nspending that we agreed we would adhere to until 2002. But we are now \nin surplus. We are out of debt because of the good fiscal policies that \nwe have had here. That occurred because Democrats and Republicans and \nthe President worked together.\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\n  Much of the problem for domestic programs is created because the \nconference report increases military spending significantly over last \nyear's level. Since all discretionary spending is now under one cap, \nthat extra money must come directly from the other programs that we \ntalked about.\n  Cutting domestic programs by 27 percent in 2004 is not realistic. It \nis an extreme decision. When it comes time for cutting specific \nprograms, Congress sure will not likely follow through.\n  In other words, this budget resolution is a roadmap to gridlock. If \nwe can't pass the appropriations bills, the funding bills, we face the \nprospect of a horrible nightmare that we once experienced here, and \nthat is a Government shutdown.\n  Why, then, are we considering a budget resolution that even some \nRepublicans admit can't be enacted into law? The answer is simple. \nRepublicans are desperate to claim that they are for tax cuts. And they \nsee that as the ``Holy Grail.'' That is what they say Americans want. I \ntell you, I see it differently. I see an America where someone comes \nfrom a home that is not wealthy, sometimes widowed. I had the \nexperience personally. My mother was widowed at age 36. My father died \nwhen he was 43. There was not a chance at all that I was going to be \nable to get an education or progress in life. But, fortunately, I \nserved in the military--World War II--and I was able to get my \neducation under the GI bill. It is an incredible thing that we offer \nwhen we propose to young people that they have a chance to get a job \nand to progress and to live a life that is better than their parents in \nmost cases. Here we are saying, well, tax cuts will take care of it \nall. No. Tax cuts won't take care of it all. Some tax cuts will help, \nbut some tax cuts are just giveaways to wealthy people. The result is \nthat we can create stresses in our society that make living \nuncomfortable.\n\n  Right now we see violent crime going down in the most unlikely \nplaces. Why? Because we have more police on the streets? Yes. Because \nwe put more criminals in jail? Yes. Because the judges are tougher? \nYes. But it is also because people see a way to make a living \nlegitimately and they do not turn to criminality. It is because there \nare education programs and there are job opportunities that have been \ncreated. That is the difference.\n  In one case you have a stable society. Those of us--and I include \nmyself, having had a successful business career--who can afford to pay \nfor the privilege of living in this country ought to step up and pay \nfor it and not be looking for tax cuts but be looking for harmony and \nstability in our society. That is what it is all about.\n  Here we have the tax cut proposal, the Republican tax cut proposal. \nThey think it is politically going to keep up their majorities here. It \nis not going to happen, because we do not have a clue on how to pay for \nthem. And as long as we don't know how to pay for them, we can only \nexpect the worst.\n  Mr. President, we are left with a budget that can be described a \nlittle bit as show business, fantasy, a budget that almost everybody \nknows isn't worth the paper on which it is written.\n  I have to say that some of the other provisions in the conference \nreport as well are highly problematic. The conference report \nestablishes a new process, a 60-vote point of order against all \nemergency spending except for defense.\n  Now I pose a situation. Take a volcano in the State of Washington or \nan earthquake in the State of California or the floods that hit \nMissouri or the droughts that hit other States or the storms that hit \nthe Northeast or the Southeast. If we say, well, these are emergency \nconditions, it disturbs the community, it destroys their economic \nviability; we want that to be taken care of by programs that we have in \nthe Federal Government. Now we are saying, well, it is not enough to \nhave 51 votes. Let's make sure you have to have 60 votes so that 41 \nvotes can stop any program they want.\n  Let's suppose that there is a political problem existing in a \ncampaign for President or Senator, and one party is in power here. They \nknow that State X, Y or Z has a stronger possible voting block than the \nother party; 41 Senators can get up and stop it cold. Emergency \nspending is emergency spending. We ought to leave it to a majority of \nthe Senate to decide that, not require 60 votes.\n  It flies directly in the face of the Senate-passed resolution. That \nis the way we did it. We left it 50 votes. So not only do I strongly \ndisagree with it as a matter of policy, but I think it is an abuse of \nthe conference process.\n  If 59 Senators think that we need to pass emergency assistance to \nhelp those ravaged by a flood or earthquake, we can't let 41 Senators \nblock it.\n  Why should we be buying new weapons with a higher priority than \nsaving the lives of Americans who are suffering from a natural \ndisaster? We know there have been abuses of the emergency designation, \nbut the Governmental Affairs Committee developed a reasonable approach \nto cutting down on those abuses. They established a new definition and \na new process for extracting new emergency items that were added at the \nlast minute in conference reports. The Senate approved that approach, \nand the House didn't have anything about this in their resolution.\n\n  Yet, when they got together in conference, the conferees on their own \ndecided that they would delineate a new and entirely different \napproach. It is not right. That is not the way the system is supposed \nto work. We talk about majority rule.\n  I am also concerned that the conference report rejected yesterday's \nSenate vote in support of the Dodd child care amendment. It was \nsupported, in part, by our Republican friends, but the amendment that \nwas carried through this body called for $12.5 billion in new funding \nfor child care on top of any new related tax cuts. Instead, what the \nconferees did is provide only $3 billion in child care funding. We had \n66 votes for the proposal yesterday at $12.5 billion. Today, it is down \nto $3 billion. That is not what the 66 Senators voted for, and it is a \nsad commentary on our commitment to families in need.\n  Finally, I am also disturbed that the conference report includes a \nprovision saying that any reestimate of our budget surplus can be used \nonly for tax cuts. I think it is a mistake. I think it is wrong. Why \nshould tax breaks for wealthy people be given a higher priority than \neducation or Social Security or Medicare or defense or veterans' needs?\n  Mr. President, I do not think we should be spending any surpluses \nuntil we save Social Security and Medicare. And I certainly do not \nthink that surpluses should be reserved only for tax cuts, especially \nwhen we know that many of those cuts are going to go to wealthy folks.\n  There are many serious problems with this conference report. Before I \nclose, I want to quickly recount the four problems that are most \nfundamental.\n  First, it doesn't guarantee a single additional penny for Medicare, \neven though Medicare faces bankruptcy in the year 2015. Instead, it \ntakes money needed for Medicare and uses it for tax cuts that will \nbenefit the wealthy.\n  Second, it threatens Social Security. It doesn't extend Social \nSecurity's solvency by a single day, and it calls for using Social \nSecurity surpluses for purposes other than Social Security directly.\n  Third, it is fiscally dangerous. It calls for huge tax cuts, the \ncosts of which explode in the future, just when the baby boomers will \nbe retiring.\n  Finally, its cuts in domestic programs are extreme. If they were ever \nenacted, they would seriously disrupt important public services.\n  More likely, Congress will never approve them, and we will again be \nfacing the disastrous threat of a Government shutdown. The people who \nvoted for it, for the most part, know very well that this is not a \nbudget that is going to survive. It is too bad that we are taking all \nof this time and expending all of this energy to produce this sleight-\nof-hand budget proposal that we see in front of us.\n  I am strongly opposed to this conference report, and I hope that it \nwill be more than a party-line vote that votes against it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SESSIONS). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time do we have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 44 minutes of his 2 1/2 \nhours.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is an inquiry. I gather my \ncolleagues are on the floor, the Senator from Missouri and others, to \nspeak on the budget; is that correct?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. He has the right to use the time. He is the manager.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will wait to get some time in morning \nbusiness to introduce a bill with Senator Domenici. Why don't we go on \nwith the process.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman of the committee, \nI yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from the \nState of Missouri. I rise to commend, thank, and praise Senator \nDomenici for crafting a budget resolution that we can stand up for and \nspeak about and be grateful for. I appreciate it.\n  The conference report balances need for responsibility, the need for \nsetting priorities. When families gather around the kitchen table to \nmake budgets, they set priorities. They say: If we are going to get the \nnew car, we don't take the same vacation; we can't spend the same money \ntwice.\n  For too long, I think the U.S. Government, thinking that it could \nalways just go further and further into debt or raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund, didn't have to set priorities. This is a budget \nthat sets priorities. It sets priorities that are important.\n  The conference report reduces the debt of this country. It will \nincrease funding for education, it will reduce taxes, it will increase \nfunding for national defense, and it will maintain the spending caps \nthat are so very necessary if we are going to have the kind of \ndiscipline that keeps us from further invading the province of the next \ngeneration and their desire to be able to build their own future, \ninstead of paying for our past. That is the real question when we \ndecide whether we are going to have discipline in spending. It is a \nquestion of whether we will let the next generation build its dream or \npay for our past.\n  This in great measure is due to Senator Domenici's great efforts. I \nespecially appreciate his willingness to work with his colleagues. At \nthe start of this process, several other Senators and I sent Senator \nDomenici a letter asking for a budget that saved Social Security \nsurpluses, that reduced the $3.8 trillion public debt, that pursued at \nleast $600 billion in tax relief over the next 10 years, that \nmaintained the statutory spending caps, and included increases in \nfunding for both education and national defense. These were specific \nitems that we requested in a letter addressed to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici. I know the occupant of the Chair \nunderstands what was included in that letter and endorses that as well.\n  What is gratifying about what the chairman of the Budget Committee \ndid is that the budget that has been prepared both meets and exceeds \nthese goals. It calls for the following: A substantial Federal tax \nrelief package, $142 billion over the next 5 years, $778 billion over \nthe next 10 years. The resolution requires the Senate Finance Committee \nand the House Ways and Means Committee to report out their tax cut \nplans by mid-July, a major step forward for the American people, to say \nto them, ``You earned it, we returned it''--instead of, ``You sent it, \nwe spent it.'' For so long the Congress has said, ``You send it, we \nwill spend it.'' No matter how much they sent, we spent. We viewed the \nAmerican people as somehow our ``sugar daddy'' for more and more \nprograms and greater and greater spending.\n  I think it is high time we said to the American people: We believe in \nyou for the future of this country, we believe in families more than we \nbelieve in bureaucracy, we believe in the private sector. You have \nearned so much, you have worked so hard, that we have an operating \nsurplus down the road and we will share it with you by way of tax \nrelief.\n  Second, it stays within the spending caps. The spending caps have \nenabled us to bring the budget into balance. I am happy that this \nbudget maintains those caps.\n  It increases spending for education and defense. This is most \nimportant. We understand the ability to defend the country from foreign \naggression and the ability for the country to have the kind of intense \nvigor and vitality that comes from well-trained, bright citizens. These \nare the two cornerposts of our existence. Education spending goes up 40 \npercent. The budget fully funds the $17.5 billion in defense spending \nrequested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the next 5 years. We \naccommodated both of those by setting priorities. Senator Domenici and \nthe Budget Committee, including the senior Senator from the State of \nMissouri, have done a good job.\n\n  The conference report contains an amendment which I introduced \ndirecting that this new education resource be directed to the States \nand local education districts and not new Federal bureaucracy. We do \nneed to increase the bureaucracy. We need to elevate the students' \nperformance levels; their achievement levels need to soar. We don't do \nthat by building bureaucracy in Washington. We need to get that \nresource directly to the classroom. I am pleased that the conference \nreport will contain this amendment which I proposed, saying that the \nincrease will go to school districts in schools where parents and \nteachers, principals, and school administrators will make decisions--\ninstead of bureaucracy directing it from Washington.\n  The conference report also reduces the debt by $450 billion, $450 \nbillion more than the President's proposal would have reduced the debt. \nIt is time for us to reduce the publicly held debt of this country.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this budget saves $1.8 trillion over the \nnext 10 years for our Nation's elderly. This money is vital to shoring \nup the Social Security system. This stands in stark contrast to the \nPresident's plan, which spends $158 billion over 5 years of Social \nSecurity surpluses for non-Social Security purposes. On the one hand, \nwe save $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years for our Nation's elderly; \nthe President's program over the next 5 years alone would have spent \n$158 billion of Social Security surpluses for non-Social Security \nspending.\n  In addition to the money that this budget saves for Social Security, \nthe budget also takes procedural steps to build in onbudget surpluses \nfrom the year 2001 and beyond. In other words, there are Social \nSecurity surpluses saved, then there will be other surpluses that \nrelate to the rest of the budget--and the budget is careful to make \nsure that those surpluses will materialize beginning in the year 2001.\n  This is setting priorities. This is kitchen table economics. This is \nunderstanding that in order to make some things work, you have to \nadjust other things and you have to work them together. It is not just \na wish list, this is a real spending plan. It is a spending plan that \nhonors the next generation and the future of this great country.\n  Under these new important procedures, Congress could no longer spend \nbillions of dollars on so-called ``emergencies'' that were not really \nemergencies. These new procedures stop the mislabeling of ordinary \nexpenses in the category of ``emergencies'' so that you could invade \nfunds or take Social Security surplus and spend, which happened last \nyear. There will be a point of order in this budget that says you \ncannot do that, you cannot mislabel, you cannot automatically \ncategorize things as emergencies.\n  Last year, the President and the Congress together spent $21 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust fund on these so-called emergencies. We \nneed to stop that. We must stop that. This budget will stop that kind \nof practice.\n  The conference report contains a 60-vote point of order ensuring that \nemergency spending will be limited to actual emergencies. In addition, \nsurpluses that are accumulating in the Social Security trust fund will \nno longer be used to finance onbudget deficits in governmental \noperations. It is a fundamental first step of Social Security reform \nthat the Social Security surpluses should not be used to funding \ndeficits in the rest of government. This budget stops that.\n  In order to establish this first step, Senator Domenici and I \nintroduced legislation that would establish a 60-vote\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\npoint of order against any budget when the Social Security surpluses \nare used to finance onbudget governmental deficits.\n  I rise to say how much I appreciate the work of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the members of the Budget Committee, and their \ncooperation with the Members of the House to work together to bring a \nbudget that really does what family budgets do--sets priorities, looks \nto the future, understands we cannot have everything all the time, but \nprotects Social Security and its surplus, protects our budget generally \nfrom mislabeling that gets us into emergency spending which puts us \ninto debt or raids the Social Security surplus, keeps the caps in \nplace, elevates the capacity for spending for education, and \nstrengthens the military. These are the fundamentals that are important \nto America's strength in the next century. This budget does that.\n  There have been a number of years in which I have not voted for the \nbudget. I haven't been able to in good conscience. I voted against last \nyear's budget with the $21 billion raid on the Social Security trust \nfund. However, I will be able to vote for this budget. This is a budget \nfor which we ought to be grateful. This is the kind of budget that we \nare grateful to have the opportunity to vote in favor of. I commend \nSenator Domenici and the other members of the Budget Committee and the \nHouse for its cooperation in getting us to a place where we can present \nthis kind of spending plan to the people of the United States of \nAmerica, for it is their money that we spend. This is a budget that \nthey would be proud to develop, were they to sit around the table and \nmake those kinds of hard-nosed judgments about the Nation that they \nmake regularly about their families.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Ashcroft leaves the \nfloor, I thank him for his kind remarks. I, too, agree we have a very \ngood budget.\n  Mr. President, I am going to yield to Senator Bond who wants to \nmanage the bill for me for a while. He has a lot of time this \nafternoon. But I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 796 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Dodd, here I got a half \nloaf, maybe a quarter loaf--but we got something.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I can have the floor for just a second, \nbecause I don't know who has the time to yield to me?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have the time to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey yield time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield so much time as the Senator from Connecticut \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from New Mexico on \nthe child care effort. There was obviously, strong bipartisan support \nfor this measure. As the Senator points out, as is normally the case, \nyou do not get everything you want, but it is a major bipartisan step \nforward and will make a lot of difference in people's lives. We had to \nfight very hard and there was a lot of objection on the other side. \nWithout his efforts, it would not have happened.\n  I also thank Senator Jeffords, Senator Chafee, Senator Hatch and the \nmany others who deserve to share the credit for achieving this result, \nbut I particularly want to thank my colleague from New Mexico and my \ncolleague from New Jersey, who has obviously been a champion of all \nthis for a long time. I thank them for their efforts to make a \ndifference in the lives of working families who struggle to find safe \nand affordable child care.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me respond. We left last night from \nour place in the Senate from work on this without the conference report \nbeing signed--and that was the only issue. And about 10:30 last night \nsignatures were necessary and we got half a loaf.\n  Mr. DODD. Thanks. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I \njoin Senator Domenici in thanking my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, for \nhis very thoughtful comments on the budget. Those of us who work on the \nnumbers sometimes get lost in the trees and fail to see the forest. But \nI thought the Senator from Missouri did a very effective job in \nexplaining why this budget is so important to the working American in \nthe average family who sits around the kitchen table and tries to \nfigure out how to spend their money and wonders why those of us in \nWashington cannot spend our money with the same kind of discipline.\n  Today is April 14. It is an ideal time for us to consider this final \nversion of the budget resolution. While so many of our constituents \nwill be staying up late tonight to finish their own income taxes before \ntomorrow's deadline, we look like we are going to be able to meet an \nApril 15 deadline of our own. The Congressional Budget Act created a \ndeadline of April 15 for Congress to adopt its budget for the upcoming \nyear, and this year looks like it will be only the second time since \nthe Budget Act was adopted in 1974 that we in Congress will meet the \ndeadline and will deliver a budget on time. I am sure many of our \nfriends and colleagues and neighbors back home will be astonished to \nhear that. Taxpayers, those who are carrying the load that we are \ndistributing, have to meet their April 15 deadline every year. I can \nunderstand their amazement, why we cannot seem to meet our April 15 \ndeadline. Meeting the deadline is a major step forward in demonstrating \nto our fellow Americans we can be responsible in spending their tax \nmoney. I commend Chairman Domenici and all the conferees on doing \nwhatever it takes to make that happen.\n  Senator Domenici is responsible for the discipline that this budget \nimposes on spending. Through his good efforts and with the cooperation \nof the colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they even met the \ntime deadlines that were required as well. But, as our constituents put \nthe final touches on their tax forms, it is important they be able to \nread in the papers about how their taxes will be spent next year. \nAdopting the budget at this time amounts to full disclosure. Taxpayers \nare sending in their checks. We need to deliver the details of what \nthey are buying. This year I think the taxpayers will have less cause \nfor buyers' remorse than in the past.\n  I think, when the American people heard what the President proposed \nin February, they probably wished their tax forms carried a money-back \nguarantee. Just think of what the President sent us and look how far we \nhave come. The proposal made by the President would destroy the budget \ndiscipline that has helped us balance the books. It would have actually \nbroken the spending caps by $22 billion in new budget authority and $30 \nbillion in actual cash outlays. The conference report we have before us \nkeeps to the caps and keeps to the discipline the taxpayers demanded.\n  When you listen to the President's budget, someone might get the idea \nthat it really presented a sound fiscal plan. That is patently false. \nThis budget that the conferees presented us saves more of the surplus \nthan the President over the next 5 and 10 years. That is why we will \nhave lower debt levels than the President's proposal, from the year \n2000 to the year 2009, even if one adjusts for Social Security equity \npurchases.\n  This means the President's new spending is larger than our tax cuts. \nYou do not hear too much about that, but that is what the President \nproposed. We have heard great complaints about leaving options in the \nbudget for tax relief for American families, but the President proposed \nto spend more than that, new spending already above what we already do. \nThe President would spend 35 percent of the surplus over the next 5 \nyears on programs unrelated to Social Security or Medicare. To do that, \nhe would have to use $158 billion of Social Security's money to pay for \nthem.\n\n  Our tax cut that we empower in this budget is smaller than the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\nnew spending, which is why we felt it was essential that we save the \nentire Social Security surplus. The President's budget talks about 15-\nyear budget estimates and talks about how much he would save over the \nextended period. When you talk about saving money down the line and \nspending it in the short term, I do not think you have to tell the \nAmerican taxpayer what that is all about.\n  There is an old saying about ``a bird in the hand is worth two in the \nbush.'' The President front-loads his spending and says leave it to a \nfuture President to come up with more savings. I do not believe that \ndog hunts in my State or any other State in the Nation. That is not the \nway to go.\n  That is why I believe, when I introduced the President's budget as an \namendment, for those who did not like the budget presented by the \nmajority, the Republican budget, that the President's budget got a \nwhopping two votes on the floor of the Senate. That was the President's \nbudget, all his assumptions, what he wanted to do. People who said ours \nwas so bad, our friends on the other side of the aisle, two of them \nvoted for it. It was not a viable option. What we have presented is a \ngood option.\n  The conference report, as I said, will save Social Security surpluses \nfor Social Security. It keeps to the contract we have with our seniors \nand puts the ``trust'' back in the Social Security trust fund. I look \nforward to working with Chairman Domenici and, I hope, with colleagues \non both sides of the aisle, to create a formal lockbox to enforce this \napproach.\n  At a time when tax revenues are at their highest level since World \nWar II, and income taxes are at an all-time high relative to our gross \ndomestic product, the President proposed not to reduce taxes, but to \nincrease them. The President's budget requested increased revenues $82 \nbillion over the next 5 years.\n  That is 80 different revenue raisers, 80 different increases in taxes \nor fees or revenues. The conference report which we have before us \ntoday goes in the opposite direction by permitting Congress to fashion \nresponsible tax policy. We could leave in the pockets of the people who \ndo the work, who create the jobs, who create the products, the goods \nand services, some $778 billion between 2000 and 2009.\n  I have my ideas on how we need a flatter, simpler, fairer tax that \nwill encourage economic development, but that is not going to be \ndebated until we get around to the actual tax provisions.\n  I think, however, that all taxpayers should welcome the news as they \nwork on their tax forms today and tomorrow that there is a hope there \nmight be a little less taxes to pay in future years. It is also \nimportant to note that not a dime of that tax relief will come at the \nexpense of Social Security. All of it will be funded from the non-\nSocial Security portion of the surplus.\n  Let me cite one specific example of where this conference report \nmakes a significant improvement over the President's budget. On a \nspecific program that is of great concern to me, to the people of my \nState of Missouri, and I believe to people throughout the country, \npeople who are concerned about a healthy environment, who want to see \nclean water, who want to clean up the wastewater that could carry \npollution, that could carry damaging and dangerous illnesses that \ndespoil our natural environments and put us at risk of waterborne \ndiseases, the President proposed to whack $550 million out of the Clean \nWater State Revolving Loan Fund.\n  This program is not a very trendy one, it is not an environmental \nboutique program that sounds good in a press release, but it affects \nMissourians whether they drink water, whether they swim, or whether \nthey fish. It means in the future that citizens in every State of the \nNation can expect cleaner water. The funding is imperative for public \nhealth protection, for environmental protection, and economic growth.\n  During the Budget Committee markup of the budget resolution, I said \nthese cuts would not stand. Chairman Domenici was able to restore a \ngood chunk of the President's cuts, and I thank him for that. But in \nthis conference report, I am hopeful we can restore even more of this \ncrucial funding.\n  The conference report puts an additional $1.1 billion in the overall \nfunding category for natural resources and environment for 2000. I will \nbe working to try to get a good part of that for the State revolving \nfunds. That is money that goes back to the people who are building the \nfacilities, who are operating the facilities, who have had hands \ndirtied cleaning up the wastewater in this country and assuring that we \nhave safe drinking water.\n  As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles the EPA \nbudget, I am confident that the additional funding will be a crucial \nresource in restoring the funds the President slashed.\n  Mr. President, I am encouraged that as our constituents finish their \ntax returns and pay off their taxes, we do not have to be ashamed of \nhow we will be using the money they worked so hard to provide their \nGovernment. In fact, we are going to be letting them keep a bigger \nportion of their money through tax relief in the future. We will \nprotect our children and our grandchildren from the debts that come \nfrom excessive spending. We will keep our promises to retirees who \ndepend on Social Security--all of this signed, sealed, and delivered by \nthe April 15 deadline.\n\n  This budget will put the trust back in Social Security. If there is \nany surplus remaining, we can give needed tax relief to working \nfamilies. It will say that we need to rescue Medicare by making the \nstructural changes in it that are needed, not by putting in the pot \nmore IOUs that will be future debt burdens on our children.\n  We also made a commitment to reform education, to put decisionmaking \nback in the hands of parents, teachers and local schools.\n  We are able to have this debate about what to do with the surplus \nbecause we have some good things going for us in this country. Our \noverall economic activity is good. We have relatively low unemployment. \nWe have steady growth. We have a stock market, for those people who are \ninterested, that has gone out of sight. Why is that so? First, I think \na sound monetary policy. We have had good monetary policy. We have kept \ninflation under control. We have avoided the hidden tax of inflation.\n  Secondly, after fighting long and hard, this Congress, through its \nmajority, has gotten the President to accept the discipline on \nspending, to put caps on spending so that ``if we don't got it, we \nain't gonna spend it,'' to put it in the vernacular. We have caps that \nkeep spending under control. That means, like most Americans, we will \nnot be spending money we do not have.\n  Congress and the President have to sit down and decide what our \npriorities are going to be, to take care of priorities without saying \nyes to every spending opportunity that comes along. It is going to take \nsome tough decisions, and many of those tough decisions are still \ncoming down the pike. But you tell a family that has to live within \ntheir budget that we have to make tough choices, and they will tell \nyou, ``So, what's new? What's different between what we have to do and \nwhat every American family has to do?'' We have to establish that \ndiscipline.\n  Now is not the time to abandon the discipline and go back to the old \nways of runaway spending. It seemed easy in the past to spend money \nthat we did not have, to run up the debt, but when you think about it, \nwe were running up the debt on our children's and our grandchildren's \ncredit cards. That debt was building up for them to pay in the future, \nand it had a tremendously harmful impact on our Nation's economy. Poor \nfiscal discipline was holding our economy back.\n  With the Federal Government's budget under control, with sound \nmonetary policy, with a promise that we are going to allow the \ntaxpayers to keep more of their money that is not needed for the work \nof the Government, we have the conditions to allow the strong, free \nmarket economy to continue to grow, to create jobs, to create wealth, \nand to provide for the families of America, for the individuals who \nwork hard and who are the people we are to serve in this Government.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have worked with Senator Domenici. I \nappreciate his leadership. I hope that my colleagues will vote on both \nsides of this aisle for the budget so that we can get about the \nbusiness of developing spending plans that comply with the\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\ndiscipline of a balanced budget, one that augers well for the future of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee for the decisions made in this conference report that \nwill protect the Social Security trust funds. First, it will be an \nhonor for me to vote for this budget resolution which, for the first \ntime in 30 years, balances the Federal budget and does so without using \nthe Social Security surplus. Second, this budget further protects \nSocial Security by creating a point of order against future \ncongressional budgets which use Social Security surpluses to pay for \nbudget deficits of the federal government.\n  These are great first steps to take to protect Social Security. \nAmericans who have devoted a lifetime of working and paying their \nSocial Security taxes deserve to have their Social Security reserved \nfor nothing but their Social Security. That has not happened in recent \nyears. Without reform, this practice of raiding Social Security would \ncontinue. In fact, President Clinton's budget for next year proposed \nusing $158 billion of the Social Security Trust Fund to finance new \ngovernment spending. We must stop these raids on Social Security.\n  The point of order included in this conference report is similar to \nlegislation I have introduced with the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee. The Ashcroft-Domenici bill writes into law the Social \nSecurity protection point of order. This conference report puts the \npoint of order in the House and Senate rules for this year and next, \nthe maximum amount of time allowed under House rules. This is a wise \ndecision, and the right step to take now. Because a budget resolution \ndoes not become law, the only option available to the budget conferees \nto protect Social Security was to amend House and Senate rules. I \nsupport this action.\n  Later this year I will seek Senate passage of my bill to put this \npoint of order into law, to make it permanent and to strengthen it by \nrequiring that it can only be waived in the Senate with 60 votes, a \nsuper majority. I will also support the efforts by Senators Domenici \nand Abraham to win passage of their Social Security lockbox bill which \nuses the debt limit as an enforcement mechanism to make sure neither \nthe President nor Congress can use Social Security to finance new \ndeficits.\n  I am also pleased that the conferees included in the final bill a \nresolution I offered and the Senate passed expressing the Sense of the \nSenate that the government should not invest the Social Security Trust \nFunds in the stock market. The President has proposed investing as much \nas $700 billion of the surplus in the stock market. This is an unwise \ngamble to take in my view, in the view of the Senate and, in light of \nits inclusion in this conference report, the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Missouri, I \nappreciate your leadership in protecting Social Security. After the \nPresident's budget was released and it proposed to raid $158 billion \nfrom the Social Security trust funds, you told me that Congress needed \nto protect Social Security. You were right. If memory serves me \ncorrectly, you introduced the first bill in the Senate this year to \nprotect Social Security by using a point of order mechanism. I was \npleased to be your first cosponsor. The inclusion in this conference \nreport of the point of order is the first step to protect Social \nSecurity. I look forward to working with you, Senator Abraham and other \nSenators in putting into law, not just the House and Senate rules, \nprovisions that will further protect the Social Security trust funds.\n  Mr. LOTT. I join Senator Domenici in thanking the Senator from \nMissouri for his leadership on Social Security. I recall a lengthy \nletter Senator Ashcroft sent me earlier this year advocating that \nwalling off Social Security should be the top budget priority for this \nCongress. I also remember the bill he introduced earlier this year \ncreating the Social Security point of order that is similar to the one \nin the conference report and his advocacy during Senate debate and when \nthe bill was in conference for the final bill to include the point of \norder. With passage of this budget which, for the first time in 30 \nyears, balances the budget without using Social Security and puts \nprocedures in place to protect Social Security in the future, the \nSenate has made protecting Social Security a high priority. I commend \nSenator Ashcroft for his efforts in protecting Social Security.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3687-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3687-S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ORDER OF PROCEDURE--S. 767\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is an important time with a lot of very \nserious matters before the Senate. Obviously, we are going to be \nworking on the budget resolution. But also, we are very much concerned \nabout what is happening in the Balkans, we are concerned about what is \nhappening in Kosovo, we are concerned about the impact that that is \nhaving in Macedonia and the Montenegro area, as well as countries that \nare not as directly impacted from a standpoint of refugees, but the \nimpact on Albania, which obviously is housing a number of refugees, and \neven countries such as Romania are being affected by what we see \nhappening there.\n  I think it is important that we work together in a bipartisan way to \nexpress our support for our troops, to express our support and \nappreciation for countries that are dealing with this influx of \nrefugees and providing haven and humanitarian assistance working with \ninternational organizations, with military representation that has been \ntrying to deal with this tremendous influx of refugees.\n  We are going to work over the next 24 hours to see if we can come \ntogether with an agreement on a bipartisan resolution expressing our \nappreciation and recognition for the outstanding work that is being \ndone by our men and women of the military, by all the organizations \nthat are helping with the refugees and for the countries that are \ndealing with a tremendous burden right now. But I think we should begin \nhere at home also.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the leader yield to me on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the leader for those comments. It is very, very \nhelpful, particularly coming from our leader. People who watch these \nfloor proceedings should take note that it was a very important \nstatement he just made. I believe he expresses the feelings of all of \nus here. Whatever other differences there may be, I think there is a \ndeep sense of appreciation first and foremost for our own men and women \nin uniform; secondly, for the organizations that are trying to do a \ngood job.\n\n  I particularly commend him for his comments regarding these front-\nline states of Montenegro, which is showing great courage in light of \nsome very difficult pressures; Albania, which is so poor--I think about \n$600 a year is the annual earnings of the people--Macedonia, about \n$1,300 a year, a small country with almost 200,000 refugees now. And \nparticularly he mentions Romania and Bulgaria, which is very important \nas well.\n  This ought to be heartening news to these governments and to the \npeople of these countries that it has not gone unnoticed in our country \nwhat a tremendous job they are doing handling a problem they did not \nask for, flooded by a sea of humanity that needs a lot of help. We are \ndeeply grateful to them. And I am hopeful the leader is right. I \ncertainly want to work with him and anyone else who is interested to \nsee if we can put some language together which would enjoy unanimous \nbacking by all of our colleagues, to speak with one strong, solid voice \nabout how much we appreciate their efforts, the efforts of our service \nmen and women, and the common determination to end this crisis and get \nthese people back to Kosovo.\n  So I thank him.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I \nalways enjoy working with him. He is absolutely right in repeating the \nneed for us to express our appreciation to our military men and women \nand to continue our commitment to the humanitarian effort that is \nunderway and express our appreciation to the front-line states that are \nthere dealing with this problem and the cost of the problem in a very \nserious way. We will work to see\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nif we can express that appreciation and concern.\n  But I want to emphasize that we have our own military men and women \nwho are doing a magnificent job. All of our Senators and House Members \nwho have gone to the region, who have gone to Brussels and have gone to \nAviano or been in Albania or Macedonia, have come back saying what a \nmagnificent job our military men and women have been doing.\n  But it has gone now beyond our active-duty pilots and men and women \nwho are involved in the exercise there. It now involves Reserve unit \nmembers, National Guard, volunteers. We have Air Guard members that are \nnow flying the refueling aircraft that are helping in that effort. And \nthey have been called up unexpectedly with very little notice.\n  Now you have spouses that are in the region that did not have time to \nfile their income tax return, and tomorrow is the infamous day. \nTomorrow is April 15. And like so many Americans, I will file my return \ntomorrow and send my check along with the return, which is a very \nunhappy situation. But we have military men and women who are doing \ntheir duty for their country that were unexpectedly, and on very short \nnotice, called up. And you have their spouses now scrambling, trying to \nperhaps deal with filing their income tax returns tomorrow, the 15th.\n  We have legislation now moving through the House that has been \nthrough the Ways and Means Committee that will be coming to the Senate \nlater on today or tomorrow, and we have legislation that has been \nprepared in the Senate now that would give, I believe, a 60-day \nextension on filing returns to our military men and women that have \nbeen called up for this service to our country.\n\n  There may be some other provisions that have been cited, too, that \nshould be outlined. It exempts U.S. troops serving in the Yugoslavia \ntheater from being taxed on the hazardous duty pay. It grants our \ntroops a 180-day filing extension on their 1998 income tax returns \nafter their return from duty in the combat zone designated by the \nPresident and exempts our troops from the 3-percent excise tax levied \non long distance telephone calls, which I am sure they are making now \nto assure their families that they are in the area and they are safe \nand they are doing their job. So it is more than just a 60-day \nextension.\n  I think it is the right thing to do. It is the fair thing to do. And \nit is important we do it today and make it clear that we are going to \ncomplete this action when the House bill comes over. That may be later \non today or tomorrow. But if we do not make it clear that we are going \nto do it today, and if we do not get it done tomorrow, these families \nare going to be under the duress of either not filing on time, as the \nlaw requires, or asking for an extension, which a lot of Americans are \nhesitant to do.\n  So I think it is important that we prepare the way to get this \nlegislation completed today, or not later than tomorrow, and make it \nclear to the families of our service men and women that are in the zone \nthat they are going to have these benefits and this extension of time.\n  In that vein, then, I do have a unanimous consent request that we \nhave been trying to get cleared, I hope we can get cleared, because we \nneed to do this. And then we can get this behind us and we can move on \nto another resolution.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that----\n  Mr. DODD. Before you do that----\n  Mr. LOTT. I would withhold.\n  Mr. DODD. Can I make a suggestion? There is one Member, I think, who \nhas some questions they may want to raise--let me put it in those \nterms--before you propound it. I would personally prefer if you could \nhold up for a couple minutes until they get here. Maybe we can work \nsomething out with them.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right.\n  Mr. DODD. Other than that, I have been asked, on behalf of someone, \nto raise an objection. I prefer they were here to make their case if \nthat is what they want to do. So if maybe we can wait 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. If we don't wait just a minute, you would have to object, \nand you prefer not to object; is that it?\n  Mr. DODD. You just hit it right on the head.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would certainly be prepared to honor that. Again, I hope \nwe could work this out. I am worried on this, like I am on the other \nlanguage we have been working on. We have a lot of very bright Senators \nthat can come up with some wonderful amendments and it could go on \nendlessly and we could get into some very controversial amendments. No \nSenator--no Senator--would object to what is in S. 767 or the bill that \nwill be coming over from the House.\n  Mr. DODD. I think most of us are cosponsors.\n  Mr. LOTT. Nobody would object to that. Therefore, we want to lock it \nin. There may be other issues Senators would like to object to. I would \nlike to say to them, there will be other bills, there will be other \nways. It will give us time to focus on something that would be an \nexpression of our appreciation and our commitment to be of assistance \nto not only our military men and women that are there in the area but \nto those that are dealing on the international basis with humanitarian \nneeds for these front-line states.\n\n  I think we can do both. But as is usually the case, you need to do \none and then the other. And so I am trying to find a way to achieve \nboth of those.\n  Mr. DODD. If the leader would yield further, I appreciate him showing \nsome patience here. This is, I think, a very good idea. By the way, I \nam a cosponsor of the proposal here to do this for our service men and \nwomen. I had the pleasure of being with a group of them last Friday and \nSaturday at Ramstein Air Force Base and flew with a crew on a C-130, a \n4-hour flight from Germany down to Macedonia. And they were terrific \nyoung men and women. In the cockpit were men and women. The navigator \nwas a woman. There were two pilots, the engineers, the crew.\n  Mr. LOTT. Was that Reserve or National Guard duty?\n  Mr. DODD. These are permanent, regular Army and Air Force people.\n  Mr. LOTT. Permanent, regular duty.\n  Mr. DODD. They do a fabulous job. And I think it is one way of saying \nto them how much we appreciate what they are doing. I guess by \nexecutive order, I gather, the President has issued some orders on this \nas well.\n  Mr. LOTT. The President has expressed his desire to do this. He made \nthat commitment, I believe, in Louisiana. Was it Barksdale Air Force \nBase? And he has taken some action, some executive order, but he \ncannot, by executive order, do what we are doing. It takes a change in \nthe law or a revision in the law in order for these things to occur. So \nit is a supplement to, in addition to, what he has already done by \nexecutive order.\n  I yield, if I might, if I still have the floor, to Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nleader and the Senator from Connecticut on Macedonia, Albania, \nBulgaria, and Romania. We have only begun to assess the impact. You can \nsee on television what is happening in Macedonia and Albania. But you \ncan't see it in Romania and Bulgaria. It is very important, and we are \nattentive and appreciative to these second-tier states that are \naffected by these actions.\n  The point I want to make, Mr. Leader, on this issue that you just \naddressed, is that the clock runs out. There is no other issue we are \ntalking about, including the one we all share on Macedonia, that has a \ntime clock over its head.\n  If this could be done tonight, tomorrow is the 15th, we send \nimmediate comfort to these thousands of families scrambling, as all of \nAmerica is, by tomorrow. We ought not to leave another night lingering \nof question and unknown measures for all these families. It ought to be \nsettled tonight.\n  There is not another issue I have heard talked about here that has \nthat kind of deadline on it and a discomfort ramification. This is \ncomfort for the families that we all think of every minute of every day \nnow, and it really ought to be apart from some of these other things.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut recognizing that, and I \nwanted to say so.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could describe this unanimous consent, \nwhat it will do is provide for an hour of debate equally divided, of \ncourse, so that Members could comment on the actual content in S. 767. \nThis is the critical\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\npart. It will also say, this unanimous consent agreement, that when the \nHouse language comes over, then the House bill would be read for a \nthird time and a vote on passage of the House bill, without any \nintervening language, motion or debate. So it in effect locks in the \nguarantee that this is going to be done by tomorrow. Our people will \nhave that guarantee by the Senate by this unanimous consent agreement \ntonight. That is what I would like to do.\n  If it would be helpful to the Senator from Connecticut, I do not know \nif other Senators are seeking recognition now, we could wait just a \nmoment more. I will notify the Senate that I would be prepared to make \nthis unanimous consent request as soon as we can get further Senators \non the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3689-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 767\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 90, S. 767, under the following \nlimitations: 1 hour of debate on the bill equally divided in the usual \nform; that no amendments to the Senate bill are in order.\n  I further ask that at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nbill be placed back on the calendar; that then the House bill, which is \nthe text of H.R. 1376 as printed in the Record, following consent, be \nread a third time and a vote occur on passage, all without any \nintervening action, motion or debate.\n  If I could explain, before the Chair rules on this, this is the bill \nthat would provide relief for our military men and women who are now--\nmany of them--unexpectedly on short notice serving in the zone where \nthe bombing is occurring, to have these tax benefits and lock this in \nso that they know, today, that they will be able to count on that \nchange.\n  That is my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, and I do not plan to \nobject, I want to have an opportunity to let the Senate know I have \nbeen trying to work with my friends to get a very straightforward sense \nof the Senate attached to the Senate bill that would simply say that \nthe armed services would do everything in their power to ensure that \nwhere there is a child of a military couple, that the husband and wife \nare not deployed into a combat zone. This is something that we have \ndone in the past--during the gulf war--after we found out that, indeed, \nwe did have a mom and dad in a combat zone together. I think it is very \nappropriate, as we give benefits to our brave men and women, that we \nprotect the children at the same time.\n  As I understand it, we are going to discuss the Coverdell bill, but \nwe will actually pass the House bill. I ask my leader if that is, in \nfact, the case? If there was a Senate bill, I would object, because I \nwould like the opportunity to have this particular Senator's amendment \nincluded, but understanding that it will be the House bill, I won't \nstand in the way. Do I have the assurance that the vote will be on the \nHouse bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will not object.\n  I look forward to working with my friends to ensure that we can \nprotect the children of our brave men and women in the armed services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I want to respond briefly to the Senator from \nCalifornia. Of course, the question has been answered. Frankly, I have \npersonal sympathy for the language in your proposal. The Senator from \nCalifornia understands the complexities of this institution as well as \nanybody. It is being run through the committee of jurisdiction. I don't \nknow what their response will be. I want to make a point there is a \nclock ticking. Nothing else we are talking about has a finite \nconclusion, which was why I wanted to do what we could do to get this \ndone, so that the comfort--I think yours relates to comfort, too--can \nbe settled for all the families because they are busily trying to \ncomply with this tonight. I think this sends a message to all of those \ntroops, their spouses, and their Nation that this is, indeed, going to \nhappen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my friend will yield, I appreciate that. I am fully \nsupportive of the legislation. I look forward to voting for the \nlegislation.\n  I am only saying as we look to the financial burden of our men and \nwomen in uniform and as we look at these refugees and the way those \nkids look at their parents, it is no different from our families here \nwhen there is a disruption in family life.\n  I look forward to working with my friend to see that we can at some \nfuture time, very soon--because it could happen soon; they are talking \nabout calling up the Reserves now in the Air Force--that we would \nprotect those children and those families. We don't want to have a \nchild go through the trauma of losing a mother and father in a combat \nzone. We don't have to do that.\n  I thank the Senator very much for his cooperation. I look forward to \nworking with him on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3689-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, today is April 14 and tomorrow is April \n15. That means tomorrow there will be a good many Americans who will \nfinish their tax return preparation, go to the post office and drop it \nin the mailbox in order to get an April 15 date stamped on it to comply \nwith the tax laws in this country. It is never a pleasant thing, and I \nknow most people grit their teeth and wring their hands about the \nresponsibility of having to file income tax returns. But most Americans \ndo that because they know that we have needs and obligations in this \ncountry to pay for a defense establishment, to pay for roads, to pay \nfor schools--to pay for the cost of civilization, in effect.\n  However, not everybody pays their fair share of U.S. income taxes, \nnot everybody pays their way. Today, I am releasing a United States \nGeneral Accounting Office report that was done at my request. This GAO \nreport, which I hope Members of the House and Senate will read, has \nsome rather startling conclusions in it. At about the time most \nAmericans will file their tax return and pay the tax bill that they \nowe, this GAO report says there are plenty of special interests in this \ncountry that don't pay anything--earn a lot of money, but don't pay any \ntaxes. They are not taxpayers. Let me describe what this GAO report \nsays. The GAO report says that 67 percent of the foreign controlled \ncorporations doing business in the United States--67 percent--pay no \nU.S. income taxes at all. Zero in Federal income taxes. In the first \nhalf of this decade, the General Accounting Office says that the \npercent of foreign-based corporations doing business here and paying no \nU.S. income taxes has ranged from 67 percent to 74 percent. The GAO \nreport also shows that U.S. controlled companies fared little better.\n\n  Now, that represents all corporations filing a U.S. tax return. Let's \njust deal with large corporations. That is, corporations defined by the \nGAO as having at least $250 million in assets, or $50 million or more \nin sales; that is a large\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\ncompany. About 30 percent of both the large foreign controlled and U.S. \ncontrolled corporations doing business this country paid no U.S. income \ntaxes--despite having more than $1 trillion in sales here in 1995, the \nlatest year for which statistics are available.\n  In 1995, the large foreign controlled corporations that did pay some \nU.S. income taxes on the profits they made--and some did, the General \nAccounting Office says they paid taxes at a rate that was just about \none-half of the rate paid by the large U.S. corporations paying federal \nincome taxes on their profits here.\n  Now, I bring this to the floor of the Senate simply to say this: \nThere is still substantial tax avoidance in this country, and it is not \ntax avoidance by working folks, by people who get up in the morning and \ngo to work at a job for 8 or 10 hours a day; they aren't avoiding their \ntax responsibilities, because they can't. They must file tax returns. \nThey have withholding on their wages and they must meet their \ncitizenship requirements in this country.\n  As we near April 15, one day away, and the American people are filing \ntax returns, it is reasonable for them to ask, when they hear what is \nwithin the cover of this GAO report, why do they not see some of the \nlargest economic interests that make hundreds of millions of dollars, \nand in some cases billions of dollars--why don't they see those \neconomic interests as taxpayers in this country?\n  The GAO, some while ago, and other reports, said that one automobile \nmaker, a foreign car maker, sold $3.4 billion worth of automobiles in \nthis country and paid zero in Federal income taxes. The Presiding \nOfficer is from a State that would care about that, the State that \nmakes more cars, I suspect, than any other State in our country, where \nmost major car manufacturers are located. So how, one would ask, could \na foreign company come in and sell $3.4 billion worth of automobiles \nand say that ``we want all the advantages and to enjoy all the \nopportunities the American marketplace can give us, but we don't want \nto become taxpayers in your country''? How does that happen? Because we \nhave a tax law, in my opinion, that deals with international \ncorporations that do business all around the world in a way that allows \nthem to jump through massive tax loopholes and, as this report says, \nhundreds of billions of dollars and more of sales in this country and \nthen claim to the U.S. Government that they don't owe one penny in \nincome taxes.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong with that system. I am going \nto come to the floor to speak later about what causes all this and what \nwe can do about it. But I did want to disclose the GAO report today \nthat says this problem isn't getting better. They did this report for \nme 4 years ago. I asked them to renew it and update it. They have done \nthat. The report says this problem isn't getting better. What we have \nis, according to some folks, $10 billion, $20 billion, $30 billion--and \none report estimates $35 billion--in taxes that should be paid to the \nFederal Government by these international corporations, but that is in \nfact not paid.\n  The only way you can retain a tax system of the type we have in this \ncountry is to have voluntary compliance--that is, to have most people \ncomplying because they know they have a responsibility to do so. People \nwill not voluntarily comply with a tax system that they think is \nunfair. It certainly is unfair to those working families in this \ncountry, who make $25,000, $35,000, $55,000, $75,000 a year and work \nhard and send their kids to school and pay their bills and stretch \nbudgets to make ends meet, and at the end of the year they have to file \na tax return and pay the Federal income taxes. It is not fair to them \nand it certainly erodes their confidence in this country and in the tax \nsystem to see some of the largest international corporations doing \nbusiness in America saying, ``We want all the advantages of being able \nto do that, except we don't want to be a taxpayer.''\n\n  I say to those corporations, if you get in trouble, whose Navy are \nyou going to ask for to bail you out? I know the answer and so do you. \nIf you are going to do business here and make profits in this country, \nyou have a responsibility to help pay for that Navy and the many other \nthings we do in this country that make it a wonderful place in which to \nlive.\n  I might just mention some of the ways in which these companies avoid \npaying taxes, just because some people might wonder how this happens. \nIt happens through massive tax avoidance schemes called ``transfer \npricing.'' A foreign corporation decides to do business in the United \nStates. It sets up a wholly-owned subsidiary. It manufactures in a \nforeign country, ships it to this country, and then either overcharges \nor undercharges itself, depending on which way the product is going, in \norder to make sure there is no profit shown in this country from its \nactivities in the United States. The result of gaming that system and \npreventing the tax collectors at the IRS from seeing what they really \nmade is that they are able to cart off their profits from this country \nand avoid paying any taxes at all.\n  On April 15, tax day, every American ought to scream at the Congress \nand the tax collection agency to say that we ought to fix this and we \nought to do it soon. How do we fix it? Well, it is interesting that \neven at a time when GAO is doing this report that shows we have massive \ntax avoidance through transfer pricing--even at this time, this problem \nis getting worse because Congress, at virtually every opportunity, the \nkind of folks who think about these things are slipping little things \ninto bills every chance they get to make this problem worse. They just \ndid it last fall in a revenue bill with a juicy little tax break worth \na couple hundred million dollars. With no debate and no hearings, they \njust stuck it in the middle of that bill. It added to the proposition \nthat more companies will do business, make profits here and pay no \ntaxes here. We have a responsibility to fix that.\n  So I appreciate the work the GAO has done. I intend to encourage them \nto keep doing this work to show us who is paying taxes and who isn't. \nGuess what? The working American families are paying taxes. They don't \nhave any choice. They may not like it, but they understand the \nadvantages of living in this country and what we must pay for for \nourselves and our children--defense, schools, roads and more.\n  If the working families in this country voluntarily comply with this \ntax law--and they do--then I suggest it is time to ask some of the \nlargest international corporations selling brand names that every \nsingle one of us knows to start doing the same thing.\n  I am going to bring a report to the floor in the coming days that \ntalks about transfer pricing in ways that everybody will understand. I \nwill talk about corporations selling to themselves radial tires for \n$2,570 and a tooth brush for $172. Why would companies sell a tooth \nbrush for $172 to themselves? So they can soak profits in one direction \nor another and prevent the Federal Government in this country from \ntaxing their profits. There are massive schemes of tax avoidance. How \nabout a piano for $50? Sound good? I am going to talk about the kind of \ntax avoidance schemes that goes on as a result of this transfer \npricing, which results, by the way, in this kind of study, which says, \nin conclusion, the largest international corporations in this country--\nyes, domestic corporations doing business overseas and foreign \ncorporations doing business here are involved in massive tax avoidance. \nWe have a responsibility to the American people to stop it. This is not \nrocket science. It is simply standing up to the largest economic \ninterests, to say to them you have the same responsibility in this \ncountry as individual taxpayers.\n\n  You have the same responsibility in this country as the average \nworking family has, and that is, you do business here, you profit from \nthis system, you have a responsibility to contribute, to pay taxes. \nWhen you do not do it, we ought to change the law and certainly improve \nenforcement and make sure you do do it, because that is the fair way to \nmake sure a tax system works for everybody.\n  Mr. President, with that I will be back on a succeeding day to talk \nmore about transfer pricing. But I wanted to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues and others the GAO report that is released today that \ndescribes what I think is a rather dismal conclusion about massive tax \navoidance by some of the largest taxpayers in the world, doing business \nin this country, making\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nsubstantial profits, and avoiding the responsibility of paying their \nfair share of Federal income taxes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3691-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

BUNCH\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 15, marks the last day of \nSenate service for Elizabeth K. Bunch. I have known Betty since 1987, \nwhen she worked as a professional staff member for me when I was on the \nRules Committee and was ranking member. I thank her, on behalf of the \nentire Senate, for her many years of service.\n  She was born and grew up in Laramie, WY. After raising a family and \nhaving a career working as the assistant to the dean of the graduate \nschool at the University of Wyoming, Betty came to Washington in 1977.\n  In her first year here, Betty was the special assistant to then newly \nelected Senator Malcolm Wallop, a good friend. Although she intended to \nstay in Washington for only 1 year, Betty spent 10 years working as an \noffice manager and special assistant for our distinguished former \ncolleague.\n  In 1987, Betty moved to the Rules Committee where she worked for me \nin so many important committee responsibilities, including overseeing \ninformation technology initiatives.\n  In 1991, Betty joined the staff of the Sergeant at Arms. There she \nwas first the ``ombudsman'' for the Senate Computer Center, and then \nthe coordinator for the consolidation of Sergeant at Arms offices in \nthe Postal Square Building.

Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to support \nthe Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act in order to restore the benefits \nunfairly eliminated by the 1996 welfare law.\n  In 1996, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform law that \ndrastically restricted the ability of legal immigrants to participate \nin public assistance programs. For the first time in history, legal \nimmigrants were cut off from most federal aid. The law barred them from \nfood stamps, SSI, and other benefits. It banned them for 5 years from \nAFDC, Medicaid, and other programs and gave states the option to \npermanently ban them from these programs.\n  These provisions have had a devastating effect on immigrant families. \nElderly and disabled immigrants were notified that they would be turned \nout of nursing homes or cut off from disability payments. Some even \ntook their own lives, rather than burden their families. Far too many \nhuman tragedies have resulted from the law.\n  Fortunately, many Members of Congress realized that the provisions \nhad gone too far, and we passed legislation in the past two years to \nrestore benefits for many. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the \nAgricultural Research Act of 1998 restored eligibility for Medicaid, \nSSI and Food Stamps for hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants.\n  Nevertheless, many immigrants who came here legally are still \nsuffering from restrictive provisions that remain in effect. The \nFairness for Legal Immigrants Act is needed to bring back this safety \nnet for immigrants who fall on hard times, especially those who are in \ngreat need, such as pregnant women, children, the elderly, the \ndisabled, the poor, and victims of abuse.\n  The Act will permit states to provide Medicaid to all eligible legal \nimmigrant pregnant women and children. It will permit states to extend \nMedicaid to ``medically needy'' legal immigrants who are disabled but \nnot on SSI. It will permit states to cover legal immigrant children \nunder CHIP, if they are also providing Medicaid coverage for legal \nimmigrant children.\n  For legal immigrants who arrived before August 1996, the Act will \nrestore SSI eligibility for those who are elderly and poor, but not \ndisabled by SSI standards. It will also restore food stamp eligibility \nto all legal immigrants who have not yet had their eligibility \nrestored, primarily parents of poor children.\n  For legal immigrants who arrived after August 1996, the Act will \nrestore SSI eligibility for those who become disabled after reaching \nthe United States. Finally, the Act will exempt post-August 1996 legal \nimmigrants who are victims of domestic or elder abuse from the five-\nyear ban on Medicaid and welfare assistance, and restore their \neligibility for SSI and food stamps.\n  These reforms are essential in order to fulfill our obligation to \nthose who legally entered our country. Many of them are family members \nof American citizens. They play by the rules, pay their taxes, and \ndeserve a fair chance to become citizens and build new lives for \nthemselves and their families in America.\n  I urge the Senate to support this important legislation, and I look \nforward to its early enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3691-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3691-S3692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JAMES Q. CANNON\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute \nto James Q. Cannon, a fellow Utahn who has served as a distinguished \nleader in the health care quality movement for over twenty-five years.\n  Those of us who know Jamie recognize his tireless efforts to ensure \nthat the thousands of seniors, the underprivileged, and other \nvulnerable citizens receive the highest quality medical care possible.\n  As President and Chief Executive Officer of HealthInsight, a \ncommunity-based quality improvement organization in Utah and Nevada, \nMr. Cannon has dedicated his life's work to fostering collaboration and \ncontinuous learning among health care providers, policy makers, \nconsumer, and business leaders.\n  These efforts have enabled physicians and other health care \nprofessionals to respond more effectively and humanely to the many \nneeds of their patients and have helped the best in health care science \nand research to become part of the usual practice of medicine.\n  Jamie Cannon's vision and pioneer spirit have assisted in bringing \nhundreds of people together annually to learn, discuss, and implement \ncommunity-wide health care quality improvement strategies. His \ncommitment to improving the delivery of health care has been a driving \nforce behind countless successful efforts in our communities to prevent \nunnecessary illness, to reduce complications associated with chronic \ndisease, to improve care delivery processes and outcomes, to simplify \nhealth care administration, and to develop sound, supportive government \npolicies.\n  Over the years, these successes have touched in one way or another, \nvirtually all aspects and settings in\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nhealth care--from government policy development to evaluations of \nprogram effectiveness, from pediatric care to end-of-life care, and \nfrom hospitals to physician offices.\n  In addition to his service to the people of Utah and Nevada, Jamie \nhas led and supported initiatives to evaluate and improve the quality \nof medical care delivered to all Americans. He has served as a member \nof the board of directors of the American Health Quality Association, \nan association representing a national network of organizations and \nindividuals striving to improve the health care delivered in every \nstate in our nation.\n  Mr. Cannon has also chaired numerous committees and task forces at \nthe national level, providing leadership and direction to other health \nbusiness executives committed to improving the quality of clinical \nmedicine.\n  In addition to providing a legacy of health care quality leadership \nregionally and nationally, Jamie has also influenced the lives of many \nothers in the community. He is a devoted husband, father of ten \nchildren, son and brother. Throughout his life, Jamie has also given \ngenerously of his time to those in need through lay service in his \nchurch.\n  Jamie's genuine care and concern for others is apparent in every \ninteraction. His boundless optimism and belief in human goodness \nengenders trust, rekindles hope, and nurtures vision in all those \naround him.\n  Mr. Cannon's leadership and service are respected and admired by his \npeers, employers, business associates, friends and neighbors, and \nfamily. I am proud to know Jamie. He deserves the recognition and \nappreciation of Congress, the Nation, and particularly the citizens of \nUtah and Nevada.\n  With honor and pride I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nrecognizing and expressing appreciation to James Q. Cannon for his many \ncontributions to quality health care in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3692-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the concerns of \nsome of my constituents who are participating in an adult basic \neducation program conducted by the ARC of Northern Rhode Island.\n  Earlier in this session, John Mullaly, on behalf of his classmates, \nwrote to me to express his concerns regarding the use of the word \n``handicapped''.\n  Mr. President, individuals who live with disabilities are one of the \nnation's great untapped resources. They have much to contribute, and \nthey deserve to be fully integrated into every aspect of society. I am \nproud that so many of my colleagues share this point of view and that \n70 senators have joined in cosponsoring S. 331, the Work Incentives \nImprovement Act, legislation that allows individuals with disabilities \nto join the workforce while maintaining their health benefits under \nMedicare or Medicaid.\n  As we debate this and other related legislation in the Senate, I hope \nthat my colleagues will also consider the vocabulary we use. Mr. \nMullaly and his classmates have suggested that we replace the term \n``handicapped'' with the phrase ``persons with physical/mental \nchallenges''. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nMr. Mullaly's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             The ARC of Northern Rhode Island,\n\n                                                 February 2, 1999.\n     Senator Jack Reed,\n     Providence, RI.\n       Dear Senator Jack Reed: We are students of Adult Basic \n     Education at the ARC of Northern Rhode Island. We believe \n     that everyone should be treated equally and be given the \n     chance to be the best that he or she can be. No one should \n     suffer discrimination. We know you agree with this. We are \n     trying to educate the general public and we need your help.\n       We are trying to tell them that it discriminates against us \n     to refer to us as ``handicapped''. It is not an appropriate \n     word because it puts a stigma on us and a limit as to what we \n     can do. It is incredible what we can do and we would prefer \n     to be referred to as persons with physical/mental challenges. \n     We will take the challenge! That term gives us inspiration to \n     meet our goals. What are our goals? To be the best we can be, \n     to give others love, kindness, and inspiration. Also, to \n     protect the rights of others like us, and to educate the \n     public.\n       Will you help us? Will you work towards using the new \n     terminology on signs in public places?

John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 507, the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 1999.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Victoria \n     Heid Hall (for the effects on outer continental shelf \n     receipts) and Gary Brown (for all other federal costs), both \n     of whom can be reached at 226-2860, and Marjorie Miller (for \n     the state and local impact), who can be reached at 225-3220.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Dan L.

Adjusting for anticipated inflation, CBO \n     estimates that implementing the bill would require \n     appropriations of $2.5 billion over that period. The bill \n     also would authorize:\n       Prepayment or waiver of amounts owed to the federal \n     government;\n       Spending a portion of the fees collected at Corps \n     recreation sites;\n       Free use of sand, gravel, and shell resources from the \n     outer continental shelf (OCS) at eligible projects by state \n     and local governments; and\n       Sale of specified federal lands in Washington and Oklahoma.\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 507 would result in \n     additional outlays of about $1.9 billion over the 2000-2004 \n     period, assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts. \n     The remaining amounts authorized by the bill would be spent \n     after 2004. Enacting the bill would affect direct spending; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. CBO \n     estimates that enacting S. 507 would reduce direct spending \n     by $18 million in 2000 and would result in a net increase in \n     direct spending of $6 million over the 2000-2004 period.\n       S. 507 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). State and local governments would likely incur some \n     costs as a result of the bill's enactment, but these costs \n     would be voluntary.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 507 is shown in the following table. \n     For constructing, operating, and maintaining projects that \n     are already authorized, CBO estimates that the Corps will \n     need about $4 billion annually over the 2000-2004 period \n     (roughly the level appropriated in 1999). The table shows the \n     estimates of additional spending necessary to implement the \n     bill. The costs of this legislation fall primarily within \n     budget function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        By fiscal years, in millions of\n                                                   dollars--\n                                     -----------------------------------\n                                       2000    2001   2002   2003   2004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated Authorization Level.......     478    558    485    321    185\nEstimated Outlays...................     239    446    510    414    278\n \n                       CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority..........     -18      6      6      6      6\nEstimated Outlays...................     -18      6      6      6      6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of estimate: For the purpose of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that S. 507 will be enacted by the end of fiscal year \n     1999 and that all amounts estimated to be authorized by the \n     bill will be appropriated for each fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Estimates of annual budget authority needed to meet design \n     and construction schedules were provided by the Corps. CBO \n     adjusted the estimates to reflect the impact of anticipated \n     inflation during the time between authorization and \n     appropriation. Estimated outlays are based on historical \n     spending rates for activities of the Corps.\n     Direct spending\n       Prepayments and Waivers of Payments. S. 507 would authorize \n     the state of Oklahoma to pay the present value of its \n     outstanding obligation to the United States for water supply. \n     CBO estimates that, if the bill is enacted, a prepayment of \n     about $20 million would be made in 2000 and that payments \n     forgone would be about $2 million a year over the 2000-2033 \n     period. The bill would authorize the Corps to waive payments \n     from the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District and the \n     cities of Chesapeake, Virginia, and Moorefield, West \n     Virginia, for other projects. CBO estimates that under \n     current law, payments from these entities would total less \n     than $500,000 annually over the 2000-2031 period.\n       Spending of Recreation Fees. S. 507 would authorize the \n     Corps to retain and spend each year any recreation fees in \n     excess of $34 million. At present, all recreation fees are \n     deposited as offsetting receipts in the Treasury and are \n     unavailable for spending unless appropriated. By allowing the \n     Corps to spend receipts in excess of $34 million, this \n     provision creates the possibility of new direct spending. \n     CBO's baseline projection of receipts is $36 million a year. \n     Allowing for the possibilities that receipts could be either \n     more or less than that projected level, we estimated that the \n     expected value of additional spending from enacting this \n     provision is about $3 million a year.\n       Using Outer Continental Shelf Sand and Gravel. S. 507 would \n     amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to allow \n     nonfederal entities to use--without charge--sand, gravel, and \n     shell resources from the outer continental shelf for shore \n     restoration and protection programs and certain other \n     construction projects if such projects are subject to an \n     agreement with the Corps. Under current law, the Department \n     of the Interior (DOI) cannot charge other federal agencies \n     for the use of these OCS resources. Section 211 would extend \n     free use of the resources to nonfederal interests, including \n     state and local governments, for the type of projects \n     specified in the bill. Based on information from DOI, CBO \n     estimates that exempting these projects from fees for OCS \n     sand, gravel, and shell resources would result in forgone \n     receipts of about $1 million each year. Proceeds from the \n     sale of this material are recorded as offsetting receipts to \n     the Treasury; thus a loss of these receipts would increase \n     direct spending.\n       Sales of Land. S. 507 would direct the Corps to sell at \n     fair market value land that was acquired for the Candy Lake \n     Project in Osage County, Oklahoma. The land was acquired in \n     the mid 1970s at a total cost of about $2 million. Accounting \n     for inflation, CBO estimates the current value of the land at \n     about $4 million. CBO anticipates that the lands could be \n     sold in fiscal year 2000. Annual lease payments and other \n     revenues accruing to the federal government from these lands \n     are not significant.\n       CBO anticipates that sale proceeds would be counted for \n     pay-as-you-go purposes. Under the Balanced Budget Act, \n     proceeds from nonroutine asset sales (sales that are not \n     authorized under current law) may be counted for pay-as-you-\n     go scorekeeping only if the sale would entail no financial \n     cost to the government.\n       S. 507 also would direct the Corps to transfer lands \n     located in Clarkston, Washington, to the Port of Clarkston. \n     The Port would not be required to pay for the lands as long \n     as they are used for recreation purposes. The fair market \n     value of the lands are estimated at slightly less than $2 \n     million. Based on information provided by the Corps, CBO \n     anticipates that the lands would continue to be used for \n     recreation purposes after conveyance and that no \n     consideration would be required. The Port currently leases \n     the lands from the United States without cost.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in outlays that are subject to pay-\n     as-you-go procedures are shown in the following table. (The \n     bill would not affect governmental receipts.) For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budget year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays........................         0       -18         6         6         6         6         6         6         6         6         6\nChanges in receipts.......................                                                  Not applicable\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Estimated impact act on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: S. 507 contains no intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in UMRA. State and local governments that choose to \n     participate in water resources development projects and \n     programs carried out by the Corps would incur costs as \n     described below. In addition, some state and local \n     governments would benefit from provisions in this bill that \n     would alter their obligations to make payments to the federal \n     government and order transfers of land.\n     Authorizations of new projects\n       CBO estimates that nonfederal entities (primarily state and \n     local governments) that choose to participate in the projects \n     authorized by this bill would spend about $1.3 billion during \n     fiscal years 2000 through 2011 to help construct these \n     projects. These estimates are based on information provided \n     by the Corps. I addition to these costs, nonfederal entities \n     would pay for the operation and maintenance of many of the \n     projects after they are constructed.\n     Changes in cost-sharing policies\n       S. 507 would make a number of changes to federal laws that \n     specify the share of water resources project costs borne by \n     state and local governments. Section 202 would increase the \n     nonfederal share or recurring costs associated with new \n     coastal shore protection projects from 35 percent to 50 \n     percent. This change would not affect the construction of \n     these projects. Some state and local governments would find \n     it easier to satisfy matching requirements for specific \n     projects as a result of provisions in S. 507 that would allow \n     additional in-kind contributions or expand the range of \n     expenditures counted towards the required match. Other \n     provisions in the bill would expand the opportunities for \n     state and local governments to participate in water resources \n     projects.\n       S. 507 includes several provisions that would alter the \n     repayment obligations of specific state and local \n     governments, either by allowing the prepayment of amounts \n     owed or by waiving amounts owed under current law.\n     New programs\n       S. 507 would authorize several new programs that would \n     assist state and local governments. Specifically, the bill \n     would authorize total appropriations of $75 million for \n     fiscal years 2000 and 2001 for a program to reduce flood \n     hazards and $30 million for the same period for activities to \n     protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat of the Missouri \n     River and the middle Mississippi River. State and local \n     governments choosing to participate in these programs would \n     have to provide 35 percent of the initial cost of any funded \n     project and all the subsequent operation and maintenance \n     costs. The bill also would authorize a program of technical \n     assistance for the purpose of developing and evaluating \n     measures to keep fish from entering irrigation systems. State \n     and local participants in this program would be required to \n     contribute 50 percent of the cost of such assistance.\n       State and local governments would benefit from a provision \n     in S. 507 that would allow them to negotiate agreements with \n     DOI to use sand, gravel, and shell resources from the outer \n     continental shelf for eligible projects at no charge.\n     Conveyances\n       S. 507 would allow the state of Oklahoma and the Port of \n     Clarkston, Washington, to take title to land and facilities \n     now owned by the federal government. Both could be required \n     to pay the costs necessary to complete these conveyances, \n     should they choose to take the property. The conveyances \n     would be voluntary on the part of these governments.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill contains \n     no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: OCS receipts--Victoria \n     Heid Hall.

Mr. President, today marks the completion of a year-long \npublic education effort called the First Family Pledge Campaign to \nincrease awareness of the need for organ donation and to increase the \nnumber of people willing to be organ donors.\n  The campaign has focused primarily on the need to discuss organ \ntransplantation within the family. Open family discussion is essential \nto ensure that each person's commitment to become an organ donor is \nunderstood and honored by family members. As part of that campaign, my \nwife Vicky and I agreed to become organ donors, and to discuss the \nissue in our family.\n  The campaign for organ donation has been an excellent opportunity to \nrecognize the success of organ transplantation in saving lives, and \nCongress should be proud that it has helped to\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\nsupport this achievement. Fourteen years ago, we created the National \nOrgan Transplant Program. Our goal was to do all we can to see that \norgan failure is not a death sentence and make it possible for many \nmore Americans to return to good health. We have had significant \nsuccess. More than 20,000 Americans--men, women and children--now \nreceive life-saving organ transplants each year. But more needs to be \ndone.\n  Too many Americans die while waiting for organ transplantation. More \nthan 60,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplantation. Every day, \n55 of those people have an organ transplant. And every day, 10 others \ndie because they did not have timely access to an organ. While there \nare differences of opinion about how an organ distribution system \nshould be designed, it is clear that the overriding problem is a \nshortage in the availability of healthy organs.\n  In 1997, there were more than 9,000 organ donors. Nearly 4,000 of \nthose donors were living relatives who were willing and eligible to \ngive an organ--a kidney or part of a liver--to a family member in need. \nBut transplantation of this type is not an option for many in need.\n  Each year, approximately 5,000 persons donate organs upon death. \nThese acts of generosity are saving the lives of countless others. \nTransplantation of a cornea can restore sight. Transplantation of a \nkidney means life without dialysis. And transplantation of a heart, \nlung or liver means the difference between life and death. Studies show \nthat more than 10,000 individuals each year could become organ donors \nafter their death, and some estimates are as high as 15,000 each year.\n  The reasons that an individual does not become an organ donor vary. \nIn some cases, the donation may conflict with religious or personal \nbeliefs. But in far too many cases, the reason is simply lack of \nawareness of the need, or misunderstanding of the process.\n  In building the national organ donation and transplantation system, \nwe have taken great care to ensure that individuals and families are \nnot coerced into decisions to donate their organs. We have a strong \nshared commitment to respect personal and religious beliefs. Congress \nhas made it illegal for organs to be sold--another measure to ensure \nfreedom of choice. The Secretary of HHS has proposed a rule to \nencourage donation by training hospital personnel to explain the \nprocess. This rule, which I support, specifies that only trained \nhospital personnel are permitted to approach families of potential \norgan donors. But the most effective measure to increase organ donation \nis open discussion, long before a time of crisis. Families need to \nexplore their beliefs and opinions, make personal commitments, and have \nan opportunity to honor the beliefs and commitments of loved ones who \ndie.\n  In closing, I commend the First Family Pledge Campaign for all it has \ndone to encourage and support these important efforts. Congress must \ncontinue to pursue legislation and policies to assure that all \nAmericans in need have access to life-saving transplantation. Adequate \nfunding is essential to support these services. We need to be sure that \nthe distribution system is fair and effective. And we need to continue \nour nationwide efforts to educate the public about the need for and \nvalue of organ donation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:53 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas passed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of \nthe Senate:\n\n       H.R. 46.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the \nWomen's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999, and I do so on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Bond, Harkin, Bingaman, Levin, Enzi, \nDomenici, Abraham, Sarbanes, Akaka, Kennedy, Edwards, Feinstein, \nLandrieu, Boxer, Cleland, Kohl, Wellstone, Burns, and Leahy.\n  As the title suggests, this bill addresses the funding constraints \nthat are making it increasingly difficult for our women's business \ncenters to sustain the level of services that they currently provide \nand, in some instances, to literally keep the doors open.\n  Some colleagues may ask the question, What is the Women's Business \nCenter Program? The Small Business Administration started the Women's \nBusiness Center Program which provides 5-year grants matched by non-\nFederal dollars to private sector organizations so that they can \nestablish business training centers for women. Depending on the needs \nof the community being served, the centers teach women the basic \nprinciples of finance, management, and marketing, as well as \nspecialized topics such as how to get a government contract or how to \nstart a home-based business.\n  These business centers are located in rural, urban, and suburban \nareas, and they direct much of their training and counseling assistance \ntowards socially\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nand economically disadvantaged women.\n  I might add, Mr. President, of all the changes in the social \nstructure of the United States or in the marketplace in the last years, \nnone has been more profound than the significant numbers of women \nentering the marketplace. As more and more women enter the marketplace \nand they assume roles as principal breadwinners or sole breadwinners \nwithin some families, it is more and more important that they have the \ncapacity to participate fully in the economy and not be relegated \nsimply to entry-level jobs.\n  Congress started this program in 1988 in response to hearings that \nrevealed the Federal Government was not meeting the needs of women \nentrepreneurs and that there were very little other mechanisms for \nentry-level women entrepreneurs. Women faced particular discrimination \nin access to credit and capital, and they were shut out of many \ngovernment contracts and had very little access to the kind of business \nassistance that they needed to compete in the marketplace. We have \nreally come a long way since that first beginning. There are now 59 \ncenters in 36 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.\n  In addition to increasing self-sufficiency among women, the women's \nbusiness centers have strengthened women business ownership overall and \nencouraged local job creation.\n  The numbers really tell a remarkable story, Mr. President. In 1998, \nwomen-owned businesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million \nsmall businesses in the United States. They have accounted for some $3 \ntrillion in annual revenues to the economy, and they employed one out \nof every four workers in the United States.\n  Still, according to the data from the 1998 Women's Economic Summit, \nwomen-owned businesses account for only 18 percent of all small \nbusiness gross receipts, and they are dramatically underrepresented in \nthe Nation's two most lucrative markets--corporate buying and \ngovernment contracting.\n  This really underscores significantly the problem that I talked about \na moment ago of entry-level jobs and of the nature of the small, \nentrepreneurial, home-grown, cottage-industry-type businesses that \nwomen begin with, which often could be grown significantly into larger \nbusinesses but for the lack of credit, the lack of available marketing \nskills, and the lack of management skills. Clearly, the need for \nwomen's business centers continues, and this is no time for us to \ndiminish or to dismantle the infrastructure that the federal government \nhas invested in for the past decade.\n\n  Addressing the special needs of women-owned businesses serves not \njust the entrepreneurs, but it serves the overall strength of \ncommunities, as well as the economy of the whole of our country. \nWomen's business centers help increase the growth, not just of women's \nbusinesses, but also of the large network of support businesses that \nare linked and affiliated with them, as well as, obviously, the general \neconomy and the local community associated with those businesses.\n  There are many extraordinarily run centers around the country. Let me \nhighlight two of them--one in New Mexico and one in Massachusetts. I \nknow my colleagues, Senators Bingaman and Domenici, are particularly \nproud of the one in their home State. I am very proud of one in \nMassachusetts which has been a model women's business center. It is the \nCenter of Women & Enterprise in Boston. Since 1995, that center has \nserved more than 2,000 women from more than 100 cities and towns in \neastern Massachusetts. Of the women it serves every year, 60 percent \nare low-income, 70 percent are single, and 32 percent are women of \ncolor.\n  Andrea Silbert is the tireless executive director of that center. She \nhas effectively raised money, forged partnerships, and designed \nthorough training and mentoring programs to help women entrepreneurs.\n  When the Boston women's business center trains an entrepreneur, that \nentrepreneur then knows how to approach a lender for a loan, knows how \nto manage her business, and understands the ins and outs and hows and \nwhys of marketing.\n  But notwithstanding the success of these several women's business \ncenters, the fact is that a number of them around the country are \nfacing increased difficulty in raising the required matching funds.\n  There are some people who think the centers should charge higher \nfees. And they might think so, until you examine the makeup of the \npeople who are being reached by the centers. We were privileged to have \na person by the name of Agnes Noonan, who has spent the last 8 years as \nthe executive director of WESST Corporation, the women's business \ncenter in Albuquerque, NM, testify before us in the Small Business \nCommittee. As she testified in March, during her first couple of years \nrunning the center, her view was that there was a very simple way to \ndeal with the problem of raising money, and that was to do a better job \nof marketing the center's services to women who could afford to pay \nhigher fees. That would increase the center's income, and it would \nreduce its reliance on public dollars.\n  But the problem is that the minute you do that, you start redirecting \nthe energy and focus of the center away from the people who most \nbenefit from it. And that is precisely what she told us as a \npractitioner. She said:\n\n       Though [such a] strategy may have made economic sense, it \n     conflicted directly with our mission of serving low-income \n     women. . . . If we were to target our services to women \n     who could afford to pay market consulting and training \n     rates, then we would clearly not be addressing the needs \n     of low-income women in New Mexico.\n\n  She also gave us important information about the realities of \nfundraising:\n\n       Nationally, only six percent of foundation money is \n     earmarked for women, and only a tiny portion of that goes to \n     women's economic development.\n\n  So as she said to us, the executive directors of women's business \ncenters are very experienced fundraisers. Lori Smith of the WBC in \nOklahoma City said before the House Small Business Committee that she \nthought she could sell sand in the desert. She viewed herself as good a \nfundraiser and as good a salesperson as there is, but she also said \nthat competition for foundation- and private-sector dollars has become \nso intense and those dollars so much scarcer with each year that \nGovernment funding has diminished. And they do not have anywhere to \nturn.\n  In addition to that, bank mergers are occurring, as we know, at an \nincreased rate around the country. And those mergers are further \nexacerbating the situation because the banks have been a primary source \nof funds for many of these centers.\n  Take the example of the recently announced bank merger in Boston of \nFleet Bank and BankBoston. Those banks separately have been very \ngenerous to the women's business center in Boston. Their combined \ncontribution came to $150,000. But we have serious concerns that their \nfull support continue, and not reduce as we have seen in other States, \nwhere the merged institutions rarely give the same amount of money as \nthe two or three, or whatever number, that the prior institutions \ncontributed. So we have seen a drying up of some of the funding \nsources, I might add, not just for the women's business centers but for \na host of charitable institutions that rely on those contributions.\n  So for many of the centers, they now have the added specter of losing \ntheir annual base of money. We need to guarantee that we do not add to \nthat ominous cloud by having the base that came from the SBA also \ndisappear at the same time when they come to the end of the original 5-\nyear grant cycle. That money is their basic bread and butter, it is \ntheir ability to stay alive, as well as the indispensable ingredient of \nleveraging for additional fundraising dollars.\n  I believe, and the colleagues who have joined me in introducing this \nlegislation believe, that it is essential for us to find a fair way to \nlet the women's business centers recompete for their base funding. That \nis competition; it is not entitlement.\n  So here is how the legislation we introduce gets us there.\n  First, it allows the women's business centers which have completed a \nfunding term to compete for another 5 years of Federal funding, which, \nunder current policy, would be up to $150,000 per year. The \nrecompetition standards would be higher than those needed for centers \napplying for funds for their initial 5-year funding term. This \nrecognizes that more experienced centers ought to be able to perform \nwell from\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nthe beginning of their second term funding; they have been through the \nlearning curve. And I believe this additional Federal funding is \nnecessary to counteract the adverse impact of bank and corporate \nmergers I mentioned previously.\n  Second, my bill will raise the authorization of appropriations for \nfiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 for women's business center \nfunding from $11 million to $12 million per year. It will also reserve \n40 percent of those appropriations for recompetition grants.\n  I believe that increasing the authorization to $12 million is \nentirely consistent with the legislation which our committee passed \nlast year, and it would ensure that there would be adequate funding to \npreserve effective, established centers and to help fund new centers in \nStates that do not have one.\n  Mr. President, I thank those colleagues who have joined me in this \neffort. I hope additional colleagues will join in support of this \nlegislation and we can rapidly pass it. It should not be contentious. \nWe are not talking about vast sums of money, but we are talking about \nan extraordinary amount of leverage for a very small investment.\n  I think that in most States in this country my colleagues will agree \nwith me that opening the doors of opportunity to full business \nownership and participation, particularly to those who have been \ndisadvantaged for various reasons, is of enormous importance to the \nlonger term economic well-being of our country. And when I say ``well-\nbeing,'' I am not just talking about the bottom line in terms of the \nreturn on investment to those businesses, I am talking, obviously, \nabout the enormous importance of strengthening families, strengthening \ncommunities, and eliminating the vestiges of discrimination that remain \nagainst women in terms of their full economic participation in the \nNation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Women's Business \nCenters Sustainability Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Business Centers \n     Sustainability Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 29 of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 656) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Eligibility For Additional Assistance.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a private \n     organization that has received financial assistance under \n     this section pursuant to a grant, contract, or cooperative \n     agreement, and that is in the final year of a 5-year project \n     or that has completed a project financed under this section \n     (or any predecessor to this section), may apply for financial \n     assistance for an additional 5-year project under this \n     section.\n       ``(2) Conditions for participation.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of this section, as a condition of receiving \n     financial assistance authorized by this subsection, an \n     organization described in paragraph (1)--\n       ``(A) shall meet such requirements as the Administration \n     shall establish to promote the viability and success of the \n     program under this section, in addition to the requirements \n     set forth in this section; and\n       ``(B) shall agree to obtain, after its application has been \n     approved and notice of award has been issued, cash \n     contributions from non-Federal sources for each year of \n     additional program participation in an amount equal to 1 non-\n     Federal dollar for each Federal dollar.''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 29(k) of the \n     Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 656(k)) is amended by striking \n     paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--There is authorized to be appropriated \n     $12,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2000 and 2001 to carry \n     out the projects authorized under this section, of which, in \n     each fiscal year, not more than 40 percent may be used to \n     carry out projects funded under subsection (l).''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. This \nlegislation will strengthen SBA's women's business centers in Michigan \nand across the Nation which help entrepreneurs start and maintain \nsuccessful businesses by providing such things as start-up help and \nfinancial expertise to women-owned businesses. This legislation will \nallow those women's business centers that are already successfully \nparticipating in the program to recompete for Federal funding after \ntheir initial funding term expires.\n  Under this legislation, the recompetition standards would be set \nhigher than those used for centers applying for their initial five-year \nfunding term. The ability of established and successful women's \nbusiness development centers to continue to compete for Federal funding \nmeans that critical resources will continue to be made available for \nwomen-owned businesses for such purposes as training and obtaining \nbusiness financing.\n  Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of small \nbusinesses in America and provide innumerable jobs and resources to the \nstate of Michigan. Michigan has two women's business centers, the \nCenter for Empowerment and Economic Development (CEED) in Ann Arbor and \nthe Grand Rapids Opportunities for Women (GROW) in Grand Rapids. We \nalso have Project Invest in Traverse City which is a women's business \ncenter affiliate. In addition, a Center is currently being set up in \nDetroit.\n  These Michigan programs offer women a comprehensive package of \nbusiness education and training, start-up financing, technical \nassistance, peer group support and access to community and government \nsupportive resources such as child care. Michigan's women's business \ncenters are supportive of this legislation and believe it is necessary \nin order for them to continue to be able to offer the current levels of \nservices and support to Michigan's women-owned businesses.\n  I am pleased that Congress has recognized the importance of funding \nthe women's business center program. In 1997, Congress enacted \nlegislation to make the 1991 pilot project a permanent part of the \nSmall Business Administration programs available to help entrepreneurs \nstart and maintain successful business. It also doubled the annual \nfunding of the women's business centers and extended the funding period \nfrom 3 to 5 years. And just this year, Congress enacted legislation to \nchange the non-Federal and Federal funding ratio requirements and it \nagain increased the annual authorization level from $8 million to $11 \nmillion.\n  The legislation being introduced today by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kerry, in addition to allowing existing women's \nbusiness centers to compete for additional Federal funding, will also \nincrease the authorized appropriations for fiscal year 2000 and fiscal \nyear 2001 from $11 million to $12 million for this program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I strongly support the Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999. Its goal is to provide disadvantaged women \nwith the opportunity to obtain the training and counseling necessary to \nbecome successful small business owners.\n  Today, the Nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving. Small \nbusiness has become the engine that drives the economy. America's 23 \nmillion small businesses employ more than 50 percent of the private \nworkforce, generate more than half of the nation's gross domestic \nproduct, and are the principal source of new jobs in the U.S. economy. \nThe increase in the number of small businesses owned by women has \nsignificantly contributed to the overall success of small business.\n  Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms has grown by78 \npercent. Employment in women-owned firms more than doubled from 1987 to \n1992, compared to an increase of 38 percent in employment by all firms. \nFor women-owned companies with 100 or more workers, employment has \nincreased by 158 percent--more than twice the rate for all U.S. firms \nof similar size. Women entrepreneurs are taking their firms into the \nglobal marketplace at the same rate as all U.S. business owners.\n  Today, women are starting new firms at twice the rate of all other \nbusiness and own nearly 40 percent of all firms in the United States. \nThese 8 million firms employ 18.5 million people--one in every five \nU.S. workers--and contribute $2.3 trillion to the economy. The Small \nBusiness Administration has created programs, such as the women's \nbusiness centers, which have been very effective in promoting woman \nbusiness ownership. We must ensure that these programs continue to \nreceive strong support in Congress.\n  The Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 will provide \nthe\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nfunds necessary to continue this successful program. It will allow \nwomen's business centers that have completed five year funding to apply \nfor additional funding, and it will also increase the authorization for \nFY 2000 and FY 2001 from $11 million to $12 million a year. Our goal is \nto help sustain existing centers, while continuing to create new \ncenters.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation, \nand I look forward to its early enactment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the second year in a row as an \noriginal co-sponsor of legislation increasing the authorization for the \nSmall Business Administration women's business center program. These \ncenters provide important management, marketing, and financial advice \nto women-owned small businesses.\n  Mr. President, this program finances a number of very important \ninitiatives at the state and local levels; measures that have proven \ncrucial to women struggling to enter the job world and to start their \nown businesses. These initiatives have changed the lives of a \nsignificant number of women in Michigan and throughout the United \nStates.\n  For example, two women's business centers in Michigan are leading the \nway toward preparing and advancing women in the business field. Ann \nArbor's Women's Initiative for Self-Employment, or WISE, program \nprovides low-income women with the tools and resources they need to \nbegin and expand businesses. The WISE program also provides a \ncomprehensive package of business training, personal development \nworkshops, credit counseling, start-up and expansion financing, \nbusiness counseling and mentoring. In addition, Grand Rapids' \nOpportunities for Women, or GROW, provides career counseling and \ntraining for women in western Michigan. GROW provides essential job \npreparedness with basic business training and assistance in obtaining \nmore specialized instruction.\n  Mr. President, I salute the good people at WISE and GROW for their \nhard work in helping the women of Michigan. These programs create and \nexpand business opportunities, fight against poverty, increase incomes, \nstabilize families, develop skills, and spark community renewal. If we \nare to maintain and increase revitalization of troubled areas and the \nempowerment of women we must continue to provide targeted funding for \nthese types of assistance programs.\n  For these reasons, I support the Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999. Because the Small Business Administration's \nwomen's business centers program makes it possible for women to build \nproductive lives for themselves and their families, I believe it \ndeserves the increased funding it needs to expand its services. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for Mr. Moynihan (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Leahy)):\n  S. 792. A bill to amend title IV of the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 to provide States with the \noption to allow legal immigrant pregnant women, children, and blind or \ndisabled medically needy individuals to be eligible for medical \nassistance under the medicaid program, and for other purposes.\n\n\n             The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Fairness for \nLegal Immigrants Act of 1999, a bill to restore to legal immigrants \neligibility for a number of safety net benefits denied to them by the \nPersonal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of \n1996. I am glad to be joined by my colleagues Senators Graham, Kennedy, \nDurbin, Feinstein, Wellstone, and Leahy.\n  The provisions of the 1996 law concerning legal immigrants were based \non the false premise that such immigrants are a burden to us all. On \nthe contrary. A recent comprehensive study by the National Academy of \nSciences concluded that immigration actually benefits the U.S. economy. \nIn fact, the study found that the average legal immigrant contributes \n$1,800 more in taxes than he or she receives in government benefits.\n  Many Americans may not realize this, but legal immigrants pay income \nand payroll taxes. And without continued legal immigration, the long-\nterm financial condition of Social Security and Medicare would be \nworsened. It is in our interest to see that these immigrant families \nhave healthy children, enough to eat, and support if they become \ndisabled. And it is not merely wise, it is just. These immigrants have \ncome here under the rules we have established and they have abided by \nthose rules. If harm should befall them, it is right to extend a hand.\n  The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act contains several provisions. \nFirst, it would permit states to provide Medicaid coverage to poor \nlegal immigrant pregnant women and children, as well as coverage under \nthe new Child Health insurance program (CHIP) for legal immigrant \nchildren, whenever they arrive in the United States. Under current law, \nstates are not allowed to extend such health care coverage--which is so \nimportant for the development of healthy children--to families who have \ncome to the U.S. after August 22, 1996, until the families have been \nhere for five years. Five years is a very long time in the life of a \nchild. It is common knowledge, emphasized by recent research, that \naccess to health care is essential for early childhood development. We \nshould, at a minimum, permit states to extend coverage to all poor \nlegal immigrant children, no matter when they have arrived here. This \nbuilds upon our recent achievements in promoting health care for \nchildren--legal immigrant children should not be neglected in these \nefforts.\n  The bill also permits states to restore Medicaid coverage to certain \nlegal immigrants in nursing homes. These individuals would be eligible \nfor states' ``medically needy'' Medicaid coverage if they were \ncitizens, having ``spent down'' their income and assets in nursing \nhomes to the point of destitution. Several states continue to pay \nnursing homes for these frail seniors without federal support. We \nshould do our share to care for them.\n\n  Next, the bill restores Supplemental Security Income (SSI) \neligibility for legal immigrants who have come to the U.S. after August \n22, 1996, and have since then, unfortunately, become disabled. While it \nwould be preferable to restore full SSI eligibility for these legal \nimmigrants, at this time we propose only that the disabled be again \neligible for SSI, because they are the population most in need. A \nmodicum of a safety net. We have made great strides in assisting the \ndisabled in this country in recent years. We should not then, \ndeliberately, refuse aid to individuals who have come to our nation \nlawfully and then suffered a disability. The bill also completes the \nprocess, begun in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, of restoring SSI \neligibility to elderly pre-1996 legal immigrants.\n  Fourth, since the 1996 welfare law was enacted we have been \nsuccessful in restoring a limited amount of food stamp eligibility for \nthe most vulnerable legal immigrants--children, the disabled, the \nelderly. A Physicians for Human Rights survey in 1998 found that almost \n80 percent of immigrant households suffered from limited or uncertain \navailability of nutritious foods, and that immigrant households \nreported ``severe hunger'' at a rate more than 10 times that of the \ngeneral population. While this survey was conducted before the limited \nrestoration of food stamp eligibility in 1998, it suggests the \nmagnitude of the hunger problem among legal immigrants. We need to do \nmore, and this bill restores food stamp eligibility to all legal \nimmigrants who were in the U.S. prior to the 1996 enactment of the \nwelfare law.\n  Finally, there is another vulnerable immigrant population for which \nwe need to do more: victims of domestic violence. The 1996 welfare law \nput severe limits on the assistance which can be provided to non-\ncitizens suffering from domestic abuse, particularly if they came to \nthe U.S. after August 22, 1996. This legislation will expand the \ncircumstances under which immigrant victims of domestic violence are \neligible for Medicaid and TANF assistance, and restores eligibility for \nfood stamps and SSI. These programs provide essential resources to \nbreak the economic dependence on a violent relationship. It also \nensures that elderly legal immigrants who are abused by their children \ncan obtain access to these benefits as well.\n  Mr. President, simple decency requires us to continue to provide a\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nmeasure of a safety net to legal immigrant families. I urge the \nenactment of this legislation to ensure that we do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation and a \nsummary of it be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Health Coverage\n\n     Medicaid\n       Permits states to cover all eligible legal immigrant \n     pregnant women and children, including those who have arrived \n     in the U.S. after August 22, 1996. (Currently, states must \n     wait five years before extending such coverage to legal \n     immigrants coming to the U.S. since August 22, 1996.)\n       Permits states to extend coverage to certain ``medically \n     needy'' disabled legal immigrants not receiving SSI.\n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)\n       Permits states to cover legal immigrant children under \n     CHIP. States can cover CHIP children under either the \n     expanded Medicaid option or separate CHIP program. However, \n     to choose this CHIP option states must have first taken up \n     the option to cover poor legal immigrant children under the \n     regular (non-CHIP) Medicaid program. Under current law, legal \n     immigrant children are ineligible for CHIP.\n\n\n                                II. SSI\n\n       For pre-August 1996 legal immigrants, restores SSI \n     eligibility for those who are elderly and poor but not \n     disabled by SSI standards. This returns pre-August 1996 \n     elderly legal immigrants to the same SSI eligibility status \n     as citizens.\n       For post-August 1996 legal immigrants, restores SSI \n     eligibility for those who become disabled after entering the \n     country. Currently, such recent immigrants are ineligible for \n     SSI.\n\n\n                            III. Food Stamps\n\n       Restores eligibility for all pre-August 1996 legal \n     immigrants.\n\n\n                          IV. Other Provisions\n\n       For post-August 1996 legal immigrants suffering from \n     domestic abuse, expands the exemption from the five-year ban \n     on receiving Medicaid and TANF. It also restores their \n     eligibility for SSI and food stamps. Victims of elder abuse \n     are also covered.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nMoynihan, Kennedy, Durbin, Feinstein, Wellstone, and Leahy to introduce \nthe Fairness to Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. I commend my colleagues \nin the Senate and the House of Representatives, who are also \nintroducing this legislation today, for their efforts to restore \nbenefits to legal immigrants.\n  This legislation includes several provisions which restore important \nhealth, disability and nutrition benefits to additional categories of \nlegal immigrants. These benefits would improve the lives of many of our \nmost vulnerable, such as pregnant women and children, the elderly and \nthe disabled.\n  One of the provisions in this proposal would grant states the option \nto provide health care coverage to legal immigrant children through \nMedicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)--in \nessence eliminating the arbitrary designation of August 22, 1996, as \nthe cutoff date for benefits eligibility to children. The welfare \nreform legislation passed in 1996 prohibits states from covering these \nimmigrant children during their first five years in the United States. \nThis has serious consequences.\n  Children without health insurance do not get important care for \npreventable diseases. Many uninsured children are hospitalized for \nacute asthma attacks that could have been prevented, or suffer from \npermanent hearing loss from untreated ear infections. Without adequate \nhealth care, common illnesses can turn into life-long crippling \ndiseases, whereas appropriate treatment and care can help children with \ndiseases like diabetes live relatively normal lives. A lack of adequate \nmedical care will also hinder the social and educational development of \nchildren, as children who are sick and left untreated are less ready to \nlearn.\n  In addition to allowing extended coverage of legal immigrant \nchildren, this initiative aims to provide Medicaid to pregnant women \nand disabled immigrants regardless of whether they participate in \nSocial Security's Supplemental Security Income program. States would \nalso become eligible for reimbursement of costs associated with \nproviding institutional care for some elderly and disabled immigrants.\n  Another important issue addressed by this legislation is the \nexemption allowing legal immigrants who are victims of domestic abuse \nto receive assistance. At present, victims of domestic violence are \nrestricted from receiving benefits during their first five years in the \nUnited States. These individuals are most vulnerable and should not be \nsubjected to staying in a bad situation due to lack of resources.\n  In this legislation we attempt to diminish the arbitrary cutoff date \nused in the 1996 welfare law to determine the eligibility of legal \nimmigrants to benefits they desperately need. Our nation was built by \npeople who came to our shores seeking opportunity and a better life, \nand America has greatly\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nbenefitted from the talent, resourcefulness, determination, and work \nethic of many generations of legal immigrants. Time and time again, \nthey have restored our faith in the American Dream. We should not \ndiscriminate between these important members of our community based on \nnothing more than an arbitrary date.\n  I hope that with the help of my colleagues in Congress we will be \nable to rectify the discrimination suffered by individuals who have \nlegally entered our country, who pay taxes, who serve in the military, \nand who add to the fabric of this nation. As our nation enters what \npromises to be a dynamic century, the United States needs a prudent, \nfair immigration policy to ensure that avenues of refuge and \nopportunity remain open for those seeking freedom, justice, and a \nbetter life.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Moynihan as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999. \nThis bill takes the next, important step toward restoring benefits to \nlegal immigrants.\n  Legal immigrants are people in our communities who are in this \ncountry legally. They pay taxes and they contribute to our economy and \nsociety. Many of our parents, or grandparents, were legal immigrants \nthemselves. The 1996 welfare reform law forced this group to lose their \neligibility for various programs, including food stamps, Medicaid and \nSSI. More than 900,000 legal immigrants--including hundreds of \nthousands of children and elderly individuals--were cut from the Food \nStamp Program alone, with nothing to abate their hunger.\n  In the years since the passage of the welfare reform act, Congress \nhas correctly realized that many of the cuts went too far, and slowly \nbenefits are being restored. For instance, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act \nrestored SSI and Medicaid benefits to a narrow class of immigrants, \nrefugees and asylees.\n  Last Congress, I worked hard to include $818 million in the \nAgricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to \nrestore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This \nlegislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled \nor elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United \nStates prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp \neligibility time limits--from 5 years to 7 years--for refugees and \nasylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong refugees \nwho aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also covered, as \nwere children residing in the United States prior to August 22, 1996.\n  Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility \nto children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not \nreceiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of \nhunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp \nProgram? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture reported that participation among children \nliving with parents who are legal immigrants fell significantly faster \nthan children living with native-born parents. It appears that \nrestrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the participation of \ntheir children. That is a disturbing development that must be \nrectified, and the legislation we are introducing today would go a long \nway toward making the situation right by restoring food stamp \neligibility to all legal immigrants.\n  The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would also address the \nmedical needs of legal immigrants. This bill will permit states to \noffer Medicaid coverage to all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women \nand children, as well as certain ``medically needy'' disabled legal \nimmigrants. This legislation would also restore SSI eligibility to \nelderly and poor legal immigrants who were in this country prior to \npassage of the welfare reform law.\n  Under current law, legal immigrants who suffer from domestic or elder \nabuse must wait 5 years to receive Medicaid, TANF, SSI and food stamp \nbenefits if they entered the United States after August 1996. The \nFairness for Legal Immigrants Act of 1999 would amend this law so that \nthese victims would not have to wait to receive assistance.\n  I am proud to cosponsor the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act of \n1999. It is a needed bill that will help fill some of the continuing \ngaps left by the welfare reform law. I look forward to working with \nSenator Moynihan and all members of the Senate to restore Medicaid, \nSSI, and food stamp benefits to legal immigrants in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Frist, Mr. Burns, \n        and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 795. A bill to amend the Fastener Quality Act to strengthen the \nprotection against the sale of mismarked, misrepresented, and \ncounterfeit fasteners and eliminate unnecessary requirements, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            the fastener quality act amendments act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fastener Quality \nAct Amendments Act of 1999. This bill represents major revisions to the \noriginal Fastener Quality Act as passed in 1990.\n  Every year billions of special high-strength bolts, screws, and other \nfasteners are sold in the United States which carry grade \nidentification markings. The markings indicate that the fasteners \nconform to specifications set by consensus standards organizations. \nThese grade-marked fasteners are used in critical applications like \naircraft, automobiles, and highway bridges where failure of a fastener \ncould jeopardize public safety.\n  In 1998, the Congress passed legislation (P.L. 105-234) delaying \nimplementation of the Fastener Quality Act to allow the Secretary of \nCommerce to conduct a review of changes in fastener manufacturing \nprocesses and the existence of other regulatory programs covering \nfasteners. The review was submitted to the Congress on February 24, \n1999, in coordination with several other Federal agencies which have \npublic safety responsibilities including the Defense Industrial Supply \nCenter, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal \nAviation Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  This bill reflects the findings and recommendations of that report. \nThe bill's content further represents discussions between both the \nSenate Commerce Committee and the House Science Committee, the \nDepartment of Commerce, and private industry representatives. Mr. \nPresident, let me note that if these revisions to the Fastener Quality \nAct are not implemented into law by June 24 of this year, the Secretary \nof Commerce will have no other choice but to implement the Act as \noriginally passed in 1990. Therefore, several of the nation's key \nindustries may be brought to a halt due to lack of certified fasteners. \nThe impact of such a slow down would be disastrous both economically \nand in terms of continuous flow of products and services to maintain \nour current way of life.\n  The bill defines fasteners as ``a metallic screw, nut, bolt, or stud \nhaving internal or external threads, with a nominal diameter of one-\nfourth inch or greater, or a load-indicating washer, that is through-\nhardened or represented as meeting through-hardening, and that is grade \nidentification marked or represented as meeting a consensus standard \nthat requires grade identification marking.'' This definition \nsubstantially reduces the scope of covered fasteners under the Act.\n  The bill also establishes a hotline in which the public may notify \nthe Department of Commerce of alleged violations of the Fastener \nQuality Act. It requires record keeping for a period of five years, \ninstead of the previous ten years, via both traditional and electronic \nmeans.\n  To address current inventory concerns, the Act will be applicable \nonly to fasteners fabricated 180 days after the enactment of this bill.\n  Furthermore, in cases of fasteners manufactured to a consensus \nstandard or standards that require end-of-line testing, the testing is \nto be performed by an accredited laboratory. This accredited laboratory \nrequirement shall not take effect until two years after enactment of \nthis Act.\n  Therefore, I, along with my co-sponsors, urge the members of this \nbody to support this bill and to provide the needed legislation which \nwill allow several key industries in this country continuous operation \nin a safe and responsible manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Chafee,\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\n        Mr. Specter, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 796. A bill to provide for full parity with respect to health \ninsurance coverage for certain severe biologically-based mental \nillnesses and to prohibit limits on the number of mental illness-\nrelated hospital days and outpatient visits that are covered for all \nmental illnesses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n             Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I rise with great pleasure to \nintroduce the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999. I also \nthank Senator Wellstone, my cosponsor, and the other Senators who have \nalready joined me in an effort to make this case. This will say to the \ninsurance companies and the businesses of America, unless they have 25 \nor fewer employees, their insurance coverage of their employees and \ntheir employees' families, if there is going to be mental illness or \nmental disease coverage, they will have to, as to severe illnesses, \nhave coverage with full parity. As to other mental illnesses, they will \nhave to stop trying to get around the parity law by cutting some of the \ncopays and the like. This will prohibit that.\n  Essentially, we are going to take a piece of America that is \ncurrently discriminated against in health care because those Americans \ndo not have a disease that is a disease of the heart but have a disease \nof the brain. We now can define it sufficiently that there is no reason \nto cover one and not the other, and in the process we will stop \ndiscriminating against about 10 million American families.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with great pleasure and excitement to \nintroduce the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999. I would \nalso like to thank Senator Wellstone for once again joining me to \ncosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  The human brain is the organ of the mind and just like the other \norgans of our body, it is subject to illness. And just as illnesses to \nour other organs require treatment, so too do illnesses of the brain.\n  Medical science is in an era where we can accurately diagnose mental \nillnesses and treat those afflicted so they can be productive. I would \nask then, why with this evidence would we not cover these individuals \nand treat their illnesses like any other disease?\n  We should not. So, I would submit there should not be a difference in \nthe coverage provided by insurance companies for mental health benefits \nand medical benefits.\n  The introduction of this bill marks a historic opportunity for us to \ntake the next step toward mental health parity. As my colleagues know, \nthis is an issue I have a long involvement with and I would like to \nbegin with a few observations.\n  I believe that we have made great strides in providing parity for the \ncoverage of mental illness. However, mental illness continues to exact \na heavy toll on many, many lives.\n  Even though we know so much more about mental illness, it can still \nbring devastating consequences to those it touches; their families, \ntheir friends, and their loved ones. These individuals and families not \nonly deal with the societal prejudices and suspicions hanging on from \nthe past, but they also must contend with unequal insurance coverage.\n  I would submit the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 is a good first \nstart, but the act is also not working. While there may be adherence to \nthe letter of the law, there are certainly violations of the spirit of \nthe law. For instance, ways are being found around the law by placing \nlimits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient visits.\n  That is why I believe it is time for a change.\n  Some will immediately say we cannot afford it or that inclusion of \nthis treatment will cost too much. But, I would first direct them to \nthe results of the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996. That law contains \na provision allowing companies to no longer comply if their costs \nincrease by more than 1 percent.\n  And do you know how many companies have opted out because their costs \nhave increased by more than 1 percent? Only four companies out of all \nthe companies throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, with that in mind I would like to share a couple of \nfacts about mental illness with my colleagues:\n  Within the developed world, including the United States, 4 of the 10 \nleading causes of disability for individuals over the age of 5 are \nmental disorders.\n  In the order of prevalence the disorders are major depression, \nschizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n  Disability always has a cost and the direct cost to the United States \nper year for respiratory disease is $99 billion, cardiovascular disease \nis $160 billion, and finally $148 billion for mental illness.\n  One in every five people--more than 40 million adults--in this Nation \nwill be afflicted by some type of mental illness.\n  Nearly 7.5 million children and adolescents, or 12 percent, suffer \nfrom one or more mental disorders.\n  Schizophrenia alone is 50 times more common than cystic fibrosis, 60 \ntimes more common than muscular dystrophy and will strike between 2 and \n3 million Americans.\n  Let us also look at the efficacy of treatment for individuals \nsuffering from certain mental illnesses, especially when compared with \nthe success rates of treatments for other physical ailments. For a long \ntime, many who are in this field--especially on the insurance side--\nhave behaved as if you get far better results for angioplasty then you \ndo for treatments for bipolar illness.\n  Treatment for bipolar disorders--this is, those disorders \ncharacterized by extreme lows and extreme highs--have an 80-percent \nsuccess rate if you get treatment, both medicine and care. \nSchizophrenia, the most dreaded of mental illnesses, has a 60-percent \nsuccess rate in the United States today if treated properly. Major \ndepression has a 65-percent success rate.\n  Let's compare those success rates to several important surgical \nprocedures that everybody thinks we ought to be doing: Angioplasty has \na 41-percent success rate; atherectomy has a 52-percent success rate.\n  I would now like to take a minute to discuss the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 1999. The bill seeks a very simple goal: (1) \nprovide full parity for severe biologically based mental illnesses; (2) \nprohibit limits on the number of covered hospital days and outpatient \nvisits; and (3) eliminate the Mental Health Parity Act's sunset \nprovision.\n  The bill would provide full parity for the following mental \nillnesses: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive \ncompulsive and severe panic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, \nautism, and other severe and disability mental disorders.\n  Like the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, the bill does not require \na health plan to provide coverage for alcohol and substance abuse \nbenefits. Moreover, the bill does not mandate the coverage of mental \nhealth benefits, rather the bill only applies if the plan already \nprovides coverage for mental health benefits.\n  In conclusion, the bill expands full parity to those suffering from a \nsevere biologically based mental illness and it closes a loophole in \nthe Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 by prohibiting limits on the \nnumber of covered hospital days and outpatient visits and I would urge \nmy colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health Equitable \n     Treatment Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Mental \nHealth Equitable Treatment Act of 1999, a bit that will ensure that \nprivate health insurance companies provide the same level of coverage \nfor mental illness as they do for other diseases. This bill will be a \nmajor step toward ending the discrimination against people who suffer \nfrom mental illness.\n  For too long, mental illness has been stigmatized, or viewed as a \ncharacter flaw, rather than as the serious disease that it is. A cloak \nof secrecy has surrounded this disease, and people with mental illness \nare often ashamed and afraid to seek treatment, for fear that they will \nbe seen as admitting a weakness in character. We have all seen \nportrayals of mentally ill people as somehow different, as dangerous, \nor as frightening. Such stereotypes only reinforce the biases against \npeople with mental illness. Can you imagine this type of portrayal of \nsomeone who has a cardiac problem, or who happens to carry a gene that \npredisposes them to diabetes?\n  Although mental health research has well-established the biological, \ngenetic, and behavioral components of many of the forms of serious \nmental illness, the illness is still stigmatized as somehow less \nimportant or serious than other illnesses. Too often, we try to push \nthe problem away, deny coverage, or blame those with the illness for \nhaving the illness. We forget that someone with mental illness can look \njust like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is sitting \nnext to us on a plane. It can be our mother, or brother, or son, or \ndaughter. It can be one of us. We have all known someone with a serious \nmental illness, within our families or our circle of friends, or in \npublic life. Many people have courageously come forward to speak about \ntheir personal experiences with their illness, to help us all \nunderstand better the effects of this illness on a person's life, and I \ncommend them for their courage.\n  The statistics concerning mental illness, and the state of health \ncare coverage for adults and children with this disease are startling, \nand disturbing.\n  One severe mental illness affecting millions of Americans is major \ndepression. The National Institute of Mental Health, a NIH research \ninstitute, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \ndescribes serious depression as a critical public health problem. More \nthan 18 million people in the United States will suffer from a \ndepressive illness this year, and many will be unnecessarily \nincapacitated for weeks or months, because their illness goes \nuntreated. The cost to the Nation in 1990 was estimated to be between \n$30-$44 billion. The suffering of depressed people and their families \nis immeasurable.\n  Depressive disorders are not the normal ups and downs everyone \nexperiences. They are illnesses that affect mood, body, behavior, and \nmind. Depressive disorders interfere with individual and family \nfunctioning. Without treatment, the person with a depressive disorder \nis often unable to fulfill the responsibilities of spouse or parent, \nworker or employer, friend or neighbor.\n  Available medications and psychological treatments, alone or in \ncombination, can help 80 percent of those with depression. But without \nadequate treatment, future episodes of depression may continue or \nworsen in severity. Yet, the steady decline in the quality and breadth \nof health care coverage is truly disturbing.\n  The results of a major survey of employer-provided health plans was \npublished in 1998 by the Hay Group, an independent benefits consulting \nfirm. The Hay Report showed a major decline in benefits in the last \ndecade:\n  Employer-provided mental health benefits decreased 54%--while \nbenefits for general health decreased only 7%;\n  Even before this erosion occurred, mental health benefits made up \nonly 6% of total medical benefits paid by employers. Today--that has \nbeen cut in half--it is down to 3%;\n  The number of plans restricting hospitalization for mental disorders \nincreased by 20%;\n  Descriptions of benefit limits themselves are misleading. Although \nplans may say that they allow 30 days for hospitalization, this is \nrarely approved. In 1996, the average length of stay was 8\\1/2\\ days, \ndown from 17 in 1991.\n  In 1988, most insurance plans allowed 50 therapy sessions per years. \nIn 1997, the average number was 20.\n  A 1998 study published by Health Affairs found that between 1991 and \n1995, HMO enrollees were twice as likely to encounter limits on \npsychiatric visits, and about three times as likely to have separate, \nand higher, copayments than for general medical health care.\n  No one, of course, expects coverage of any illness to cost nothing. \nBut what we do know is that fears of spiraling costs for mental health \ntreatment are unfounded. Studies from HHS that have examined the \neffects of mental health and substance abuse treatment parity have \nshown that full parity for these benefits would be just slightly higher \nthan current premiums. Most reports, like the one requested by Congress \nfrom the National Advisory Mental Health Counsel, showed that when \nmental health coverage is managed, either moderately or tightly, that \npremium increases can be as low as 1%.\n  These costs are so low. And the cost of NOT treating is so high--\nespecially when one looks at the toll that untreated mental illness \ntakes on individuals, families, employers, corporations, social service \nsystems, and criminal justice systems. I have seen first hand in the \njuvenile corrections system what happens when mental illness is \ncriminalized, when youth with mental illness are incarcerated for \nexhibiting symptoms of their illness. To treat ill people as criminals \nis outrageous is outrageous and immoral. We must make treatment for \nthis illness as available and as routine as treatment for any other \ndisease. The discrimination must stop.\n  Our bill includes parity for hospital day and outpatient visits for \nall mental illnesses. Additionally, for many of the most severe adult \nand child mental illnesses, the bill establishes full parity, i.e., \nparity for copayments, deductibles, hospital day, and outpatient visit \nbenefits. The bill also provides protection for non-physician \nproviders, and for states with stronger parity bills; it also includes \na small business exemption, and eliminates the sunset provision and the \n1% exemption from the 1996 Mental Health Parity Act. Covered services \ninclude inpatient treatment; non-hospital residential treatment; \noutpatient treatment, including screening and assessment, medication \nmanagement, individual, group and family counseling; and prevention \nservices, including health education and individual and group \ncounseling to encourage the reduction of risk factors for mental \nillness.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999 provides for major \nimprovements in coverage for mental illness by private health insurers. \nIt does not require that mental health benefits be part of a health \nbenefits package, but establishes a requirement for parity in coverage \nfor those plans that offer mental health benefits. This bill goes a \nlong way toward our bipartisan goal: that mental illness be treated \nlike any other disease in health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, the Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 1999 is \ndesigned to take a large step toward ending the suffering of those with \nmental illness who have been unfairly discriminated against in their \nhealth coverage. We must end this discrimination.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Domenici and Wellstone, in introducing the Mental Health \nEquitable Treatment Act of 1999, and I applaud them for their \nleadership on this issue. This legislation is an important step towards \nensuring that people with mental illness have access to the care they \nneed.\n  For too long, insurance plans have treated patients with mental \nillnesses differently than those with physical illnesses. However, \nresearch has proven the biological origins of mental illness. It is now \ntime to bring coverage of mental illness into the 20th century. There \nis no rational basis for excluding or limiting coverage for such \nconditions; doing so is patently discriminatory. Enactment of the \nMental Health Parity Act in 1996, which I cosponsored,\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nwas the first step in correcting this disparity. This legislation \nbuilds upon the 1996 law by adding some important new protections.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island, over 28,000 people are suffering \nfrom severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder \nand major depression. These disorders can be as threatening to the \nhealth of the patient as physical illnesses, such as cancer or AIDS. \nDiscriminatory coverage restrictions or cost-sharing requirements--such \nas limits on the number of therapy visits or disparate co-payments--\nplace an undue hardship on these patients at a time when they require \nmedical care.\n  If left untreated, mental illnesses can result in more serious \ndisability or even death. This legislation takes another step in \nhelping to prevent such tragedies. I hope we one day will be able to \nend discrimination in the coverage of all mental illnesses. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 797. A bill to apply the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 to \nthe International Olympic Committee; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n         International Olympic Committee Integrity Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for decades Americans have watched with \nawe and amazement at the invigorating achievements of the world's \nOlympic athletes. When Gail Devers and Wendy Williams won Olympic \nmedals, they inspired their hometown of Bridgeton, Missouri. When Nikki \nZiegelmeyer won a speed skating Olympic medal, her hometown of Imperial \nMissouri cheered. And when Ray Armstead helped win the 4 by 400 meter \nrelay, St. Louis was proud of its native son.\n  Gail, Wendy, Nikki and Ray won through sheer talent, toil and sweat. \nThey pursued Olympic fame with honor and integrity, competed fairly, \nand won with dignity. Their athletic grace on the world stage helped \nspark dreams of future Olympic glory in young people today.\n  But now the Olympic torch has been dimmed, and the five Olympic rings \nhave been tarnished by bribes and graft given to secure victory at any \nprice. The victory pursued with moneyed vengeance was not in athletic \ncompetition. In this scandal, the Olympic athletes are the innocents, \nyet the scandal tarnishes their achievement. The villains at ground \nzero are those who decided where the games were to be played and those \nwho hosted or will host the games. Such irony: Scandal torches the \ncompetition to host the world's most competitive and honorable games.\n  The facts are bleak--in their attempts to land the 2002 Olympics, \nleaders of the Salt Lake City Olympic Committee spent $4 million on \ngifts, scholarships, cash payments and other inducements for \nInternational Olympic Committee members; allegations by senior Olympic \nofficials have raised questions about payments that may have been made \nto influence the selection of other Olympic cities; the Justice \nDepartment has launched a criminal investigation into payments by Salt \nLake City Olympic Officials; an independent investigation conducted by \nformer Senator George Mitchell and former White House Chief of Staff \nKen Duberstein concluded that receipt of ``valuables'' by International \nOlympic Committee members has become ``widespread, notorious, \ncontinuous, unchecked and ingrained in the way Olympic business is \ndone.''; and the International Olympic Committee has expelled six of \nits members for corruption.\n  Now that these problems have been exposed to the world, the question \nis what should be done to stop this bribery from destroying the Olympic \nmovement.\n  Today, Senator McCain took a step in the right direction by convening \na hearing in the Senate Commerce Committee. I regret the decision by \nthe President of the International Olympic Committee, Juan Antonio \nSamaranch, to not attend that hearing. And I take exception with the \ncomments of one of the IOC witnesses who told the Associated Press, and \nI quote, ``What I'm afraid is that they're doing it for political \nadvantage and not for the benefit of anybody except for themselves. \nThey just get on a soap box and preach their righteousness.''\n  Well, it is crystal clear to me that Congress should, for our Olympic \nathletes and the hometowns they represent, use soap and scrubbing and \nscrutiny to clean up this mess.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that is a vital \nstep in restoring integrity to the IOC host city bidding process. The \nInternational Olympic Committee Integrity Act will expand the coverage \nof the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to include the IOC. The FCPA \nprohibits U.S. businesses from offering bribes or kickbacks to foreign \nofficials. The U.S. Olympic Committee has asked President Clinton to \nissue an executive order to cover the IOC under the FCPA. To date, the \nPresident has not done so. My bill accomplishes what the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee has requested and that is to outlaw the gifts and payments \nsuch as those that have been made in the past to International Olympic \nCommittee officials.\n  In addition, I am keeping open the option of removing the federal tax \ndeduction that federal tax law provides for contributions made to the \nInternational Olympic Committee. I will review the testimony of IOC \nwitnesses from today's Commerce Committee hearing before making a final \ndecision.\n  In closing, Mr. President, we should give credit where it is due. \nWhen faced with a serious mistake that has been made, a test of \ncharacter is whether you do the next right thing. Once the Salt Lake \nCity problem was discovered, officials at the U.S. Olympic Committee \nresponded quickly. The USOC asked for the Mitchell-Duberstein \ninvestigation I mentioned earlier. The USOC has implemented a series of \ninternal and external reforms of procedures used to apply for hosting \nthe Olympic Games. The USOC has strengthened ethics rules, and created \na compliance officer to monitor U.S. bid cities. And, in the future, \nall honoraria received by committee members must be forfeited to the \ngroup's chief financial officer.\n  We have much more to do in order to restore confidence and dignity to \nthe Olympics. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the \nInternational Olympic Committee Integrity Act. We owe it to Gail \nDevers, Wendy Williams, Nikki Ziegelmeyer, Ray Armstead and all future \nOlympic athletes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Abraham, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 798. A bill to promote electronic commerce by encouraging and \nfacilitating the use of encryption in interstate commerce consistent \nwith the protection of national security, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  Introduction of the ``PROTECT'' Act\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as the Members of the Senate know, for \nseveral years I have advocated the enactment of legislation that would \nfacilitate the use of strong encryption. Beginning in the 104th \nCongress, I have introduced legislation that would ensure that the \nprivate sector continues to take the lead in developing innovative \nproducts to protect the security and confidentiality of our electronic \ninformation including the ability to export such American products.\n  I am pleased to rise today to introduce with my Chairman, Senator \nMcCain, the PROTECT ACT of 1999 (Promote Reliable On Line Transactions \nTo Encourage Commerce and Trade). The bill reflects a number of \ndiscussions we have had this year about the importance of encryption in \nthe digital age to promote electronic commerce, secure our confidential \nbusiness and sensitive personal information, prevent crime and protect \nour national security by protecting the commercial information systems \nand electronic networks upon which America's critical infrastructures \nincreasingly rely. I am extremely pleased to join with him in \nintroducing this important legislation.\n  While this bill differs in important respects from the PRO-CODE \nlegislation I introduced in the previous Congress, I do think it \naccomplishes a number of very important objectives. Specifically, the \nbill:\n  Prohibits domestic controls;\n  Guarantees that American industry will continue to be able to come up \nwith innovative products;\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\n  Immediately decontrols encryption products using key lengths of 64 \nbits or less;\n  Permits the immediate exportability of 128 bit encryption in \nrecoverable encryption products and in all encryption products to a \nbroad group of legitimate and responsible commercial users and to users \nin allied countries;\n  Recognizes the futility of unilateral export controls on mass market \nproducts and where there are foreign alternatives and so permits the \nimmediate exportability of strong encryption products whenever a \npublic-private advisory board and the Secretary of Commerce determines \nthat they are generally available, publicly available, or available \nfrom foreign suppliers;\n  Directs NIST to complete establishment of the Advanced Encryption \nStandard with 128 bit key lengths (the DES successor) by January 1, \n2002 (and ensures that it is led by the private sector and open to \npublic comment); and\n  Decontrols thereafter products incorporating the AES or its \nequivalent.\n  Today, we are in a world that is characterized by the fact that \nnearly everyone has a computer and that those computers are, for the \nmost part, connected to one another. In light of that fact, it is \nbecoming more and more important to ensure that our communications over \nthese computer networks are conducted in a secure way. It is no longer \npossible to say that when we move into the information age, we'll \nsecure these networks, because we are already there. We use computers \nin our homes and businesses in a way that couldn't have been imagined \n10 years ago, and these computers are connected through networks, \nmaking it easier to communicate than ever before. This phenomenon holds \nthe promise of transforming life in States like Montana, where health \ncare and state-of-the-art education can be delivered over networks to \npeople located far away from population centers. These new technologies \ncan improve the lives of real people, but only if the security of \ninformation that moves over these networks is safe and reliable.\n\n  The problem today is that our computer networks are not as secure as \nthey could be; it is fairly easy for amateur hackers to break into our \nnetworks. They can intercept information; they can steal trade secrets \nand intellectual property; they can alter medical records; the list is \nendless. One solution to this, of course, is to let individuals and \nbusinesses alike to take steps to secure that information. Encryption \nis one technology that accomplishes that.\n  I am proud that today I have been able to join with Senator McCain to \nintroduce this legislation which will enable Americans to use the \nInternet with confidence and security.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is the third Congress in which I have \nintroduced and sponsored legislation to update our country's encryption \npolicies. My objective has been to bolster the competitive edge of our \nNation's high-tech companies, allow Americans to protect their online \nand electronically stored confidential information, trade secrets and \nintellectual property, and promote global electronic commerce. I am \npleased to join Senators McCain, Wyden and Burns, in this continuing \neffort with the ``Promote Reliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage \nCommerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999.''\n  In May 1996, I chaired a hearing on the Administration's ill-fated \nClipper Chip key escrow encryption program that drove home the need for \nrelaxed export controls on strong encryption. U.S. export controls on \nencryption technology were having a clear negative effect on the \ncompetitiveness of American hi-tech companies. Moreover, these controls \nwere discouraging the use of strong encryption domestically since \nmanufacturers generally made and marketed one product for both for \nexport and for domestic use here. At that hearing I heard testimony \nabout 340 foreign encryption products that were available worldwide--\nincluding for import into the United States--155 of which employed \nencryption in a strength that American companies were prohibited from \nexporting. That number has grown exponentially. As of December, 1997, \nthere were 656 foreign encryption products available from 474 vendors \nin 29 different foreign countries.\n  American companies certainly do not enjoy a monopoly on encryption \nknow-how. The U.S. Commerce Department's National Institute for \nStandard and Technology (NIST) is developing an Advanced Encryption \nStandard (AES) to update the U.S. Data Encryption Standard (DES), the \ncurrent global encryption standard. Only 5 of the 15 AES candidate \nalgorithms submitted to NIST for evaluation were proposed from American \ncompanies or individuals. The remaining proposals came from Australia, \nCanada, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, United Kingdom, Israel, Norway, \nand Belgium.\n  In the 104th Congress, I introduced encryption legislation on March \n5, 1996, with Senators Burns, Dole, Murray and others, to help \nAmericans better protect their online privacy and allow American \ncompanies to compete more effectively in the global hi-tech \nmarketplace. Specifically, the ``Encrypted Communications Privacy Act \nof 1996,'' S. 1587, would have relaxed export controls on strong \nencryption and promoted the widespread use of encryption to protect the \nsecurity, confidentiality and privacy of online communications and \nstored electronic data. This bill would have legislatively confirmed \nthe freedom of Americans to use and sell in the United States any \nencryption technology that most appropriately met their privacy and \nsecurity needs. In addition, this bill would have relaxed export \ncontrols to allow the export of encryption products when comparable \nstrength encryption was available from foreign suppliers, and \nencryption products that were generally available or in the public \ndomain.\n\n  In the years since that bill was introduced, the Administration has \nmade some positive changes in its export policies. In October 1996, the \nAdministration allowed the export of 56-bit DES encryption by companies \nthat agreed to develop key recovery systems. This policy was supposed \nto sunset in two years. I strongly criticized this policy at the time, \nwarning that this ``sunset'' provision ``does not promote our high-tech \nindustries overseas.'' In fact, when the time came last year to return \nto the old export regime that allowed the export of only 40-bit \nencryption, the Administration relented and continues to permit the \nexport of 56-bit encryption, with the condition of developing \nencryption programs with recoverable keys.\n  The proposals I made in 1996 made sense then, and versions of these \nprovisions are incorporated into the PROTECT Act today.\n  Specifically, the PROTECT Act would provide immediate relief by \nallowing the export of encryption using key lengths of up to 64 bits. \nIn addition, stronger encryption (more than 64-bit key lengths) would \nbe exportable under a license exception, upon determination by a new \nEncryption Export Advisory Board that the product or service is \ngenerally available, publicly available or a comparable product is \navailable from a foreign supplier. This determination is subject to \napproval by the Secretary of Commerce and to override by the President \non national security grounds.\n  This relief is important since the time and effort to crack 56-bit \nDES encryption is getting increasingly short. Indeed, earlier this \nyear, a group of civilian computer experts broke a 56-bit encrypted \nmessage in less than 24 hours, beating a July 1998 effort that took 56 \nhours.\n  The breaking of 56-bit encryption comes as no surprise to those doing \nbusiness, engaging in research, or conducting their personal affairs \nonline. While 56-bit encryption may still serve as the global standard, \nthis will not be the situation for much longer. 128-bit encryption is \nnow the preferred encryption strength.\n  For example, in order to access online account information from the \nThrift Savings Plan for Federal Employees, Members and congressional \nstaff must use 128-bit encryption. If you use weaker encryption, a \nscreen pops up to say ``you cannot have access to your account \ninformation because your Web browser does not have Secure Socket Layer \n(SSL) and 128-bit encryption (the strong U.S./Canada-only version).''\n\n  Likewise, the Department of Education has set up a Web site that \nallows prospective students to apply for student financial aid online. \nSignificantly, the Education's Department\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nstates that ``[t]o achieve maximum protection we recommend you use 128-\nbit encryption.''\n  These are just a couple examples of government agencies or associated \norganizations directing or urging Americans to use 128-bit encryption. \nWe should assume that people in other countries are getting the same \ndirections and recommendations. Unfortunately, while American companies \ncan fill the demand for this strong encryption here, they are not \npermitted to sell it abroad for use by people in other countries.\n  Significantly, the PROTECT Act would permit the export of 128-bit \n(and higher) AES products by January 1, 2002. While not providing \nrelief as quickly as I have urged in other encryption legislation, \nincluding the E-PRIVACY Act, S. 2067, in the last Congress, this bill \nmoves in the right direction, and provides a sunset for unworkable \nencryption export controls. In my view, this bill would give most \nInternet users access to the strongest tools they need to protect their \nprivacy starting in 2002--a long time by Net standards, but time our \nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies say they need to address the \nglobal proliferation of strong encryption.\n  Encryption is a critical tool for Americans to protect their privacy \nand safeguard their confidential electronic information, such as credit \ncard numbers, personal health information, or private messages, from \nonline thieves and snoops. This is important to encourage the continued \nrobust growth of electronic commerce. A March 1999 report of the \nVermont Internet Commerce Research Project that I commissioned analyzed \nbarriers to Internet commerce in my home State, and found that ``the \nstrongest obstacle among consumers'' was the perceived lack of \nsecurity.\n  Focusing on the export regime for encryption technology is only one \naspect, albeit an important one, in the larger debate over how best to \nprotect privacy in a digital and online environment. Legislation to \nprovide encryption export relief is a start, but we also have important \nwork to do in addressing broader privacy issues, such as establishing \nstandards for law enforcement access to decryption assistance. I look \nforward to working with Senators McCain, Wyden and Burns on passage of \nthe PROTECT Act as well as other privacy legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my esteemed colleagues, \nSenators McCain, Burns, Wyden, Leahy and Abraham in introducing \nlegislation that will encourage sales of US information technology \nproducts while at the same time protecting our national security \ninterests. The Promote Reliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage \nCommerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999 is an important first step \nthat recognizes that as the Internet becomes more of a presence in \nglobal commerce, there must be guarantees and assurances that business \nand personal information remains confidential. It also recognizes that \nthe US companies are leaders in creating the technology that serves \nthis vital purpose, and that these companies are integral to our \ngrowing economy.\n  United States information technology companies have been frustrated \nby what they perceive as too-stringent controls on the export of their \nencryption products. These controls have served a vital purpose in \nprotecting national security interests. The realities of the \nmarketplace and the technology sector, however, suggest that it time to \nloosen our grip somewhat on the export controls we impose. Although the \nUS is the leader in producing high quality, strong encryption products, \nother countries also have the ability to produce comparable products. \nWe must recognize this reality and understand that while export \ncontrols can slow the spread of encrypted products, they cannot stop \nit. Importantly, controls that do not recognize this reality put our \nsoftware industry at a disadvantage as it tries to compete in the \nglobal market.\n  Nothing, of course, is more important than our national security. \nThis legislation maintains strong guidelines to ensure that encryption \ntechnology is not sold to countries that pose a threat to our national \nsecurity. It puts in place a number of reasonable checks to make \ncertain that US encryption technology does not get into the wrong \nhands. At the same time, it takes into consideration that where \nencryption products are generally or publicly available, we should not \nunduly limit their sale to responsible entities in NATO, OECD or ASEAN \ncountries. To do so would not only cause potential harm to US industry, \nbut it could also have an unintended negative impact on our own \nsecurity.\n  I applaud Senator McCain for taking this first step towards resolving \na complicated problem. As we work through this and other legislation \nthat attempts to address the issue of encryption exports, I hope we can \nincorporate the best features into the strongest possible bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 799. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe tax brackets, eliminate the marriage penalty, allow individuals a \ndeduction for amounts paid for insurance for medical care, increase \ncontribution limits for individual retirement plans and pensions, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                               tax relief\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I offer an important piece of \nlegislation. The bill I offer today, called the American Family Tax \nRelief Act of 1999, is a modest, but important tax relief package. This \nbill is important for both substantive and symbolic reasons. \nSubstantively, this bill provides all Americans with needed tax relief. \nIf the need for tax relief isn't yet apparent to everyone, tomorrow \nwill remind all Americans of the need when they submit tax returns \nwhich reflect an ever larger percentage of their income going to the \nfederal government.\n  This bill is also important as a symbol to the American public that \nCongress remains committed to the principle of a smaller federal \ngovernment and lower taxes. We should not use the unusually good \neconomic times we enjoy as an excuse to delay providing tax relief to \nhard-working American families. No, we should instead take this \nwonderful opportunity to recommit ourselves to fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility.\n  We are already taking important steps in this regard by locking up \nthe social security trust fund to ensure its solvency. We are also \ndevoting a significant portion of the surplus to retiring publicly held \ndebt, which will reduce the drain on federal spending for interest on \nthis debt. The next step is to provide tax relief. This is a platform \nmany of us have stood upon, and is therefore a pledge we must honor. If \nwe can't provide tax cuts in good times, think how difficult it would \nbe in bad times.\n  This bill I offer today has five different components: the largest \ncomponent of this legislation would lower all individual income \ntax rates by 5%. Although this is substantially less than the 10% tax \ncut I have also supported, this modest reduction will more easily fit \nin the budget offsets after social security solvency and debt \nretirement have been addressed. By letting all Americans keep more of \ntheir income, they will be free to spend or save more of it. By now, we \nall know that the end result of this is a healthier, more robust \neconomy.\n\n  The second component would expand the lowest income tax bracket, a \ntargeted tax break for middle income tax payers. In addition to the 5% \nacross the board reduction, many middle income earners would now fall \ninto the lowest tax bracket, thereby paying even lower taxes than they \nwould under the existing tax code.\n  Third, I would repeal the marriage penalty. Last year during my \nreelection campaign, I heard from hundreds of Coloradans asking me to \nrepeal this offensive part of the tax code. I agree with all of them \nthat we need a tax code that underscores the value we place on \nencouraging families, not one that discourages or penalizes marriage. \nThis bill would do that.\n  Fourth, this bill would bring needed relief to many taxpayers by \nallowing the full deductibility of health insurance. Even folks who \ndon't meet the minimum criteria needed to itemize their deductions, \noften single folks or lower income folks, could still deduct their \nhealth insurance. This is a critical step towards providing all \nAmericans with health insurance coverage and reducing the cost of this \ncritical component of modern life.\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n  The last piece of this bill would encourage greater individual \nresponsibility for retirement planning. By allowing a taxpayer to \ncontribute more into an IRA without being taxed, more individuals will \ncontribute more to their own retirement. The end result would be less \nreliance and less strain on Social Security and other entitlement \nprograms. The more Congress can lead the way in weaning ourselves off \nof federal entitlements by encouraging individual retirement planning, \nthe more government will shrink while increasing its efficiency.\n  I conclude by inviting my colleagues to take a good look at this bill \nand work with me on reasonable changes and to support its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 800. A bill to promote and enhance public safety through the use \nof 9-1-1 as the universal emergency assistance number, further \ndeployment of wireless 9-1-1 service, support of States in upgrading 9-\n1-1 capabilities and related functions, encouragement of construction \nand operation of seamless, ubiquitous, and reliable networks for \npersonal wireless services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                           E-911 Act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about some good \nnews for a change. I want to introduce the ``E-911 Act of 1999.'' The \npurpose of this legislation is to improve 911. By linking some of the \namazing innovations in wireless technology to 911 and medical and \nemergency response professionals we bring our 911 systems into the 21st \ncentury.\n  All kinds of technologies exist today that can greatly reduce \nresponse time to emergencies and help victims get the right kind of \nmedical attention quickly. But right now these technologies are not \nconnected in ways that can be used for emergencies. That's why this \neffort to upgrade our 911 systems across the nation is so important and \nnecessary.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted \nstudies showing that crash-to-care time for fatal accidents is about a \nhalf hour in urban areas. In rural areas, which covers most of my home \nstate of Montana, that crash-to-care time almost doubles. On average, \nit takes just shy of an hour to get emergency attention to crash \nvictims in rural areas. Almost half of the serious crash victims who do \nnot receive care in that first hour die at the scene of the accident. \nThat's a scary statistic.\n  In 1997 there were 37,280 fatal motor vehicle crashes in the United \nStates--41,967 people died as a result. Of that number, 2,098 were \nchildren. Now obviously there is no piece of legislation that can \ninstantly prevent these kinds of tragedies. But there are definitely \nthings we can do to help reduce them. Upgrading our 911 response \nsystems, which this legislation promotes, is a solid step toward \npreventing many horrible tragedies.\n  Drew Dawson, who is the director of the Montana Emergency Medical \nServices Bureau and the president of the National Association of State \nEmergency Medical Services Directors, strongly supports the Wireless \nCommunications and Public Safety Act of 1999. He tells me that the bill \nwill help bring better wireless 911 coverage to Montana and will \nenhance our statewide Trauma Care System. Mr. Dawson believes this \nlegislation will help him and his emergency folks do their jobs better, \nwhich means it will help them save more lives than they already do.\n\n  I have to say a word about all of the good work that folks like Drew \nDawson in Montana and other emergency professionals do all over the \ncountry. The United States has the most skilled and dedicated group of \nmedical and emergency professionals in the world. We need to give them \nbetter tools. There is technology out there that can help these \nprofessionals and that can help all of us citizens, if, God forbid, we \never find ourselves in an emergency situation needing this kind of \nhelp. The E-911 Act of 1999 will help all of us and will make our \nemergency services even better than they are today.\n  Mr. President, Let me take a moment to summarize the important \nsections of this bill.\n  It makes Congressional findings and specifies the purpose of the Act. \nThe purpose of the Act is ``to encourage and facilitate the prompt \ndeployment throughout the United States of a seamless, ubiquitous, and \nreliable end-to-end infrastructure for communications, including \nwireless communications, to meet the Nation's public safety and other \ncommunications needs.''\n  It assigns to the Federal Communications Commission, and any agency \nor entity to which it has delegated authority under Section 251 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934, the duty to designate the number 911 as the \nuniversal emergency telephone number within the United States for \nreporting an emergency to appropriate authorities and requesting \nassistance. The universal number would apply both to wireless and \nwireline telephone service. The Commission, and any agency or entity, \nmust establish appropriate periods for geographic areas in which 911 is \nnot in use as an emergency telephone number to transition to the use of \n911.\n  It establishes a principle of parity between the wireless and \nwireline telecommunications industries in protection from liability \nfor: (1) the provision of telephone services, including 911 and \nemergency warning service, and (2) the use of 911 and emergency warning \nservice. The bill provides for wireless providers of telephone service \nto receive at least as much protection under Federal, State or local \nlaw from liability as local exchange companies receive in providing \ntelephone services. States cannot impose procedural barriers, such as \nrequiring wireless providers to file tariffs, as a condition for \nwireless providers to receive the substantive protection from liability \nfor which the legislation provides. The bill also provides for users of \nwireless 911 service to receive at least as much protection from \nliability under Federal, State or local law as users of wireline 911 \nservice receive.\n\n  It amends Section 222 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n222) to provide appropriate privacy protection for call location \ninformation concerning the user of a commercial mobile service, \nincluding such information provided by an automatic crash notification \nsystem. The provision authorizes disclosure of such information to \nemergency dispatch providers and emergency service personnel in order \nto respond to the user's call for emergency services. The provision \nalso is intended to allow disclosure of such information to the next-\nof-kin or legal guardian of a person as necessary in connection with \nthe furnishing of medical care to such person as a result of an \nemergency. Finally, the customer of a commercial mobile radio service \nmay grant broader authority (for example, in the customer's written \nsubscription agreement with the service provider) for the use of, \ndisclosure of, or access to call location information concerning users \nof the customer's commercial mobile service communications instrument \n(e.g., the customer's wireless telephone), but the customer must grant \nsuch authority expressly and in advance of such use, disclosure or \naccess.\n  It provides definitions for terms used in the legislation.\n  That is the long version of what this bill is about. The short \nversion is: it's about saving lives. Mr. President, I hope all of my \ncolleagues will join me and help pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to cosponsor and \nsupport the E-911 Act of 1999, which has been introduced by Senator \nBurns. I commend Senator Burns for his outstanding work on this \nlegislation which will help build a national wireless communications \nsystem and save lives.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure that Americans everywhere can dial \n9-1-1 to summon prompt assistance in an emergency. When a person is \nseriously injured, every second counts. In fact, medical trauma and \npublic safety professionals speak of a ``golden hour''--the first hour \nafter serious injury when the greatest percentage of lives can be \nsaved. The sooner that the seriously injured get medical help, the \ngreater the chance of survival. And prompt notification to the \nauthorities is the first critical step in getting medical assistance to \nthe injured.\n  I believe that injured Americans should be able to get emergency \nmedical assistance as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nOver 60 million Americans carry wireless telephones. Some of these \npeople own them specifically for safety reasons, in order to summon \nhelp in an emergency. Others would be willing to use their phones to \nreport emergencies to the authorities.\n  But in many parts of the country when a person who is seriously \ninjured--or a frantic bystander--calls 9-1-1 on their wireless \ntelephone, nothing happens. Although many Americans think that 9-1-1 is \nalready a national emergency number everywhere, it isn't. There are \nmany places in America where 9-1-1 isn't the right number to call for \nhelp. The rule in America ought to be uniform and simple--if you have \nan emergency wherever you are, dial 9-1-1. This bill reduces the danger \nof not knowing what number to call, by making 9-1-1 the universal \nemergency telephone number.\n  Mr. President, I also believe that we also need to tie our citizens \nthrough their wireless telephones to emergency medical centers, police \nand firefighters so that they can get lifesaving assistance even when \nthey are too injured to make a 9-1-1 call, or can make the call but \ncannot give their location. This bill supports the upgrading of 9-1-1 \nsystems so that they can deliver more information, like location and \nautomatic crash information data which will better enable emergency \nservices to reach those incapacitated by injury. This legislation also \npromotes the expansion of the areas covered by wireless telephone \nservice, so that more people can use wireless phones in an emergency. \nBecause if a wireless telephone isn't within range of a wireless tower, \na wireless call can't go through.\n  Mr. President, I would like to see an America where more people in \nmore places can call 9-1-1 and quickly get the right help in \nemergencies. This legislation will help reduce medical response time \nfor millions of Americans, by helping to make sure that people can use \ntheir wireless phones to call 9-1-1 immediately and get the ambulances \nrolling\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee on this important life-saving legislation, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 801. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe tax on beer to its pre-1991 level; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                         Repealing The Beer Tax\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \npertaining to the federal excise tax on beer.\n  Many people are not aware that they pay enormous hidden taxes when \nthey purchase any number of consumer products. The beer tax is one \nsignificant example of such a hidden tax. Bearing a disproportionate \ntax burden, forty-three percent of the cost of beer is comprised of \nboth state and federal taxes.\n  The federal government doubled its tax on beer eight years ago. \nToday, though it is one of the more regressive taxes, the 100 percent \nbeer tax increase remains as the only ``luxury tax'' enacted as part of \nthe 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. While taxes on furs, \njewelry, and yachts have been repealed through subsequent legislation, \nthe federal beer tax remains in place with continued far reaching \neffects, including the loss of as many as 50,000 industry jobs. My \nlegislation seeks to correct this inequity and will restore the level \nof federal excise tax to the pre-1991 tax rate.\n  Mr. President, I offer this bill as companion legislation to H.R. \n1366 introduced by Representative Phil English.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 801\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF 1990 TAX INCREASE ON BEER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (1) of section 5051(a) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to imposition and \n     rate of tax on beer) is amended by striking ``$18'' and \n     inserting ``$9''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Specter, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 802. A bill to provide for a gradual reduction in the loan rate \nfor peanuts, to repeal peanut quotas for the 2002 and subsequent crops, \nand to require the Secretary of Agriculture to purchase peanuts and \npeanut products for nutrition programs only at the world market price; \nto the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                  Reform of The Federal Peanut Program\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould bring common sense reform to the federal peanut commodity \nprogram. This legislation would phase out the peanut quota program over \nthree years, with the quota being eliminated in crop year 2002. I am \njoined today by several colleagues in this reform effort.\n  Under this legislation, the price support for peanuts that are grown \nfor edible consumption is gradually reduced each year from the current \nsupport price of $610 per ton to $500 per ton by 2001. In the year 2002 \nand ensuing crop years, there would be no quotas on peanuts, and the \nSecretary of Agriculture would be required to make the non-recourse \nloan available to all peanut farmers at 85 percent of their estimated \nmarket value. This measure is consistent with the non-recourse loan \nprograms available for other agriculture commodities.\n  Another component of this peanut reform bill would allow additional \npeanuts, those produced in excess of the farmer's quota poundage, to be \nused for sale to the school lunch program.\n  Mr. President, the federal peanut program, born in the 1930's during \nan era of massive change and dislocation in agriculture, is sorely out \nof place in today's agricultural sector. Other farm commodities are \nseeking new export opportunities abroad, building new markets and \nhelping to improve our national balance of trade, however, the peanut \nindustry is building new barriers to protect itself. The quota system \nstifles freedom for farmers, and it fosters a set of economic \nexpectations that cannot be sustained without continued government \nintervention. Moreover, failure to reform this program costs consumers \nbetween $300-500 million annually, adding to the cost of feeding \nprograms for low-income Americans.\n  In short, this program must be changed. As we have learned from \nchanges made to other commodity programs, reform does not happen \novernight. This proposal provides for a fair transition that will \nenable farmers and lenders to adjust their expectations to the \nmarketplace. Following completion of the phase-out period, the peanut \nprogram will operate like most other agricultural commodities.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have many of my Senate colleagues join \nme today as cosponsors of this measure, including Senators Chafee, \nDeWine, Feingold, Gregg, Brownback, Specter, and Collins.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make the International Olympic Committee subject to \nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                           the ioc reform act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould make the International Olympic Committee subject to the Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act. This legislation is in response to what I \nbelieve is a failure on the part of the International Olympic Committee \n(IOC) to adequately respond to corruption in the selection of cities to \nhost the Olympic games.\n  This morning, I chaired a hearing of the Commerce Committee on the \nrecent public controversies involving the Olympic bid process. As most \nof you know, allegations of bribes and corruption in the Salt Lake City \nbid process have prompted investigations by the Utah Attorney General \nand the Department of Justice. The purpose of the hearing was not to \nfocus on a single investigation. Instead, the Committee examined the \nbid process as a whole and the reform efforts undertaken by the United \nStates Olympic Committee (USOC) and IOC respectively.\n  The Committee heard testimony from the USOC, IOC and the Special Bid \nOversight Commission. The Commission was appointed by the USOC to \nreview the circumstances surrounding the selection of Salt Lake City to \nhost the 2002 Winter Olympics. The Commission, composed of a group of \nhighly respected individuals including our former colleague Senator \nMitchell and Ken Duberstein, made a series of recommendations to reform \nboth the USOC and the IOC. The recommendations focused on bringing \ntransparency and accountability to both organizations.\n  The USOC appears to be moving forward with reform. It adopted in full \nthe recommendations of the Commission and took responsibility for its \nown failure to oversee the Salt Lake City bid process. While not \ncomplete, I believe the process of reform at the USOC has begun. \nUnfortunately, the hearing did very little to ease my concerns about \nthe IOC. IOC representatives expressed opposition to several of the \ncommissions' recommendations and continues to be resistant to change. \nWhile I understand the IOC may have legitimate concerns about some of \nthe suggested reforms, I question their commitment to reform.\n  This morning Senator Mitchell and the other members of the Commission \nagreed that Congress could and should take action to ensure that the \nIOC is\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\nsubject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In the United States, the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act is available to law enforcement to combat \nofficial corruption in international business transactions. Currently, \nIOC members are not governed by the Act because they do not generally \nact in the role of a foreign official. Rather, they act on behalf of \nthe IOC, a private enterprise. My amendment includes the IOC in the \ndefinition of a Public International Organization subjecting them to \nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n  This bill should be a considered vehicle for discussion. This \nmorning, Senator Mitchell and the Commission offered to provide the \ncommittee with further comments on possible legislative solutions to \nthis problem. I look forward to hearing their ideas and working with \nthem. However, based upon the recommendation of the panel this morning \nand the need to send a strong signal to IOC that we are serious about \nreform, I wanted to introduce this first step today. I know that many \nof my colleagues either will introduce measures as well and I look \nforward to working with them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 804. A bill to improve the ability of Federal agencies to license \nFederally-owned inventions; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n           TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER COMMERCIALIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am with my colleague Senate \nFrist introducing the Technology Transfer Commercialization Act of \n1999. This bill would make technical changes and clarifications to the \nlegislation which governs the transfer of intellectual property from \nthe federal government to the private sector.\n  The original Technology Transfer Improvements Act (TTIA), which I was \nauthor of in 1995, allowed for easier and quicker access to \nintellectual property which the government owns and private industry \nwants. It created a win-win situation. The government gets royalties \nfrom these licenses, private industry gets the intellectual property \nthat it needs, and Americans get jobs from the production of inventions \nbased on this intellectual property.\n  This bill builds on the strong positive response from TTIA. It \nreduces the requirements for obtaining a non-exclusive license in order \nto allow as many companies and individuals as possible access to the \ninformation. It also addresses private industry's concerns about \nmaintaining confidential information within applications.\n  However, this does not come at the expense of the government being \nable to keep control of its property. This bill also clarifies the \nability of the licensing agencies to terminate a license if certain \ncriteria are not met. Furthermore, it allows the government to \nconsolidate intellectual property which is developed in cooperation \nwith a private entity so that the package can be relicensed to a third \nparty.\n  Technology transfer is a vital part of our national economy. It is \nwhat allows our industries to remain at the leading edge in their \nfield.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Technology \nTransfer Commercialization Act of 1999.\n  Technology transfer is a crucial link in the process that transforms \nresearch results into commercially viable products. The federal \ngovernment's involvement in technology transfer arises naturally from \nits desire to encourage usage and commercialization of innovations \nresulting from federally-funded research. However, it is through \nfurther development, refinement, and marketing by the private sector \nthat research results become diffused throughout the economy and \ngenerate growth. The private sector's active and timely participation \nin this process must be strongly encouraged if our competitiveness is \nto be enhanced.\n  Patents and licensing rights play key roles in the technology \ntransfer process in that they provide strong economic incentives to \nindustry. Studies have shown that research funding accounts for only 25 \npercent of the costs associated with bringing a new product to market. \nIncreasingly, patent ownership is used as a means to recoup the \ninvestment through the incoming royalty stream. In addition, actual \nexperience and studies concluded that if companies do not control the \nresults of their investments, they are less likely to engage in related \nresearch and development.\n  Existing legislation encourages the transfer of technologies and \ncloser collaborations between the Federal labs and industry by allowing \nthe industry partners to obtain title to inventions that result from \nthese collaborations. The Stevenson-Wydler Act and subsequent \namendments created a framework to facilitate cooperative and \ndevelopment agreement (CRADAs) between industry and the Federal labs. \nThe Bayh-Dole Act and subsequent amendments established policies for \nthe licensing of federally-funded inventions.\n  The Technology Commercialization Act of 1999 improves upon both \nStevenson-Wydler and Bayh-Dole by taking into consideration the \nincreased competition in the marketplace. Provisions include \nstreamlining the licensing procedure, and encouraging use of the \nelectronic media to shorten the time requirements for public notice. \nThis is in accordance with the fast pace required for doing business \ntoday. Other provisions include clarifications of criteria for granting \nany license, as well as exclusive and partially exclusive licenses.\n  Although technology transfer is important, such transfer should not \ncompromise national security or substantially reduce competition in the \nmarketplace. In response to these concerns, the Act requires the Office \nof Science and Technology Policy to study existing practices of CRADA \ncreation in the agencies, and issue a report outlining review \nprocedures for the creation of certain types of CRADAs.\n  The Act also lays the groundwork for a better understanding of the \ntechnology transfer process. Although there is consensus on the role of \ntechnology transfer in economic growth, there are no existing measures \nfor understanding how much technology is transferred or how well the \nprocess works. Relevant questions include is the technology that is \nbeing transferred useful or successful, and are the inventions being \nproduced in the federal labs relevant to the marketplace. As we \ntransition into a knowledge-based economy, the management of knowledge \nmovement will play a key role in sustaining our competitiveness.\n  In summary, technology transfer is crucial to our national economic \ngrowth. Therefore, both Senator Rockefeller and I ask for your support \nin enhancing our competitiveness and encouraging industry to work \ntogether with our federal agencies to create the best technologies \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3713-1", "month":

On \nFebruary 28, 1999, Daniel Tweedall was announced the fifth place \nNational winner in the 1999 Voice of Democracy Program. For his fine \nperformance, Daniel will receive a $5,000 Scholarship Award provided by \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Ladies Auxiliary.\n  A Junior at Evansville Central High School, Daniel submitted his \nwinning audio essay script entitled, ``My Service to America'' to the \nIndiana Veterans of Foreign Wars Voice of Democracy contest. This \nbeautiful essay was judged the winner from more than 1,500 entries \nsubmitted by Indiana student competitors in the 1998-1999 competition. \nDaniel's essay then went on to its fifth place finish in the nationwide \ncompetition. More than 80,000 students participated in this year's \ncontest.\n  Daniel's moving essay described how the speech given by one of his \ngovernment teachers following the drive-by shooting of the teacher's \nsister had inspired him to serve America as the\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nteacher's sister had. Daniel explained how he chose to serve America \nthrough community service in such organizations as Habitat for \nHumanity. Daniel wrote, ``I know that every time I help the woman next \ndoor shovel her walk when it snows, serve a hot meal at the rescue \nmission, or simply walk down the street and smile at someone, the flame \nfrom my already burning torch warms the heart, making them want to do \nmore for others and believe in the youth of America.'' Daniel now hopes \nhe will inspire others to also serve our country through military \nservice, public office, or community service.\n  After graduation, Daniel plans to attend either DePauw University or \nthe University of Notre Dame where he expects to pursue a career in \nmedicine. Daniel is the President of his class, the vice-president of \nthe school's speech team, and the Secretary of the school's Spanish \nclub. In addition to Habitat for Humanity, Daniel is also involved in \nthe Evansville Rescue Mission and Teen Power.\n  I commend Daniel on his tremendous accomplishment. Not only has he \nwon a very competitive essay contest, he has also demonstrated the \nfinest qualities of leadership, national service, and community \ninvolvement. I hope that his example will inspire others to serve our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3716-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JIM THORPE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJim Thorpe as he is being considered in the selection of Athlete of the \nCentury. Pennsylvania has a historic affiliation to this great man, of \nwhom a borough in Carbon County Pennsylvania is named for.\n  Jim Thorpe is the only American athlete to ever excel, as an amateur \nand as a professional, in three major sports; track and field, football \nand baseball.\n  As an amateur in track and field, Thorpe won the pentathlon and the \ndecathlon at the Amateur Athletic Union's (AAU) National Championship \nTrials in Boston, prior to the 1912 Olympics. He went on to represent \nSac, Fox Nation and the United States in the 1912 Olympic Games in \nStockholm, Sweden, and became the first U.S. athlete to win the \ndecathlon and the only athlete in the world to win both the decathlon \nand the pentathlon during one Olympic year. These athletic feats and \nthe subsequent worldwide publicity helped to establish the viability of \nthe Olympics.\n  Thorpe's major league baseball career consisted of playing with the \nNew York Giants, the Cincinnati Reds and the Boston Braves, in which he \nended the 1919 season with a .327 average.\n  His amateur football record was established while he was a student at \nthe Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania and was chosen to Walter \nCamp's First Team All American Half-Back in 1911 and 1912. A founding \nfather of professional football, Thorpe became the first elected \npresident of the American Professional Football Association, now known \nas the National Football League. He was voted America's Greatest All-\nAround Male Athlete and chosen as the greatest football player of the \nhalf-century in 1950 by an Associated Press Poll of sports writers. He \nwas also named the Greatest American Football Player in History in a \n1977 national poll conducted by Sport Magazine.\n  Because of his outstanding sports achievements, Thorpe was inducted \ninto the National Indian Hall of Fame, the Helms Professional Football \nHall of Fame, the Professional Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, \nthe National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and the Pennsylvania and \nOklahoma Halls of Fame.\n  Mr. President, Jim Thorpe's immeasurable sports achievements have \nlong been an inspiration to America's youth, as well as to the youth of \nPennsylvania. I ask my colleagues to join with me in paying tribute to \nJim Thorpe for his renowned accomplishments, as he is considered for \nAthlete of the Century in 2000.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3716-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOYCE CHIANG\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

She \nwill long be remembered and greatly missed.\n  At the age of 28, Joyce had already demonstrated a strong commitment \nto public service. Most recently, she worked as an attorney for the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service. Prior to joining the INS, Joyce \nwas a staff member for Congressman Howard Berman. She served as the \nStudent Body President at Smith College, where she graduated in 1992. \nIn her spare time, Joyce volunteered for local charities.\n  After Joyce disappeared one night in January, her friends and family \nbegan organizing to find her. They posted fliers, wore yellow ribbons,, \nand held weekly candlelight vigils for her safe return. These vigils, \nwhich were held both in Washington and in California, were attended by \nhundreds of people--a testament to Joyce's ability to touch people's \nlives in a special way. Tragically, the search for Joyce Chiang ended \nwith the terrible news that her life had been taken.\n  Joyce was a young person full of energy, intelligence, and \ngenerosity. She was deeply dedicated to improving our communities and \nhad only begun to make her contribution to our society. Her passing is \na loss not only for her friends and family, but for all of us in the \ngreater community in which she lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3716-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3716-S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO GEORGE R. STEPHENS\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is with mixed emotions that I \noffer this congratulatory statement to George R. Stephens, a long-time \nGPO liaison to the Senate Republican Policy Committee, on the eve of \nhis retirement. George has been a part of the Policy Committee family \nfor so long that we've practically forgotten he's on a different \npayroll. In fact, his tenure with the Committee long precedes my \nservice as Committee Chairman.\n  But, let's start at the beginning. George R. Stephens began his \nemployment with the Government Printing Office in 1969, following in \nhis mother's--and his grandmother's--footsteps. George's mother, Ella \nStephens, joined GPO in 1950 as a ``clerk-typist.'' George's first GPO \njob was a Linotype operator. After a short stint in the private sector, \nGeorge returned to work at GPO's headquarters for about 10 years. In \nJanuary of 1981, he began his 18-year service as a GPO liaison to the \nU.S. Senate, assigned to the Republican Policy Committee (RPC) as a \nprinter/proofreader. The position included aiding the RPC in publishing \nits Record Vote Analysis, a publication the Committee has provided \ncontinually since its inception in 1947.\n  George has served under four Policy Committee chairmen: John Tower of \nTexas; Bill Armstrong of Colorado; Don Nickles; and now myself. It must \nhave been a challenge for a nonpartisan federal employee to work in the \nsingle large committee room that houses the dedicated, outspoken, and \ndecidedly opinionated RPC staff, engaged in near-constant discourse \nabout how to solve the problems of the day. To his credit, George's \nprofessionalism and nonpartisanship never wavered, yet he is accepted \nas a full-fledged member of our Policy Committee family. I think it's \nfair to say he appreciates our party's dedication to keeping government \nin its place--that is, good government, but not Big Government.\n  George has certainly been an energetic advocate for the good \ngovernment work of his employer, Congress' printer. In a letter to the \neditor to Roll Call in 1995 responding to that newspaper's call for \nincreased privatization of GPO services, George wrote, ``. . . There \nisn't another printing company on this earth capable of producing such \nlarge jobs so quickly and with the high standards to which Members have \nbecome accustomed. Newcomers to Washington quickly learn that GPO \nprints and delivers the Congressional Record and the Federal Register \non a daily basis. They also learn that its ability to have printed \nbills and other documents available within hours of their drafting is \nessential to the\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nsmooth and timely operation of Senate proceedings.''\n  George's years of service with the GPO span an era of unprecedented \ngrowth in technology. From typewriters and hot metal typesetting, to \nso-called cold press, to computer desktop publishing, fiber optics, CD-\nRom's and online publishing, George has witnessed truly revolutionary \nchanges to the world of printing. However, one thing has not changed: \nour government's commitment to assure public access to government \ninformation. George is part of that proud tradition.\n  While some witnesses to a revolution turn and run in fear of the \nunknown, George has embraced each development along the way. His \neagerness to keep up with changing technology has been an asset to our \nCommittee, but his eagerness is not limited to technology. This is a \nman who loves his job. With a record that likely competes with any \npostman, George travels 60 miles each way every day to arrive at work \non time, no matter the weather or traffic conditions. His dedication is \ncommendable.\n  But George will not be remembered simply for his work as our \nCommittee's GPO liaison. He's also an avid ham radio operator, and for \n13 years has served as president of the Capitol Hill Amateur Radio \nSociety. The club was formally established in 1969, and, at the urging \nof Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, it established a station in the \nRussell Senate office building. That station has been maintained on a \nvoluntary basis, without any government funds, ever since. Over the \nyears, the club has stood ready to provide communications in the event \nof a disaster, and to help connect military personnel overseas with \ntheir friends or family members. In one of its many accomplishments \nunder George's leadership, the club in 1991 hosted a commemoration of \nthe bicentennial of the birth of Samuel F.B. Morse, by reenacting \nMorse's historic 1844 message, ``What hath God wrought!'' from the \nNation's Capitol to Baltimore. The telegraph instruments used for the \nre-enactment were loaned by the Smithsonian Institution, and because \nthe society's members are proficient in Morse code, the re-enactment \nwas historically accurate.\n  Yet, things have a way of changing. Like hot metal typesetting, ham \nradio is truly a phenomenon of the 20th century. The advent of the \ncomputer and the Internet age have reduced ham radio's appeal. And so \nnow, when George goes, so too goes the Capitol Hill Amateur Radio Club. \nOn George's last day of government service, April 30, the club will \ndisband, the equipment will be donated to a foundation, the antenna \nremoved from the Russell roof. The callsign ``W3USS'' will remain alive \nbut inactive. This marks the end of a remarkable era.\n  So, let us look to the future. George and his wife Bea live in a \nlittle southern Maryland town called Avenue. His house is right on the \nwater, but George doesn't own a boat. He says he's never had time for \nboating. Now, he's looking at buying a nice little 24-foot or 30-foot \n``party boat'' so he can host friends in an occasional leisure-filled \nafternoon on the lower Potomac. Perhaps, after that little purchase, he \nwon't miss us all quite so much!\n  In closing, on behalf of myself, and of the current and former staff \nof the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee, I wish to offer \nheartfelt thanks for George's many valuable years of service, and our \nhopes that he and his wife enjoy many happy and healthy years of \nretirement. We truly cannot give enough thanks to someone who has \ndedicated himself to making sure we Senators--literally--dot our `i's' \nand cross our `t's'.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3717-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3717-S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JACKIE EBRON\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this past Sunday the Queens \nJewish Community Council honored an important member of the staff of \nthe Metropolitan New York Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty (Met \nCouncil). Her name is Jackie Ebron and she helps serve the more than \n100,000 clients who are helped by this remarkable organization. Ms. \nEbron, the Met Council's longest serving employee and Director of \nCrisis Intervention is an African-American whose exceptional service to \nimpoverished Jewish New Yorkers was recently highlighted in New York's \nJewish Week newspaper.\n  In the past seven years the Met Council has developed 1300 units of \nspecial needs housing for the elderly, mentally ill and the homeless; \nevery day they provide nearly three thousand poor elderly individuals \nwith home care services; they provide job placement to more than one \nthousand people a year and have trained more than 20,000 home \nattendants since 1993. Their food programs impact on the lives of well \nover 100,000 people and they also provide furniture and clothing to \nthousands. The Met Council's coordination of a network of two dozen \nJewish Community Councils across New York City helps deliver services \nwhere they are needed in a timely and efficient manner. The Met Council \nis also one of the most efficient non-profit organizations today. They \nspend 98% of their budget on programs and services; only 2% is spent on \nadministration.\n  I ask that the Jewish Week article on Jackie Ebron be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Jewish Week, Mar. 19, 1999]\n\n                      They Call Her `Mitzvah Mama'\n\n                         (By Heather Robinson)\n\n       By the time she was 8 years old, Jackie Ebron, who is soon \n     to become the first African-American to receive the Queens \n     Jewish Community Council's Chesed Award, had begun helping \n     the elderly.\n       Growing up in the Grant Projects on 125th Street, her \n     family had an elderly neighbor who rarely left her apartment.\n       ``My mother would never send me to the store that I didn't \n     knock on this woman's door and ask, `Do you need a loaf of \n     bread or milk?' '' recalled Ebron on a recent afternoon. ``So \n     [the motivation to help] was with was a child.''\n       Ebron has channeled that motivation into more than two \n     decades of work helping the elderly and others in need. Over \n     the years, she has visited more than 5,000 needy homes and \n     helped many thousands more clients over the phone. And \n     through her work, she quickly overcame an initial prejudice: \n     ``In my background,'' she says, ``the words Jewish and poor \n     didn't go together. But there is a very big Jewish poor \n     population at the poverty level or below.''\n       Now the director of crisis intervention services for the \n     Metropolitan Coordinating Council on Jewish Poverty (Met \n     Council) in Manhattan, Ebron will receive the Chesed Award on \n     Sunday at the Third Annual Installation Breakfast of the \n     Queens Jewish Community Council (QJCC). Shea Stadium's \n     Diamond Club, the site of the event, will go kosher for the \n     first time in honor of the breakfast for the QJCC, an \n     organization representing more than 90 synagogues and Jewish \n     organizations throughout the borough.\n       At the event, Ebron will share her honor with Jane \n     Blumenstein, family violence crisis specialist for Met \n     Council. The pair has been selected because of the \n     extraordinary dedication they bring to their work, according \n     to Manny Behar, executive director of the QJCC. He added that \n     he and other officers of the QJCC chose this year's \n     recipients, as they always do, based on character.\n       ``We always give the award to someone who exemplifies \n     chesed, which is Hebrew for acts of loving kindness, and this \n     time, one of the people we selected happens to be African-\n     American and non-Jewish,'' he said.\n       Because the QJCC and Met Council work together frequently, \n     Behar said he has had many opportunities to observe the rare \n     sensitivity and respect for people which Ebron--whose \n     colleagues call her ``Mitzvah Mama''--brings to her work.\n       Behar recently watched Ebron provide assistance to a \n     homeless, mentally ill man, and he admired her manner. ``The \n     patience and understanding she showed him were absolutely \n     inspiring,'' he recalled.\n       According to Peter Brest, chief operation officer at Met \n     Council, Ebron ``combines a great and giving heart with a \n     common sense approach to problem solving.''\n       While Met Council, which receives public funding, assists \n     many needy non-Jews, it also receives private funds and \n     specifically targets Jewish poverty. The result is that about \n     80 percent of Ebron's clients are Jews, a fact which is no \n     obstacle to her dedication.\n       ``To me it doesn't matter what race or religion you are,'' \n     she said. ``If you are hungry or homeless, I see your need.''\n       A social worker for more than 25 years, Ebron, 48, grew up \n     in Harlem, the eldest of seven children raised by a single \n     mother. She attended Washington Irving High School in \n     Gramercy, which was an all-girls school at the time.\n       After graduating, she started working at Heights Senior \n     Citizens' Center, where her responsibilities entailed \n     escorting elderly people to the bank and helping them with \n     financial transactions. That was during the '70s, before \n     direct deposit, when older people carrying social security \n     checks were frequently targets for thieves.\n       That job was followed by a stint as an investigator for the \n     mid-Bronx Senior Citizens' Council, a position that involved \n     a large amount of what she describes as ``leg work'' to find \n     elderly people in need.\n       Met Council hired her in 1977 to work on a special project \n     arranged by a donor. In that\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\n     capacity, she made home visits to needy families, and \n     reported what she observed to the benefactor, who then \n     provided financial aid to the neediest cases.\n       After a series of other jobs, five years ago, Met Council \n     appointed Ebron director of crisis intervention services. A \n     supervisor of six employees, she deals directly with clients, \n     working to provide them with assistance from Met Council and \n     a host of additional agencies. That assistance can take many \n     forms, such as securing job training for a young immigrant, \n     providing funds to prevent an elderly woman from being \n     evicted, or arranging temporary nursing help for a woman who \n     has just given birth to multiple children. About 65 percent \n     of her clients are elderly, 25 percent are families and the \n     rest are young single people, Ebron said.\n       As an African-American woman serving the needs of a mostly \n     Jewish population Ebron has encountered resistance on both \n     sides of the racial and religious divide.\n       ``I've been asked, `How come a black woman is in charge of \n     Jewish money?' '' said Ebron, adding that she responds, `` \n     `Does it matter what I look like? What matters is I'm able to \n     serve you to help you overcome your problem.' ''\n       Similarly, she said, African American colleagues have \n     questioned her choice to work for a Jewish agency.\n       ``I'll say to them, `My clients are Jewish. Well, I didn't \n     know. I was so focused on the fact that they're people who \n     need my help.' Usually when I answer that way there's no \n     problem, no fight . . . It seems my calling is above all of \n     that.''\n       Ebron, who is single and describes herself as ``married to \n     [her] job,'' said she is gratified to work for an agency \n     which began modestly and has since launched an array of life- \n     and hope-sustaining programs.\n       ``After 21 years I feel I made the right choice,'' she \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3718-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF THE MISSOURI INVITATIONAL CELEBRITY TURKEY HUNT\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I take the floor today to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues Indiana's celebration of Medical \nLaboratory Week.\n  In the world of health care, it is easy to forget that quality \nmedical testing and exceptional patient care is a team effort. Doctors \nare the visible element in this complex harmony, but there is another, \nless visible, but equally important element involved.\n  Medical laboratory professionals are highly-trained health personnel \nwho perform and evaluate those medical laboratory tests necessary to \ndetect, diagnose, and monitor treatment of diseases. They also help to \nprevent diseases, while at the same time tirelessly working to develop \nnew methods of combating them. These dedicated men and women save \ncountless lives each day through their firm commitment to a healthier \ncommunity.\n  Laboratory medicine is an honorable profession, in its constant and \nconsistent dedication to the well-being of the greater community. Let \nus not forget that it is also an inseparable and invaluable part of \nhealth care without the often-unsung efforts of these fine people, \nmedicine as we know it would not exist.\n  I therefore ask my colleagues, as well as all citizens, to join me \nand the State of Indiana in recognizing and supporting the vital \nservice provided by medical laboratory professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3718-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO CORNERSTONE COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President. I rise today to honor the men's \nbasketball team of Cornerstone College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and \ntheir coach, Kim Elders. This outstanding team recently reached the \npinnacle of success by winning the NAIA Division II National \nChampionship for basketball last month.\n  The Golden Eagles of Cornerstone have received an honor that is \nreserved for only one team each year. This achievement is the product \nof hard work, determination, and dedication which was present \nthroughout the Golden Eagles' season. The common focus of the team \nmembers was determined early in the pre-season as they declared \nthemselves to be On A Mission.'' Throughout the regular season and \ncontinuing into the playoffs, Cornerstone subdued their opponents \namassing an amazing record of 37 wins and only three losses, thereby \nearning the #1 rank in the national polls. At the national tournament \nin Nampa, Idaho, they proved that they deserved that rank by defeating \nall challengers. Their exciting season peaked at the championship game, \nin which Cornerstone beat the two-time defending national champion, \nBethel, in an exciting overtime final.\n  The achievements of the basketball team will be seen by many as a way \nto promote the glory of sport and the excellence of Cornerstone in \nparticular. Interestingly however, these aspects are not the focus at \nCornerstone College. Rather, Cornerstone has followed its motto of \nAcademic Excellence, Christian Commitment,'' by using basketball and \ntheir team's success as a medium to bring the Christian message to \nothers. This being the case, the men's basketball team has not only \nbrought a sense of pride to Cornerstone College and the greater \ncommunity, but their success has been a platform for bringing the hope \nof Christ to all who hear about their championship.\n  Mr. President, the men's basketball team of Cornerstone College has \nshown itself to be a group of unique and talented individuals. I \ncommend them for their dedication and hard work and honor them for the \nsuccess that it has brought them. Furthermore, I commend Cornerstone \nCollege for its unique and important message and for their faithfulness \nin making it heard. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the \nmen's basketball team of Cornerstone College for their success in \nbecoming the 1999 NAIA national champions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3718-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CORRECTION TO THE RECORD\n\n  In the Record of April 12, 1999, the texts of S. 293 and H.

RECONCILIATION.\n\n       Not later than September 30, 1999, the House Committee on \n     Ways and Means shall report to the House a reconciliation \n     bill that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     such that the total level of revenues is not less than: \n     $1,408,500,000,000 in revenues for fiscal year 2000, \n     $7,416,800,000,000 in revenues for fiscal years 2000 through \n     2004, and $16,155,700,000,000 in revenues for fiscal years \n     2000 through 2009.\n\n     SEC. 5. SAFE DEPOSIT BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) under the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the social \n     security trust funds are off-budget for purposes of the \n     President's budget submission and the concurrent resolution \n     on the budget;\n       (2) the social security trust funds have been running \n     surpluses for 17 years;\n       (3) these surpluses have been used to implicitly finance \n     the general operations of the Federal Government;\n       (4) in fiscal year 2000, the social security surplus will \n     exceed $137 billion;\n       (5) for the first time, a concurrent resolution on the \n     budget balances the Federal budget without counting social \n     security surpluses; and\n       (6) the only way to ensure that social security surpluses \n     are not diverted for other purposes is to balance the budget \n     exclusive of such surpluses.\n       (b) Point of Order.--(1) It shall not be in order in the \n     House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget, or any amendment thereto \n     or conference report thereon, that sets forth a deficit for \n     any fiscal year. For purposes of this subsection, a deficit \n     shall be the level (if any) set forth in the most recently \n     agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget for that fiscal \n     year pursuant to section 301(a)(3) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974. In setting forth the deficit level \n     pursuant to such section, that level shall not include any \n     adjustments in aggregates that would be made pursuant to any \n     reserve fund that provides for adjustments in allocations and \n     aggregates for legislation that enhances retirement security \n     or extends the solvency of the Medicare trust funds or makes \n     such changes in the Medicare payment or benefit structure as \n     are necessary.\n       (2) Paragraph (1) may be waived in the Senate only by the \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members voting.\n       (c) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) beginning with fiscal year 2000, legislation should be \n     enacted to require any official statement issued by the \n     Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, or any other agency or instrumentality of the \n     Government of surplus or deficit totals of the budget of the \n     Government as submitted by the President or of the surplus or \n     deficit totals of the congressional budget, and any \n     description of, or reference to, such totals in any official \n     publication or material issued by either of such offices or \n     any other such agency or instrumentality, should exclude the \n     outlays and receipts of the old-age, survivors, and \n     disability insurance program under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (including the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund) and the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (2) legislation should be considered to augment subsection \n     (b) by--\n       (A) taking such steps as may be required to safeguard the \n     social security surpluses, such as statutory changes \n     equivalent to the reserve fund for retirement security and \n     Medicare set forth in section 6; or\n       (B) otherwise establishing a statutory limit on debt held \n     by the public and reducing such limit by the amounts of the \n     social security surpluses.\n\n     SEC. 6. RESERVE FUND FOR RETIREMENT SECURITY AND, AS NEEDED, \n                   MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Retirement Security.--Whenever the Committee on Ways \n     and Means of the House reports a bill, or an amendment \n     thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon is \n     submitted that enhances retirement security, the chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget may--\n       (1) increase the appropriate allocations for each of fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2004 and aggregates for each of fiscal \n     years 2000 through 2009 of new budget authority and outlays \n     by the amount of new budget authority provided by such \n     measure (and outlays flowing therefrom) for such fiscal year \n     for that purpose; and\n       (2) reduce the revenue aggregates for each of fiscal years \n     2000 through 2009 by the amount of the revenue loss resulting \n     from that measure for such fiscal year for that purpose.\n       (b) Medicare Program.--Whenever the Committee on Ways and \n     Means or the Committee on Commerce of the House reports a \n     bill, or an amendment thereto is offered, or a conference \n     report thereon is submitted that extends the solvency or \n     reforms the benefit or payment structure of the Medicare \n     Program, including any measure in response to the National \n     Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, the chairman \n     of the Committee on the Budget may increase the appropriate \n     allocations and aggregates of new budget authority and \n     outlays by the amounts provided in that bill for that \n     purpose.\n       (c) Limitation.--(1) The chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget may only make adjustments under subsection (a) or (b) \n     if the net outlay increase plus revenue reduction resulting \n     from any measure referred to in those subsections (including \n     any prior adjustments made for any other such measure) for \n     fiscal year 2000, the period of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2004, or the period of fiscal years 2000 through 2009 is not \n     greater than an amount equal to the projected social security \n     surplus for such period, as set forth in the joint \n     explanatory statement of managers accompanying this \n     concurrent resolution or, if published, the midsession review \n     for fiscal year 2000 of the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office. For purposes of the preceding sentence, \n     revenue reductions shall be treated as a positive number.\n       (2) In the midsession review for fiscal year 2000, the \n     Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation \n     with the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund, shall make an up-to-date estimate of \n     the projected surpluses in the social security trust funds \n     for fiscal year 2000, for the period of fiscal years 2000 \n     through 2004, and for the period of fiscal years 2000 through \n     2009.\n       (3) As used in this subsection, the term ``social security \n     trust funds'' means the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 7. RESERVE FUND FOR PROGRAMS AUTHORIZED UNDER THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the House, when the Committee on \n     Appropriations reports a bill or joint resolution, or an \n     amendment thereto is offered, or a conference report thereon \n     is submitted that provides new budget authority for fiscal \n     year 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 for programs authorized \n     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), \n     the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may increase the \n     appropriate allocations and aggregates of new budget \n     authority and outlays by an amount not to exceed the amount \n     of new budget authority provided by that measure (and outlays \n     flowing therefrom) for that purpose up to the maximum amount \n     consistent with section 611(a) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(a)(2)).\n       (b) Adjustments.--The adjustments in outlays (and the \n     corresponding amount of new budget authority) made under \n     subsection (a) for any fiscal year may not exceed the amount \n     by which an up-to-date projection of the on-budget surplus \n     made by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office for \n     that fiscal year exceeds the on-budget surplus for that \n     fiscal year set forth in section 2(4) of this resolution.\n       (c) CBO Projections.--Upon the request of the chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget of the House, the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office shall make an up-to-date estimate \n     of the projected on-budget surplus for the applicable fiscal \n     year.\n\n     SEC. 8. APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ALLOCATIONS AND \n                   AGGREGATES.\n\n       (a) Application.--Any adjustments of allocations and \n     aggregates made pursuant to this resolution for any measure \n     shall--\n       (1) apply while that measure is under consideration;\n       (2) take effect upon the enactment of that measure; and\n       (3) be published in the Congressional Record as soon as \n     practicable.\n       (b) Effect of Changed Allocations and Aggregates.--Revised \n     allocations and aggregates resulting from these adjustments \n     shall be considered for the purposes of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 as allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n\n     SEC. 9. UPDATED CBO PROJECTIONS.\n\n       Each calendar quarter the Director of the Congressional \n     Budget Office shall make an up-to-date estimate of receipts, \n     outlays and surplus (on-budget and off-budget) for the \n     current fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 10. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON THE COMMISSION ON \n                   INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) persecution of individuals on the sole ground of their \n     religious beliefs and practices occurs in countries around \n     the world and affects millions of lives;\n       (2) such persecution violates international norms of human \n     rights, including those established in the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, and the \n     Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance \n     and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief;\n       (3) such persecution is abhorrent to all Americans, and our \n     very Nation was founded on the principle of the freedom to \n     worship according to the dictates of our conscience; and\n       (4) in 1998 Congress unanimously passed, and President \n     Clinton signed into law, the\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which \n     established the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom to monitor facts and circumstances of \n     violations of religious freedom and authorized $3,000,000 to \n     carry out the functions of the Commission for each of fiscal \n     years 1999 and 2000.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution assumes that $3,000,000 will be \n     appropriated within function 150 for fiscal year 2000 for the \n     United States Commission on International Religious Freedom \n     to carry out its duties; and\n       (2) the House Committee on Appropriations is strongly urged \n     to appropriate such amount for the Commission.\n\n     SEC. 11.

SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   AND PRESERVING HOME HEALTH SERVICES FOR ALL \n                   MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) Access to Health Insurance.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) 43.4 million Americans are currently without health \n     insurance, and that this number is expected to rise to nearly \n     60 million people in the next 10 years;\n       (B) the cost of health insurance continues to rise, a key \n     factor in increasing the number of uninsured; and\n       (C) there is a consensus that working Americans and their \n     families and children will suffer from reduced access to \n     health insurance.\n       (2) Sense of the Congress on Improving Access to Health \n     Care Insurance.--It is the sense of the Congress that access \n     to affordable health care coverage for all Americans is a \n     priority of the 106th Congress.\n       (b) Preserving Home Health Service For All Medicare \n     Beneficiaries.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reformed Medicare home \n     health care spending by instructing the Health Care Financing \n     Administration to implement a prospective payment system and \n     instituted an interim payment system to achieve savings;\n       (B) the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, reformed the interim payment system \n     to increase reimbursements to low-cost providers, added $900 \n     million in funding, and delayed the automatic 15 percent \n     payment reduction for one year, to October 1, 2000; and\n       (C) patients whose care is more extensive and expensive \n     than the typical Medicare patient do not receive supplemental \n     payments in the interim payment system but will receive \n     special protection in the home health care prospective \n     payment system.\n       (2) Sense of the congress on access to home health care.--\n     It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) Congress recognizes the importance of home health care \n     for seniors and disabled citizens;\n       (B) Congress and the Administration should work together to \n     maintain quality care for patients whose care is more \n     extensive and expensive than the typical Medicare patient, \n     including the sickest and frailest Medicare beneficiaries, \n     while home health care agencies operate in the interim \n     payment system; and\n       (C) Congress and the Administration should work together to \n     avoid the implementation of the 15 percent reduction in the \n     interim payment system and ensure timely implementation of \n     the prospective payment system.\n\n     SEC. 14. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON MEDICARE PAYMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The House finds that--\n       (1) a goal of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was to expand \n     options for Medicare beneficiaries under the new \n     Medicare+Choice program;\n       (2) Medicare+Choice was intended to make these choices \n     available to all Medicare beneficiaries; and unfortunately, \n     during the first two years of the Medicare+Choice program the \n     blended payment was not implemented, stifling health care \n     options and continuing regional disparity among many counties \n     across the United States; and\n       (3) the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 also established the \n     National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to \n     develop legislative recommendations to address the long-term \n     funding challenges facing Medicare.\n       (b) Sense of the House.--It is the sense of the House that \n     this resolution assumes that funding of the Medicare+Choice \n     program is a priority for the House Committee on the Budget \n     before financing new programs and benefits that may \n     potentially add to the imbalance of payments and benefits in \n     Fee-for-Service Medicare and Medicare+Choice.\n\n     SEC. 15. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON ASSESSMENT OF WELFARE-TO-WORK \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It is the sense of the House that, \n     recognizing the need to maximize the benefit of the Welfare-\n     to-Work Program, the Secretary of Labor should prepare a \n     report on Welfare-to-Work Programs pursuant to section \n     403(a)(5) of the Social Security Act. This report should \n     include information on the following--\n       (1) the extent to which the funds available under such \n     section have been used (including the number of States that \n     have not used any of such funds), the types of programs that \n     have received such funds, the number of and characteristics \n     of the recipients of assistance under such programs, the \n     goals of such programs, the duration of such programs, the \n     costs of such programs, any evidence of the effects of such \n     programs on such recipients, and accounting of the total \n     amount expended by the States from such funds, and the rate \n     at which the Secretary expects such funds to be expended for \n     each of the fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002;\n       (2) with regard to the unused funds allocated for Welfare-\n     to-Work for each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999, identify \n     areas of the Nation that have unmet needs for Welfare-to-Work \n     initiatives; and\n       (3) identify possible Congressional action that may be \n     taken to reprogram Welfare-to-Work funds from States that \n     have not utilized previously allocated funds to places of \n     unmet need, including those States that have rejected or \n     otherwise not utilized prior funding.\n       (b) Report.--It is the sense of the House that, not later \n     than January 1, 2000, the Secretary of Labor should submit to \n     the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Ways and \n     Means of the House and the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate, in writing, the report described in subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 16. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON PROVIDING HONOR GUARD \n                   SERVICES FOR VETERANS' FUNERALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that all relevant \n     congressional committees should make every effort to provide \n     sufficient resources so that an Honor Guard, if requested, is \n     available for veterans' funerals.\n\n     SEC. 17. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS ON CHILD NUTRITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) both Republicans and Democrats understand that an \n     adequate diet and proper nutrition are essential to a child's \n     general well-being;\n       (2) the lack of an adequate diet and proper nutrition may \n     adversely affect a child's ability to perform up to his or \n     her ability in school;\n       (3) the Government currently plays a role in funding school \n     nutrition programs; and\n       (4) there is a bipartisan commitment to helping children \n     learn.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the \n     Committee on Agriculture should examine our Nation's \n     nutrition programs to determine if they can be improved, \n     particularly with respect to services to low-income children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/14/senate-section/article/S3723-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3723-S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
