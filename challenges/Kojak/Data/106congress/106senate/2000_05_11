Dr. Edward Merritt \n``Ted'' Robinson of Central Union Church in Honolulu.\n  Dr. Robinson is senior minister at Central Union Church in Honolulu, \nthe largest United Church of Christ in the West and 1 of the 10 largest \nin the United States. Central Union was founded over 150 years ago, and \nthe ``Church in the Garden'' is renowned for its commitment to \ncommunity outreach as much as for its beautiful sanctuary. For over a \ncentury, the congregation has worked to put its faith into action in \nHawaii, nationally, and throughout Asia and the Pacific.\n  Dr. Robinson has served as senior minister at Central Union for 15 \nyears and has ministered in the United Church of Christ for over 30 \nyears. He was born in Westwood, MA, and received his bachelor's degree \nfrom Yankton College and bachelor of theology degree from Yankton \nSchool of Theology. He holds a master's of divinity from United \nSeminary in St. Paul and master's of sacred theology from the Iliff \nSchool of Theology at the University of Denver. He earned his doctor of \nministry degree at San Francisco Theological Seminary.\n  In addition to his work in the United Church of Christ, Dr. Robinson \nhas served on a number of boards and commissions in Honolulu including \nthe Salvation Army, Girl Scouts, Shriner's Hospital for Crippled \nChildren, Hawaii Habitat for Humanity, and Honolulu Boy Choir.\n  Ted and Barbara Robinson are the proud parents of two children, Sarah \nand Jonathan, and one granddaughter.\n  When we are home in Hawaii, we frequently worship at Central Union. \nTed Robinson is one of the finest preachers to grace Hawaii. He is a \nfriend and source of comfort for me and my family and inspires his \nactive and growing congregation to live their lives as courageous \npeople of faith. By word and deed, he embraces the mission of Central \nUnion inscribed in the sanctuary above the altar: ``Love Never \nFaileth.''\n  It is my pleasure and privilege to welcome my good friend and \nminister to the Senate.\n  Aloha.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I do thank my colleague, who will be \nspeaking momentarily. I want to simply recapitulate some of the \nstatements made yesterday, of which the first and the most important is \nto say this is the first trade bill to come to the floor of the Senate \nin 6 years. It is not simply that there have not been matters to attend \nto, it is rather that we have not been able to attend to them.\n  Most important, we have been unable to provide the President with \nnegotiating authority for future trade agreements in the manner that \ndeveloped over the last half century, following the epochal decision \nand action in the first term of President Roosevelt under Cordell Hull \nto begin the reciprocal trade agreements program. Under that program, \nthe United States negotiated with individual countries, and then after \nWorld War II with a group of countries gathered together under the \numbrella of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The Reciprocal \nTrade Agreements Act of 1934 gave the President the authority to \nnegotiate and proclaim tariff reductions and that procedure evolved, in \n1974, into the trade agreements negotiating authority, whereby the \nCongress gave the President the opportunity to reach a common agreement \nwith other countries and then send it to the Congress to be approved up \nor down, not to be negotiated item by item as we had done in the \ndisastrous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930. We have never had a tariff bill \nas such on the Senate floor in 70 years.\n  The administration was hesitant about asking the Congress to renew \nthis authority. When finally it did, we were hesitant about giving it, \nand it looked for a while as if an enormous, a momentous event in the \nworld economy and the American economy and in the political stability \nof the world was being lost. The role of trade has become so important. \nMany of the principal actors in the Second World War were at war with \neach other in very much trade-related matters. It would now be thought \ninconceivable for any such conflict to take place.\n  I say this because not only was this the first bill in six years, but \nyesterday we began our debate on an auspicious note with a resounding \nvote of 90-6 in support of the motion to proceed to the conference \nreport, and now we will vote to invoke cloture. I trust we will do so \nwith the same resounding vote.\n  This is a good bill. It is not perfect, nor will it solve all the \neconomic problems of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, but it will \nhelp, as Senator Grassley and others said yesterday. My esteemed \ncolleague, the Senator from Iowa, is here representing Senator Roth, \nthe chairman of our committee, who is recovering from surgery and who \nwill be back with us next week when on next Wednesday we will take up \nin the Finance Committee the proposition of permanent normal trade \nrelations with China, an epic decision we will have to make and which I \nthink we will be able to make in the context of this legislation having \nsucceeded.\n  I remind all who might be listening that 6 months ago, this \nlegislation was dead. It was not going anywhere. The House had passed a \nmeasure limited to Africa and not very well received over here. They \nhad not included anything for the Caribbean Basin and Central America, \nas we call it, a program begun under President Reagan, and the Finance \nCommittee took it up. The Finance Committee worked for 6 months on this \nmatter.\n  I know there are persons who feel it is unacceptable because it does \nnot contain provisions that provide for assistance to sub-Saharan \nAfrica with respect to HIV/AIDS.\n  I say to my friends, the Senate did have such a provision. We fought \nfor it in conference. We were not able to succeed because on the House \nside it was thought the legislation was a trade measure and public \nhealth issues were not relevant.\n  But also, absent economic development, there will be no controlling \nthis epidemic in Africa, anymore than in the subcontinent of Asia, and \nwe will not have anything in which to begin an engagement on these \nmatters--nothing. Anyone who comes to this body thinking that \nlegislation which is not perfect is unacceptable will often be \ndisappointed. I was disappointed with the extent to which persons spoke \nyesterday about rejecting this legislation because it was not perfect.\n\n  I note that the Foreign Relations Committee has reported out a \nmeasure, S. 2382, the Technical Assistance, Trade Promotion and Anti-\nCorruption Act of 2000, which includes some important provisions \naddressing this public health crisis. Other suggestions are under \nreview. These include proposed tax incentives to promote vaccine \ndevelopment. These tax incentives will come to the Finance Committee.\n  I am sure my friend from Iowa will agree that Senators who accept \nwhat we have done today, even if not perfect, will find a much more \nreceptive Finance Committee. We have worked very hard on this. We know \nperfectly well the facts, and we propose to address them in a context \nwhere we will have a tax bill. We will try to get a tax bill on the \nHouse side, and we will enact something of much greater consequence \nthan anything now contemplated.\n  I offer a further thought, which is that on May 3, the Wall Street \nJournal reported, and I was advised of this in advance, that the Pfizer \npharmaceutical company--one of the oldest, the one which developed \npenicillin during World War II, the British having discovered it and \nnot having the capacity to produce it; a great firm with great \nsuccesses--had offered to provide one of its drug therapies for HIV \ninfection, called Diflucan, at no cost to\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\nSouth Africans. There is a press announcement from Geneva this morning \nthat five pharmaceutical companies--Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Glaxo \nWellcome, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Roche--are participating in a \ncollaborative initiative with the United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, \nwhich is termed UNAIDS to ``explore ways to accelerate and improve the \nprovision of HIV/AIDS-related care and treatment in developing \ncountries.''\n\n  Does the Presiding Officer wish me to cease and desist?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The time allocated to the \nminority side has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Fine.\n  I would simply close by saying, sir, as to the matter of worker \nrights, the amendment to the CBI legislation offered on this matter was \noffered by Senator Levin, which I cosponsored. It provided that the \nPresident must take into account the extent to which a prospective CBI \nbeneficiary country protects internationally recognized worker rights. \nThat is to say, the core labor standards established by the ILO. I \nreport to the Senate that this was retained in the conference \nagreement, as were many other Senate amendments.\n  I thank the Chair and I regret having imposed upon my colleague's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my intention to use 5 minutes and \nthen give the remainder of the time to one of the opponents of the \nlegislation, the Senator from Wisconsin. So I ask the Chair to please \ninform me when 5 minutes are up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so note.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the cloture motion. \nI urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this motion. \nI spoke yesterday, at length, about why this bill is such an important \npiece of legislation.\n  I guess the best proof of it is that it enjoys such bipartisan \nsupport, which does not happen too often on Capitol Hill. But I summed \nup, in yesterday's remarks, that this conference agreement is about \nopportunity--opportunity for 48 struggling nations of sub-Saharan \nAfrica; and opportunity for the people of the Caribbean, many of whom \nare struggling to rebuild their lives following the devastation of \ntheir countries by natural disaster.\n  Most importantly, we in the Congress must be concerned about American \njobs--our working men and women. This bill does much for the American \neconomy and for America's consumers, as well. The enhanced Caribbean \nBasin Initiative textile provisions in this conference agreement may \ncreate up to $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 new jobs over the next \n5 years. Those are not my estimates. Those are not Senator Moynihan's \nestimates. Those are the textile industry's own estimates.\n  In addition to the textile industry, this bill enjoys the support of \nmany other industries as well. This is because American exports follow \nAmerican investment when that investment moves abroad, especially \nexports of capital equipment.\n  This conference agreement enjoys broad support among distinguished \nMembers of both the majority and minority, who have worked together \nlong and hard to fashion this agreement.\n  It also enjoys the support of a vast majority of political, civic, \nand religious leaders around the United States, and the support of each \nof the nations that would benefit from its passage.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at an advertisement in the Hill \nnewspaper that was put out yesterday. It has a long list of prominent \nbusiness leaders and organizations. It has a long list of American \ncivic leaders who support this, including even organizations such as \nEmpower America, which is headed by Republican Jack Kemp, and is \nsupported by conservative leaders such as Bill Bennett.\n  Since it enjoys this broad, bipartisan support--both within and \noutside the political environment--I hope that it gets the support of \nour colleagues as well.\n  A vote for cloture is also a reaffirmation of America's historic \nleadership role in international trade. We have much to do in the \ninternational trade arena in the next year or two:\n  Restore confidence in American trade policy, and leadership in trade; \nrebuild confidence in the World Trade Organization; win the fight for \npermanent normal trade relations status for China; and show our trading \npartners in Geneva, where negotiations are underway right now, that we \nin the Senate are engaged with the world, and the world can look to us \nfor that leadership.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote in support of the opportunity to continue \nAmerica's leadership in the effort to reduce trade barriers. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this motion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that advertisement I \nmentioned in the Hill newspaper printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Hill, May 10, 2000]\n\n                      To The United States Senate\n\n\n      conference report on the african growth and opportunity act\n\n     We Endorse Legislation That Provides Social and Economic \n         Opportunity in Africa And We, the Undersigned, are \n         Working Together to Achieve this Goal\n\n                         All 48 African Nations\n\n     Angola\n     Benin\n     Botswana\n     Burkina Faso\n     Burundi\n     Cameroon\n     Cape Verde\n     Central Africa Republic\n     Chad\n     Comoros\n     Congo (Brazzaville)\n     Congo, Democratic Republic\n     Cote d'Ivoire\n     Djibouti\n     Equitorial Guinea\n     Eritrea\n     Ethiopia\n     Gabon\n     The Gambia\n     Ghana\n     Guinea\n     Guinea-Bissau\n     Kenya\n     Lesotho\n     Liberia\n     Madagascar\n     Malawi\n     Mali\n     Mauritania\n     Mauritius\n     Mozambique\n     Namibia\n     Niger\n     Nigeria\n     Reunion\n     Rwanda\n     Sao Tome and Principe\n     Senegal\n     Seychelles\n     Sierra Leone\n     South Africa\n     Swaziland\n     Tanzania\n     Togo\n     Uganda\n     Zambia\n     Zimbabwe\n\n                            Business Leaders\n\n     The Limited, Inc.\n     Gap Inc.\n     Ford Motor Company\n     Moving Water Industries\n     Chevron Corporation\n     Kmart Corporation\n     Cargill\n     BP Amoco Corporation\n     Bechtel\n     Exxon Corporation\n     Citigroup\n     Enron Corporation\n     Bank of America\n     Mobil Corporation\n     Boeing Company\n     Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n     National Retail Federation\n     Caterpillar, Inc.\n     Leon Tempelsman & Son\n     DaimlerChrysler\n     American International Group\n     Archer Daniels Midland Company\n     Foley, Hoag and Eliot\n     Eastman Kodak\n     Equator Bank HSBC\n     Edlow International\n     Eli Lilly and Company\n     Emerson Electric Co.\n     Texaco Inc.\n     Equitable Capital Mgmt.\n     Barden International\n     BET, Inc.\n     F.C.

The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first thank the Senator from Iowa \nfor his courtesy in giving me this time to speak in opposition.\n  Mr. President, I rise to take another opportunity to express my \ndisappointment with the conference report on the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act. I have outlined my concerns about this bill time and \nagain. I have explained how little opportunity it really offers to the \ncountries of Africa. I have expressed my fears about transshipment. I \nhave noted the bill's failure to address the environmental issues that \nare inextricably linked with trade and investment. And, most \nimportantly, I have pointed out the rather obvious fact that unless we \nget serious about reducing Africa's debt burden and fighting the \nregion's devastating HIV/AIDS crisis, any effort to stimulate trade and \ninvestment is simply an act of political theater.\n  By refusing to address the core obstacles prohibiting so much of that \nvast continent from achieving its potential as a region of prosperity \nand a valued trading partner, this Senate is once again ignoring the \ntough issues in favor of the ultimately futile quick fix. We are \ncapable of better, and the people of Africa are certainly deserving of \nmore.\n  I felt this way before learning the outcome of the conference--I felt \nthis way last year, when I joined Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr., to \nintroduce alternative legislation to the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct. But my disappointment was deepened, and my sense of outrage was \nprovoked, and my resolve to fight for something better was strengthened \nwhen the outcome of the conference became apparent.\n  The fate of the Feinstein-Feingold amendment--a provision that was \naccepted into the manager's package when this bill was debated on the \nfloor last fall but was stripped by the leadership in the final days of \nthe conference--is appalling. Our modest amendment would have prevented \nthe U.S. Government from pressuring African countries that use \ninternationally legal means to make HIV/AIDS medications more \naccessible to their citizens. I stood on this floor yesterday and cited \nstatistic after shocking statistic, trying to communicate the urgency \nof the situation and the scale of the crisis. The falling life \nexpectancies, the overcrowded morgues, the millions of orphans, the \ndeclines in GDP--I have tried to convey the extent of the disease's \nreach. In light of these facts, passing legislation that prevents our \nGovernment from stopping legal efforts to bring help and hope to the \nmillions affected by the epidemic seemed like the least that this body \ncould do. And yet we could not even accomplish that modest step. We \ncould not even agree to do no harm.\n  And I want to remind my colleagues that this issue will not go away. \nEven those least inclined to give this issue the attention it deserves \nwill not be able to ignore 5,500 deaths per day, and the social, \neconomic, and political ramifications of those deaths. This issue will \nnot go away as long as the HIV/AIDS crisis continues on its terrible \ncourse; this issue will not go away as long as the American public asks \ntough questions about why this Congress refuses to pass even modest \nmeasures like the Feinstein-Feingold amendment; and this issue will not \ngo away as long as I am in this Senate.\n  Most Members didn't have to face up, publicly, to the pressure of the \npharmaceutical industry and the far reaching implications of their \nchoice to support or not support the Feinstein-Feingold amendment. But \neventually we will all have to face the music, we will have to answer \nto our constituents and to our consciences.\n  The commitment of the major pharmaceutical companies to differential \npricing is perhaps promising, but it raises as many questions as it \nanswers. There is differential pricing today between the United States \nand Canada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Iowa.\n  There is differential pricing today between Canada and the United \nStates when it comes to pharmaceuticals, and that is a bad deal. \nDifferential pricing does not necessarily mean the affordable pricing \nof drugs.\n  But I appreciate the courtesy in being able to speak on this matter \nbecause I believe so strongly that the voices in opposition to this \nbill need to be heard. We did not do the job we needed to do to create \na real Africa trade bill. I regret that and will vote in opposition to \ncloture. I ask my colleagues to vote against cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nstate.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the Conference \n     Report to accompany H.R. 434, The African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act:\n         Trent Lott, Jon Kyl, Pat Roberts, Craig Thomas, Bill \n           Frist, Paul Coverdell, James Inhofe, Orrin Hatch, Don \n           Nickles, Larry Craig, Slade Gorton, Mitch McConnell, \n           Peter Fitzgerald, Chuck Grassley, Phil Gramm, and Mike \n           Crapo.\n\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nconference report to accompanying H.R. 434, the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are \nrequired under the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

On this vote, the yeas are 76, the nays are \n18. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, now that we are considering the \nconference report on the free trade bill, which I support, I point out \nwhile this legislation is designed to improve economic conditions in \nsub-Saharan Africa, many of these sub-Saharan countries have struggled \neconomically for years. As a result, that economic stagnation has also \nled to political unrest, civil wars, and bloody violence. Reducing \nviolence should be a high priority all across the globe, not only on \nthe African Continent but also a high priority in our country.\n  In this country, we are going to see this weekend hundreds of \nthousands of mothers and families in Washington marching against \nviolence as part of the Million Mom March.\n  My resolution simply commends the participants of the Million Mom \nMarch this weekend for rallying their communities to ask for sensible \ngun safety legislation. It calls on the Congress to complete action on \nthe juvenile justice bill, which will help promote safety and sensible \nlegislation, and I hope to offer that resolution before the Memorial \nDay recess.\n  I will be on The Mall for the march this Sunday with, I am sure, many \nof my colleagues on Mother's Day, May 14, 2000, with Americans from all \nwalks of life. In Washington and communities across the country, people \nwill join together to call for meaningful, commonsense gun safety \npolicies.\n  My resolution commends these families, citizens, members of religious \ncongregations, schools, community-based organizations, businesses, \npolitical, and cultural groups for coming together as a local and \nnational community to recognize the violence committed against our \nchildren from guns must cease.\n  I am going to continue to try my best to see if we can get action on \nthe stalled gun safety provision that American families want us to \npass.\n  It has now been more than a year since that terrible tragedy at \nColumbine High School on April 20, 1999. Students at that high school \nwere attacked in the halls of their school, in their classrooms. The \nresult everyone knows: 12 students dead, a teacher shot dead, another \n23 students and teachers injured.\n  I have to ask, just as they are asking--I hear it; and I know \ncolleagues of mine hear it--what has Congress done since that time, \nsince that awful day 1 year ago? What have we done to help reduce this \nviolence? As I see it, not much--virtually nothing. I think it is \nshameful.\n  It is shameful because shootings have not stopped. Columbine was the \nmost deadly school shooting. But there have been many others. It is \npeculiar, you often think--at least I do; I speak for myself--that we \nhave seen the ultimate outrage, one after another: Columbine; the \nchildren being led, hand in hand, by policemen out of the school in Los \nAngeles; young people at a prayer meeting in Texas--and still nothing \nhappens.\n  In February of this year, a little first grader was shot and killed \nby a classmate--a 6-year-old killing a 6-year-old. The child, Kayla \nRolland, a beautiful little girl, is taken from her family. There was \nno explanation except that this little boy got a gun and pulled the \ntrigger. In December of last year, a seventh grader in Fort Gibson, OK, \ntook a handgun to school and wounded four students. These are just the \nschool shootings since the terrible tragedy at Columbine.\n  Since 1997, there have been school shootings in Pearl, MS, West \nPaducah, KY, Jonesboro, AR, Edinboro, PA, and Springfield, OR.\n  There have been many other outrages outside our schools. Recently, a \nracist in Pittsburgh killed six people, and not too far from where we \nare standing, seven children were shot at the National Zoo.\n  Some of us have tried to address this violence. During the debate on \nthe juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed several gun safety \nmeasures, including my amendment to require criminal background checks \nat gun shows. It was a very close vote. The Vice President, in his role \nas President of the Senate, voted to break the 50-50 tie.\n  I remind my colleagues that the gun show amendment had bipartisan \nsupport. I did not get 50 votes without getting some of our colleagues \non the Republican side. I was pleased to have that support from \nSenators DeWine, Fitzgerald, Lugar, Voinovich, Warner, and Senator John \nChafee, who is no longer with us. They all voted for the amendment.\n  The final juvenile justice bill passed by a vote of 73-25. There was \nstrong bipartisan support for moving forward on juvenile crime and for \ntrying to reduce gun violence.\n  But what has happened since then? The gun lobby, and its \ncongressional allies, have stalled the bill. It has been held hostage \nin the conference committee for more than 9 months. We need to move \nforward on gun safety because stopping gun violence and keeping our \nkids safe is too important.\n  When you talk about a million women marching, while they would like \nit, they are not marching for equal pay; they are not marching for job \nopportunity; they are not talking about ``glass ceilings;'' they are \nnot talking about an invasion of the rights as we conventionally see \nthem. There is one issue that is more important than any other.\n\n  They say: Dear God, help us protect our children. When we send them \nto school in the morning, they are healthy and smiling. We want them to \ncome back from school the same way at the end of the day--even though \nthey now know that there are going to be metal detectors, there are \ngoing to be guards, and there are going to be additional measures to \ntry to maintain security.\n  Violence has won over much of our attention, certainly much of our \nbudget. But we have to work to help families, some of whom have already \npaid a terrible price for gun violence, and others who worry about it \neach and every day. Because the wounds that were received were not \nsimply the wounds that came from the gun attack, as horrible as that \nwas, but everybody in the vicinity, everybody in those schools, were \nwounded by those attacks, so was our Nation. It changed the tenure of \nthings. It made us all apprehensive.\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\n  So the gun safety provisions in the juvenile justice bill are simply \ncommonsense measures that Congress should have enacted a long time ago.\n  First, we have to close the gun show loophole. There is no question \nthat closing the gun show loophole will help prevent guns from getting \ninto the wrong hands, including the hands of schoolchildren.\n  The proof is in the testimony of Robyn Anderson before the Colorado \nLegislature. She is the young woman who went with Eric Harris and Dylan \nKlebold to the Tanner gun show in Adams County, CO. She bought two \nshotguns and a rifle for Klebold and Harris, three of the four guns \nthat they later used in their massacre, their shooting rampage at \nColumbine High School.\n  She testified, saying very clearly:\n\n       Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun \n     show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday. . \n     . . While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking \n     sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy \n     their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--\n     because there would be no paperwork or background check.\n\n  She said:\n\n       It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I \n     wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a \n     background check.\n\n  More recently Patty Nielson, a teacher at Columbine High School, \nspoke about the need to close the gun show loophole. She said:\n\n       All we know for sure is that if they [Klebold and Harris] \n     hadn't gotten these guns, they never would have killed those \n     innocent people. And the shocking thing is that they got \n     those guns so easily from the gun show.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New Jersey withhold? The leader is on \nthe floor to make a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I certainly would agree to that provided that I \nregain the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did not hear the request, but I understand \nthat Senator Lautenberg will yield so that I can proceed to a unanimous \nconsent request at this time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. I believe that we are \npostcloture now, and the subject for debate should be the African and \nCBI trade bill; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, that is correct. In a postcloture \nsituation, debate is supposed to be germane to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3862-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3862-S3880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 2521\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the military construction appropriations bill, S. 2521, \nimmediately following the adoption of the African trade conference \nreport; further, there be debate only relative to the bill, other than \nany amendments offered and cleared by the two managers, which would \ncontinue until 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, May 16, 2000.\n  This has been cleared with the Democratic leadership. We are \nextending it until this time on Tuesday at the request of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I just want to make sure \nthat those of us who want to speak about the Million Mom March that is \ncoming this weekend, where we may see a quarter of a million or more \nmoms here, and thousands more across the country, are not precluded \nunder this UC from speaking on it in morning business. If it requires \nan amendment to the UC, I would hope we could work that out. Otherwise, \nI will object because we could talk about a lot of things, but there is \nno question the Million Mom March deserves to be discussed. Senator \nLautenberg has a resolution praising the moms, and I think we should be \nable to discuss that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I might say, this does not preclude that. \nBut the rules of the Senate are that once you vote on cloture, and the \nfact that cloture was adopted, postcloture, the debate has to be on the \ncloture item.\n  If the Senators want to talk on this subject, we will be glad to talk \nwith them about the appropriate time to do it. But under the rules, the \nregular order will be that we have debate on this measure.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. After a vote on final passage, this would be entirely \nin order, and if a resolution is to be offered, then you could deal \nwith the resolution; but you could not deal with it now, is that right? \nI ask that question of the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I may, I inquire of the Senator, what was \nthe question?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. After we have a vote on final passage, then these \nmatters would be entirely in order, correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, after the vote on the conference \nreport, it would be debate relative to the pending bill only. But, \nagain, we always work together to find time for Senators to have \nmorning business and talk on subjects that they wish to talk about. But \nwe are trying to set up a process to complete the African trade bill \nand then move to the military construction appropriations bill. We have \nit worked out. Again, we will be glad to talk to Senators who may be \ninterested in a time when that could be done. But the rules do not \nallow that now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand. I am going to have to object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to see it. My understanding is we are going to \nMILCON and we will not necessarily have an opportunity to speak--maybe \nwe can put in a quorum call until I see that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from California to \nwithhold her objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She has already objected. The Senator from New \nJersey has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope we can work this out in some amicable \nway. The regular order is that debate now is on the African trade and \nCBI conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I know the \nSenator from New Jersey has the floor. In an effort to resolve this, I \nwonder if the leader would consider, prior to going to the military \nconstruction bill, that there be a period of time for Senators to \ndiscuss this march.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, again, I think we can work out a time to do \nthis. We have a problem in that the manager of the bill has a time \nproblem--or one of the managers--and she has to leave later on this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. REID. Also, there is nothing to prevent Senators from talking \nwhile the bill is pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. The point is, it would take consent in order for that to \nhappen. Generally speaking, as long as everybody is being considerate \nof each other--we haven't objected to Senator Lautenberg speaking. But \nhe would not be able to speak on the subject if Senators objected. He \nactually has spoken on both. I think we are making a mountain out of a \nmolehill here, and we ought to be able to work through this.\n  Mr. REID. We will continue to work on this.\n  Mr. LOTT. Should I renew the request at this time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again, we worked very hard on \nboth sides of the aisle to accommodate Senators on both sides of the \naisle, including their desires to speak, but also the managers' desire \nto do some of their work and still be able to make other commitments. \nIn this case, we are actually trying to protect the ranking member, \nSenator Murray, from Washington State. We ought to be able to work \nthrough that. I hope Senators will be understanding of the managers' \ndesire to make some progress on the MILCON bill today. But at their \nrequest, which I think is reasonable, we will strike the ``relative to \nthe bill'' part of the request and I will renew it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the military \nconstruction appropriations bill, S. 2521,\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nimmediately following the adoption of the African trade conference \nreport, and further, there be debate only, other than any amendments \noffered and cleared by the two managers, which would continue until \n2:15 p.m. on Tuesday, May 16, 2000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid and all Members. \nFurther, I assure the minority leader that I don't intend to file a \ncloture motion on this bill this week. I think we can make progress on \nmilitary construction. It has broad support because of what is in the \nbase bill and also because it has the emergency funding for Kosovo and \nfuel for the military. I believe we can complete this bill this week.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the majority leader will yield, when would he \nexpect that the MILCON bill will come up and be available for debate?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we will be able to finish the debate remaining on \nthe Africa trade bill, and sometime between 12 and 1 o'clock get a vote \non that, and then we would go to MILCON. The managers would like to \nspend, obviously, some time on the substance of that, and then we will \ngo forward from there.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would there be any likelihood of a vote tomorrow on \nthat?\n  Mr. LOTT. No. We will vote on the Africa trade bill today, but then \nwe will go to debate only on MILCON, and that would go until 2:15 until \nTuesday. There would be no votes on that until Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield? We have a couple more speakers on \nthis side. Senator Harkin is one of them and he said he would be \nwilling to speak after the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will speak after the vote.\n  Mr. REID. One of our members is tied up in judiciary, or we could be \nfinished by noon. We will try to get him back here and speed this thing \nup.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the teacher, Patty Nielson, from \nColumbine is right in her statement. It is shocking that anyone can get \na gun so easily at a gun show. The American people understand this \nissue. In every poll, more than 80 percent of the American people \nsupport background checks at gun shows. In fact, two-thirds of the gun \nowners--66 percent--support background checks on all gun sales at gun \nshows. Some of the other loopholes in our gun laws are also shocking. \nThere is no reason why we should allow large-capacity ammunition clips \nto be imported. We banned them from being manufactured in this country, \nbut they can still be brought in, imported.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like the Senator to respond to these questions. I \nwant to put the importance of this resolution in context.\n  The Senator mentioned that it was April 10 of last year that we had \nthe Columbine tragedy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. April 20.\n  Mr. DURBIN. April 20, 1999. And if I am not mistaken, 12 or 13 high \nschool students were killed, and more were injured during the course of \nthat time. America was fixed on this event as no other event, despite \nall the gun violence, when we consider it could happen at a high school \nsuch as Columbine.\n  Is the Senator from New Jersey able to tell me what the response was \nof the Senate to that tragedy?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I call the Senate to order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The debate must be germane to the African \ntrade conference report.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is regular order.\n  Mr. President, I have the right to establish the connection between \nthe trade industry, and that is how I started my remarks. The fact is \nthat one of the purposes of getting this trade matter into law is to \nmake sure the countries we deal with that are having severe economic \nproblems, where we see starving populations, where we see human rights \nignored, corruption rampant--that is the mission of what we are doing \nthis day. Frankly, I am not doing it exclusively so we can do more \nbusiness. We would like to do more business.\n  The fact is that trade has another significant implication. It is a \nforeign policy implication. How do we deal with it? When we look \nthrough the television cameras today, we see people with malnutrition, \ndisease, starving. We are hoping we can do something to try to \nalleviate those conditions.\n  Why is it out of order? I ask the Parliamentarian, why is it out of \norder to talk about the subjects that relate at home to the same things \nwe are trying to do to help overseas? I don't understand it. I must say \nthat I have to pose that to the Parliamentarian.\n  We are never so strict that you can't talk about matters that relate \nindirectly. Or are we going to measure it word by word what is being \nsaid here? I think it is an invasion, I must say, of the Senator's \nright to speak on an issue.\n  I am not finished with remarks on the trade commentary. I intend to \nclose with the trade commentary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate must be germane to the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, everybody's good friend here, wishes to ask a question of the \nmajority leader. I would like Senator Moynihan to ask him to respond \nwith the assurance that I get the floor, if we abandon the debate now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I ask the distinguished and \nforbearing majority leader, if we have a vote on the African trade \nbill, if the Senator from New Jersey could speak to the matter he is \ndiscussing?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nrequest we agreed to that he would be able to do that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That I be able to recapture--we are asking the \nmajority leader. He speaks very clearly. I have the assurance that I \nwill be recognized immediately after to finish the comments that I was \nmaking.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask Senator Lautenberg if he can give us \nsome idea about how long he thinks that might take. The reason I am \ninquiring again is that we do have managers of the bill who have a time \nproblem. I would like to encourage the Senator to talk with them and \nget some time agreements so they can move forward with the military \nconstruction bill. I feel as if they will be able to work something out \nwith you.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have two of our Senators who want to \nspeak on the African free trade bill. One of the Senators wishes to \nspeak after the vote. I placed a call and spoke to the other Senator. \nHe is going to call me back in a few minutes as to whether he could do \nthe same. If that is the case, the vote will take place as soon as the \nleader wants it on the Africa trade bill, and then they can speak after \nthat.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am not managing the bill. I know there is \nat least one more Senator on the floor who wants to speak on the trade \nbill. I understand there may be one or two on this side. We have about \nfour or five speakers.\n  Mr. REID. We have three on our side.\n  Mr. LOTT. And a couple on our side.\n  Mr. REID. One of the Senators wants to speak for 45 minutes on our \nside. That is why I was trying to see if we could work it out so she \ncould speak after the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. What is our status, Mr. President? I am going to ask \nfor a vote on germaneness, if the interpretation stands.\n  I thought we had an accommodation with the majority leader --I was \ntrying to be helpful--to give us a chance to finish the debate on the \nsubjects as I described, and to make way for the vote to take place in \nan expeditious fashion but guaranteeing me by unanimous consent now to \nbe able to get the floor after the vote on the trade bill has taken \nplace. If that is the case, I will yield the floor so we can get on to \nthe business.\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n  I would like that representation to be made now and clearly \nunderstood.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, as I understand it, the debate now \npostcloture has to be on the African-CBI trade bill. After that vote \noccurs, which shouldn't be too long from now, we would go to the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. I assume that Senators who \nwish to speak on this subject will want to talk with the managers of \nthat MILCON bill, including the Senator from Washington on the other \nside of the aisle, who has a time problem, and work something out. I \nassume you can get that worked out.\n\n  I didn't know there was a consent that had been asked for that would \nguarantee that or how long that would be. And I am not sure the Senator \nwants to do that until he talks to Senator Murray to see what her \nsituation is.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as the majority leader knows very \nwell, there is some dispute on this issue. And I have the floor. I have \ntried to conduct myself as the rules provide.\n  What I am asking the majority leader now is, if I propound a \nunanimous consent request, I be recognized after the vote on the trade \nbill and that I be permitted to speak at that time, to regain the \nfloor. I think it is a reasonable request based on the debate that is \ngoing on now. Otherwise, we are going to have more delays than we would \nlike to see. I want to get the African trade bill out of the way.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't believe there has been a unanimous \nconsent request propounded. If there is one propounded, will the \nSenator be willing to include in that a time period for how long it \nwould take? If he takes a couple of hours, he has a major problem \nbecause of his own Member's schedule. If he needs 10 minutes, then I \nthink we could do that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a couple of requests. I would try to do it in \n40 minutes, and work on even compressing that, I say to the leader--but \n40 minutes maximum.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, if there is such a thing \ngoing on right now, some of us want to speak. If I may say, I happen to \nbe in favor of the African trade bill. I am willing to speak after the \nvote. I just want to make sure we are allowed to speak on the African \ntrade bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. The African trade bill? Why don't you speak now?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to speak now. But I don't have the floor \nright now, and I can't get the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We can release the floor, if the leader will give me \nconsent, and we can move on to the business.\n  Mr. REID. As I understand what the Senator from New Jersey said, he \nand the other two speakers would be willing to agree to a 40-minute \ntime agreement today. Is that the correct way I understood the Senator \nfrom New Jersey?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish the Senators would at least talk to \nthe Senator on their side of the aisle as to the time problem and see \nwhat Senator Murray has to say because I feel a little funny here. I am \nprotecting Senator Murray's desire to do her part early. I think we \ncould, if the Senator would agree to do this after Senator Murray \nspeaks, and opening statements are made--I wish the Senator would talk \nto her we could agree to that. I presume it would be about 3:30 this \nafternoon, or so.\n  Mr. REID. I can't speak to this. Senator Boxer would be happy to talk \nto our friend. I think 40 minutes would probably do it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to urge the Senator to talk to Senator Murray \nand see if that is agreeable with her, and to the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We want to accommodate. I tell the leader that. \nPerhaps we can move it along by saying that after the opening \nstatements by the managers--they introduce their managers' amendment--I \nthen be able to regain the floor for the 40 minutes about which we are \ntalking. I think that will allow us to move things along at a good \npace.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is that propounded as a unanimous-consent request or \nsimply the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was. It was a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it was already agreed to. You already said \nit was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the Senator has the right to reserve the \nright to object.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Lautenberg \nbe given 30 minutes after the opening statements and the managers' \namendments are offered on the military construction bill, so we can \nspeak on the subject about which he has been speaking this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to, first of all, support \nenthusiastically the Trade and Development Act of 2000 known as the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  I thank Chairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, and the staffs for their \nhard work to retain the amendment I offered on child labor. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation not only for the trade benefits it \npromises to African and Caribbean countries, but for the benefits it \npromises to another important and often neglected group, the world's \nchildren.\n  This bill includes a provision I introduced last year in the form of \nan amendment when we first considered this trade measure. As many of \nyou will recall, my amendment, cosponsored by Senators Helms and \nWellstone, sought to ensure that beneficiaries of U.S. trade \npreferences fulfill their commitments to eliminate the use of abusive \nand exploitative child labor.\n  My amendment passed the Senate by a resounding vote of 96-0. The \nprovision contained in this conference report is very simple and \nstraightforward.\n  It builds on the international consensus that came out of the ILO \nconference in Geneva last June in which the delegates unanimously \nadopted the Convention to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n  This provision simply states that in order to be eligible for the \ntrade benefits in this bill, the Generalized System of Preferences, the \nCaribbean Basin Initiatives, the African Trade Preferences, a country \nmust implement its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child \nlabor as established by ILO Convention 182 for the Elimination of the \nWorst Forms of Child Labor--it is that simple.\n  ILO Convention 182 defines the worst forms of child labor as all \nforms of slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, the sale or \ntrafficking of children, including forced or compulsory recruitment of \nchildren for use in armed conflict, child prostitution, children \nproducing or trafficking in narcotic drugs, or any other work which, by \nits nature or the circumstances in which it is carried out, is likely \nto harm the health, safety, or morals of the children.\n  This chart illustrates the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child \nLabor, including child slavery, bondage, prostitution, use of children \nin pornography, trafficking in children, forced recruitment in armed \nconflict, recruiting children in the production or sale of narcotics, \nand hazardous work. These are all the items that are covered in the \nbill before us.\n  For the first time in history, the world will speak with one voice in \nopposition to abusive and exploitative child labor. Countries from \nacross the political, economic, and religious spectrum--from Jews to \nMuslims, from Buddhists to Christians--came together to proclaim \nunequivocally that\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nabusive and exploitative child labor is a practice that will not be \ntolerated and must be abolished. Those are the exact words from the \nconvention.\n  So after ILO Convention 182 was adopted unanimously, gone is the \nargument that abusive and exploitative child labor is an acceptable \npractice because of a country's economic circumstances; gone is the \nargument that abusive and exploitative child labor is acceptable \nbecause of cultural traditions; and gone is the argument that this form \nof child labor is a necessary evil on the road to economic development.\n  When this convention was adopted and approved, the United States and \nthe international community as a whole laid those arguments to rest and \nlaid the groundwork to begin the process of ending the scourge of \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Additionally, for the first time in history, the U.S. tripartite \ngroup of the ILO, which consists of representatives from government, \nbusiness, and labor, unanimously agreed on the final version of the \nconvention. This is the first time in history this has happened.\n  For the first time ever in our history, the legislation we have \nbefore us--the African trade bill--will codify in U.S. trade law a \nsimple notion: If you want the trade benefits outlined in this bill, \nyou must implement commitments on abusive and exploitative child labor \ninto which your country has freely entered.\n  Let me be clear. What I mean by abusive and exploitative child labor \nis not a kid helping on the family farm. It is not a kid doing work \nafter school. There is nothing wrong with that. I worked in my youth. I \nbet you probably did too, Mr. President, as all of us did. That is not \nwhat we are speaking about.\n  The Convention the ILO adopted last year deals with children chained \nto looms, who handle dangerous chemicals, ingest metal dust, are forced \nto sell illegal drugs, are forced into child prostitution, are forced \ninto armed conflict, are forced to work in factories where furnace \ntemperatures exceed 1,500 degrees. It deals with children who are \nforced to work to pay off their parents' debts in a form of bondage \nthat deserves to be called what it is, outright slavery.\n\n  According to the ILO, Latin America and the Caribbean has about 17 \nmillion children doing this type of work, Africa has about 80 million \nchildren, Asia has about 153 million, and there are about a half \nmillion in Oceania. That totals about 250 million children worldwide \nwho are working--most full time. Millions of these kids are under 10 \nyears of age. Some are as young as 6 or 7.\n  Can you imagine your first-grade son or daughter, or your first-grade \ngrandson or granddaughter, working 12 to 14 hours a day in horrific \nconditions making just pennies a day, if anything? Can anyone say this \nis acceptable for any child anywhere in the world?\n  These children are forced to work many times with no protective \nequipment. They endure long hours, as I said, for little or no pay. \nThey simply work only for the economic gain of others. They are denied \nan education and the opportunity to grow and to develop.\n  Again, this is in sharp contrast to any kind of a part-time job after \nschool for spending money or to buy the latest CD. That is not what we \nare talking about. We are talking about kids working in the worst \nconditions you can imagine. I am not talking about teenagers, I am \ntalking about kids under the age of 10.\n  A lot of times, people will say: Well, that is just what you heard. \nBut I have had firsthand experience and exposure to this.\n  About 2 years ago, Rosemary Gutierrez, of my staff, and I traveled to \nPakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh to investigate and look at the \nissue of abusive and exploitative child labor. We were in Katmandu, \nNepal. We had previously been told of a young man who had worked as a \nchild laborer for a number of years. He escaped, and through various \nand sundry means he became involved actively in working against child \nlabor in his home country of Nepal.\n  Through various contacts, we contacted this young man and asked him \nif there was any way possible we could get in to see a carpet weaving \nfacility where kids are working.\n  As others told us, the problem is, if you let a factory owner know \nyou are coming to inspect, or to visit, they take all of the kids out \nthe back door. They hide them. They disperse them around. When you get \nthere, there are no kids. They do this all the time.\n  So the only way we could ever get a feel for what was going on was to \nsurreptitiously and under cover try to enter one of these places. That \nis what my staff person, Rosemary Gutierrez, and I did with this young \nman from Nepal.\n  We got in an unmarked car. It was on a Sunday evening. He knew about \nthis one plant on the outskirts of town where he knew one of the guards \nat the gate. He thought he had found out the owner of this factory was \ngoing to be gone. He knew the guard at the gate through I don't know \nwhat circumstances. He assured us, if he went out there, he would be \nable to sneak us in so we could see firsthand.\n  Imagine, we are in this unmarked car. My staff person, Rosemary \nGutierrez, and another person, about five of us, I think, were cramped \nin this small, unmarked car. We drive out to this place on the edge of \ntown, darkness has fallen. We walk up to this gate with an armed guard.\n\n  What is the first thing we see? A sign in both Nepalese and English. \nI took a picture of it. This is my picture. It says: Child labor under \nthe age of 14 is strictly prohibited. Right there in front of the gate. \nIt is in English and Nepalese.\n  Had we notified this plant owner we were coming, there would not have \nbeen one kid in this place. However, we came, the guard spoke with this \nyoung Nepalese man and let us through the gate. We walked down a back \nalley for about 15 yards, took a turn, and there was a building. We \nwent in the door of the building that was all closed up. It is Sunday \nnight about 7 o'clock in the evening. It is dark and wintertime.\n  We walk in the door and here is what we saw. This is only one \npicture, I have many others. This picture was taken by my staff person. \nThat is me in the picture, I wanted to show proof positive of what was \nhappening. Here are these kids. You cannot see them because the camera \nflash doesn't go back far. There are dozens of kids working at these \nlooms. It is nighttime and kids are working the looms. Since I had this \nyoung Nepalese man with me who spoke Nepalese, they were talking. The \nkids were very nervous but I talked to this young child and the best we \ncould determine he is 7 years old. We talked to this young girl shown \nin another picture and determined she was eight or nine years old. \nRemember, this is in the evening, they have been working all day in \nthis closed building. I didn't know it at the time, but when you make \nthese carpets, all the dust gets in the air; the place is dusty, anyone \ncan see all the fine particles and the children have no protective gear \nwhatever. We saw this firsthand.\n  To finish my story, it turned out the owner was not gone. After we \nhad been there for about 10 minutes, the owner shows up and, of course, \nhe is beside himself. I told him who we were and he asked us--not \npolitely--to get out. Of course, we left--but not until we had the \ndocumented proof with photos. As I said, this is only one of many that \nI have. My staff person and a couple of other people were there to \nwitness the kids, kids taken away from their countryside families. \nThere was a barracks nearby where they live. They eat their meals \nthere, they sleep there, they work here. This is maybe 50 or 100 feet \naway from the barracks in a compound which they cannot leave.\n  Tell me they are not slaves. They have no right to leave, they have \nno right to go home, they have no one protecting them. They are kept \nlocked in a compound day and night, forced to work on these looms. \nPlease, someone tell me that this ought to be tolerated in free trade.\n  This legislation before the Senate, the African trade bill, contains \nthis provision that says from now on, no trade preferences to any \ncountry that doesn't implement what is already agreed to, implement the \nprovisions of ILO 182.\n  Our goal is not to enact punitive sanctions on our trading partners. \nWe are trying to use trade to help them emerge from poverty. Rather, it \nis to encourage and persuade them to build on the prosperity that comes \nwith\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\ntrade and to lift their standards up. Exploitative child labor in other \ncountries does a couple of things. First, it puts competing firms and \nworkers at a disadvantage in the United States and other countries that \ndo not allow child labor. This legislation before the Senate codifies \nfor the first time ever in U.S. trade legislation the requirement that \ncountries who wish to benefit from trade preferences must actually do \nwhat they have already committed to do, and that is to eliminate the \nworst forms of child labor.\n  Additionally, the Department of Labor will produce an annual report \non what countries are doing in order to live up to their commitments to \neliminate child labor. Furthermore, there will be a public hearing \nannually so that nongovernmental organizations, trade unions, and \nbusinesses will have an opportunity to comment. No longer will it be \nsufficient for a country to be merely ``taking steps'' to address one \nor more of the internationally recognized core labor standards to be \ndeemed eligible for preferences under GSP or under the African \nCaribbean Trade Act.\n\n  Once the President signs this bill into law, a country's efforts to \neliminate the worse forms of child labor will be a mandatory \nconsideration for determining eligibility for trade benefits. This is, \nindeed, an important development. In the past, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, in its implementation and enforcement of the \ngeneralized system of preferences, I believe, has abused the language \nin the statute calling for taking steps to afford worker rights, \nincluding child labor. The USTR has interpreted that as any one gesture \nmade by a country would be enough to satisfy the requirements of the \ngeneralized system of preferences.\n  In other words, there is a list of five internationally recognized \nworkers' rights provisions: the right of association; the right to \norganize and bargain collectively; a prohibition on the use of any form \nof forced or compulsory labor; a minimum age for the employment of \nchildren; and acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum \nwages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.\n  If a country previously had taken a step in any one of those areas, \nthey would get GSP. If they had the right of association but still had \nchildren working they could get GSP. This is wrong.\n  Now, after 15 years, we have a universal standard. ILO Convention 182 \nis a well-defined and internationally accepted standard that will be \nthe criterion used in granting any country U.S. trade benefits. ILO \nConvention 182 will hold everyone to one real and enforceable standard \nalready agreed to by 174 countries.\n  I believe in free trade. But I also believe in a level playing field. \nU.S. workers, workers in other countries, cannot compete with slaves. \nCall it what you want, dress it up with all kinds of fancy words, but \nthese kids are working under slave-like conditions, and they do not \nhave a choice. That is the definition of slavery.\n  When a child is exploited for the economic gain of others, that child \nloses, their family loses, their country loses, and the world loses. It \nis bad economics and bad development strategy. Nations that engage in \nabusive child labor make bad trading partners.\n  A nation cannot achieve prosperity on the backs of its children. \nThere is simply no place in the new global economy for the slave labor \nof children.\n  Again, I point out, this is the kind of work we are talking about. \nThis is 8-year-old Mohammad Ashraf Irfan, making surgical instruments \nin Sialkot, Pakistan. He is working with dangerous tools and he is \nmaking surgical equipment. If you are going to go into a hospital and \nhave an operation, you are probably going to have one of these used on \nyou, made by an 8-year-old kid with no hope for his future.\n  Here is a young Indian girl carrying construction material. This is \nthe kind of abusive and exploitative child labor we are talking about.\n  Recently, I came across a startling statistic. According to the \nUNICEF report entitled ``The State of the World's Children, 1999,'' \nnearly 1 billion people will begin this 21st century unable to read a \nbook or sign their name because they are illiterate. This is a formula \nfor instability, violence, and conflict.\n  Nearly one-sixth of all humanity, 3\\1/2\\ times the population of the \nUnited States, will be functionally illiterate on the eve of the new \nmillennium. That is shocking. And the main reason for this appalling \nsituation is that many of these people who are adults now were forced \nto work as children instead of attending school.\n  The children making pennies a day and denied an education will never \nbuy a computer or the software for it. They will never purchase a CD or \na VCR to play American movies. By allowing abusive and exploitative \nlabor to continue, we not only doom the child to a future of poverty \nand destitution, we doom future markets for American goods and \nservices.\n  The markets of tomorrow are taking shape today. If we want American \ngoods to be purchased the world over, people not only have to be able \nto afford them, they have to be educated enough to be able to use them.\n  Some have said labor issues should not be dealt with in trade \nmeasures. I think this is wrongheaded thinking. We should be addressing \nthese issues on trade measures. After all, we are ultimately talking \nabout our trade policy.\n  Not long ago, agreements on intellectual property rights were not \nconsidered measures to be addressed by trade agreements. In the \nbeginning, just a few years ago, only tariffs and quotas were addressed \nby GATT because they were the most visible trade-distorting practices. \nBut over the years, GATT evolved to include intellectual property \nrights and services which have become integral parts of our trade \nagreements.\n  Now I understand the WTO, the World Trade Organization, will consider \nrules dealing with foreign direct investment and competition policy to \nbe part of trade agreements. If we can protect a song, if we can \nprotect a CD, certainly we can protect children.\n  We cannot, as a nation, ignore this. In 1993, the Senate put itself \non record in opposition to the exploitation of children by passing a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that I submitted. In 1994, as chairman \nof the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nI requested the Department of Labor to begin a series of reports on \nchild labor. These reports now consist of five volumes with a sixth to \nbe released in a few days. They represent the most comprehensive \ndocumentation ever assembled by the U.S. Government on this issue.\n  Last year, President Clinton issued an Executive Order prohibiting \nthe U.S. Government from procuring items made by forced or indentured \nchild labor. I congratulate President Clinton for taking that step.\n\n  I am also pleased to say that the United States was one of the very \nfirst countries to ratify ILO Convention 182. We did it in near record \ntime, and President Clinton signed this. I was there in Seattle at the \nWTO conference last December. Again, I compliment and commend President \nClinton for his bold action in signing this, the U.S. being one of the \nfirst countries to sign on to ILO Convention 182.\n  I also compliment and commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Chairman Helms, for not only cosponsoring my amendment but \nalso for his work in getting the ILO convention through his committee \nand through the Senate in record time last year. Chairman Helms did a \ngreat service to this effort to eliminate these worst forms of child \nlabor around the world. I commend Chairman Helms for his leadership in \nthis area.\n  I am not just talking about the ratification. I am talking about the \nstandards that were established by this convention that were \nunanimously accepted in Geneva. There was not one vote against it. As I \nsaid, the Tripartite Advisory Panel on International Labor Standards \nsays the United States already meets the standards set by this \nconvention.\n  Last, some say this is a restraint of trade. Nonsense. We already \nhave laws on our books that prohibit the importation of ivory. We have \nlaws on our books that prohibit the importation of goods made with \nprison labor. We have laws on our books that prohibit the importation \nof counterfeit goods that don't respect intellectual property rights \nsuch as pirated CDs. Again, if we can protect ivory and pirated CDs, we \ncan protect. I am pleased the United States has taken a major step \nforward with this trade bill. We are sending a strong message to our \ntrading partners. There is no place in the global\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\neconomy for countries engaging in abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will support this conference report with \nan overwhelming vote. I believe this measure will give hundreds of \nthousands of children hope for a brighter future. As someone who has \nbeen working on this issue of abusive and exploitative child labor for \nover a decade, I cannot help but feel proud the United States has \nspoken in such a clear and unequivocal voice that engaging children in \nthis type of slave labor will not be tolerated in our trade policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    textiles and apparel provisions\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, sections 112 and 211 of the act will \ncreate new import programs for apparel produced in the Sub-Saharan and \nCBI countries which have been carefully crafted to bring significant \nbenefits both to those regions and to the U.S. textile and apparel \nindustry if the new programs are administered as intended. These \nprograms could, however, fail to provide the intended benefits if they \nare not administered as intended.\n  Obviously, the intent of the Senate managers in crafting the textile \nand apparel provisions in sections 112 and 211 is very important, and \nis worth discussing in some detail as we consider the conference \nagreement today.\n  I would now ask my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, if it is his understanding that the conference agreement \nadopted the operative provisions of the Senate bill commonly referred \nto as ``807A'' and ``809'' with respect to both Africa and the \nCaribbean Basin, provisions which afford duty-free and quota-free \ntreatment to apparel articles made from American fabric.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the distinguished Senator from Iowa would indulge \nme further, with regard to the provisions popularly referred as \n``807A'' and ``809'' in both the Caribbean Basin and Africa trade \nmeasures, do I understand correctly that the conference agreement \nadopted the operative language of these provisions as reported out of \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is my understanding correct that those provisions, as \nreported out by the Finance Committee and passed by the Senate, \nrequired that all textile components of such apparel articles be made \nfrom American fabric?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct. The Finance Committee reported \nout the Africa and Caribbean Basin measures separately. The committee \nreports on each of those measure addresses this issue explicitly. The \nreports make clear that those provisions commonly referred to as \n``807A'' and ``809'' are to be administered in a manner consistent with \nthe then-current regulations regarding the ``Special Access Program'' \nfor textile and apparel articles from the Caribbean and Andean Trade \nPreference Act countries. The report, in fact, expressly cites the \nFederal Register notice dated April 3, 1998, that sets out the rules \nthat the Committee intended would apply. The language of the reports \nthen restates the language of the Federal Register notice, concluding \nthat the requirements that products must be assembled from fabric \nformed in the United States applies to all textile components of the \nassembled products, including linings and pocketing.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. When the Act requires yarn to be ``wholly formed'' in \nthe United States, am I correct that the intention of the managers is \nto require that all processes necessary to convert fibers into yarns--\ni.e., spinning, extruding--be performed in the United States?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct. While the fibers need not be \nmanufactured in the United States, let me be clear that it is the \nmanagers' intent that the man-made core of a wrapped yarn must \noriginate in the United States and that all mechanical processes \nnecessary to convey fibers into yarns must be performed in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I understand that it is the managers' intent that \nunder the Caribbean Basin portion of the Act, an apparel article \ncontaining elastomeric yarns, including elestomeric filament yarns, \nshall be eligible for the de minimis rule set forth in section 211 only \nif such yarns, whether covered or uncovered, are wholly formed in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Now, with respect to the provisions of the Africa and \nCaribbean Basin programs that deal with fabric or yarn not widely \navailable in commercial quantities, am I correct that it is the intent \nof the managers that these provisions should be administered in the \nsame manner, as practicable, as the short supply procedures in the \nNAFTA?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is the case.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. With respect to the so-called ``809'' benefits the \nAfrica and CBI programs, is it the intent of managers that apparel \narticles remain eligible for duty-free and quota-free treatment when \nthe fabric is cut both in the United States and the beneficiary \ncountries?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct, provided that all the other \nrequirements of both the 807A and 809 provisions are satisfied. This \nincludes the requirement that U.S. thread be used in the assembly of \nthe apparel article.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have one final question regarding the so-called 809 \nprovisions of both the Africa and Caribbean Basin measures. Am I \ncorrect that it is the managers' intent that these provisions do not \npermit dying or finishing of the fabrics to be performed in countries \nother than the United States or the beneficiary countries?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to thank my colleague for his time and \nattention to these important questions.\n\n\n              non-accrual experience method of accounting\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Tennessee in a colloquy with the distinguished Managers \nof this legislation, the Trade and Development Act of 2000.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Virginia \nand I direct the distinguished Managers to a matter that relates to a \nrevenue raising provision that was considered in the conference on the \nTrade and Development Act of 2000, but ultimately was not included in \nthe final agreement. The revenue raising provision limited the non-\naccrual experience method of accounting.\n  The related matter is the application of the formula in the Treasury \nRegulations on the non-accrual experience method of accounting to \nqualified personal service providers.\n  The formula contained in Temp. Reg. Section 1.448-2T does not clearly \nreflect the amount of income that, based on experience, will not be \ncollected by many qualified personal service providers, especially for \nthose where significant time elapses between the rendering of the \nservice and a final determination that the account will not be \ncollected. Providers of qualified personal services should not be \nsubject to a formula that requires the payment of taxes on receivables \nthat will not be collected.\n  To this end, we believe the Treasury Secretary should amend the \ntemporary regulations to provide a more accurate determination for such \nqualified personal service providers of the amount to be excluded from \nincome that, based on the taxpayer's experience, will not be collected. \nIn amending such regulations, the Secretary should consider providing \nflexibility with respect to the formula used to compute the amount of \nthe exclusion to address the different factual situations of taxpayers.\n  Do the distinguished Managers agree with our view of the temporary \nregulations and the action the Treasury Secretary should take?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with distinguished colleagues from Tennessee \nand Virginia that Temp. Reg. Section 1.448-2T presents problems for \nqualified service providers. Furthermore, the Treasury Secretary should \nconsider amending these temporary regulations to provide a more \naccurate method.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I concur with my distinguished colleagues from Iowa.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, S. 434, the Trade and Development Act of \n2000 Conference Report breaks important new ground in trade \nlegislation. For the first time, in exchange for granting unilateral \ntrade benefits to a country,\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nthe President must give equal consideration to whether a country has \nmet both trade criteria and labor standards.\n  For example, before the favorable trade benefits available in this \nlegislation can be granted, the President must determine not only that \na country has demonstrated a commitment to undertaking its WTO \nobligations on or ahead of schedule, and the extent to which a country \nprovides protection of intellectual property rights, but also the \nextent to which the country provides internationally recognized worker \nrights.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased the Conference Report retained the Levin-\nMoynihan amendment requiring the President to take into consideration \nthe extent to which a country provides internationally recognized \nworker rights, including child labor, collective bargaining, the use of \nforced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and labor \nstandards before the trade benefit can be granted to a Caribbean Basin \nbeneficiary country.\n  The Levin-Moynihan provision sets an important precedent of promoting \nstandards on such things as child labor, collective bargaining, use of \nforced or coerced labor, occupational health and safety and other \nworker rights as part of our trade relationships by considering \nprogress toward those goals when unilaterally granting a trade benefit.\n  Most CBI countries are signatories of the International Labor \nOrganization conventions. Considering the extent to which these \ncountries abide by their own international obligations is the least we \ncan do when considering whether they deserve to receive unilateral \ntrade preferences from us.\n  The bill is further strengthened by another important precedent \nsetting provision. The Conference Report also retained the Harkin \namendment on Child Labor. As a result, this legislation, for first \ntime, codifies in U.S. trade law ILO convention language on Child Labor \nby amending the Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify that the ban on articles \nmade with forced and/or indentured labor includes those articles made \nwith forced and/or indentured child labor. It also, for the first time, \nconditions U.S. trade benefits on meeting child labor standards by \nadding a new eligibility criterion to the Generalized System of \nPreferences, which also apply to the eligibility criteria under the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act, to provide that the President shall \nnot designate a country for benefits if it has not implemented its \nobligations to eliminate the worst forms of child labor.\n  I hope this legislation will help to bring about greater economic \ndevelopment and democracy to the important regions of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica and the Caribbean. Because of this hope, and because of the \nprovisions I have mentioned above, I will vote for this bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report to H.R. 434, the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. I \nbelieve passage of this legislation is important to cement what has \nbecome the broad, bi-partisan consensus of this body: trade is a key \nfactor in raising living standards in developing countries, and is of \nprimary importance in exporting to those countries key American values \nof human rights, democratization, peace and stability.\n  Mr. President, in supporting this legislation I do not suggest that \ntrade alone is a panacea for the many difficulties in developing \ncountries. Simply opening the door to trade with African countries will \nnot enable many of these countries to enter the international community \nof developed nations. Many countries in Africa simply lack the basic \nhealth, education and economic infrastructures to take advantage of the \nbenefits this legislation provides.\n  Trade and investment initiatives for Africa will not succeed without \nsubstantial investments in developing Africa's human resources.\n  For those sub-Saharan African countries who labor under a crippling \ndebt burden, some measure must be taken to assist them to break free \nfrom reliance on debt provided by donor countries. Debt relief should \nbe the highest priority of donor countries, including the United \nStates, seeking to promote African economic development.\n  This legislation should therefore be hailed not as an end in itself, \nbut as a good beginning to a longer-term policy which, under U.S. \nleadership, begins to draw Africa more closely into the global \ncommunity. We need to begin now to ensure that U.S. policy will do more \nto promote regional economic cooperation and integration in Africa; \nU.S. Policymakers, including those in this body, should undertake \nbroader and more regular consultation with Africa's governmental, non-\ngovernmental and private sector leadership, and we should ensure that \nthe eligibility standards contained in this legislation carefully \naccount for differing levels of development. To that end, we should be \ncareful not to rely too closely on conditions such as those employed by \nthe International Monetary Fund in applying eligibility standards under \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, the importance of this legislation is both its \nhistoric significance as the first major piece of trade legislation in \ntwelve years and its precedential significance in marking the \nimportance of trade benefits as a ``carrot'' and not a ``stick'' to \nbring international social and living standards in developing standards \nmore close to international norms.\n  Rather than holding this legislation hostage to concerns which can \nand must be addressed in the longer-term. I would urge my colleagues to \ntake this first step on the road of a broader, more sensible policy \ntoward the developing world, and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is with mixed feelings that I will vote \nfor passage of the Trade and Development Act of 2000.\n  No one can look upon the scenes of human suffering in Africa today \nwithout recognizing the need for action. Whether it is the AIDS \nepidemic or the violence in Sierra Leone, the floods in Mozambique or \nthe unacceptably slow progress toward democratization, Africa \nchallenges the conscience--and threatens the health and security--of \nthe rest of the world.\n  We must respond.\n  The bill before us today offers an initial response to the many \ninterconnected problems on the African continent. I agree with the \nbasic premise of the bill, that promoting sustainable economic growth, \nled by more open access to American markets, must be a key element in \nany strategy for Africa.\n  And I must add here, Mr. President, that it is time for us to provide \nsimilar market openings to the nations of the Caribbean, who have faced \na real disadvantage since the passage of NAFTA.\n  But I will focus my brief remarks today on Africa, because when the \nlegislation before us today was initially proposed, it offered us the \nopportunity to formulate a comprehensive policy for Africa. At the end \nof the day, I am afraid that what remains is only a first step.\n  Mr. President, compared to the crushing problems facing the peoples \nof Africa, this bill is really very modest in terms of what it offers \nAfrican countries in terms of duty free exports to the United States.\n  While opening our markets must be part of any program of economic \nassistance for Africa, we should not mistake this bill for a complete \npolicy.\n  It may be that this bill has more symbolic value, as evidence of \nrenewed interest in Africa, than any material impact on the many \ndifficult and interconnected problems facing economic development \nthere. Certainly, we should not let this bill become an excuse for \nself-congratulation or complacency.\n  Some provisions, however, I hope will enable the United States \ngovernment to enhance its trade and investment relationship with \ncountries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The conference report directs the \nAdministration to convene an annual trade and economic forum with the \ntrade ministers of African countries. The key here is that in order to \nexpand trade and investment, there must be a climate within African \ncountries which create investor confidence.\n  I believe that open, face to face dialogue with African Trade \nMinisters is vital if the United States is going to get its message \nacross about issues such as the importance of transparency, and the \nguarantee of timely remedy to disputes through a judicial process that \nis open and fair.\n  In addition, the report increases the number of foreign commercial \nservice officers. Currently, we have fewer than 10 such officers for \nthe more than forty countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly this is \ninadequate. These officers are\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nresponsible for identifying opportunities for small to medium U.S. \nbusinesses to export their goods and services to African countries, as \nwell as providing information on economic conditions and investment \nclimate factors which enable them to make better decisions on where and \nwhen to invest.\n\n  One of the most glaring weaknesses of this legislation, Mr. \nPresident, is that it does not adequately address the HIV/AIDS crisis \nin Sub-Saharan Africa, so eloquently described by Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Feingold yesterday in their moving statements.\n  Some of my colleagues do not believe that a trade bill should attempt \nto speak to the issue of HIV/AIDS. I believe that we are talking about \na disease that is so virulent, so deadly and so pernicious that any \nplan for economic development in Africa will inevitably fail if this \nepidemic is not contained.\n  If only because of the very real threat that this epidemic carries \nfor our own health and security, Congress must take any and all \nopportunity we have to provide help to this region in fighting this \ndreaded disease.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I was extremely disappointed that the \nFeinstein-Feingold amendment to the Senate bill was dropped without any \nprovision put in its place which would offer effective assistance to \nAfricans as they fight this deadly disease.\n  In March, the Foreign Relations Committee unanimously passed an \nauthorization bill which provided $300 million dollars for a program--\nbased on work by Senators Frist and Kerry--of vaccines to fight the \nspread of HIV/AIDS.\n  Although the conference on the bill before us today was conducted \nunder the jurisdiction of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees, it \ndeclined to take action on the tax credits for vaccine research, \nproduction, and distribution that would have complemented those steps \nwe took in the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  That was another opportunity lost, Mr. President, and another reason \nwhy the celebration over passage of this bill should be muted, at best.\n  I see some hope in today's Wall Street Journal, which reports that \nseveral major drug companies have announced plans to cut the cost of \nAIDS drugs in the developing world. I hope we will see some real \nresults following from this announcement. Voluntary action of this sort \ncan and should be part of any comprehensive plan to address this crisis \nof historic proportions.\n  This conference report also states that it is the sense of the \nCongress that the nations of Sub-Saharan Africa should receive \nsubstantial debt relief.\n  I must point out that the Foreign Relations Committee has passed \nauthorizations for the use of the proceeds of gold revaluations at the \nIMF as well as the U.S. share of the trust fund that will be set up for \nthe new, enhanced debt relief program for the poorest nations of the \nworld. The nations of Sub-Saharan Africa will be among the chief \nbeneficiaries of that program.\n  I am glad to see that, with passage of this legislation, that \nCongress stands behind this debt relief program. I hope that the \nAppropriations Committee will soon provide the funds for us to put some \nmoney behind those sentiments, and that the Banking Committee will \nquickly conclude its work on the remaining authorization needed to put \nthe debt relief program into motion.\n  In the end, while I understand and sympathize with some of the \ncomplaints raised by those who will vote against the bill, I prefer to \nsee this glass as half full. But this is still a pretty small glass, \nMr. President.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in my absence I would like to \nsubmit this statement for the Record. As you know, I make every effort \nnot to miss votes in the Senate, and would not do so but for the fact \nthat there is currently a massive wildfire that is raging out of \ncontrol in my state. At this time a substantial number of homes have \nbeen destroyed or damaged, with more surely to follow. And there is no \nend in sight. Thousands of New Mexicans have had to leave their homes \nin Los Alamos and White Rock, and if the conditions stay the same \nthere, many more will be leaving in other communities. This is a \nuniquely catastrophic situation, and I apologize for not being able to \ncast my vote.\n  But since I cannot be here today, I want to submit for the record \nthat if I was here I would have voted in the affirmative for the \nAfrica/Caribbean Basin Initiative Trade Bill. There has been \nconsiderable debate over this bill, and I have carefully considered the \nissues involved. I agree with my colleagues that this is not a perfect \nbill--questions concerning labor rights, human rights, corporate \ninvestment, the environment, transshipments, and so on linger, and they \nwill do so until the provisions of the bill are implemented over time. \nBut I am convinced that over the long run it begins a process that \noffers real hope for Africa, the Caribbean Basin, and the people who \nlive in those regions. So while I am not present today, I state for the \nRecord that I feel this is the right step to take. An initial step to \nbe sure, but definitely the right one.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, more than 6 months ago I signified my \nsupport for the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative when it came to the Senate floor for a vote. Today, I \nstand again with a bipartisan collection of my colleagues, a broad base \nof industry, faith-based and religious groups, a variety of free trade \nadvocates, and supporters from the sub-Saharan African nations and the \nCaribbean to advocate for swift passage of this legislation.\n  To begin, Senators Roth and Moynihan should be applauded for \nproducing and delivering this legislation after more than three years \nof deliberation and negotiation. The long and arduous task of attaining \nagreements between U.S. industry and their counterparts in Africa and \nthe Caribbean, as well as assuring that the various trade interests \nfrom all sides were accommodated, is a task that should be commended.\n  As we continue to prosper and advance in this expanding and ever \nchanging world economy, it is essential that the United States reach \nout to all regions of the globe. By unilaterally expanding access to \nU.S. markets, sub-Saharan nations and the Caribbean will be afforded \nnew trade and investment policies that will propel these regions into \n21st Century trade practices.\n  Trade with the United States does imply that certain practices be \ninstituted and embraced by participating nations. This bill promotes \nthe establishment and development of free-market economies, insists on \nhuman rights standards, and champions democratic and economic \nprinciples, the U.S. expects from our trading partners.\n  From textiles and apparel, to agriculture and specialty goods, not \nonly does the United States stand to prosper from this trade agreement, \nbut, so too do the sub-Saharan and Caribbean nations. While some have \nargued that U.S. companies could be harmed by expanded trade with these \nregions, stringent requirements regarding the transshipment of goods \nhave been incorporated into the legislation. In addition, the bill \nincludes a provision that enables the U.S. Customs Service to assist \nthese countries with illegal transshipments.\n  While I am somewhat disappointed that the bill no longer includes the \nreauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences, the crux of the bill, its intent, and its long-\nterm impact on trade with sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean make it \nwell worthy of passage. In addition, my home State of Washington, the \nmost trade dependent state in the nation, naturally stands to gain from \nincreased trade.\n  Again, I reiterate my support for the legislation and its far-\nreaching intent. With such a broad base of advocates vying for its \npassage, not to mention the partnerships in trade this legislation \ncreates for the United States, this measure deserves our support and \nswift approval.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns with the \nlegislation before us.\n  While I support the intent of this legislation, increasing trade \nbetween Africa and the U.S., I will not be able to lend it my support.\n  This is in no way a comment on either Chairman Roth or Senator \nMoynihan. They have done yeoman's work on this legislation, which has \nbeen a longtime priority for them both.\n  Mr. President, my objection to this legislation is what it includes, \nand what it excludes.\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\n  The legislation includes provisions which are a less than \ncomprehensive approach to establishing mutually beneficial trade \nrelations with Africa. In addition, I have heard from Rhode Island \ntextile manufacturers who remain concerned with the textile provisions \nin this legislation, specifically the less than perfect transhipment \nelements. Lastly, the legislation only includes a study of the \neffectiveness of Trade Adjustment Assistance, even though the Senate \nbill reauthorized and strengthened TAA for workers and businesses \nadversely affected by international trade.\n  On the other hand, the conference report excludes an amendment which \nis important to our country's jewelry manufacturers as well as Senator \nFeingold's and Senator Feinstein's amendment on HIV/AIDS treatment in \nAfrican nations.\n  Last year, with the support of Chairman Roth and Senator Moynihan, \nthe Senate adopted a common sense amendment to the Africa Growth and \nOpportunity Act to improve country of origin marking requirements for \ncertain types of imported jewelry.\n  Now, improving the country of origin marking requirements for jewelry \nmay seem like a modest proposal, but it took many years to develop a \ncompromise on this issue that would pass the Senate.\n  To give a sense of how long it took, I first introduced this \nlegislation in 1996 as a member of the other chamber, when members of \nour struggling domestic jewelry manufacturing industry came to me with \na desire to see permanent country of origin markings on imports.\n\n  These small businesses told me that all too often the stickers or \ntags meant to inform consumers where a product was made, fell off, were \nobscured by price tags, or in some cases were simply removed. Customs \nofficials in Rhode Island also acknowledged that there was a problem \nwith the marking regime on imported jewelry.\n  Most importantly, I found that the same concern on the part of \ndomestic makers of Native American style jewelry had been addressed as \npart of the 1988 trade bill. It is upon this common sense law that I \nbased my legislation.\n  Mr. President, as a general rule, the United States requires all \nimported products to display in the most permanent manner possible the \nnation where they were made. One only has to look at a watch, clothing, \ncomputers, televisions, scissors, books, toys, and almost every other \nproduct to see that its country of origin is conspicuously and \npermanently marked so consumers know where a product was manufactured.\n  The existence of these marking requirements is not due to some \nnefarious protectionist urge, rather it is simply a tool to provide \nconsumers with information and help Customs officials easily recognize \nimports for the purposes of tariff classification. I would add that \nmost of our trading partners have similar standards.\n  It was with the above in mind that I was pleased to work with the \nChairman and Senator Moynihan to develop a sensible amendment to \nincrease the amount of imported jewelry that had to be permanently \nmarked. However, I would point out that this language was also \nconsistent with all trade laws and created no bar to the flow of \nimported jewelry. Moreover, the amendment did no more than establish \nmarking requirement parity between non-precious jewelry and Native \nAmerican style jewelry. And, lastly I am hard pressed to see how \nchanging the method by which a product is marked leads to any increased \ncosts for foreign manufacturers, since under the current country of \norigin system all products are legally required to be marked in some \nfashion.\n  Unfortunately, the House cavalierly dismissed the concerns of Rhode \nIsland, Massachusetts, New York, and California jewelry makers for \nreasons of either ignorance or animosity to change.\n  I want to stress that I appreciate and recognize the time that the \nChairman, Senator Moynihan and their staffs put into this seemingly \nnon-controversial provision.\n  While the legislation before us does not contain this common-sense \namendment, I want to assure my colleagues here and in the other body, \nas well as the thousands of hard-working men and women of the domestic \njewelry industry, that I will continue to pursue this issue and utilize \nall of the Senate's prerogatives to enact this legislation. Thank you.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. This legislation \ncontains important measures that not only will help spur the economies \nof developing nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, \nbut also will strengthen our ability to retaliate against countries who \nrefuse to comply with WTO trade decisions won by the United States.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa is enmeshed in great economic, human, and \npolitical turmoil. The countries of this region are among the poorest \nin the world. The per capita income averages less than $500 annually, \nand the average life expectancy is the world's shortest. We have all \nseen pictures of the desperate conditions--images of starving babies, \nhomeless families, and needless bloodshed seem to be everywhere. And, \njust today, news stories about the situation in Sierra Leone and \nZimbabwe remind us of how truly bleak life in Africa can be.\n  But, Mr. President, despite the killings, despite the political \nunrest, despite the poverty--the future offers the people of Africa \ngreat opportunities for increased trade and investment--opportunities \nthat can restore hope and bring about positive change on the Continent.\n  With a population of more than 700 million, Sub-Saharan Africa \nrepresents one of the largest economic markets in the world. According \nto the U.S. Department of Commerce, my own home state of Ohio was the \ntenth largest exporting state to the region, with $148 million in \nexports in 1998. Although U.S. exports to Africa are more than 45 \npercent greater than U.S. exports to all the countries of the former \nSoviet Union, this export market still represents only about one \npercent of our nation's total trade.\n  It is time that we establish a new economic framework on which we can \nbuild increased trade with Africa. The Africa Growth and Opportunity \nAct establishes just such a framework by encouraging increased trade \nand investment by reducing trade barriers.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, the legislation before us today, \nnot only affects African nations, but also those within our own \nhemisphere through the Caribbean Basin Initiative.\n  Over the last decade, the United States has played a vital role in \nthe spread of democracy and the growth of free enterprise throughout \nthe Western Hemisphere. Today, every nation in our hemisphere--except \nCuba--has moved toward establishing a democratic government and is \nopening their economies to free trade. Democratic elections have become \nthe norm--not the exception--and hemispheric trade integration is a \ncommon goal.\n  To further consolidate democracies and economic gains in the region, \nwe must move forward to integrate economically with our neighboring \ncountries. The Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act is part of our \neffort to consolidate democracy and economic stability in our \nhemisphere. This Act would bring tremendous benefits to the United \nStates and to the Caribbean Basin. It would enhance our economic \nsecurity, both by opening new markets for American products and by \nstrengthening the economies of our closest neighbors. And, it would \ncreate new hope for those left jobless by Hurricanes Mitch and George.\n  The CBI enhancement legislation would extend duty-free treatment to \napparel assembled in the Carribean Basin (or assembled and cut in the \nregion) using U.S. fabric made from U.S. yarn. This would help \nstrengthen existing U.S.-CBI partnerships in the apparel industry, \nbecause the duty-free treatment will help U.S. apparel manufacturers \nmaintain their competitiveness with the Asian market.\n  The CBI enhancement also would take steps toward creating a Free \nTrade Area of the Americas (FTAA), by promoting the anti-corruption and \nprotection of intellectual property, as well as other forms of \ncooperation with matters such as counter-narcotics programs. \nSpecifically, the legislation would link CBI benefits more explicitly \nto the fulfillment of specific obligations in beneficiary countries in \nsuch areas as WTO compliance, intellectual property rights, investment \nprotection,\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nmarket access, worker rights, narcotics enforcement, corruption, \ngovernment procurement, customs valuation and comparable tariff \ntreatment.\n  Mr. President, trade integration will occur in this hemisphere, \nwhether or not we are a part of it. So, it is in our national interest \nto shape that integration process by bringing more countries into \nbilateral and multilateral trade agreements with the United States. If \nwe fail to seize trade opportunities in Africa and within our own \nhemisphere, others will take our place of leadership. No country is \nwaiting for us to act first. In the end, the longer we wait, the more \nwe stand to lose.\n\n  And speaking of losing, currently, our nation continues to be injured \nby the refusal of the European Union (EU) to comply with WTO rulings in \nthe beef and banana trade disputes. In addition to denying American \nfarmers access to the European market, the EU's actions are undermining \nthe entire WTO Dispute Settlement process. If they are successful in \nignoring such decisions, how can we expect other countries to follow \ntrade dispute settlement rulings? How can we expect anyone in the \nUnited States to have faith in the WTO?\n  Repeatedly, I have come to the floor to raise my concerns about the \nEU's flagrant disregard for dispute settlement rulings in the beef and \nbanana cases, which have clearly shown the ``Fortress Europe'' \nmentality against free and fair trade. Last Fall, during the Senate \nfloor debate on the Africa trade bill, I successfully amended the \nlegislation to create a powerful mechanism--tariff retaliation--to \nfight ``fortress'' mentalities and to protect our nation from illegal \nforeign trade practices. Today, I am pleased to say that the conference \nreport before us now still contains my provision to strengthen the one \nand only weapon in our arsenal to fight WTO noncompliance.\n  The purpose of the provision is simple--to make our retaliation more \neffective and to compel compliance with the WTO rulings. The measure \nwould specifically require the U.S. Trade Representative to \nperiodically ``carousel''--or rotate--the list of goods subject to \nretaliation when a foreign country or countries have failed to comply \nwith a WTO ruling. The retaliation list would be carouseled to affect \nother goods 120 days from the date the list is made and every 180 days, \nthereafter. The U.S. Trade Representative would retain ample discretion \nand authority to ensure that retaliation implemented by the United \nStates remains within the levels authorized by the WTO. Also, the \nprovision makes it clear that our Trade Representative is to structure \nthe retaliation lists to maximize the likelihood of compliance by the \nlosing side in trade disputes.\n  Mr. President, the WTO is one of the most important means for \nAmerican businesses and producers to open foreign markets, liberalize \ncommerce, resolve disputes, and ensure more open and fair trade. \nAmerican farmers and agribusiness, for example, are major net \nexporters, posting exports of more than $57 billion in 1997. Of the \nnearly 50 complaints filed by the United States in the WTO, almost 30 \npercent involved agriculture. If a country or countries fail to comply \nwith WTO rulings, American agriculture and other U.S. sectors in need \nof trade relief will suffer greatly.\n  It's time to fight back. While carousel retaliation is tough, it is \nthe right response to chronic non-compliance with WTO rulings. It is \nthe kind of response that will do more to encourage compliance with WTO \nrules, giving Ohio's farmers and businesses the level-playing field \nthey deserve.\n  Overall, Mr. President, the trade bill before us is a good bill--it \nis good for Sub-Saharan Africa; it is good for the Caribbean Basin; and \nit is good for agriculture and business right here at home in the \nUnited States. In the end, this bill just makes good sense.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support passage of H.R. 434, the Trade \nand Development Act of 2000. This legislation includes the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act, legislation to grant Caribbean countries \ntariff parity with the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other \nlegislation that will use trade incentives to promote U.S. global \neconomic interests.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of many components of this \nlegislation, especially the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \nlegislation giving NAFTA parity to our Caribbean allies. This \nlegislation sets an important precedent for future U.S. foreign policy \nby emphasizing trade incentives over foreign aid. It makes clear that a \ndeveloping African or Caribbean country must pursue democratic and \nmarket-oriented reforms in order to receive benefits. This incentive-\nbased approach will promote democratic government and economic reforms \namong nations home to more than one billion people. Recent developments \nin both Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone show that there is much work that \nstill has to be done in Africa to establish stable and effective \npolitical and economic institutions. My hope is that this legislation \nwill encourage these developing countries to continue to make progress \ntoward this important goal.\n  This legislation has been improved since it passed the Senate last \nyear. The conference report gives greater incentive to the development \nof local African and Caribbean industry by allowing conditional duty-\nfree treatment of apparel made from regional fabrics. While I hope that \na future Congress will remove the restrictive conditions on this tariff \ntreatment in order to more fully assist the development of regional \nindustry, I believe that this liberalized tariff-rate quota will \npromote economic growth and stability in the affected regions. This \nlegislation urges the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) \nand Export-Import Bank to promote investment in Africa. Greater \nAmerican investment in Africa creates greater exposure to American \npolitical, economic, labor and environmental principles. Provisions of \nthis legislation also welcome the people of Albania and Kyrgyzstan into \nthe international economy, which I believe is beneficial to American \ninterests. Finally, I am glad that this legislation includes a \nprovision to prohibit the importation of products made from child labor \ninto the United States. This barbaric practice is a relic of earlier, \nless enlightened times that should be extinguished.\n  It is unconscionable that the conference dropped a provision that \nwould have made HIV/AIDS medicine more available to the African people. \nThe AIDS epidemic throughout Africa is a crisis, which impedes \npolitical reform and economic development in that region. We have a \nmoral obligation to help relieve this health epidemic. I am a strong \nadvocate of free trade and private enterprise. However, as a practical \nmatter, there is little profit to be made or lost in assisting with a \nhealth crisis in poor undeveloped countries. Therefore, I believe that \nwe should have included the Senate provision in order to ensure greater \ndistribution of HIV/AIDS drugs to Africa. Since it is no longer \nincluded in this legislation, I urge the Congress to enact legislation \nthat will establish a comprehensive solution to the HIV/AIDS problem in \nAfrica that includes the greater distribution of American drugs and \nmedical practices to combat HIV/AIDS. The AIDS crisis in Africa must be \nsolved if we are to achieve any lasting development in the region.\n\n  I also have concerns that this legislation will establish some poor \nprecedents. It is my understanding that there is not yet a formal \nestimate by the Congressional Budget Office for this legislation, so we \ndo not know its cost. I am very disturbed that whatever the costs of \nthe legislation, it will be paid for out of the federal budget surplus. \nThis is not wise policy. The Constitution clearly gives the Congress \nthe ``power of the purse'' and we must use this power judiciously. I \nremain dedicated to the principle that the Senate should only consider \nlegislation that has both a known cost and specific provisions paying \nfor it. The version of this legislation that we considered in the \nSenate in November included provisions to pay for it. The Congress \nshould close tax shelters and loopholes and cut wasteful government \nspending in order to pay for new programs. As fiscal conservatives, we \nknow that this surplus exists only because we have made careful \nchoices. We must now use this surplus to shore up Social Security and \nMedicare, pay down the national debt, and cut taxes--not spend it on \nmore government programs.\n  I am also concerned by some of the provisions in this legislation. \nWhile I understand that the current tariff\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nstructure puts American suit manufacturers at an unfair advantage, \nremedying this inequity deserves more study by the Senate. I do not \nfavor the tariff rebate provisions. No compelling argument has been \nmade to support a Wool Research, Development and Promotion Trust Fund \nthat costs $2.25 million each year. I am also concerned by provisions \nincluded in the conference report that allow Oregon nuclear power plant \nworkers to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits after their \neligibility has expired, and allow a company with operations in \nConnecticut and Missouri to obtain a refund on duties it paid on \nimports of nuclear fuel assemblies. In addition, I have reservations \nabout using ``budgetary gimmicks'' to change the schedule of payments \nof rum excise taxes to Puerto Rico. These revisions are unrelated to \ntrade opportunities for Africa and the Caribbean. All of these measures \nshould be examined in the usual authorization process to ensure that \nthey are considered on merit, and not foisted on the taxpayers by \nspecial interests.\n  In conclusion, although I disagree with some of the inadvisable \nprovisions in this bill, I support this legislation. I believe that, on \nbalance, it is an important milestone in American policy with the \ndeveloping world, which I hope will encourage the spread of American \npolitical and economic values. I will not allow the perfect to be the \nenemy of the good. However, Congress should ensure that we are more \nfiscally responsible in funding legislation. It is important that we \nwrite responsible legislation that will help promote the American \nprinciples of democracy, the rule of law, and a market-oriented \neconomic system.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is an exceptionally difficult \ndecision.\n  But after weighing the pros and cons of this legislation, I rise to \nsupport the Trade and Development Act.\n  It is high time that we address economic growth in Africa and the \nCaribbean. Africa, in particular, has been ignored for far too long. I \nwould like to support this effort to encourage economic growth, \ninvestment and trade in the region while recognizing that this effort \nalone is not enough. It should only be a small piece of our policy in \nAfrica. Much more must be done.\n  I have considered the impact this measure will have on American \nworkers. I am a blue-collar Senator. My heart and soul lies with blue-\ncollar America. I spent most of my life in a blue-collar neighborhood. \nMy career in public service is one of deep commitment to working-class \npeople. I have fought and continue to fight for economic growth, jobs \nand opportunities in America--in particular--in my own State of \nMaryland. And in the last decade, working people have faced the loss of \njobs, lower wages and a reduced standard of living, and a shrinking \nmanufacturing base--everything that the critics say. But voting against \nthe Trade and Development Act will not save those jobs or bring those \njobs back.\n  I also care about working-class people all over the world. I applaud \nmy colleagues for uniting to pass Senator Harkin's amendment to meet \nand enforce internationally recognized standards that eliminate the \nworst forms of child labor. Countries can only enjoy the benefits \ngranted under this Act if they take action to eliminate work that harms \nthe health, safety or morals of children. Benefits will not be given to \nsub-Saharan or Caribbean countries that carry out hazardous child labor \npractices, such as slavery, debt bondage, forced or compulsory labor, \nchild prostitution or drug trafficking. This effort is especially \nrelevant to this trade legislation because out of the 250 million \nchildren between the ages of 5 and 14 who are working in the developing \nworld--one-third are in Africa.\n  This Act could have been further strengthened. I supported other \namendments toward that aim, which were not incorporated into this \nlegislation. I see several yellow flashing lights that we cannot ignore \nand we must address with our trading partners in sub-Saharan Africa and \nthe Caribbean.\n  Even though the worst forms of child labor were addressed in this \nlegislation, additional efforts still need to be undertaken to protect \nthe rights, welfare, health and safety of all workers. I supported \namendments offered by my colleagues to ensure the enforcement of \ninternationally recognized core labor standards and to establish a \nlabor side agreement before this legislation could go into effect. \nNeither amendment was adopted.\n  Furthermore, much more needs to be done to protect our environment. \nDangerous or haphazard practices that damage the environment in sub-\nSaharan African or the Caribbean not only harm territory within these \nregions--it affects all of us. We cannot continue to ignore the \nenvironment in trade agreements. We must find a way to ensure that \neconomic growth does not come at the expense of the environment.\n  In addition, much more must be done to provide debt relief to Africa \nand to prevent and address the HIV/AIDS crisis plaguing the region.\n  Taking into account these considerations, I still believe that we \nhave a unique opportunity to support legislation that works toward free \ntrade and fair trade. This Act strives to create economic growth, jobs \nand opportunities in sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean. It \nencourages African nations to compete and to institute market-oriented \neconomic reforms. It also works to strengthen America's economy and to \ncreate American jobs by increasing US exports and investment to these \nregions.\n  I agree that the Trade and Development Act as it stands does not \nencompass numerous other measures that America needs to undertake with \nrespect to Africa and the Caribbean. But it is a courageous first-step \nand it merits our support.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Conference \nReport on H.R. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000. I oppose \nthis bill because, as a result of this legislation, many Americans will \nlose their jobs, a significant number of whom will be South \nCarolinians. Our domestic textile industry will be particularly \ndamaged. I remind my colleagues that in the past five years over \n454,000 American textile industry workers already have lost their jobs.\n  At best, this bill further erodes the system of protective quotas \nthat the Administration promised the U.S. textile industry as a \ncondition of U.S. entry into the World Trade Organization. This quota \nsystem was to remain in effect for ten years from 1995 until 2005, to \nprovide the U.S. textile industry with time to adjust to competition \nfrom foreign government-subsidized and sweat-shop made textile imports.\n  The textile industry has been strong in the United States because it \nencompasses fiber, fabric, and apparel production. The textile \nindustry, in the aggregate, forms the second largest industrial sector \nof the U.S. economy. Certain segments of the industry, such as yarn and \nfabric production, have benefitted from technology and increased \ncapital investment while apparel production has tended to opt for \ncheaper labor rather than invest in modern production facilities.\n  I fear this bill will further encourage U.S. textile firms to move \ntheir production off-shore. It signals capital markets that the U.S. \ntextile industry is at risk, thus reducing its ability to borrow the \ncapital to make those improvements necessary for domestic production. \nWith the denial of capital to automate and modernize, the rush toward \ncheaper and cheaper labor will lead to a continuing exodus of U.S.-\nbased manufacturing. This will result in a further loss of employment \nin the domestic textile industry and its supporting industries.\n  A decline in the domestic textile industry will also impact American \nfarmers. Cotton producers in the United States have profited from a \nstrong and vibrant domestic textile industry. However, as the textile \nindustry becomes locked in a downward spiral of chasing ever lower \ncosts, it will look for other ways to reduce expenditures. A likely \nresult will be to encourage cotton production closer to its foreign \nmanufacturing facilities. While U.S. cotton exports may initially \nincrease under this legislation, the long-term impact will not be so \nfavorable to domestic cotton producers.\n  The countries of Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean do need to \ndevelop economically. There can be no doubt that these countries \nrequire help. However, providing assistance by decimating the U.S. \ntextile industry is not the answer. Furthermore, there is no\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nassurance that this bill will improve the textile industry of these \nNations or provide jobs to their citizens. It is clear that government-\nsubsidized Asian textile interests are positioning themselves to \ndominate the world textile trade. One only has to look at the situation \nin the Northern Mariana Islands to see the model for the future. \nMoreover, transshipment to evade the quota arrangements of this bill \nand other existing quotas will likely continue until the quotas finally \nend in 2005.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 434 is a bad bill that critically injures the \nU.S. textile industry, puts Americans out of work, and, in the end, \nbenefits only Asian textile interests. Therefore, I oppose this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues to do likewise.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, due to a scheduling conflict I was \nunable to cast my vote today on the cloture motion for the conference \nreport accompanying H.R. 434, the Trade and Development Act of 2000. \nFor the record, I would have voted ``aye'' in favor of cloture on the \nbill.\n  I am very supportive of expanding our trading opportunities with the \nCaribbean countries and Africa and I am delighted that all parties \ninvolved have come to agreement and we have passed this vital \nlegislation. Our distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Moynihan, focused our attention on the significance of the \npassage of this bill earlier today when he highlighted the fact that \nthis is the first trade bill to pass Congress in six years. In my view, \nthat is simply too long.\n  I'm not here to focus on missed opportunities today, however. I'm \nhere to praise the members of both the House and Senate who were on the \nconference committee for their tireless efforts on this bill's behalf. \nTo all involved in the passage of this legislation I say ``thank you.''\n  This legislation means a great deal to the Caribbean and Africa, but \nit means a lot to Arkansas, too. This bill will generate an increase in \ndemand for cotton, which is sorely needed. Our cotton farmers at home \nhave experienced several years of bad weather and prices, and I know \nthey are pleased to have access to new markets. It's planting season in \nArkansas but that hasn't stopped my constituents from staying in touch. \nI've heard from many of them this week who took time from their busy \nschedules to voice their support for this bill. They realize, as I do, \nthat the world is increasingly becoming a ``global marketplace'' and we \nmust do all we can to expand our trading opportunities. I applaud the \nSenate's vote on the ``Trade and Opportunity Act'' today and hope that \nit will not be another six years before the next trade bill comes to \nthe Senate floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the trade bill before us represents a \nmilestone in U.S. trade policy. This bill, and especially the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act found at Title I, acknowledges the social, \nhealth, and political problems as well as the economic challenges \nfacing a group of states, most of which are developing nations.\n  It is not that our trade policies have not concerned themselves with \ndeveloping countries before--that commitment is evident in the \nGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP), the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative, and many other trade initiatives. However, this bill is \nunique in many ways.\n  First, we are acknowledging that the mere existence of a trade \nagreement does not produce immediate results. The strength of a society \nand its polity profoundly affect the development of the capabilities \nthat allow for globalization. Developing countries, for example, need \ninvestment, but prudent companies do not commit their resources unless \nsome very fundamental conditions exist, conditions that exceed those \naddressed in the Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMS) Agreement of \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  The bill before us does that. We underscore the importance of \npolitical stability; we provide opportunities for technical assistance \nthat can create a banking and legal structure to repatriate profits and \nto protect the sanctity of the contract.\n  Second, we acknowledge that there are regionally specific social and \nhealth issues that are preconditions to real economic development--what \nI refer to as ``trade enablement.'' Most Sub-Sahara African (SSA) \nstates have been left behind. Their colonial and post-colonial \nsocieties have not, for the most part, melded into a modern, unified \nstate. Nor have these societies produced the type of workforce that \ntrade demands--educated, technically skilled, and healthy workers.\n  The bill before us deals this reality, too, and in several ways.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I believe we should do what we can to \nhelp restore our African partners to the world baseline standard of \ngood health. With 20-30 percent HIV/AIDS infection among the adult \npopulations in some states, few firms will risk hiring a workforce in \nwhich one-in-three to one-in-five workers may not be alive, let alone \nworking in five years. I agree with President Clinton's comments that \nAfrica, too, needs to do more to control this problem. But this bill \nprovides incentives.\n  Not only are these efforts to improve health in this region good \neconomics and good politics, but they are also simply the right thing \nto do. We are the richest nation in the world. It has always been a \npart of the American character to help those who are suffering and to \nimprove conditions where we can.\n  Worker education also faces immense challenges. Literacy rates have \nrisen to 59 percent, but that level lags comparable literacy rates in \nEast Asia (84 percent), Latin America (83 percent) and the Caribbean \n(83 percent). Once more, the incentives provided by this bill to create \nan investment climate, will awaken African governments to the need for \nprogramed improvements in literacy and technical training. And, through \nthe newly created economic forum under this bill, conditions can be put \nin place for technical assistance.\n  Mr. President, it is undeniable that this bill is a hybrid. It is not \na conventional trade bill, because Africa, with the exception of a few \nstates like South Africa, Gabon, and Mauritius, is not positioned to \ngain immediate or even mid-term benefits unless, and I repeat, unless, \ntrade is coupled with the forms of assistance and incentives that this \nbill provides.\n  But it is no less deniable that great benefits will be potentially \navailable to both the U.S. and Sub-Saharan Africa if the underlying \nconcept in this bill materializes.\n  For the United States, Africa is a warehouse of badly needed \nstrategic materials which will open new sources of supply for U.S. \nproducers. Moreover, if properly developed, this market will benefit \nthe entire population of an African state, rather than a few, often \ncorrupt elites.\n  It is a fundamental axiom of every trade theory that the economic \nevolution of trading partners produces rolling prosperity--which is \nanother way of saying that prosperity raises all boats. Not only does \nthis phenomenon promise future markets for U.S. goods, services, and \nagricultural products, but also a more prosperous, politically stable \nAfrican continent, which, in turn, produces other foreign policy and \nnational security benefits for the U.S. It creates international \npartners in this region that have a stake in world peace, disease \ncontrols, as well as other initiatives to combat terrorism, \ninternational crime, labor force abuses, and environmental degradation.\n  I believe that this Africa Trade bill will have a broad range of \nbenefits for America, and I will support this legislation. I want to \ncompliment Senator Roth, Senator Grassley, and other Senators who \nworked so diligently on this legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last year I reluctantly cast my vote \nagainst the Trade and Development Act of 1999, a modest package of \ntrade bills which included the African Growth and Opportunity Act and \nthe Carribean Basin Trade Enhancement Act.\n  I have long supported expanding trade opportunities for Vermonters \nand all Americans, as well as for people in developing countries. And I \nhave felt for some time that our relationship with Africa cannot \ncontinue to be based almost exclusively on aid, when the real engine of \ndevelopment, as we have seen both at home and abroad, is investment and \ntrade.\n  However, I voted against that bill because I felt that in developing \na trade policy toward Africa--where poverty is deeply rooted and \nprotections for the environment and the rights of workers\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nare non-existent--precautions must be taken to ensure that it is a \nsound policy that responds to Africa's unique and urgent needs. I was \ndisappointed that given the rare opportunity to examine and redefine \nour relationship with Africa, the approach was so limited and flawed.\n  There are many aspects of this conference report which I strongly \nsupport. Provisions which open new markets for American exports, while \nproviding trade benefits that will help a number of countries compete \nmore effectively in the global economy. Provisions which encourage \ncountries to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, and raise the \nprofile of U.S. agricultural interests in trade negotiations.\n  I remain disappointed, however, by the act's approach toward Africa.\n  It is astonishing that aside from Sense of Congress language about \nthe need to strengthen efforts to combat desertification, the act in no \nway addresses environmental concerns. This is an unfortunate step \nbackward from NAFTA, which--while they did not go far enough--contained \nside agreements on both environmental and labor issues.\n  Multinational corporations, especially mining and timber companies, \nhave a long history of exploiting Africa's weak environmental laws and \ncausing pollution, deforestation and the uprooting of people. There is \na direct link between environmental degradation and civil unrest. If \nbarriers to foreign investment are lowered or eliminated--as the act \ncalls for--and meaningful, enforceable environmental protections are \nnot put in place, these problems will only get worse.\n  The act's provision on workers' rights, most of which have been \nincluded in other trade legislation, have routinely allowed countries \nnotorious for abuses to escape without penalty. Unions have rightly \ncriticized them for being vague and unenforceable.\n  As the wealthiest nation, we have a responsibility to do what we can \nto ensure that the benefits of the global economy are enjoyed by people \nfrom all walks of life, here and abroad. However, the workers' rights \nprovision in this act are an invitation for the continued exploitation \nof cheap African labor.\n  Mr. President, some have claimed that this legislation is an historic \nfirst step toward integrating Africa into the global economy. Others \nhave called it a devastating blow that will force African countries to \ncut spending on education and health care, and to submit to strict \nInternational Monetary Fund conditions. It is neither.\n  The Trade and Development Act of 2000 is not going to cause the great \neconomic boon some have predicted, and it may cause harm. But it is the \nwrong approach if we truly want to redefine our relationship with the \nregion from one of dependency to one of actively promoting economic \ngrowth and self-reliance.\n  Like last year, I reluctantly cast my vote against the bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have now reached the final stage of \nthe legislative process with regard to the Trade and Development Act of \n2000. The moment has come to vote on final passage. Once again, I urge \nmy distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for \nopportunity, to vote to reaffirm America's historic leadership in \ninternational trade. What we do here, what we say here, reverberates \nall around the world. So I say to my distinguished colleagues, let's \nsend a resounding message, a clear message, a strong message, that \nAmerica is engaged with the world. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nTrade and Development Act of 2000.\n  I hope we will have speakers now on the African trade bill so we can \nmove ahead to get a vote on that. I think I have not had any requests \nfor speakers in support of the legislation because those of us who \nsupport the legislation would like to move it to immediate passage. I \nhope those who would still like to speak in opposition to it and \nexpress those points of view will please do that at this particular \ntime.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are going to go to \na vote immediately. All speakers on this side have evaporated. They \nwill present statements.\n  We do have one speaker, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, who wants to \nspeak for 45 minutes. I ask unanimous consent he be allowed to speak on \nthis bill on which we are going to be voting following the vote, and \nprior to military construction, for up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) \nand the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Bryan) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 77, nays 19, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 98 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--77\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--19\n\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Bingaman\n     Bryan\n     Domenici\n     Roth\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this was a momentous moment for the \nSenate, for the Nation, and for the world. We have passed the first \ntrade bill in 6 years, having rejected others and having come about in \nthe aftermath of very dim expectations. From no chance whatever, we \nhave come to the point where this bill passed by 77 votes. It could not \nhave happened without the majority leader, who personally convened \nmeetings in his office day after day. There were mind-numbing details \nabout thread, yarn, square meter equivalents, hundreds, millions--but \nit came about.\n  Senator Roth, our chairman, who could not be here today, will be back \nnext week. He put this matter through the Finance Committee nearly \nunanimously. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the staff \nwho not only did this, but did it until dawn, day after day--or should \nI say night after night. They are, on the majority staff: Frank Polk, \nGrant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Tim Keeler, and Carrie Clark. On the \nmajority leader's staff: Dave Hoppe and Jim Hecht. On our minority \nstaff: David Podoff, Debbie Lamb, Linda Menghetti, and Timothy Hogan. \nPlus majority and minority tax staffs because tariffs are taxes, we \nhad: Mark Prater, Ed McClellan, Russ Sullivan,\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\nCary Pugh, Anita Horn, and Mitchell Kent. And a very special word of \nthanks to Polly Craighill, Senate Legislative Counsel, who labored with \nthe committee staff long into the night.\n  Once again, I say to my dear colleague, Senator Grassley, who carried \nthe matter so brilliantly on the other side, not every day do we pass a \ntrade bill 4-1. Thank you. And I again thank the majority leader. The \nNation is in his debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, following up on what Senator Moynihan \njust said, and associating myself with those remarks, as important as \nthe bill we passed is for the continent of Africa and the Caribbean \nBasin Initiative, and as important as it is for the consumers of \nAmerica and the 120,000 new jobs it is going to create for American \nworking men and women, this bill is far more significant, from my point \nof view, because it is the first major piece of trade legislation \npassing the Congress in years, as Senator Moynihan said.\n  In the meantime, I think the United States has been seen by other \nnations as giving up some of our traditional leadership around the \nworld in negotiations and tearing down trade barriers, which has been \nour role as a world leader since 1947. I hope that this legislation is \nthe start of America, once again, leading the world in reducing \nbarriers to trade, the promotion of international trade, and seeing \ntrade as more important than aid as an instrument to helping depressed \neconomies around the world.\n  I look forward to the continuation of our leadership in setting the \nagenda for the World Trade Organization agenda and regional trade \nagreements, as well.\n  Besides all the staff members Senator Moynihan mentioned, I also \ncompliment my international trade counsel, Richard Chriss, on his \noutstanding contribution to the passage of the Africa Trade and CBI \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I also thank the majority leader. I am not a member of the \ncommittee, but I wanted to commend the Senator from New York once again \nfor his tremendous leadership on this issue, and Senator Grassley who \nis filling in for Senator Roth, who will be back next week. I commend \nthe majority leader and minority leader. This is an example of what \nthis body can do on issues that usually provoke the most bitter \ndebates. Trade policy and some other issues can be tremendously \nacrimonious. The fact that the leadership on both sides of the aisle \nworked as diligently and as hard as they did to try to come up with \nsome understandings as to how to recognize legitimate interests speaks \nvolumes about what this body can do on something as significant and as \nimportant as this bill.\n  I didn't want the moment to pass without commending, obviously, the \nfloor managers and the Finance Committee for their work, but also the \nleadership for their support of this measure. The administration, as \nwell, should be mentioned in this context. While it has been 6 years, \nwe are going to be dealing with a couple of these issues now in \nsequence that will be very important and, obviously, their backing and \nsupport is worthwhile.\n  Regarding the last point our colleague from Iowa made, my hope is \nthat passage will also serve as a springboard for us to deal with other \nforeign policy matters that serve the interests of our country. We have \nentered a global economy. We all know the lingo about the kind of world \nof which we are now a part. It is going to be critically important that \nthe Senate of the United States is fulfilling its historic role--the \nunique aspect of the legislative part of Government--to be engaged in \nthe foreign policy interests of our Nation.\n  This agreement certainly serves the interests of Africa and the \nCaribbean Basin very well. But more importantly, it serves the \ninterests of our Nation very well. So I commend the staff and others \nwho were involved. This is a great start. The leadership deserves \ncommendation for their support and their willingness to put a shoulder \nbehind this effort. I also thank the minority leader, Tom Daschle, for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Moynihan, Senator Dodd, and \nSenator Grassley, for their comments. They are absolutely right. This \nis the way we can do things when we make up our minds that we are going \nto. Keep in mind that just a year ago, most people thought this had no \nchance. The House passed a bill that was only applicable to Africa. But \nthen Senator Roth and Senator Moynihan said we should go forward on \nthis. They made the point that we had not had a major trade bill in--I \nthought 5 years, but in fact it was 6 years. I yielded to the \ndistinguished Senator from New York because he pays such close \nattention to this. The chairman and ranking member said we should go \nforward with this and we should add the CBI region and Central America \nto the package. We did that.\n  We worked together across the aisle between the two parties. The \nadministration did express its interest in this legislation. The \nPresident personally called at least twice--maybe three times--and \ntalked about his hope that we could get this done. But I remember a \ncritical moment a month or so ago, late at night, and we were trying to \nmake the last decision that would close the package up. Dave Hoppe, my \nchief of staff, was there, and Jim Hecht on my staff, who worked so \nhard on this legislation, who knew the substance better than I would \never know it. It is mind-boggling in its detail and all the pieces that \nwere in this package. But when I had to basically help make the final \ndecision, as a matter of fact, I was looking at Senator Moynihan's \nstaff and said, ``What do you think? Can we make this work?'' They \nsaid, ``Yes.''\n  That is the way it was. It wasn't partisan at all. To reach this \npoint now and have a vote in the House last week of 309-110, and then \n77-19 in the Senate, in an area where we have acrimony, regional \ndivision, and one sector of the economy pulling against the other, I \nthink this is something we should take a moment and relish and take \ncredit for and be proud of. It represents a significant step forward in \nour trade policy and a victory for the cause of free trade. Like \nSenator Dodd, I have been to Central America and met with the \nPresidents and Ambassadors from Central America and the Caribbean. They \npleaded for this and said, ``Give us an opportunity.'' This is the way \nto help. This is the way to help their people and give them an \nopportunity to get jobs. It will help you, and it will help us.\n\n  I suspect there will be a celebration today and tonight in Central \nAmerica, in the Caribbean, and in Africa.\n  I want to make this point. While that is important, we want free \ntrade and this is good for America. I worked a great deal with Charlie \nRangel, the Congressman from New York, who really wanted this. I \nremember a fateful meeting we had outside an elevator in the Cannon \nOffice Building at which I said, basically, if you do Africa, we will \ndo CBI, and we will get together. And we did. He said in some of our \nmeetings: I don't want a bill that is going to cost America jobs. I \nbelieve we can have a bill that helps America, creates more American \njobs and more opportunity for Americans, and that will be good for the \nsub-Sahara region and for Central America. I believe we achieved that.\n  This bill retains the basic structure and approach of the original \nSenate bill. I want to emphasize that because we made a commitment to \nSenators who had reservations about this bill that we would do \neverything possible to retain the basic structure of the Senate bill. \nWe fought for it, and I think we were successful in that area.\n  The approach makes economic sense, allowing workers and businesses in \nthis country and in our trading partners' to specialize in the \nactivities to which they are most suited. The vast majority of the \ntrade benefits under this bill will involve the use of U.S.-made \ncomponents. They need it in those other regions. They need our yarn. \nThey need our cotton. So we will benefit, and they will benefit.\n  I am acutely aware of the concerns and challenges facing our domestic \ntextile industry. Faced with vast amounts of unfair trade and blatant \ncheating in past textile agreements, our industry has seen a flood of \nforeign imports that have caused job losses.\n  The U.S. textile industry will within a few years face the removal of \nquotas under WTO. At a time of such uncertainty, it is imperative that \nour trade\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nmeasures be carefully geared to sustain and enhance the economic \nopportunities available to our textile industry and workers. I believe \nthis measure before us today does that. It has some of the most \nstringent transshipment measures ever enacted, increasing resources for \nthe Customs Service and ensuring that countries receiving benefits \nunder the bill provide full cooperation with our authorities.\n  That was one of the concerns--that other countries would use Africa, \nor the CBI, the back door, to transship, to violate the agreements and \nget in our country in an unfair way.\n  Will this be perfect? Nothing in this area is perfect. But it will do \nthe best job I believe we have ever done. We are going to watch it to \nmake sure it is effective in that regard.\n  I was pleased to see comments from members of the domestic textile \nindustry as a result of this conference agreement. The president of the \nAmerican Textile Manufacturers Institute has noted projections that the \ndemand for U.S. fabric will double over the next 8 years under this \nbill. It is estimated that this will translate into more than 60,000 \nnew U.S. textile jobs in America. This legislation will have real \nbenefits, immediate benefits--for American consumers, for the retail \nindustry, for the yarn industry, for cotton, and for textiles. All the \nother components in this area of job creation in America will benefit. \nSo will Africa. So will the CBI.\n  I am pleased we have come to this agreement. Actually, it is a little \nanticlimactic. In the end, the vote was so overwhelming that you wonder \nwhy all the huffing and puffing. But I believe it is because of the \ngood work done by our staffs and by the leadership in the House and in \nthe Senate. It would have not been achievable if Chairman Archer and \nsubcommittee chairman Crane had not been willing to be flexible and \nagree to some of the things that were important to the Senate.\n  I want to say a special word about our staffs that worked so hard, \nand through so many nights, to secure the successful conclusion we have \nseen today. I want to recognize in particular Senator Roth's staff, \nincluding Frank Polk, J.T. Young, Grant Aldonas, Faryar Shirzad, Tim \nKeeler, and Carrie Clark; and from Senator Moynihan's staff, David \nPodoff, Debbie Lamb, Linda Menghetti, and Tim Hogan; from Senator \nGrassley's staff, Richard Chriss; and from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Hester Grippando. And finally, with a bill of this detail and \ntechnicality, the diligent work of legislative counsel is especially \ncritical. I would like to thank Polly Craighill, Sandy Strokoff and \nMark Synnes for their extraordinary efforts.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not want us to complete this effort without \nsaying I am proud of it. I believe it will be positive for all \nconcerned. I began the debate that way, and I end it that way.\n  I extend my congratulations to all involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I compliment the majority leader for his \nstatement and for the effort he has put forward in bringing us to this \npoint.\n  I agree with virtually every word he has just spoken about the \nimportance of this matter and about the extraordinary influence it will \nhave on trade policy to important parts of the world today. This is not \nonly good trade policy, it is good economic policy, and it is good \ndiplomatic policy. It is extremely important that people realize the \ndiplomatic, economic, and trade ramifications of this legislation.\n  I have watched with great admiration as this legislation has been \nproduced. I must say it is one of the many reasons I have come to \nadmire our ranking member on the Finance Committee and his \nextraordinary effort in getting us to this point. I don't know that I \nhave talked to him about any matter as often as I have talked to him \nabout this in recent months. This is one he has lived and breathed. We \nare very grateful to him for his leadership and for all of the work he \ndid to get us to this point.\n  I have already expressed myself in regard to the importance of the \nlegislation and the extraordinary amount of effort that has gone into \nthe work today. This would not have happened were it not for the \ninvolvement of a number of our colleagues. Its importance cannot be \noveremphasized. This is good for this country, and as I noted, it is \nimportant we recognize the new opportunities that it presents, not only \nfor the Caribbean countries and Africa but for this country especially.\n  I would be remiss if I were not to mention the tremendous leadership \ndemonstrated by the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd. On every issue involving Central and Latin America, our caucus \ndepends upon him to a remarkable degree. He is, without a doubt, our \nexpert on South America, on Central America, and on international \nissues. I personally find myself required, in many cases, to turn to \nhim as the person in whom I have the greatest trust and for whom I have \nthe greatest admiration when it comes to his knowledge of these issues. \nI thank Senator Dodd for all of his efforts in getting us to this \npoint.\n  I also thank Senator Graham from Florida who has put a great deal of \neffort into the vote we were able to get this morning, and I am \ngrateful to him.\n  Finally, Senator Baucus also has worked diligently with all of our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and is also extraordinarily \nknowledgeable on trade matters.\n  We have a number of our colleagues who, because they worked as hard \nas they did, because they showed the leadership they did, because they \nwere as committed as they were to resolving outstanding differences and \nworking through these many issues in a way that allowed us this \nsuccess, we ought to pause and thank today. It is not often we see \nlegislation, and trade legislation in particular, of this import with \nthe kind of vote we just cast. It is a great day for this country. I \nagain publicly express my appreciation for their diligence and for \ntheir work in getting us to this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Feingold is recognized for up to 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  We just completed our work on the African Growth and Opportunity Act. \nI had the opportunity on a number of occasions during the debate to \nexpress my concerns about the bill and, in particular, the way in which \nit did not address one of the greatest crises in Africa--the HIV/AIDS \nproblem. But I have asked for this opportunity to speak about another \nenormous problem in Africa that I think needs to be closely associated \nwith the debate we just had and our thinking with regard to Africa; \nthat is, the problems with armed conflicts in Africa.\n  Anyone who has been reading the newspapers or watching television in \nthe last few days--whatever the medium--could not help but have a \nnatural reaction to the news from Africa that would suggest an \nimpression of chaos, and even feelings of hopelessness. I am sure this \nis especially true in the last few days when it comes to the events \nthat are transpiring in Sierra Leone with some United Nations troops \nbeing killed, others apparently captured, some missing, protesters \nbeing killed, and the absurdity of the United Nations troops protecting \nFoday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, the group \nthat has been responsible for some of the most heinous crimes against \npeople we have seen in many years--a group that has been responsible \nfor repeated acts of murder, maiming, and rape. People see this on the \ntelevision, read about it in the newspaper, and they wonder if there is \nanything that can be done to help make things different in Africa.\n  Then they read about Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \nthey have this sense, understandably, that is a place of endless \nconflict. They read about Ethiopia and the starvation and famine in a \nborder dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea that seems to be, at least \nto many of us, unnecessary and terribly harmful to the people of both \ncountries. They turn on the television, and they see Zimbabwe and what \nmust appear to be a form of chaos with people occupying the land of \nother people and farmers and farm workers being murdered in a place \nthat a lot of people thought was a success and that now begins to look \nawfully tense, violent, and undemocratic.\n  Add to that what we have been talking about in the last few days with \nthis enormous AIDS crisis. Then, if you\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nmention the AIDS crisis to somebody from Africa, they say: By the way, \ndo you know there is a terrible new strain of malaria that has become \nextremely problematic and dangerous for people in many parts of Africa? \nSo it is easy for anyone to react with resignation.\n  I think this is a compassionate country. I think our elected \nrepresentatives wish to help. When all of this is viewed, I fear that \npeople believe it is hopeless. I think that is understandable. But it \nis too easy to give up or to use well-worn phrases to dismiss the \nsituation in the African countries as hopeless.\n  We hear that a lot of records are thrown away. We hear people say, \nfor example, that is just ``tribalism'' and that is what happens when \nthese tribes strike out at one another.\n  Another word used is, well, it is just ``barbarism.'' That is what \ngoes on in Africa, people seem to say, and there is nothing you can do \nabout it.\n  Others point out quite clearly that there are problems with \ncorruption in many of these countries. One very thoughtful Senator \nactually said to me the other day as we talked about what might be done \nto try to resolve the problem in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: \nWell, I am afraid we are just going to throw away money to make \nourselves feel better.\n  That is what some people fear we do when we try to solve or help \nsolve the problem in Africa.\n  I don't think anyone can entirely dismiss any of this. As one who has \non occasion shared at least the emotional reaction to these phrases and \nterms, I am afraid these terms and attitudes reflect a generalization \nabout all of Africa, about the entire continent, that does not hold \ntrue. In fact, they are generalizations that even with regard to some \nof the specific examples do not have a connection to reality. I think \nthese generalizations sometimes suggest, and these phrases sometimes \nsuggest, an unwillingness to explore and understand the differences \nthat actually exist as between these African countries and situations, \nand in fact the differences between easy assumptions and the facts on \nthe ground in any one of these individual places.\n\n  I understand how easy it is for someone to slip into a feeling of \nhopelessness about Africa. I fight it myself in my own experience. \nHaving been in Africa in December for 2 weeks and having traveled to 10 \ndifferent countries, I have had some moments such as this. Since I have \nbeen there, in the countries I actually had a chance to visit, the \nsituation certainly has not vastly improved, as in the Congo--although \nI will be talking about that shortly.\n  In Rwanda, there has been some political instability, a change of \npower in the Presidency, and other disturbing events. Namibia, just \nbelow Angola, has been drawn, to a greater extent than they had been in \nthe past, into the Angolan conflict that has been going on for about 25 \nyears. This has been only since last December, with refugees crossing \nborder lines in significant numbers. In Angola itself, this brutal \ncivil war continues. You may have seen tragedy in some of these other \ncountries on the television. One of the most horrifying things you \ncould ever see is the incredible tragedy of war and the refugee \nchildren in Angola.\n  Then, of course, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe certainly seemed tense in \nDecember. I was concerned. President Mugabe seemed quite tense to me at \nthe time, but I had no idea there would be this collapse of a \ncommitment to democracy on the part of the President of Zimbabwe, and \nall the violence and fear that has resulted.\n  Add to that places I did not go this time. There was a coup d'etat in \nCote d'Ivoire. Some say it was for the better in the long run, but a \ncoup d'etat it was. And we have also seen the terrifying and tragic \nconsequences of flooding in Mozambique.\n  Even in Nigeria, which I would cite as a place where we have some \ngreater hope than we used to have, even there where a fledgling \ndemocracy is trying to take root, there are repeated examples of \nreligious and geographically based violence that make it difficult to \nbelieve the future is going to automatically be a bright one.\n  So I feel all these concerns about these problems, having just been \nthere and traveled to some of these countries. Oddly enough, though, I \nbelieve we have to struggle to simultaneously do two things. First, we \nhave to see each of these situations as different instead of just \ngeneralizing. Second, at the same time, we have to see the \ninterrelationships between the different situations in Africa and the \ndifferent countries in Africa. Because if we do not see how these \nsituations relate to each other, we will not be able to help to make \nstability and peace possible, and we will not be able to help with \nfighting disease and establishing democracy and fighting corruption.\n  I do not pretend to come close to understanding all of these \ninterrelationships, but I am trying to assist our own analysis of what \nAmerican foreign policy toward African nations should be.\n  Let me suggest, at the risk of oversimplification, a few distinctions \nbetween three different important situations in Africa that we have \nbeen reading about right now: Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of \nthe Congo, and Zimbabwe. They are very different. First, Sierra Leone \nis obviously a very small country compared to the others, apparently \nabout twice the size of the State of Maryland. The situation in Sierra \nLeone is certainly more confined than the situation in the Congo, but \nit does involve other elements. A lot of the refugees from Sierra Leone \nhave gone to Cote d'Ivoire, which has led to some destabilization \nthere.\n  The leader of Liberia, Charles Taylor, has been heavily involved in \nbacking Mr. Sankoh in Sierra Leone, and has caused problems backing the \nRUF organization that committed so many of these crimes. Unlike so many \nother African countries, Sierra Leone recently, in the last few years, \nhad their first real democratic election. The President was thrown out \nin a coup, then the ECOMOG, the Nigerian-led force, came in and put him \nback in power. But the country descended into this, one of the most \nbrutal civil wars we have witnessed in many years. So the Sierra Leone \nsituation is a very tenuous governmental situation. There is no long, \ncontinuous period of rule, either democratic or otherwise, by one \nparticular power or entity or person.\n\n  Contrast that with the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nCongo is, obviously, a huge country. To give you an idea of the size, \nit is basically the size of all of the United States, from the \nMississippi River all the way over including the entire east coast. It \nis that big in area. But it has not suffered so much from instability, \nexcept for in the last few years, as from a brutal rule of Mr. Mobutu \nwho, for maybe 35 years, was the autocratic ruler of what was then \ncalled Zaire and who, in fact, some regarded as one of the greatest \nthieves of all time, in terms of all the resources and riches he \nspirited out of his nation of Zaire which is now called Congo.\n  Finally, Mr. Mobutu had to flee and a group of powers from around \nAfrica, some of whom are fighting each other now, together helped \nestablish President Laurent Kabila in power a few years ago.\n  So it is a terribly difficult situation, but it is not the same as \nSierra Leone. Sierra Leone is a frightening situation. There are great \ncrimes being committed. But what is happening in the Congo quite a few \npeople have referred to as a world war, or Africa's first world war. It \nis that significant and that problematic.\n  In fact, many people do not realize it but there are so many \ncountries that now have their troops fighting in Congo that it really \ndoes look like a world war. There are alliances. For example, one side \nof combatants that are supposedly allies--although they have been \nfighting amongst themselves some--are Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi. They \nare backing the rebels trying to fight the Kabila government. On the \nother side, you find groups from Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe trying \nto support and keep in power Mr. Kabila.\n  In addition to that, we fear there are economic incentives for some \nof these countries to want to stay in Congo. It is a country rich with \nincredible resources, including diamonds. Some suggest some of these \ncountries may not want to leave the conflict because of the economic \nopportunities that exist. So, I would have to say Congo is already like \nthe ultimate Rubik's Cube in foreign policy; it is so complicated and \ndifficult, in terms of understanding what is going on and what could be \ndone. It is like a world war.\n\n  Now, contrast that with the third example, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is in a\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nvery different position. Zimbabwe actually had what, fortunately, \nbecame about 20 years ago, majority rule. Although I obviously believe \nthat the previous Rhodesian Government was a terrible government, some \nof the institutions from that era have continued into the current era \nand suggest at least a significant commitment in the past to reasonable \ngovernance and the rule of law.\n  Unfortunately, that promise and that hope that Mr. Mugabe originally \nbrought have fallen apart. Many people think what is happening in \nZimbabwe is a race war; that is not the case. It is not a war of black \nagainst white. Some think it is about land reform. Although certainly \nthere should be some land reform, that is not what is happening in what \nused to be a country that some thought was moving in the right \ndirection.\n  What is happening in this country--that basically was on a better \npath than Congo, and certainly a better path than Sierra Leone--is \nPresident Mugabe is not moving his country forward in a democratic way, \nin the way that the great Nelson Mandela did. Nelson Mandela, one of \nthe greatest persons of the 20th century, after all those years of \nimprisonment, became the President of South Africa. What did he do \nafter his first term was up? He believed it was important that \ndemocracy work, and he stepped aside and let someone else be elected \nPresident. This is just the opposite of what Mr. Mugabe is doing in \nZimbabwe, which is threatening to destroy, in my view, a country that \nhas great promise.\n  I am trying to illustrate how different these situations are. Why do \nI do this? We must consider our responses to each of these crises \nindividually, as well as in the context of Africa as a whole. When we \nlook at each one, as well as any other situation in Africa, I can \nunderstand the hesitation on the part of the American people and our \nelected Representatives. Hesitation is not only understandable, but it \nmakes some sense.\n  I understand the need to be hesitant. Hesitation should not be born \nof oversimplification or incorrect generalization. I know why we are \nhesitant to get involved in too many places. I have personally said \nmany times we are overcommitted around the world. We have over 250,000 \nAmerican troops stationed abroad in this post-cold-war era. We have \ngotten ourselves in situations in Bosnia and Kosovo and in East Timor \nand even in Colombia, potentially, that some people would regard as \nopen-ended. I am more optimistic about the East Timor situation. \nHowever, I am fearful that in Bosnia and Kosovo we got into a situation \nvery heavily. It is open ended. We may find it difficult to extricate \nourselves. That is a reason for hesitation.\n  There are reasons for being hesitant specifically with regard to the \nrecord of the efforts made in Africa in the past. Certainly, the \nfailure of the U.N. mission in Congo in the early 1960s is an example \noften cited as an attempt that failed that makes people hesitant. \nWithout any doubt, the miserable failure of our Somalia mission in \nnortheast Africa in 1993 and 1994 is another example of where the \nAmerican people would have some reason to pause before wanting to get \ninvolved in helping to resolve some of the conflicts in Africa.\n  I think this hesitation begs the question with regard to Africa. I \nthink the question is, Why do we act decisively in other parts of the \nworld, and seem to be disproportionately hesitant to act when it comes \nto problems in Africa? There are a lot of reasons that might be given \nfor treating Africa differently. Let me suggest I don't think these \nreasons hold up. I want to mention a few of the reasons that have been \ngiven or might be given.\n  First, our not acting in Africa cannot be because of a lack of \ntragedy, brutality, and even genocide in Africa. Despite the cries of \n``never again'' that were legitimately raised with respect to Bosnia \nand Kosovo and even East Timor, how can anyone now use that kind of \nphrase with regard to what happens in Africa? I don't need to cite \nchapter and verse from my colleagues, although maybe I should, about \nthe tragedies and brutality and human suffering in Africa as a result \nof conflict, be it Angola, Burundi, or, of course, Rwanda.\n\n  I don't think the reason we don't act in Africa is because the \nAfrican countries should try to help themselves. The fact is, the \nAfrican countries are doing a pretty good job with very limited \nresources to try to shoulder their share of the burden. In fact, they \ncompare favorably to our European allies when it comes to stepping up \nto the plate in their own region.\n  One of my criticisms of the Bosnia and Kosovo situation is I don't \nthink the European allies did as much as they could and asked us to do \nmore than we should in those situations. There are examples, in Africa, \nof a better record. Nigeria, a country I have often criticized on this \nfloor, under their previous military regime actually has a good record \nof trying to resolve conflicts in their region. The ECOMOG forces, led \nby Nigeria, were involved in trying to change the situation for the \nbetter in Liberia, and the Nigerians in the past have taken aggressive \nsteps to try to solve the problem in Sierra Leone, and some hope they \nwill be asked to do this again.\n  When I was in Mali in December, one of the poorest countries in the \nworld, they told me how some of their people were part of the ECOMOG \nforce that went into Sierra Leone, and how they lost eight lives in \nthat mission. They are taking the loss of lives of their own citizens \nin the name of trying to have peace and stability in their region. I am \nimpressed by that.\n  I am impressed by the comments of President Chiluba of Zambia this \nweekend who, after a couple hundred of his troops were missing in \nSierra Leone, said he regretted it. He was concerned for their safety, \nbut peace was worth this kind of effort.\n  For anyone who thinks the African nations and the African Presidents \nare asking us to do everything, that is not what the record shows. I \ndon't think it can be a fair objection to our acting and a reason for \nhesitance to say they are asking for American troops to do this. That \nis not true. I am not hearing demands for American troops. In fact, I \ntalked to ten different African Presidents about the Congo situation in \nDecember, and I don't remember any of them asking for American troops \nto be involved in this situation. In fact, some did specifically seem \nto indicate they prefer that there not be American troops involved for \nwhatever reason. This is not a question of whether American ground \ntroops will be asked to resolve these situations.\n  I don't think our hesitance can be explained by suggesting that \nAfrican situations are somehow too complex--though, as I indicated they \noften are complex--to try and unravel. Some of the situations are \nhorrible but are relatively straightforward, such as Angola. And as I \nsaid, although Congo is complex, so, certainly, are the situations in \nBosnia with the ethnic divisions and borders that show no particular \nrelationship to the ethnic identity of the people. There are little \nenclaves throughout the area. We are talking in this Congress about \ngetting more involved in the situation in Colombia with real money and \nreal resources. That is an enormously complex situation which is \nrelated to the situation in other Latin American countries. So it can't \nsimply be that these are tough nuts to crack; they are, but they are \nnot the only ones. We have acted in some incredibly difficult and \ncomplex situations in parts of the world that are not in Africa.\n  Can it be because somehow Africa doesn't involve our national \nsecurity? I don't think it can be that these situations are not \ndangerous, not only for Africa but for us and the rest of the world. \nThe situation in the Congo is often called Africa's first world war, as \nI have said. That means not just tragedy for Congo and the nations \ndirectly adjacent, but it means it has the potential for enormous \ndisruption throughout the entire continent, and I suggest a \ndestabilizing influence throughout the world when it comes to political \nborders, when it comes to the spread of AIDS, when it comes to millions \nof children who are orphans, when it comes to child soldiers marauding \naround the countries, and, yes, national security because this kind of \nsituation, if left unchecked, opens the door to other countries and \nother entities that are not our friends, trying to exploit the tragedy \nin Africa, whether it might be attempted by Libya, North Korea, or \nperhaps China. It cannot be that we hesitate because this continent\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nis not in our national interest and is not a question of our national \nsecurity.\n\n  Finally, perhaps most important, our hesitance cannot be because the \nUnited States and the West have no responsibility to act. Consider the \ncolonial legacy. After my trip, I had a chance to read one of the best \nand most powerful books I have read in a long time called ``King \nLeopold's Ghost'' by Adam Hochschild. This is basically the story of \nthe brutal exploitation of the Belgian Congo by Belgium's King Leopold \nand others in the previous century. Colonialism essentially marauded \nthe social structure of a peaceful people.\n  When that period finally came to an end in 1960, I believe, they had \na democratic election. I am sure it was not perfect, but a man named \nPatrice Lumumba, a hero to the Congolese people, was elected President. \nA few months later, he was brutally murdered, without a doubt at the \ninstruction of our CIA and our country. That is what we did to the \npeople of Congo, and we installed Mr. Mobutu who proceeded to have one \nof the most brutal rules in history for the next 30 to 35 years.\n  To suggest we do not have a responsibility, that we did not have \nanything to do with this is just plain wrong. The same thing goes for \nAngola. This is not about the colonial era only. Angola was used for \nmany years as a playground for the cold war. The Soviet Union and the \nUnited States decided to have it out here, and they planted more \nlandmines in the fields, the rich farm fields of Angola, than any other \nplace in the entire world. As a result, there are more amputees in \nAngola than anywhere else in the world and in any other time in human \nhistory. Walk down a street in Angola and look at the number of people \nwho have lost a limb to landmines--not that lives, of course, were not \ntaken. It is appalling. That was our war. I understand the stakes that \nwere involved, but to suggest we do not have a responsibility when we \nwere that involved in the situation and to fail to help the people from \nAngola to have a decent life is simply wrong.\n  I have just given six reasons that I do not think can really be the \nreasons for our not acting in some of these situations. I will now \nsuggest three reasons I think might genuinely explain our extreme \nhesitance and reluctance to help stop these conflicts in Africa, as \ncompared to our willingness to do it in other parts of the world.\n  First, I believe there is a genuine fear that we will get stuck in \none of these situations. Some might call it the Vietnam syndrome, and I \nunderstand that, having been a young opponent of the Vietnam war myself \nin my college years. I remember the song entitled ``Knee Deep in the \nBig Muddy.'' That was a symbol for our generation of how we were stuck \nin Vietnam. I am sure many people worry about that.\n  I submit we are already stuck in Bosnia and Kosovo, and I believe we \nbecame stuck in those places because we went headlong into those \nconflicts with no good plan about how to finish it or what resources we \nwould commit to it or what steps would allow us to finish the job or \ndecide that we cannot finish the job. I do think that our hesitance is \npart of our very recent memory of the enormous tragedy in Africa in \nSomalia when we lost 18 of our brave soldiers in the helicopter \ndisaster that led to our withdrawal. There is no question in my mind \nthat Americans and American foreign policymakers worry that if we try \nto help in one of these situations, we will get stuck and cannot get \nout. When I say ``we,'' I mean the international community, not \nnecessarily just the United States.\n  Second, I think we do not act perhaps when we should because we have \na tendency in this country to think in terms of having to do all or \nnothing in one of these situations; that we have to do the whole thing, \nand if we do not do the whole thing, somehow we have not lived up to an \nAmerican obligation to do absolutely everything to solve the problem.\n\n  Some say do not do it at all unless you are going to go in and get \nthe job done. I have heard that many times with regard to military \nintervention; why don't we just go in there and finish the job? It is \nan attitude which, on occasion, is appropriate but I think sometimes \nleads to mistakes.\n  When it comes to the African situation, this notion that we should do \neverything or nothing leads to real problems. In Somalia, we tried to \ndo too much when we did not know what we were doing, and then we did \nnothing when it came to Rwanda. It does not have to be everything or \nnothing. In fact, there is a recent example I am relatively pleased \nabout, and that is what we are doing in East Timor. We are not leading \nthe charge there. Australia is leading the charge and Asian countries \nare leading the charge. We are helping in a measured, reasonable way \nbecause the countries in that region, as I suggest some of the \ncountries in Africa, are trying to do the same thing.\n  I believe that is a reason people are afraid of doing some things \nbecause they want to do everything or nothing.\n  A third reason we do not act, and a genuine reason--and I fear it is \nthe most important reason and I wish I did not have to come to this \nconclusion--but I do think there is somehow, unbelievably, a double \nstandard when it comes to Africa. This is very bad for Africa, and I \nsubmit it is just as bad for the United States.\n  When I see President Mbeki of South Africa and the President of the \nPeople's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin, get together at a news \nconference and comment about how they are tired of having one country \ncalling all the shots in the world, I see fertile ground for resentment \nagainst the United States that can hurt us today and can especially \nhurt America and our children and grandchildren in the future.\n  This is a sad thing to let happen because we do not have a lot of the \ncolonial baggage and some of the resentment that Africans feel toward \ncountries such as Belgium because we were not deeply involved in many \nof those situations. We have a positive opportunity, when it comes to \nmuch of Africa, to get it right.\n  It is this idea of getting it right that brings me to the specific \npurpose of these comments, and that is that we should not summarily \nretreat from the pursuit of peace and self-determination in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. I fear there will be some kind of a \nknee-jerk reaction because of the very disturbing news and film coming \nfrom Sierra Leone. The United Nations there obviously has not yet got \nit right. I may well be interested in seeing and helping that United \nNations effort become stronger and tougher to deal with the brutality \nthat is going on, and we cannot abandon that situation, but I believe \nthere is a way to get it right in Congo. One of the main reasons is the \nleadership of a man from whom I stole the phrase ``Get It Right,'' and \nthat is our Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, whom I \nhad the chance to accompany on a trip to Africa in December. It was an \nhonor to be on that trip, and we had a chance together to meet with \nvirtually every one of the African Presidents who are directly \ninterested in this conflict.\n  I want my colleagues to know that, although we were extremely moved \nand troubled by the AIDS crisis in Africa, and that overtook us \nemotionally on the trip, the core reason for the trip was to see if the \nAmbassador and I and others could get an understanding of the \ncomplexity of what is going on in the Congo and what we could do about \nit.\n  I want my colleagues to know--and I heard him do it--that at each \nstop, Ambassador Holbrooke said: We want to help, but there are no \nblank checks and we must get it right or we cannot help.\n  He was very measured and showed due caution. Of course, the situation \nin the Congo is incredibly difficult, but I see some reason to see it \nas progressing in the right direction, slowly but surely. I understand \nthat our support may not necessarily work, that there could be a \nfailure, but I think that serious logical steps can be taken.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to, just very briefly, \nindicate some of the steps that have been taken in the Congo pursuant \nto what is called the Lusaka agreement that suggests to me this is a \nsituation worth supporting if at all possible.\n  The countries involved, including the Congo itself, and some of the \nrebel groups, have signed this Lusaka agreement that set up something \ncalled a\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\njoint military commission. This joint military commission is committed \nto doing the job of actually enforcing the peace and making sure the \nparties withdraw from the other countries.\n  In order to get to phase 2 of this operation that is now \ncontemplated, a number of things had to happen. The joint military \ncommission had to be created, and an initial 90 observers from the U.N. \nhad to be deployed. That was done. But before the next phase goes \nforward--the one that involves some 5,500 U.N. troops and personnel--a \nnumber of other things had to happen as well.\n  There had to be a functioning cease-fire. Although it has not worked \nat all times--and at the moment is in a little bit of trouble because \nof the conflict between Uganda and Rwanda--on the whole, it has \nsucceeded in the last month. Second, it was essential that all these \nparties come together and pick one person as a facilitator of the \nprocess of national dialogue. After a number of efforts, they did so, \nby appointing President Masire, the former President of Botswana.\n  They had to create an operational arrangement of the U.N. MONUC group \nand the JMC to coordinate, and they did it. They had to have a signed \ncommitment by the parties of the conflict guaranteeing security and \nfreedom of movement and access for the U.N. team. And they did it.\n  So now we come to the point of where additional steps, hopefully, can \nbe taken. We are now looking at getting into the second phase of this \npeace operation, including developing plans to disengage and withdraw \nthe troops from the various countries and parties that have signed this \nagreement, and the conducting of an inter-Congolese dialog that could \nlead to a genuine democratic country, and to develop these plans with \nthe JMC.\n  If that is accomplished, and only if these steps are accomplished, \nwould we go forward to the final steps, phase 3, which involves \nverifying the withdrawal of foreign forces, normalizing border \nsecurity, and, yes, finally, again, after all these years, the \nconducting of a democratic election.\n  So what I am seeing here, although it is certainly not perfect, is a \nmeasured step-by-step approach--not an all-or-nothing approach--but a \nstep-by-step approach, led by the African countries. That is something \nI think we should encourage and even admire because it is so very \ndifficult to do in this situation.\n  For me, there is a sufficient record to say, we must try to do \nsomething--not send U.S. troops, not send a huge United Nations force \nof 30,000 or 40,000 people, as some have wondered about.\n  It may not work, and we may ultimately have to say no to doing more, \nas tragic as failure would be--but based on the facts that I have \nwitnessed and learned about, I think we must try.\n  We must not wash our hands of this or just say that it would be an \nexample of throwing money in the Congo to make ourselves feel better. I \nbelieve we should support financially--and in other ways--the efforts \nfor peace in the Congo. We must try.\n  Again, why must we try? I think because this is a test--it is a very \ntough test--but it is a test of whether the United States really does \nhave a double standard vis-a-vis Africa. To abandon the Congo without \nan effort would be a strong signal that we intend to abandon all of \nAfrica.\n  We must try, even though we have tried in other situations with great \ndifficulty--such as Kosovo and Bosnia and Haiti. Let me again suggest I \nthink we went too headlong into those situations. I do not think we \nwere careful to take the measured steps that are being done in this \ncase. And that led to our complete, abject failure to act with regard \nto Rwanda. As I have said, even with regard to Somalia, mistakes were \nmade. But I think that is because it was, again, an example of an all-\nor-nothing approach, with no clear mission, and no exit strategy.\n\n  I think this is different. I think this has the potential to work, \nalthough it is difficult, because it is measured and it is an African-\ndominated approach.\n  I think we have to try because at this time in human history the \ncrimes against Africa have to be halted. I do not have time to talk \nabout the slave trade, the gap between the rich and the poor, the use \nof these countries as a playing field for colonial powers during the \ncold war. But we cannot extol this new global economy and trade around \nthe world and have these African nations treated forever as hopeless \nand fundamentally different.\n  We must try, in fact, because the lofty rhetoric of U.S.-Africa trade \nbecomes something of a cruel hoax on the people of Africa if we are not \ngoing to confront the brutality, the chaos, and even the genocide in \nthe very nations with whom we claim we want to have improved trade.\n  We must try because I think it truly hurts America in the world's \neyes, at a critical time in our role as a world leader, if we are \nperceived as being unwilling to help African nations when they \ndesperately need that help.\n  Finally, to return to my initial theme--because each situation in \nAfrica is different, and yet interrelated--if we help move this process \nforward, this Lusaka agreement, involving cooperation between the U.N. \nand the joint military commission, it cannot only give Congo what it \nhas always deserved and never had--real peace, self-determination and \nhope--but it can help its neighbors.\n  Rwanda is greatly destabilized and threatened because of this \nconflict in the Congo. Uganda has a very problematic border with the \nCongo, and other countries, and is now in conflict with Rwanda because \nthey are in the Congo together. That would help alleviate that \nsituation. Burundi has enormous problems of its own, which President \nMandela is trying to help with. None of these countries should be \ninvolved in the Congo conflict. They have problems of their own.\n  Angola, which I have described as one of the most horrifying \nsituations in Africa, should not be having troops up in this area for \nwhatever reason, perhaps because of their conflict within their own \ncountry. We can cause this to be a more localized problem that perhaps \nwe could deal with.\n  Namibia certainly should not have troops up in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, nor should the other countries, when all it does \nis drain their resources and causes problems over their borders.\n  And, of course, Zimbabwe. Talk about any country in the world that \nshould not be using its resources right now to fight a war in the \nCongo, when it has such desperate economic and political problems at \nthis time. Even South Africa suffers in its tremendous struggle to \nbecome one of the great nations of the world as long as this Congo \nconflict continues.\n  Let us be realistic, but let us also be open to the possibility of \ntrying in the Congo. Let us not have a double standard where we act \nwith great rhetoric and words of ``never again'' in so many places in \nthe world, but when it comes to Africa, we seem to be unable to act.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2521, which the clerk will report by \ntitle.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2521) making appropriations for military \n     construction, family housing, and base realignment and \n     closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill and report for fiscal year \n2001. This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking \nmember, Senator Murray of Washington, and I have tried to maintain \nregarding military construction on this subcommittee. It has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Murray and her staff. They have been very \ncooperative throughout this\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nwhole process. That is very important because we take our jobs here \nvery seriously and this appropriations bill very seriously.\n  This bill was reported out of the full Appropriations Committee on \nMay 9. The bill recommended by the Committee on Appropriations is for \n$8,634,000,000. The bill is $600 million over the budget request and \napproximately $292 million over last year's enacted level. However, \nthere are some considerations we must make. More importantly, the \nlegislation reflects a reduction of $1.2 billion from just 4 years \nago--a decrease of almost 12 percent.\n  We sought to recommend to the Senate a balanced bill, and we believe \nit addresses the key military construction requirements for readiness, \nfor family housing, barracks, quality of life, and the Guard and \nReserve components.\n  As my colleagues well know, we take into strong consideration the \nGuard and Reserve components because we have seen a shift in our force \nstructure. Our force structure has shifted from Regular Army, Air \nForce, Navy, and Marines to Reserve and Guard components. When we \nstarted to do that, we found that around this country our \ninfrastructure was lacking for training of these personnel.\n  This bill honors a commitment we have to our armed forces. It helps \nensure that housing and infrastructure needs of the military are given \nproper recognition.\n  Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within \nthe committee's 302(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  This bill has some points I want to mention. It includes $3.5 billion \nto provide better and more modern family housing for our service \npersonnel and their families.\n  On another quality-of-life measure, we have added substantially to \nthe budget request for barracks construction projects. The bill \nprovides $712 million for 43 projects throughout the United States and \noverseas. This funding will provide single service members a more \nfavorable living environment wherever they are stationed.\n  The committee also provides $101 million for 14 environmental \ncompliance projects.\n  We also address the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve \ncomponents.\n  As our active force grows smaller, we are more dependent than ever on \nour Guard and Reserve for the maintenance of our national security. I \ncontinue to be greatly alarmed that the Department of Defense takes no \nresponsibility for ensuring that our Reserve components have adequate \nfacilities.\n  For the members of the Guard and Reserve, quality of life, too, is \nvery important. It is all about buildings and it is all about \nfacilities from which they work and perform their mission.\n  Their lack of regard for the total force concept very much concerns \nme and many of my colleagues. In Montana, we have the greatest example \nof a unified Red Horse Division at Malmstrom Air Force Base. It is made \nup of Regular Air Force and Reserves and is working very well.\n  This comes at a time when our country is so heavily dependent on the \nGuard and Reserve to maintain our presence around the world. For \nexample, the President's budget request was for only $222 million for \nall of the Reserve components and the National Guard. That was just not \nenough.\n  Recognizing this chronic shortfall, we have again lent support by \nadding $359 million to these accounts.\n  In each case, the funds will help satisfy the essential mission; \nquality of life, and, of course, our readiness requirements.\n  We fully fund the budget request for the base realignment and closure \naccount by funding $1.17 billion to continue the ongoing BRAC process \nand consumate the remaining closures and realignments.\n  As you know, in this line particularly, it has been very troubling to \nthis committee that environmental cleanup has really soaked up a lot of \nour funding that should have been used for quality of life.\n  We will work very closely with the Senate Armed Services Committee as \nwe put together a conference package for military construction.\n  This bill also includes year 2000 supplemental funding for the \nDepartment of Defense in peacekeeping operations in Kosovo and other \nrequirements.\n  The chairman of the full Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, \nwill speak to these issues as we move along.\n  I urge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and to move it \nforward as quickly and as expeditiously as we possibly can.\n  Now I yield to my good friend, the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor today to \noffer the fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill. I \nthank Senator Burns, the chairman of our committee, and his staff, for \nbeing so good in a great bipartisan manner, in being able to work this \nbill through again this year. I publicly thank him for his work with me \nin a really solid manner. I appreciate the way he has done that.\n  Before I address this bill, I want to address some comments that were \nmade about me on this floor by the majority leader just a short time \nago.\n  While I was taking part in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee \nas part of my work to improve pipeline safety in this country, I \nunderstand the majority leader suggested that my schedule was a reason \nwhy a debate on commonsense gun control was not going to take place \ntoday.\n  Given the work that I have done over the years to protect young \npeople from gun violence, and my strong support of this weekend's \nMillion Mom March, I was rather surprised by that suggestion. I assure \nmy colleagues that this debate is too important to be delayed any \nlonger.\n  While I support the majority leader's concern about a family \nobligation I have; namely, my son is going to be married, there is no \nexcuse for not debating this legislation--especially the absence of any \none Member.\n  If this had been a concern of the majority leader, perhaps he could \nhave spoken to me personally before incorrectly citing me as the reason \nwhy the Senate would not be debating gun violence today.\n  I would like to remind the majority leader that, on November 4, I \ncame to the floor, in the wake of a fatal shooting in my home State, \nand urged the Members of the Senate to work with me on commonsense \nsolutions to gun violence. Since that time, it has been the \ncongressional majority that has prevented this much needed debate from \ntaking place, and it is the congressional majority today that, again, \nrefuses to address this vital issue.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that, on average, 12 children \ndie every day from gunfire. We cannot wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I will now turn to the issue before us.\n  I again am pleased to be here with my chairman, Senator Burns, in \nrecommending the fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations \nbill to the Senate for its approval.\n  This is an unusual bill this year because it contains emergency \nsupplemental funding for a number of defense items not related to \nmilitary construction, including U.S. participation in the Kosovo \npeacekeeping operation and in the Colombia counternarcotics initiative.\n  I will defer to my ranking member on the full committee, Senator \nByrd, and others, to address the items in the supplemental portion of \nthis bill, and I will confine my remarks to the military construction \nportion of the bill.\n  This bill provides a total of $8.634 billion in new spending \nauthority for military construction for fiscal year 2001.\n  This level of funding exceeds the President's budget request for \nmilitary construction by $600 million, and provides nearly $300 million \nabove the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2000.\n  Nevertheless, as usual, this bill comes up short of what the services \nneed to meet their infrastructure requirements.\n  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I once again urge the \nadministration to increase the budget for military construction.\n  This is a bricks-and-mortar bill.\n  There is nothing glamorous or ``gee-whiz'' about aircraft hangars or \nbarracks or armories.\n  But this is an essential bill, and the projects that it funds are \nvital to our men and women in uniform.\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\n  As many of my colleagues have pointed out to me in the course of \ndeveloping this bill, the President's budget barely scratches the \nsurface or infrastructure needs.\n  The requests that Senator Burns and I have received this year address \ncompelling needs throughout the services, and I wish that we had the \nresources to fund more of them.\n  Senator Burns and his staff deserve a great deal of credit for their \ndedicated and thoughtful approach in drafting this bill.\n  As always, they have worked very hard to produce a balanced, \nbipartisan product that takes into account both the concerns of the \nSenate and the needs of the military.\n  In particular, they have done a superb job of continuing to shine the \nspotlight on the quality of life projects that are so important to our \nmen and women in uniform, and to their families.\n  At a time when military enlistment and retention are declining--and \nthe services are unable to match the financial incentives of the \nprivate sector--quality of life issues are amplified in importance.\n  Quality of life issues do not diminish the importance of readiness \nprojects, but we must not dismiss their role in recruiting and \nretaining our military personnel.\n  Within the budget constraints that we are all forced to operate this \nyear, this bill attempts to meet the most urgent and timely military \nconstruction needs with very limited resources.\n  All of the major construction projects that we have funded have been \nauthorized.\n  In addition, we have ensured adequate funding for family housing and \nbarracks construction.\n  However, I remain concerned that the nation's overall investment in \nmilitary infrastructure continues to lag, and I hope we will see a more \nrobust effort in future budgets.\n  This is an extremely important bill for our nation and our military \nforces.\n  I again commend Senator Burns, and I thank the staff of the \nAppropriations Committee, including Sid Ashworth, Christina Evans, and \nSonia King, as well as Mark Borreson, a fellow on my staff, for their \nexcellent work in producing the bill.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to completing action on this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to continue discussing the \nissue we were talking about earlier. In my earlier remarks, while \ntalking about trade, we talked about the value of trade with the sub-\nSaharan nations, whose economic subjugation created all kinds of \nproblems. We talked about the economic strangulation that presents so \nmany problems and creates violence and corruption and lawlessness in \nsome of these countries. We are hoping that this trade can suppress \nthose differences and that violence.\n  I was making the point that we in this country have a problem of our \nown regarding gun violence, which is very detrimental to the harmonious \nfunctioning within our society. We have these huge differences between \nthose who think that ``guns unlimited'' ought to be the rule. I had the \nopportunity to hear a brilliant author, Gary Wills, talk about why it \nis that people distrust Government. One of the issues he brings up--and \nI am paraphrasing some here--is that when people see that violence \npervades our society, we have to have some sense of a regulation. He \npointed out that if we didn't have regulations on our highways, highway \nsafety programs, our system would be rendered useless because people \nwould be afraid to go out on the highways because of the mayhem it \nwould create.\n  I think it is a fairly simple thing to understand that if you were \nable to drive as fast as you wanted on either side of the road, we \nwould be killing and maiming one another. I don't understand why it is \nthat we can't have some sensible gun violence control in this country, \nsome regulation. Why is this one part of our society so exempt from any \nkind of sensible regulation that says a person who wants to buy a gun \nought to be qualified physically and emotionally to do so, and that if \nthey want to buy a gun they ought not have any history of violent \nbehavior?\n  I wrote legislation regarding spousal abuse. I said anybody convicted \nof a misdemeanor for spousal abuse ought not to be able to own a gun. I \nhad terrific resistance in this place. I could not get it through, \nreally. Finally, we got it through as a piece of legislation on a \nbudget.\n  What has happened in 3\\1/2\\ years? Well, 33,000 people who are not \nqualified by virtue of violence against a spouse or their children--\ndomestic abusers--have been prevented from getting guns, where maybe \nthey pointed a gun at somebody and said, ``If you don't listen to me, I \nwill blow your brains out.'' I think it was a positive measure.\n  The Brady bill was fought tooth and nail before it was passed. The \nBrady bill gave Government time to check out these individuals who are \napplying for guns or gun ownership at such a prolific rate that we \nought to have some measure of control. Well, after a long debate and a \nlot of suffering, had Jim Brady, who was shot while an attempt was made \non the life of President Reagan, not wheeled himself around the \nCapitol, it never would have passed.\n  What was the effect of the Brady bill--the thing the gun lobby was so \nafraid of that would ``impair freedom\"? Baloney, as we say. Well, \n500,000 people were prevented from getting guns, thank the Lord. What \nwould have happened? Those 500,000 people who were not qualified either \nby virtue of personal characteristics, background, a tendency toward \nviolence, or trouble, could have gotten guns. Thank goodness they were \nnot able to get guns.\n  We wonder whether or not, with a Million Moms March imminent on \nMother's Day, anybody thinks mothers are clamoring to leave their homes \nand march in protest because they have nothing better to do on Mother's \nDay. That is the most revered holiday, next to Christmas, that we have \nin our society. It is when people flock to see moms. I know my children \nwant to see their mother. My grandchildren want to see their mother. A \nlot of them in my family will be out there marching because they are \nsick and tired of worrying about whether or not their children, when \nthey go to school to learn, to sing, to play, to make friends, are \ngoing to get shot, are going to get assaulted, are going to get killed \nor wounded in such a way that they never recover. That doesn't only \nmean those who were hit with a bullet. It means friends who saw their \nclassmates at Columbine lying down and trying to crawl out windows to \nget away from the madness, in fear for their lives.\n  What was the impact of that throughout the school? Did the wounding \nstop with those hit with a bullet? Or do those wounds go on forever? \nSome lost friends who were 16 and 17 years old--kids in the prime of \nlife. Those wounds will last forever. So it is not only those who are \ninvolved in the fracas; it is everybody--all of us across the country.\n  Look at the physical cost: metal detectors, guards, cameras, rigid \nprocesses for transportation. It costs a fortune. Frankly, I think we \nshould just put a lid on this proliferation of guns and stop the \nunlicensed gun dealers from selling guns and not asking any questions \nof the buyer--``buyers anonymous''--at gun shows across the country. If \nyou want to buy guns, just put your money down, brother, and you can \nhave all the guns you want and walk away. You could be one of the 10 \nmost wanted criminals in the United States on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted \nlist. Even if they recognize you, they have no obligation in the States \nthat don't\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nhave control because the Federal Government doesn't have it all; they \nare under no obligation to say, hey, we know you are sought after. We \nknow you are a criminal.\n  There are no rules. We ought to stop that and we ought to make a \npledge to the mothers who are going to be out there on Sunday that we \nare going to do something about it, instead of sitting on our hands \nover a year since Columbine. It is almost a year now since we passed \nthe gun show loophole closure in this body and sent it over to the \nHouse as part of a conference. That is what we do here. The House and \nthe Senate confer and they try to agree on a bill. They don't want to \nact on it. The action is no action. That inaction is the rule because \nthey don't want to bring up the gun issue. It is too sensitive. It \nmight be too offensive to the NRA. It might be too offensive to the gun \nlobby. We are saying, no, we have to do something about it. The least \nthing we are going to do today is offer a resolution and, we hope, get \nit passed.\n\n  We ask those on the other side who won't join us to stand up in front \nof the American public and say: I don't think you are entitled to send \nyour child to a safe school; you have to run the risk. After all, guns \nare more important than my kids or my grandchildren. I can tell you \nthat the so-called ``freedom to own a gun and maim people,'' and the \nConstitution says you are allowed to shoot at anybody you want to, is \nnot a matter--in the wildest imagination--of the second amendment.\n  Mr. President we have a limit of time. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I want to give as much time as my colleague from New \nYork needs, not more than 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey for \nyielding. I thank him for not only his generosity in yielding time but \nfor his leadership this year and last year on this issue, and in the 18 \nyears he has been in the Senate. We will really miss him in many ways \nas he goes on to other things, but one of the most important reasons we \nwill miss him is as the leader in this fight to bring sensibility and \nrationality to gun laws.\n  I hope we will pass the resolution the Senator from New Jersey is \noffering and that it will not be blocked. I hope people will let us \nvote because we are voting in the shadow of a momentous movement that \nis taking place in America.\n  I have been fighting in the Congress for gun control for 20 years. I \nhave seen the various ebbs and flows in public opinion on guns. I have \nseen modest gun control measures, such as this one, bottled up in \ncommittee and picked to death by those who do the NRA's bidding. I was \non the front lines when we scratched and clawed our way through a few \nvictories such as Brady and the assault weapons ban.\n  We are on this floor now because the world changes on Mother's Day. \nOn Mother's Day, the political landscape will undergo a seismic shock. \nThere is a classic sign in the movie ``Network'' where a TV commentator \nshouts, ``I am mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.'' And \nthat leads to a spontaneous reaction where families heave their TV set \nout the window.\n  That is what the Million Mom March is. It is a spontaneous assemblage \nof ordinary citizens who are not going to take it anymore. It is \nbigger, more passionate, and more widespread than any movement we have \nseen in years. It is a movement more powerful and more numerous than \nany of us could ever have hoped.\n\n  When the mothers of this Nation gather on Constitution Avenue, their \ncollective footsteps will sound like a shot heard around the world. \nThey are not going to put up with lame excuses from Congress about why \nthe Lautenberg amendment is bottled up. They are not going to put up \nwith any more reasons about why we can't pass the most basic, \ncommonsense gun measures.\n  Let me say to George Bush, and anyone else who is standing in the way \nof closing the gun show loophole, that our mothers are watching. On \nMother's Day, the mothers of this Nation will give us the gift of \ncommon sense. There is a new force in the country today and its name is \nMom. Today we are simply giving this body a chance to not make Mom too \nangry.\n  I thank the Senator and yield any time I have not used to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, we are in morning business, I believe. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes remaining in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to make a unanimous \nconsent request. In fairness, I want to see a Republican on the floor \nbefore we make that request about time. So if the staff would arrange \nto have someone come to the floor, I would appreciate it because I want \nto continue talking about this resolution we have already sent up to \nthe desk.\n  We are looking for very simple, commonsense changes. I can't imagine \nanybody saying we should not prohibit juveniles from possessing assault \nweapons. It is hard to oppose that. Does anyone seriously believe \njuveniles need assault weapons? Additionally, we should require child \nsafety locks to be sold with handguns. It is a simple step we can take \nto try to protect kids who get a hold of guns. We know that the 6-year-\nold who used a gun to murder another 6-year-old would not have been \nable to do so, A, if the gun had been properly protected from reach by \na child; or, B, if the gun had had a safety lock, the child wouldn't \nhave been able to operate it.\n  We also ought to study--I know the Senator from California wants to \ntalk about this--the marketing of guns to juveniles. She spoke about it \na few moments ago. I heard her talk about it. It was so clear and so \nprecise that it is hard to argue against it.\n  Why shouldn't we examine what it is we are doing to convince little \nkids that their mark of maturity is going to be to own a gun? I don't \nunderstand why.\n\n  When it comes to guns, we are talking about deadly weapons. We are \nnot talking about play toys that might turn over or something such as \nthat. This is automatically associated with killing, with death, with \ninjury--a gun in the wrong hands.\n  No, we are not saying that every gun owner is out for murder. We are \nnot saying every gun owner is out to hurt people, but there are enough \npeople that it makes an enormous difference whether or not guns are out \nthere in the hands of the wrong people. We ought to make sure they are \nnot being sold as toys.\n  These are all commonsense measures. They passed this Senate as part \nof a juvenile justice bill just about a year ago next week. It was sent \nover to the House. We got our conference committee together.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to yield 10 minutes to my \ncolleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey. Let me \necho what he has said on the floor in this matter--that we want to \nprotect our children and our families from gun violence. He will be \nsorely missed.\n  I want to pick up on something that was said about the million moms. \nI think Senator Lautenberg, as a grandfather, has spoken most \neloquently as to what the women of this country really want.\n  It is hard to generalize about it to people, but I can truly say, if \nthere is anyone in our society who is more selfless than any other, it \nhappens to be moms. When you love someone more than you love yourself, \nthat is what happens. The fact that they are coming here in such \namazing numbers is truly remarkable. I think when everyone across the \nNation who is coming here on this issue is added up, it will be a \nmillion moms.\n  There is a web page for the Million Mom March. It is called the \nTapestry, and moms are calling that site; they are writing their \nstories.\n  One woman from El Cerrito writes:\n\n       Ten years ago, my beautiful son, Andrew, killed himself \n     with a bullet to his brain. He\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\n     was mentally ill, and never should have been able to buy a \n     gun. I will be at the March with one of my daughters, who is \n     also a mother, because something has got to bring Congress to \n     its senses.\n\n  Then there are several others. One wrote the following:\n\n       Once I wrote a letter to my Congressman asking him to \n     support sensible gun laws. He sent me back a three-page \n     letter upholding the second amendment, but this had no effect \n     on me as in my life I have lost my father and uncle and a \n     nephew by marriage to guns. One was murder, one was a \n     suicide, and one was accidental. Had guns not been around and \n     easy to get, none of these untimely and sad deaths would \n     have occurred.\n\n  We are at a time in our history when we can look back at what is \nhappening to our people. When I was a young mom--now I am a grandmom--\nthe reason I got involved in politics was that I thought the Vietnam \nwar was wrong. I marched with my children in California at that time to \nsay enough is enough; let's end the killing.\n  We lost 58,168 of our valued sons and daughters in that war. For that \nperiod of 11 years, let's look at the statistics we have in our Nation \nfrom a different kind of war, a war in our streets, in our suburbs, in \nour schools, in our counties, our cities, in churches and child care \ncenters: 395,441 dead. If the moms of America marched to end the war in \nVietnam where 58,168 died--and they did help end it--we can turn around \nthis tragic number and win this war in our streets.\n  I say straight from my heart, we will not win this war unless people \nin this body have the guts and the courage to stand up to the gun \nlobby. We will not win this war if people in this body and in the House \nof Representatives do not have the heart and the guts and the courage \nto stand up to the gun lobby and its power. I pray that we will have \nthat courage and we will have the strength to do it and turn around \nwhat is happening.\n  Senator Lautenberg has talked about the juvenile justice bill. It is \nstuck in limbo, twisting in the wind in the conference committee after \nwe had five sensible gun laws attached to it. They are very sensible \nand include: closing the gun show loophole so that people who shouldn't \nhave a gun cannot get a gun at a gun show; banning the importation of \nhigh-capacity ammunition clips for automatic weapons, Senator \nFeinstein's amendment; requiring child safety devices be sold with \nevery hand gun, Senator Kohl; an amendment by Senator Ashcroft that \nsays it is illegal to sell or give a semiautomatic to anyone under the \nage of 18; and the fifth, requiring the Federal Trade Commission and \nthe Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry \nmarkets to juveniles.\n  If we thought Joe Camel was bad--and we know Joe Camel was bad--let's \nlook at what the National Rifle Association is doing to market to our \nchildren. This is the beautiful, quite lovely NRA logo with the eagle. \nThis is their logo. Here we see the cartoon version of that eagle, \n``Eddie the Eagle.'' This is the gun lobby kids' cartoon. This is the \neagle of the NRA. These kids are not 18. They are nowhere near 18. They \nare babies.\n  What makes us think the gun lobby wants to market to kids? Let's take \na look at what they say in an ad from a firearm manufacturer: \n``Building the next generation of customers takes work and commitment. \nBut it must be done.'' ``Our greatest threat is the lack of a future \ncustomer base.'' ``We continue to look for every opportunity to reach \nyoung people. . . .''\n  There shouldn't be any question about it. Just as Joe Camel was aimed \nat kids, so is Eddie the Eagle aimed at kids.\n  Here is Joe Camel, the cartoon version of the camel advertisement. \nHere is the gun lobby kids' cartoon. It is hard to do this all in 10 \nminutes, but that is all my colleagues on the other side would let me \nhave. Here are Eddie Eagle products for kids: Eddie Eagle lunch box, \nEddie Eagle Jitter Critter, 3D glasses, tattoo pac, Eddie E. B-Nee \nbaby.\n  That is not marketing to grownups, my friends; it is marketing to \nkids. The gun lobby doesn't want us to look at it, but we will.\n\n  When they had the tobacco lawsuits, we were able to find out what the \ntobacco company said in secret memos: ``If our company is to survive \nand prosper . . . we must get our share of the youth market.'' \n``Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer.''\n  Sound familiar to the gun lobby?\n  Look at what they say: ``The greatest threat we face is the lack of a \nfuture customer base. . . .'' ``We continue to look for every \nopportunity to reach young people. . . .''\n  Cigarette companies, Joe Camel, firearms company, Eddie the Eagle.\n  I don't have any objection in terms of a family learning to hunt, but \ntell me what is right about teaching a 4-year-old child how to load a \nhandgun. Yet this ad is proudly displayed in gun magazines. This child \nis 4 years old.\n  This sums it all up. How is this for an ad in Gun World: ``Start 'em \nYoung! There is no time like the present.''\n  This is a very young boy, maybe 15, holding a toy gun, that looks \nlike a real gun, shooting at a can of soda. It is a little bit of a \nlove letter from him about shooting. ``Start 'em Young!''\n  In the juvenile justice bill, I was fortunate enough to get through \nthis Senate, by a unanimous vote, a study of the gun dealers marketing \nto children. Guess what. Ed Markey took that on the House side and got \nthe same thing passed. So we have identical amendments in the House and \nSenate. Out of all of the gun amendments we passed, this is the only \none that had identical language in the House and Senate. What does that \nmean? It means we could make this the law of the land tomorrow if there \nwere good faith in this Republican Congress. We can in good faith take \nmy amendment that passed here by unanimous vote, and passed over in the \nHouse unanimously, and start this study right now.\n  But no. To all who say politics doesn't matter, let me state what \nthis wasted time means. It means that every day they are starting them \nyoung. It means that every day, a child might pick up a gun because it \nso much fun--they see it in the ads. And they can pick up a gun and \naccidentally injure themselves or someone else.\n  It is an unbelievable situation that a year after we passed five \nsensible gun measures, we have done nothing.\n  Let me close with something from the Million Mom March from Janet \nLazar of Menlo Park, CA. Listen to this.\n\n       As a social worker for children and families, I have heard \n     the voices of many children who have become victims of \n     violence. Listen to the still voice of a child describing her \n     mother held at gunpoint by her father. Listen to the cold, \n     dead voice of a beautiful 15-year-old girl describe the six \n     friends and relatives she lost to gang warfare. Listen to her \n     bewilderment as she wonders if she will live to raise \n     children of her own. Listen to the suicidal voice of the \n     young man who accidentally killed his best friend as they \n     fooled around with an unlocked handgun.\n\n  She writes:\n\n       My heart cries for someone to listen to the children. The \n     time to act is now.\n\n  To the creator of the Million Mom March, who is a constituent of \nSenator Lautenberg--and how appropriate that is--I say thank you. I say \nthank you for caring about the children. I say thank you for giving up \nyour Mother's Day and coming here. I say thank you for taking a risk \nthat maybe your idea would not catch on. I say thank you for doing what \nwe Americans do best, acting--acting on facts, acting on information, \nand, yes, acting on anger.\n  It is an honor to be on the floor today with my friend, Senator \nLautenberg. It is an honor to stand by his side as we, together, fight \nto make sure the laws of this land reflect the priorities of the people \nand the mothers and the children and the families.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from California for her ever \npersistent fight to protect children and protect the families in this \ncountry. We are going to continue, no matter what turn of events we \nsee. We want the public to be heard.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a resolution that simply \ncommends the participants of the Million Mom March this weekend for \nrallying for their communities to demand sensible gun safety \nlegislation. It calls on Congress to complete action on the juvenile \njustice bill before the Memorial Day recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 305, which was introduced by me, that the \nresolution and\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nthe preamble be agreed to en bloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I object, as a Member of the Senate from the \nState of Colorado.\n  Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen who can hear \nme, what an irony it is. What an irony it is. The Senator from Colorado \nobjects to simple gun safety legislation. What an irony it is that this \nplace is empty, but the voice of negativism creeps through.\n  I want all the million moms across the country to hear this. They are \nsaying: No, no to sensible gun safety legislation. They are saying: No, \nMom, your kids are going to go to school and it is too bad, it is too \nbad if some little maniac, or some confused child has a gun in his or \nher hand. Too bad, too bad, unless it is their kid, God forbid.\n\n  What are we witnessing here? Foolishness. The public ought to know \nit. They ought to stand up and shout: We are not going to take it \nanymore. A million mothers marching across this country--I hope they \nare made furious by this objection.\n  Object to a resolution? A resolution, for my friends who do not know, \nis not a law. It is simply a thought. It is the way we think we ought \nto do things. We are far from legislation. We just think we ought to \nprotect children. We think we ought to make it tougher for people to \nhave guns randomly. We think we ought to make it tougher for young \nchildren to learn that guns are a step toward manhood. They ought to \nlearn. They ought to learn.\n  Remember the image--the kids at Columbine, the bleeding boy reaching \nout the window for help: Somebody, help me before I get killed. Or the \nlittle children at the school in Califor\nnia--little kids, like my grandchildren, like your grandchild, being \nled by policemen so they could get away from a gunman. Or the \nyoungsters saying a prayer in Waco, TX, heads bent in prayer, and some \nidiot comes by and starts shooting. Or that 6-year-old child killing \nanother 6-year-old child.\n  So we cannot enact a law that says you have to put your gun away if \nyou have one, so a child can't get ahold of it? Or make it childproof?\n  The Republicans say: No. We have 51-50 vote when the Vice President \ncast a tie vote and it went to the House. The House didn't want to \ncooperate, the Republican majority there said: No, no, let's bury this \nthing.\n  Bury it. What a terrible term. What a terrible term. Because we are \ntalking about funerals and burials, instead of laughter, instead of \nlove, instead of friendship. It is a black day, a bad day for America. \nI hope the million moms, when they get together, will talk about this.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for one last question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Was it part of my friend's resolution, welcoming the \nmillion moms to Washington?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It was a resolution to welcome them.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let's be clear here about what is being objected to. This \nis a resolution that says to the million moms: Thank you for caring \nabout our children; thank you for being good mothers; Thank you for \ngiving up Mother's Day to be here, to stand for a cause that is bigger \nthan each of us separately.\n  It is hard for me to believe the Republicans would object to \nwelcoming the million moms to this town, moms who are Democrats, \nRepublicans, those declining to state--maybe they don't have a party. \nThis is not a partisan issue.\n  I say to my friend, thank you for bringing this to the floor. I think \nthe American people are finally going to see who stands up for what is \nright.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the floor, not in exhaustion, \nnot in fatigue, but ours to fight another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend our colleague, Senator \nLautenberg, for his efforts. He has done the Senate a service and has \ncalled the Senate and the Nation's attention to the importance of the \nMillion Mom March. I appreciate as well the participation and the \nleadership Senator Boxer is always able to provide for our caucus on so \nmany issues before the Senate. They have articulated very ably and \nadmirably for our caucus today in expressing to all of those coming \nfrom all parts of the country how important it is they express \nthemselves, how important it is they exercise their constitutional \nopportunities in this great country, how important it is they send a \nmessage to the rest of the country, as well as to Members of the \nCongress, the critical nature of the need to address the gun issue in \nan effective way.\n  That is all they are coming to express themselves on, and it is \nappropriate at this time, and given the tremendous message that numbers \nof women will send by their presence, that we acknowledge their \npresence and welcome them to this city; that we tell them we are \nlistening; that we resolve to respond in as effective a way as we can.\n  Again, I thank the senior Senator from New Jersey for his efforts, \nand the Senator from California for participating, for sending that \nmessage loudly and clearly and for doing all they can to recognize the \nimportance of what will happen in Washington on Sunday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, did the Senator wish to respond?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Can I have 1 minute?\n  Mr. WARNER. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nhis always courteous response to a request.\n  It was disheartening to see we could not get a resolution adopted--\nnot law, a thought, an idea, what we would like to do, that says we \nwelcome the committed women who are involved in the march who are going \nto gather in places across this country to protest the threat of \nviolence to their children.\n  I thank our leader, and my colleague from California, for being such \nactive supporters of this protest against violence. I am sorry we did \nnot have a chance to get a vote on it. I thank the Senator from South \nDakota for his friendly remarks as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend, hundreds of thousands of \nmothers and ``honorary mothers'' will convene in Washington, DC and \ncommunities around the country to call for sensible gun legislation for \nsafe kids.\n  On Sunday, Americans will unite for the Million Mom March, the first-\never national march for gun-safety. The mothers from Michigan and \naround the country come from all walks of life. They live in cities, in \nsuburbs and in rural America. They are of all races, all religions and \nall political persuasions. They are our friends and neighbors, our \ncommunity leaders.\n  On Mothers' Day, 2000, these ``mothers and others'' will join \ntogether to grieve over the loss of their loved ones, and the loss of \nmore than 4,000 young people who are killed by gunfire each year.\n  Among these mothers will be Veronica McQueen, the Michigan mother who \nlost her six year old daughter, Kayla Rolland, to gun violence earlier \nthis year. Ms. McQueen said, ``I just don't want to see another parent \nhave to bury another baby over this, over something that is \npreventable, something that is very, very preventable.''\n  Gun violence is preventable. But mothers can not act alone. Mothers \nin the Million Mom March know: In order to reduce the level of gun \nviolence in their homes and communities, Congress must pass legislation \nto keep guns out of the hands of children and criminals.\n  Some of us in this Congress have heard the cry of families around \nthis country and worked to pass sensible legislation to protect our \nnation's children. That legislation would limit access to guns by \nprohibited persons by, among other things, closing the gun show \nloophole-- applying background checks to guns sold at gun shows.\n  The Lautenberg-Kerrey gun show amendment that passed in the Senate,\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nbut not in the House of Representatives, is one of the most important \nprovisions we can pass this Congress. It will close the loophole that \nallows criminals and other prohibited persons to buy guns at gun shows \nthat they would not otherwise be permitted to purchase.\n  It a loophole that is often exploited by those who do not want to \nundergo background checks--including Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the \nColumbine killers. Harris and Klebold used four semiautomatic assault \nweapons in their now infamous attack on their classmates. Of the four \nguns, three were purchased by Robyn Anderson at a gun show in Adams \nCounty, Colorado.\n  Robyn, who was 18 at the time, bought three semiautomatic assault \nweapons for her younger friends. She later testified before the \nColorado Legislature about her purchase and the need to close the gun \nshow loophole. She said: ``Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to \nthe Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on \nSunday. . . While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking \nsellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns \nfrom someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be \nno paperwork or background check.''\n  Robyn continues: ``I was not asked any questions at all. There was no \nbackground check. All I had to do was show my driver's license to prove \nthat I was 18. Dylan got a shotgun. Eric got a shotgun and a black \nrifle that he bought clips for. He was able to buy clips and ammunition \nwithout me having to show any I.D. The sellers didn't write down any \ninformation.''\n  ``I would not have bought a gun for Eric and Dylan if I had had to \ngive any personal information or submit any kind of check at all. I \nthink it was clear to the sellers that the guns were for Eric and \nDylan. They were the ones asking all the questions and handling all the \nguns.''\n  Robyn concluded: ``I wish a law requiring background checks had been \nin effect at the time. I don't know if Eric and Dylan would have been \nable to get guns from another source, but I would not have helped them. \nIt was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have \nhelped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.''\n  The Columbine killers took advantage of the gun show loophole and the \nresult was deadly. Congress has the chance to close this loophole with \nthe Lautenberg amendment. That amendment requires prospective \npurchasers to undergo background checks at gun shows and gives law \nenforcement up to three business days to those checks if there is any \npotentially disqualifying information--as set forth in the current \nBrady law.\n  Honest, law-abiding Americans are not affected by these background \nchecks. 72 percent of the checks are completed within three minutes, \nand 95 percent are cleared within two hours. FBI records reveal that \nthe five percent of people whose background checks take more than 24 \nhours to complete, are 20 times more likely to have a criminal record \nor otherwise be prohibited from accessing weapons.\n  Congress must pass legislation that gives law enforcement up to three \nbusiness days, when needed, to complete background checks at gun shows, \nand truly close the gun show loophole. As of this day, Congress has \nfailed to do so, and has subsequently failed the families of the \nColumbine victims and others who have lost loved ones to gunfire.\n  On this Sunday, I will march with the families of those victims from \nMichigan and around the country, who are calling on Congress to end \ntheir agony. In the words of one mother, it's time to turn tears into \naction. Congress must pass ``sensible gun laws for safe kids.'' Let's \nstart by closing the gun show loophole today. It's time to end the \nplague of gun violence on America's children.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in welcoming the \nMillion Mom March to Washington this weekend. Their campaign for \nsensible gun control has captured the attention of the nation, and it \ndeserves to capture the attention of Congress too. Their message is \nirresistible. Gun crimes and gun violence are a serious challenge to \nthe nation, and it is wrong for the United States Senate to bury its \nhead in the sand on this fundamental issue. More than a year has passed \nsince the Columbine tragedy, and we have failed to finish the job we \nbegan last year on the Juvenile Justice Bill. Democrats have repeatedly \nasked for the House and Senate conferees to meet and approve a final \nbill that includes the Senate-passed gun control provisions. We wait \nand wait and wait, while schools and children across the country \ncontinue to suffer from the epidemic of gun violence that plagues so \nmany of our communities.\n  Too many children are in continuing danger of gun violence in their \nhomes and schools and neighborhoods. These are not new problems, but \nthey have become increasingly serious, and it is irresponsible for \nCongress to look the other way and ignore them.\n  Our goal is to support parents, youths, educators, law enforcement \nauthorities, and communities. We have a shared responsibility to find \nsolutions to these problems. Fifty million school children are waiting \nfor our answer.\n  The greatest tragedy of the school shootings across the nation is \nthey have not shocked us into doing everything we can to prevent them \nin the future. By refusing to learn from these tragedies, Congress is \ncondemning the country to repeat them. How many wake-up calls will it \ntake before Congress finally responds?\n  Current statistics on children and guns are unacceptable.\n  For every child killed with a gun, four others are wounded. According \nto the Centers for Disease Control, the rate of firearm deaths of \nchildren 0-14 years old is twelve times higher in the United States \nthan in 25 other industrial nations combined.\n  Over 6,000 students were expelled in 1996-97 for bringing guns to \nschool. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that \nbetween 36% and 50% of male eleventh graders believe they could easily \nget a gun if they wanted one.\n  In a 1997 survey, 9% of high school students had carried a weapon to \nschool during the 30 days preceding the survey; 6% had a gun.\n  Between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1998, there were 173 violent deaths \nin schools.\n  In a recent survey of over 100,000 teenagers conducted last month, \n30% said they could get a gun in a few hours and 11% more said they \ncould get a gun in one day.\n  1 in 5 of these teenagers have felt afraid at school since the \nColumbine High School shootings a year ago.\n  4 in 10 of these same teenagers said there are guns in their homes, \nand more than half of them say they have access to those weapons.\n  In 1996, more than 1300 children aged 10-19 committed suicide with \nfirearms. Unlike suicide attempts using other methods, suicide attempts \nwith gun are nearly always fatal, which means that a temporarily \ndepressed teenager will never get a second chance at life. Two-thirds \nof all completed teenage suicides involve a firearm.\n  The firearm injury epidemic, due largely to handgun injuries, is ten \ntimes larger than the polio epidemic of the first half of this century.\n  The nation's gun laws are a disgrace. We need to close the gun show \nloophole, support child safety locks on guns, and provide greater \nresources for strict enforcement of the gun laws now on the books.\n  The guns used to kill nine of the 13 people murdered at Columbine \nHigh School were purchased at a gun show. The woman who bought the guns \nfor Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold said that she would never have \npurchased those guns if she had to submit her name for a background \ncheck.\n  More than 800 Americans, young and old, die each year from guns fired \nby children under the age of 19. It shouldn't take a Columbine, a \nJonesboro, or an urban drive-by shooting to persuade us to act.\n  Perhaps six-year-old Kayla Rolland would be alive today if the gun \nthat her classmate used had a child safety lock on it.\n  Perhaps a 13-year-old school girl in Deming, New Mexico and a school \nvice-principal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania would still be alive if \nthe young shooters did not have access to the guns.\n  American children are more at risk from firearms than the children of \nany\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nother industrial nation. In a recent year, firearms killed no children \nin Japan, 19 children in Great Britain, 57 children in Germany, 109 \nchildren in France, 153 children in Canada--and 5,285 children in the \nUnited States.\n  Shame on the National Rifle Association, shame on the Republican \nParty, and shame on the United States Congress for tolerating figures \nlike that. My fervent hope is that the Million Mom March will succeed \nwhere so many other efforts in recent years have failed, and that \nCongress at long last will be persuaded to act. The irresistible force \nof the Million Mom March is about to meet the immoveable object of \nCongress--and I intend to do all I can to see that the immoveable \nobject of Congress finally moves.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to recognize and \nwelcome the visit to Washington, DC by a group of my fellow West \nVirginians for this Sunday's ``Million Mom March.''\n  The Million Mom March, coinciding with Mothers' Day, is a grassroots \neffort led by people across the country--Dads and Kids included--\ndedicated to educating our children and our nation about guns; both the \ndangers posed by their misuse and the tragic toll this misuse has taken \non our country's youth, their friends, and their families. The people \nwho attend this event here in Washington will have gathered in the \nparking lots of schools, churches, and synagogues across the country, \nand will have come here to let those of us in Congress know, in no \nuncertain terms, that we need to be doing more to protect our children.\n  I am pleased to say that among those relaying that message this \nweekend will be a delegation of Moms from West Virginia, many with \ntheir entire families in tow. As they point out, one difference many of \nthese West Virginian Moms may have from others participating in this \nweekend's events is that they also have hunters in their own families. \nIn fact, it would not surprise me at all to find out that more than a \nfew of the folks marching were hunters themselves.\n  In West Virginia, we respect the rights of law-abiding citizens to \nkeep and bear arms, and we consider parents and children hunting \ntogether to be a time-honored tradition. Yet our state legislature has \nalready taken the responsible step of limiting possession and legal \nownership of handguns to those 18 and older. Now the West Virginian \nMoms join with their counterparts from around the nation to demand that \nMembers of Congress respond appropriately to the epidemic of American \nchildren killed and injured by accidents and crime involving guns.\n  Unfortunately, all too often when we in Congress discuss the misuse \nof guns, the debate turns into a pointless back-and-forth about whether \nwe have too many gun laws, or too few. Rather than engage in that \ndebate, I would just invite my colleagues to consider these staggering \nstatistics:\n  One in 910 American children die because of the misuse of guns before \nthe age of 20.\n  American children under the age of 15 are twelve times more likely to \ndie from gunfire than children in 25 other industrialized countries \ncombined.\n  Seventy-seven percent of murder victims aged 13-17 are killed by a \nfirearm.\n  Last year:\n  4,205 children and teens were killed by gunfire;\n  2,562 were murdered by gunfire;\n  1,262 committed suicide using a firearm; and\n  306 died from an accidental shooting.\n  Each day:\n  Two children under the age of 5 are murdered;\n  Six children and youths under 20 commit suicide;\n  Ten children and youths under 20 are homicide victims; and\n  Twelve children and youth under 20 die from firearm misuse.\n  Between 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly 80,000 children and \nteens in America--25,000 more than the total number of American \nsoldiers killed in battle in Vietnam.\n  Firearms wounded an additional 320,000 children during this same \nperiod.\n  In that period, more than 25,000 children took their own lives with \nfirearms, and nearly 10,000 died as a result of an accidental shooting.\n  In 1997, my home state of West Virginia lost 23 children younger than \n20 to firearm misuse, up seven from the previous year. Nine were \nmurdered, ten committed suicide, and three were the victims of \naccidents.\n  Mr. President, last year the United States Senate passed the Juvenile \nJustice bill. Among its provisions, this bill contained some courageous \nefforts to address the culture of crime and violence in which our \nchildren are being raised. The bill also featured some common-sense \nmeasures designed to make guns safer, and provisions to keep firearms \nout of the hands of criminals. The Senate also sought to close the so-\ncalled gun show loophole. Sadly, our seeming inability to have any \ndiscussion about guns has kept the conferees on this bill from \nreporting back to the respective houses with a version for final \npassage.\n  My purpose here today is to join the Million Moms in calling \nattention to the bottom line. We live in a society in which the lives \nof children are tragically at risk because of the virtually unfettered \navailability of guns. Our respect for the constitutional rights of gun \nowners should never overwhelm the love and caring we have for our \nchildren. I commend the Moms, from West Virginia and around the \ncountry, who come to remind us what our priorities should be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3887-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3887-S3893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I make a parliamentary inquiry. Are we now \nout of morning business and on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the military construction bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. President, in the course of the deliberations before the Senate \nAppropriations Committee on this measure, the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd--former majority leader of the \nSenate; one who has served in the Senate 41 years--brought before that \ncommittee an amendment entitled the Byrd-Warner amendment dealing with \nthe issue of the balance of power in the Constitution between the \nexecutive branch, the President, and the legislative branch, the \nCongress of the United States, as it relates to matters of foreign \npolicy but, most particularly, as it relates to the matter--and perhaps \nthe most important entrusted to both the President of the United States \nand the Congress--the most important matter of when the President, as \nCommander in Chief, sends beyond the shores of our great Nation men and \nwomen in uniform into harm's way in the cause of peace.\n  This week, those of us on the Republican side of the aisle had our \nweekly luncheon, as did our good friends and colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. At our luncheon, Senator Strom Thurmond stood and \nasked if we could observe a moment of silence as he recounted the \nclosing day of World War II, when hostilities ceased in Europe--the \nbloodiest of all wars, in which 292,000 men and women, wearing the \nuniform of the Armed Services of the United States, lost their lives.\n  You could have heard a pin drop in that caucus as that great soldier, \nas that great statesman, asked for remembrance of the veterans of those \ngenerations.\n  In a very humble way, I have a brief memory. At age 17, I joined the \nNavy. It was January of 1945. I was simply trained, as were thousands \nof other youngsters my age, because at that point in January, in the \nwinter of 1945, both the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific were \ninconclusive. I simply was at training command, waiting for the \ninvasion of Japan. I thank God that last battle in the Pacific never \noccurred, not only for myself but for millions of others who would have \nbeen involved.\n  I look back very humbly on the modest contribution I made in uniform, \nboth in that war and again during the Korean war, where I served in the \nMarines for a brief period.\n  The military did far more for me than I did for the military. Today, \nthat 17-year-old sailor as of 1945 is privileged to be the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee of the Senate, a dream I thought would \nnever be fulfilled.\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n  I again reiterate, my service was modest. On both sides of the aisle, \nthere are men who have served and show the scars of war, who understand \nthe burden on the President of the United States as he sends forth \ntroops into harm's way. I respect these individuals greatly for their \nknowledge, for having borne the pain in the field of battle, unlike \nmyself. But I was there when others did.\n  The point of this is the gravity of the decision to send forth our \npeople--the sons and the daughters of people from every village and \ntown across this Nation.\n  I recount World War II. I then go to Korea, again, where I served as \na young Marine officer. Over 50,000 men and women lost their lives in \nthat conflict.\n  During the course of the Vietnam conflict, I was privileged to serve \nin the Navy as Undersecretary of the Navy and then as Secretary of the \nNavy. I was there 5 years, 4 months, and 3 days. Over 50,000 men and \nwomen lost their lives, not to mention the number of those wounded.\n  The point I make is, the last time this Nation declared war was World \nWar II. Yet since that time we have sent men and women into harm's way, \nbeyond our shores, over 100 times.\n  We never declared war in the Korean conflict. As a matter of fact, it \nwas called the forgotten war. We never declared war in Vietnam, a war \nthat not only brought tremendous casualties on the field of battle and \na wrenching experience to the families--as each war does--but it \ndivided this Nation. Indeed, it was the people of this Nation who rose \nup and, finally, through their elected representatives in Congress, \nprovided the basis for the withdrawal of our troops from that conflict.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. It is a decision of power \nbetween the executive and the legislative branches. It is assuming the \nresponsibility--the responsibility to join with the President or not \njoin with the President--in sending those people beyond our shores. No \ngreater responsibility rests upon a Member of Congress than that.\n  I have had the privilege to know Presidents. I have had the privilege \nto learn from my elder statesmen in this Chamber--foremost among them \nJohn Stennis, John Tower, Barry Goldwater, and ``Scoop'' Jackson, all \nof whom worked on the Armed Services Committee--of how Presidents of \nour great Nation face up to that decision to go or not to go.\n  Stennis used to tell the story that Lyndon Johnson told him. The \nPresident used to say to Stennis: When that phone rings at night, and \nthere is a troubled spot in the world, and I have to make the decision, \nDo I or do I not send those troops? I always thought, Where is an \naircraft carrier, an island of America? What is the nearest force \nstructure of the U.S. to this conflict?\n  It is a big decision. Read the biographies of our Presidents. It is a \ntough decision. Congress has an obligation to share with the President \nin the making of that decision. That is my point. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  We have not really fully shared in that decisionmaking since World \nWar II. Yes, we have the power to declare war under the Constitution. \nWe also have the sole power over the purse--the power to decide whether \nthat President can utilize the taxpayers' contribution each year in the \noperations of the United States.\n  Just this week, the Armed Services Committee concluded its bill--\nroughly $309 billion--to provide for the Armed Forces of the United \nStates. It is the biggest money bill that goes through here. It will be \nbrought to the floor next week, hopefully.\n  That is what I am talking about--the power of the purse. Our \ncommittee authorizes, and the committee under the Senator from Alaska, \nMr. Stevens, and the distinguished cosponsor of this amendment, Mr. \nByrd, then make the decisions on the appropriations against the \nauthorization. That is what this amendment is about. It is about how we \nconduct the expenditure in this bill--$2 billion-plus for Kosovo \nalone--how we go about spending the taxpayers' money for that. How does \nit directly relate to the safety and welfare of those brave men and \nwomen of the U.S. Armed Forces who are marching through, or patrolling \nthrough, or standing watch night and day in Kosovo?\n  Mr. President, I first went to Kosovo in 1990 with then-leader Bob \nDole. There was a group of four or five of us. I remember that trip \nvery well. I remember that we exited rather speedily from Kosovo \nbecause there was a riot developing. So many people wanted to see the \nAmerican Senators, wanted to tell the American Senators about the \ncruelty and the deprivation of human rights that was then, in 1990, \nbeing inflicted on the people of Kosovo--Kosovo being a part of \nYugoslavia--being inflicted by Milosevic. Little did we know that war \nwould soon spread through this region--first in Bosnia, and then it \nwould erupt in Kosovo.\n  Well, we saw those people. We went by the famous field where, \nhundreds of years ago, the people of that region fought off the \nbarbarian insiders and lost the battle. They still consider that the \nmost hallowed ground in Kosovo. That region has been subjected to \nfighting and internal strife ever since. Even Hitler put some 21 \ndivisions in there to try to control the Yugoslav region, and finally \nhe told his generals to just contain them as best they could. He never \ncould subvert that province because of the internal fighting. \nThroughout the occupation of the German armies, a continuous civil war \nraged among the various religious and ethnic factions in that region. \nThe Germans just sort of turned their back on them. One German general \nsaid in a dispatch to Berlin about those who died in this civil war: \n``Less mouths to feed, less backs to clothe.''\n  What a desperate, desperate cauldron of humanity. I expect that at \none time or another in our deliberations in this body on Bosnia and \nKosovo, every Member has availed themselves of the history of this \nregion. As many times as I have been there--I believe I was the first \nU.S. Senator to go into Sarajevo in September of 1992, at the height of \nthe fighting of the civil war in that town. I remember the French, who \nwere controlling such security as was available, just in an airport \nwhere we were trying to bring in Red Cross supplies and food, put me in \nan armored vehicle and drove me around the town. We looked out through \na little slit and firing was going on.\n  A French colonel and a former Foreign Legionnaire said, ``I have \nfought in battles all over the world, and I cannot understand this \none.'' The Croatians, Bosnians, Serbians were fighting each other. He \nsaid, ``If you saw them in a room, you could not tell the difference. \nMost are well-educated people.'' He said, ``In all my years of combat \nin far-flung places of the world, I have never seen the violence that \nthese people can inflict on one another. I have never seen anything \nlike it.''\n  That violence raged for years, until the U.N. and then NATO forces \nfinally came in and stabilized peace in that region. The war in Kosovo, \nwe know well. We did everything we could at the diplomatic table. There \nwere negotiations and valiant efforts by many. Not only the U.S, but, \nindeed, many nations tried to deal with Milosevic and to avoid the \nfighting. The rest is history. For 78 days, an air war was conducted in \nwhich the United States of America flew roughly 70 percent of the \nmissions. Five or six other nations had their fighters, and they did \nthe best they could. It was a consortium of nations.\n\n  Why did the U.S. have the largest burden? Very simply, we had the \nmost modern equipment. It was a high-tech war. We employed every bit of \nhigh-tech equipment that we knew how to employ to protect the lives of \nthe aviators. That was the correct decision. We gave as much as we \ncould to our allies, but their planes simply weren't equipped with the \nhigh-tech guidance systems, radar systems, and other detection systems \nto defend themselves. So we flew the bulk of the missions. NATO is \nstill without adequate airlift. We supplied the cargo planes, the troop \ncarriers, in large measure. In that remote location in the airfields \nthat ring Kosovo--Italy had a dozen airfields, and how valiant that \ncountry was in that battle. They turned over much of their civil \naviation, air space, and airfields to allow the U.S. and allies to \noperate their aircraft around the clock.\n  Back to this amendment. The amendment is in two parts. I will refer \nto it as part 1 or 2. First, it is a contribution that I made some 2\\1/\n2\\ months ago, following my most recent trip to Kosovo. I went into \nthat region, I think for the fifth or sixth time, and I went to the \nheadquarters of the KFOR commander,\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\na fine German officer, well-trained. He had a modest office. We were \njoined by Ambassador Kouchner, who was given by the U.N. the primary \nresponsibility for trying to rebuild Kosovo following the termination \nof the conflict. This was January. I remember it well. There were 1 or \n2 light bulbs sort of hanging from the ceiling, and they were \nconstantly flickering. Down the hall was a toilet that was inoperative \nbecause there wasn't enough power. You had to flush it by taking a big \nbucket of water and pouring it in.\n  I bring this up because Ambassador Kouchner said to me repeatedly in \nthe hour or so I was there, as the lights were flickering, ``We don't \nhave enough money from our allies that fought this war and others who \nmade the commitment to get adequate power.'' He said, ``Half of the \ncity of Pristina''--that is where we were, Pristina--``is freezing \ntonight because of the inadequacy of the power, inadequacy of the \nhousing, inadequacy of everything, food and the like.'' That was in \nJanuary. That is not an American; that is a Frenchman.\n  The general who commented on the lights said, ``This is the best \nbuilding in town. We are doing our best; we are going to make it \nthrough.'' This was the headquarters of all the KFOR, all the troops. \nUp to 30 nations had contributed troops to try to bring about a measure \nof stability.\n  The consequence of that trip and going out to visit our troops in a \nfar region--the whole area was divided into various regions: The \nAmerican sector, the French sector, the British sector. I visited our \ntroops in the American sector. I watched these young men from places \nall across the United States, heavily dressed in their flack suits and \nprotective vests, cold as the dickens, carrying weapons, but going \naround to try to maintain order in these war-ravaged communities. There \nwas the Serb section in the town and the Albanian section.\n  There was an indivisible line between them. You couldn't see it. But \neverybody knew you didn't step across it. There was very little, if \nany, contact between two factions.\n  I visited other American soldiers--two and three stationed out to \nguard a church. Our soldiers then and today are doing all kinds of \ntasks at personal risk, for which in large measure they weren't \ntrained. They do not teach us in boot camp how to solve marital \ndisputes or how to solve disputes between shop owners who are arguing.\n  These wonderful persons in uniform are drawing on a lifetime of \nAmerican experience with their families and their homes and their towns \nto perform tasks that are far beyond any training the military gives. \nBut they are doing it. They have done it, and they continue to do it, \nand do it very well.\n  At the end of the war, there were commitments in which the various \nallies came in and said we will send so many million dollars; we will \nsend so many police; we will send so many building supplies; we will do \nthis and we will do that. Bernard Kouchner, the man in charge, simply \nsaid it is not being done.\n  So I came back home and concocted an amendment in consultation with \nquite a few of my colleagues. I went about it very deliberately. I \nconsulted on two occasions at the White House in constructive meetings. \nThe administration wasn't at all supportive of this venture; that is, \non the face of the draft that I had. But I had other people within the \nadministration and elsewhere telling me privately: John, if you do \nthis, I think you will get the attention of the allies and they will \nbegin to fulfill the commitments they made. Whether they are dollar \ncommitments, commitments for police, or other commitments; they will do \nit.\n  I came to the floor of the Senate on Monday. I had quite a few \ncosponsors: The distinguished Senator Stevens, the distinguished \nSenator Inouye, members of the Appropriations Committee, and a great \nnumber of the Armed Services Committee. There was nothing to file the \namendment against. But my intentions were that at such time as the \nKosovo supplemental came through, I would put it on and have it printed \nin the Record.\n  This thing reverberated around the world, known as the Warner \namendment. I take no great pride of authorship. But they had to name it \nsomething. But, suddenly, the allies began to get the message that we \nmean business in the Congress of the United States. We mean business. \nThey began to account for what they had done. They began to expedite \ntheir dollars. They began to expedite the building materials. They \nbegan to expedite in some ways sending police, although they are still \nfar behind the goals. Now, some 2\\1/2\\ months later, I have just been \nadvised as late as yesterday by a constant stream of U.N. and E.U. \nofficials through my office. I thank them. They quietly thanked me and \nthose who supported me for bringing this matter out in the public and \nmaking known the need of the allies to step up.\n  The House of Representatives, Mr. Kasich, called me one day with \ngreat respect and said: John, I think your amendment is a good one. \nWould you agree if I brought it up on the House floor just as it is? I \nsaid: Fine. Give it a try.\n  There was quite a debate in the House of Representatives on that \namendment. I will put it in the Record later today. But it was only \ndefeated by a very few votes with basically 200 on each side. By a very \nfew votes did it go down, largely because a number of Members had not \nreally had a chance to think it through.\n\n  But this amendment, which is couched as the Byrd-Warner amendment \ntoday, simply says the following: That the allies made certain \ncommitments that, in the judgment of this Senator and such others who \nsupport those commitments, have not been kept in a timely way.\n  We have about 15 percent of the troops there. I want to make this \nclear. Other nations have 85 percent of them.\n  As a consequence, our troops and the troops of other nations could be \nthere indefinitely. There is no one--I defy anyone--who can come to \nthis floor and give with any precision the dates on which the \ninfrastructure of that nation, and particularly its judicial system, a \npolice system, and other necessary infrastructure, can enable the \ntroops of this Nation and others to go home.\n  It seems to me they needed a wake-up call. That is precisely what \nthis amendment does that I partly drew up. It simply says to our \nPresident: Respectfully, Mr. President, of this $2 billion coming \nthrough, you can utilize a certain percentage right away to reimburse \nthe Department of Defense for expenditures it has already made for the \nKosovo operation for this fiscal year to replenish the funds taken out \nof the Department of the Army, largely, but some out of the Navy, some \nout of the Air Force, but 25 percent we hold back--that is all, 25 \npercent of $2 billion we hold back--until you can certify that you have \nexamined, first, the commitments of our allies, and then, second, the \nextent to which they have completed their commitments. I have been told \non good authority that in all probability the President can make that \ncertification largely with what has occurred in the 2\\1/2\\ months since \nthis Warner section of this thing has been made public.\n  So my amendment in large measure has met its goal.\n  I thank the many people who have helped me and stood by the purpose \nof this amendment. But had the President not been able to certify, I \nsaid the other 25 percent of the money would then be used to bring our \ntroops home because this Nation has fulfilled its commitment and did \nits best certainly in the combat phase of this. Certainly in the year \nalmost after the combat phase, we have done it. Now let the Europeans \nand other nations pick up.\n  If there is one thing in this bill I will bring to the floor next \nweek for the colleagues of the Armed Services Committee, the most \nserious thing facing us today in the military is the retention of the \nmiddle-grade personnel, enlisted and officer, because of the constant \ndeployment of these individuals all over the world away from their \nfamilies. We are not today able to retain sufficient numbers to keep \nthis military of ours, this magnificent military of ours, strong in the \nfuture. It is not the shortage of dollars. It is not the shortage of \nequipment in large measure, although spare parts is a problem. It is \nthe fact that these men and women in the uniform of our Nation are \nconstantly being sent away on ships, flown away in airplanes, and many \ntimes with very short notice so that the remaining spouse has to pick \nup the responsibilities as that serviceperson goes overseas.\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\n  I just think to keep an indefinite commitment in this region without \nany participation by the Congress of the United States is wrong. We \nshould speak to that, and that is what my portion does. It simply says \n25 percent is to be used to bring home the troops if you can't make the \ncertification. But if the Congress wishes, it could meet and say: Even \nthough you could not make the certification, Mr. President, we think \nyou should continue the policy as you have laid it out despite the \ninability of making the certification, despite the fact that our allies \nhave not made their commitments. That amendment simply says we should \nbe involved. That is what the Constitution requires. We should be \ninvolved. We cannot come in here year after year, month after month, \nand just stamp these appropriations with an ``aye'' vote and then run \nout of the Chamber. We have to face up to this amendment. This \namendment makes us face up to it.\n\n  That is my principal contribution. I join my distinguished colleague \nand friend, Senator Byrd, in his portion. I see my distinguished \ncolleague from South Carolina who worked on this and voted for it in \nthe Appropriations Committee. I shorten my remarks so the Senator may \naddress the Senate.\n  The thrust of the Byrd amendment is not ``cut and run,'' not that we \nare trying to undermine NATO, that we are turning our back. It is \nsimply saying to the Congress of the United States and to the next \nPresident, give Congress a plan and show we can pull out just the \ncombat elements of our troops, leaving the intelligence, leaving the \nlogistics, leaving other segments of the military to help the remaining \ntroops of the many nations--not cut and run. Bring out the combat \ntroops. Show Congress a plan.\n  Those troops, in our judgment, should be out by July 2001. Is that \ntoo much to ask, 14 months hence? That is not cut and run. That is not \nundermining anybody. That is not sending a signal to Milosevic that the \nUnited States is turning its back. It is saying to the men and women of \nour Armed Forces, to this Nation, that we have done our share. It is \ntime for us to pick up the combat share to the extent it is still \nnecessary. And then, if it is in the infinite wisdom of this body that \nwe should not make any changes, we should not come home with the combat \nelements. All we have to do is stand up and send a message, a sense of \nthe Congress, we think we should stay. That would add far greater \nstrength to the conviction of the American participation than this year \nafter year after year of idly voting on an appropriations bill and not \ndiscussing it.\n  I respect my dear colleague from West Virginia. How many times he has \nbeen on this floor reminding Members of our responsibilities? Many, \nmany times. This is an amendment that simply says: Congress, the hour \nhas arrived where you have to stand up and be counted if we will \ncontinue for an indefinite time the missions in Kosovo.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Dear \nColleague letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2000.\n       Dear Colleague: On May 9, the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations, by a bipartisan vote of 23 to 3, adopted a \n     major policy provision relating to the ongoing role of the \n     United States military in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation.\n       The Senate is expected to quickly take up the FY 2001 \n     Military Construction Appropriations Bill, which contains the \n     Kosovo language. As the authors of this provision, we take \n     this opportunity to provide you with our analysis of the \n     language and a fact sheet on the provision.\n       We are particularly concerned about the possibility of \n     misconceptions or misinterpretations of the provision. The \n     Byrd-Warner language goes directly to the institutional and \n     constitutional responsibilities of Congress. It does not \n     require the withdrawal of U.S. military troops from Kosovo. \n     To the contrary, the language makes specific provisions for \n     Congress to vote, under expedited procedures, if the next \n     President seeks to continue U.S. military involvement in the \n     Kosovo peacekeeping operation beyond July 1, 2001.\n       The provision has three main objectives. First, it \n     terminates funding for the continued deployment of U.S. \n     ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the \n     President seeks and receives Congressional authorization to \n     keep troops in Kosovo.\n       Second, the provision requires the President to develop a \n     plan, in consultation with our European allies, to turn the \n     ground combat troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping \n     operation entirely over to the Europeans by July 1, 2001. \n     Assuming the President is successful in developing such a \n     plan, there should be no need for funding the continued \n     deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo beyond July \n     1, 2001.\n       Third, related to current operations in Kosovo and to \n     signal to the Europeans the need for them to fulfill their \n     commitments for implementing peace and stability in Kosovo, \n     the provision withholds 25 percent of the emergency \n     supplemental funding for military operations Kosovo attached \n     to the Military Construction bill pending certification by \n     the President that our allies are making adequate progress in \n     meeting the commitments they made to the Kosovo peacekeeping \n     process. If the President cannot make the certifications by \n     July 15 of this year, the funding held in reserve can only be \n     used to withdraw U.S. forces from Kosovo unless Congress \n     votes otherwise.\n       This last provision has been compared to an earlier \n     proposal by Senator Warner, a version of which was narrowly \n     defeated in the House. That language, however, has been \n     modified to address a major concern expressed during the \n     House debate; namely, that failure by the President to \n     certify the requisite level of allied contributions would \n     automatically trigger the withdrawal of U.S. forces from \n     Kosovo with no opportunity for Congress or the President to \n     intervene.\n       The Byrd-Warner language included in the Senate Military \n     Construction Bill addresses that issue by including a \n     provision for Congress to vote, under expedited procedures, \n     to lift the troop withdrawal requirement on use of the funds \n     held in reserve, thus disarming the automatic trigger. \n     Moreover, the allies appear to have gotten the message. They \n     have in the past two months increased their contributions, \n     and the President is expected to be able to make the required \n     certification by July 15.\n       The larger issue addressed by the Byrd-Warner provision is \n     that of the responsibility of Congress to exercise its \n     constitutional duty. It was no accident that the founding \n     fathers vested in Congress alone the power of the purse. Yet, \n     we are seeking in Kosovo, as we have seen in so many other \n     peacekeeping operations, a bastardization of that process. \n     Instead of Congress' appropriating funds for expenditure by \n     the Executive Branch, the Executive Branch is spending funds \n     first and asking Congress after the fact to pay the bills.\n       Setting aside for a moment the foreign policy implications \n     of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation, the Senate has a duty \n     to vigilantly guard the rights bestowed on Congress by the \n     Constitution. No such right is more central to the separation \n     of powers on which our system of government is built than the \n     vesting in Congress alone the power of the purse.\n       Provisions to put Congressional check reins on funding \n     appropriated to implement U.S. foreign policy initiative are \n     often criticized as micromanaging the Administration. \n     Language dealing with troop drawdowns is subject to the \n     additional criticism of endangering U.S. troops and \n     emboldening foreign despots. The Byrd-Warner provision is \n     carefully and deliberately designed to avoid those pitfalls.\n       First, the language offers guidance to the President; it \n     does not dictate an outcome. Because the United States bore \n     the lion's share of the air offensive against Yugoslavia, we \n     believe that the Europeans should be responsible for the \n     ground element of the Kosovo peacekeeping mission. The Byrd-\n     Warner provision offers a road map to achieve that outcome by \n     July 1, 2001. If the next President disagrees with our \n     position, the language provides a mechanism, in the form of a \n     joint resolution to be voted on under expedited procedures, \n     for him to seek and receive congressional authorization to \n     continue the deployment of U.S. ground troops in Kosovo \n     beyond July 1, 2001.\n       The provision specifically exempts from the restriction on \n     U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo such U.S. military \n     missions as support for NATO headquarters in Kosovo, \n     intelligence support, air surveillance, and related \n     activities. The United States can continue to assist NATO \n     in Kosovo, with the exception of providing U.S. ground \n     combat troops for the mission.\n       According to Administration estimates, the other NATO and \n     non-NATO countries participating in the Kosovo peacekeeping \n     operation are currently contributing about 85 percent of the \n     total force structure. The Byrd-Warner provision provides \n     ample time for those nations and others to augment their \n     deployments of ground combat troops to Kosovo. In no way does \n     this language undercut the NATO peacekeeping operation in \n     Kosovo or provide encouragement to Slobodan Milosevic. If \n     anything, it will give the Europeans the opportunity to \n     demonstrate to the world the strength and unity of their \n     opposition to Milosevic's brand of tyranny.\n       The time frames outlined in this provision are deliberate. \n     Our intention is to shift long range decisionmaking on the \n     role of the United States in Kosovo away from the politically \n     charged atmosphere of an election year and into the next \n     Administration. This language allows the next President, \n     whoever is elected, to deal decisively with Kosovo and\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\n     prevents the U.S. from drifting, through inaction, into an \n     indefinite and likely prolonged commitment of U.S. personnel \n     and resources in yet another foreign peacekeeping operation.\n       To promote continuity between Administrations, and to \n     ensure that the next Administration does not put off dealing \n     with Kosovo until it is too late to plan effectively, our \n     provision requires the current President to submit, by \n     September 30, 2000, an interim plan for the U.S. to \n     transition its ground combat troops out of Kosovo, and the \n     next President to submit a final plan by May 1, 2001.\n       Should the Byrd-Warner language result in a drawdown of \n     U.S. ground troops from Kosovo, the language provides for a \n     ``safe, orderly, and phased'' withdrawal of troops, and \n     leaves the planning of that withdrawal up to the President. \n     Any troop drawdown would be managed by the generals, not the \n     Congress.\n       We urge you to carefully consider the language of the Byrd-\n     Warner provision, and we welcome your support. Should you \n     have any questions or require additional information, please \n     contact Christina Evans of Senator Byrd's staff at 224-3088 \n     or Judy Ansley of Senator Warner's staff at 224-4928.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert C. Byrd.\n     John Warner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                Fact Sheet: Byrd-Warner Kosovo Amendment\n\n       More than 5,500 U.S. troops are participating in the NATO \n     peacekeeping operation in Kosovo despite the fact that \n     Congress has never authorized, nor even formally debated, \n     U.S. involvement in Kosovo since the Senate, on March 23, \n     1999, authorized air strikes against Yugoslavia.\n       Congress has a constitutional responsibility to address \n     policy issues involving the deployment of U.S. troops \n     overseas in instances, such as Kosovo, in which American men \n     and women are being sent into potentially dangerous \n     situations.\n       By tacitly endorsing, through emergency supplemental \n     funding measures, Executive Branch decisions to deploy U.S. \n     troops overseas without congressional authorization, Congress \n     is effectively abrogating its responsibility under the \n     Constitution.\n       This amendment terminates funding for the continued \n     deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July \n     1, 2001, unless the President seeks and receives \n     congressional authorization to continue such deployment.\n       In recognition of the fact that the United States military \n     bore the brunt of the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, \n     the amendment also requires the president to develop a plan \n     to turn the ground combat troop element of the Kosovo \n     peacekeeping operation entirely over to the Europeans by July \n     1, 2001.\n       The timing is a key element of the amendment. First, it \n     shifts the responsibility of determining future U.S. \n     involvement in Kosovo from the current Administration, which \n     will be out of office within months, to the next \n     Administration, which will inherit the Kosovo peacekeeping \n     mission. Second, the amendment provides ample time for the \n     next Administration to either develop a plan to hand off the \n     Kosovo ground combat troop mission to the Europeans or make \n     its case to Congress to keep U.S. ground combat troops in \n     Kosovo.\n       If the next President sees a compelling need to keep U.S. \n     ground troops in Kosovo beyond July 1, 2001, the amendment \n     requires him to seek congressional authorization. If \n     Congress, acting under expedited procedures, does not \n     authorize the continued deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo, \n     funding would be terminated after July 1, 2001.\n       As an intermediate goal, the amendment withholds 25 percent \n     of the FY 2000 supplemental appropriations for military \n     operations in Kosovo pending certification by the President \n     that the Europeans are living up to their commitments, \n     including provision of at least 33% of the commitment for \n     monetary reconstruction assistance, 75% of the commitment for \n     humanitarian assistance, 75% of the commitment for Kosovo \n     government administration monetary assistance, and 75% of the \n     commitment for civilian police.\n       If the President cannot make such a certification by July \n     15, 2000, the money being held in reserve could only be used \n     to withdraw troops from Kosovo unless Congress, acting under \n     expedited procedures, votes otherwise.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first commend the chairman of our \nArmed Services Committee. He has been to war twice. He served as our \nSecretary of the Navy. He has a conscience with respect to the GIs now \ndeployed in Kosovo. That is the reason I rise this afternoon.\n  My chairman, ranking member, and former majority leader, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has a little bit of \nlaryngitis. He is feeling well. He is at the committee markup right now \nwith respect to the Labor, Health and Human Resources bill in \nappropriations over in the Hart Building. He wanted someone to be able \nto respond. I understood the opposition to this particular amendment \nwere on their way to the floor. That is why I came. Maybe the better \npart of wisdom would be to say thank you and there is no debate, and \nwhen we get in one, then Senator Byrd can speak for himself.\n  However, I share that concern for our troops, their morale and the \ndeployment of a so-called peacekeeping mission. There isn't any peace. \nThere isn't any policy. All we have to do is look at the record. The \nrecord shows best that we debated airstrikes and we were split down the \nmiddle, 58-41, March 23, under the Biden amendment. We had the McCain \namendment deploying armed forces in Kosovo, saying let's go to war. \nThat was May 4, 1999. It was tabled by a motion of 78-22.\n  The record shows, at best, we have a lukewarm endorsement, maybe \nfavoring some airstrikes, but against taking the life of a GI. That is \nthe military policy right now. With respect to diplomacy, the policy is \none of a so-called multiethnic society, as I remember Secretary \nAlbright saying.\n  I visited Kosovo shortly after the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee did this year. I was never briefed on the \nimportance of a multiethnic society . . . maybe the region should be \npartitioned. But that isn't the policy of the United States. I tried to \nverify the multiethnic policy with all of our experts deployed there--\nthe Army generals, the Navy admirals, and everyone else. I could find \nno support for any kind of multiethnic society in light of what was \ngoing on on the ground.\n  Here we have another Vietnam, not in the sense of deploying more and \nmore troops, but actually having a military deployment in an impossible \nsituation. Don't go forward, don't go backward, just stay there; we \nwill send movies. It is sort of embarrassing to see our military \nhunkered down like chickens in a hailstorm at Camp Bonsteel and \neverybody bragging that we have wooden buildings and catwalks through \nthe snow and we can get hamburgers at McDonald's. That is not for the \nGI, the one who volunteers to serve in the military. He is looking to \nbe trained and go to battle for our national security.\n  To address these conditions that continue and languish is a reason I \nam confident Senator Byrd introduced his amendment, which is part of \nour bill. And certainly it is my feeling, likewise, that we have a \nresponsibility here.\n  The other day we had the 25th anniversary of Vietnam. The Secretary \nof Defense said, almost 25 years later, it was a mistake. Are we going \nto have to wait 25 years to resolve Kosovo? Bosnia was to last 1 year. \nThat policy has been going on for 5, 6 years now.\n  We just cannot willy-nilly go along with mixed policies. Of course, \nthe clarion call for the Kosovo initiative was ethnic cleansing. At the \ntime they were briefing us, they had 100,000 Albanians living \npeacefully in Belgrade. Milosevic lived down the street. Heavens above, \nthis was not the Holocaust. Everybody confuses ethnic cleansing with \nenemy cleansing. When you start bombing somebody and you make that the \nenemy, an outright open warfare, then the other side has got the right, \ntitle, and interest to clear the area of any on the side of the enemy. \nMore ethnic cleansing occurred after the bombing than before the \nbombing. Actually, it was enemy cleansing because Milosevic is a cagey \nfellow and a scoundrel and we all know it. He says to himself, whoopee, \nnow I can go in there and get rid of the real Albanians  that have been \ngiving me problems down there in Kosovo. And he did it.\n\n  That is exactly what was happening. The talk now is trying to deal \nwith, ex post facto, a million refugees spilling over into Macedonia, \ndown into Albania and back up into Montenegro and elsewhere. But the \nreal spilling over and the cleansing was enemy cleansing. We are trying \nto talk about war and victory, trying to give dignity to a mistake.\n  No. 1, it was a flawed policy from the word go. We came in where \nthere weren't any guys with the white hats. It wasn't the good guys \nversus the bad guys. Anybody who knows anything about Kosovo and this \npart of the world knows that both sides are really something else. I \nwould not want an American to go to battle for either side. I\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nsay that advisedly because it has been proven. When we went there \nearlier this year, what did we learn? Yes, there was violence upon \nviolence upon violence. It was continuing. And 95 percent of the \nviolence was being inflicted by Albanian on Albanian.\n  It is interesting to me to see here, recently, in The Economist, \nthat:\n\n       The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. \n     On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.\n\n  Then going down it says:\n\n       At present, the Albanians can look to NATO for their \n     security and to the U.N. for their administration, while many \n     of them traffic in drugs and other contraband and generally \n     profit from the legal limbo in which they live.\n\n  Peacekeeping? Where is the peace? Where is the peace? We are now \nsaying we have a deployment for peacekeeping. It is an enforced cease-\nfire.\n  I was briefed by the brass in Kosovo. They said both sides ran out of \ntargets. We hit all the targets we wanted to hit. We were even going up \nthere knocking out the Chinese Embassy.\n  Of course, Milosevic had gotten rid of everything and cleansed \neverything he possibly could. What a wonderful war. We won. Now we want \nto snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Come on, don't give us that.\n  We were there in the little town of Urosevac. The President visited \nthat town at Christmas time. They had a big show. They had 400-some \ntroops, and they all were hunkered down in the city hall. You could \ntell the 65,000 or 70,000 residents of the town were not friendly. We \ndrove around and they glowered at us. They were in charge. We were not \nin charge of the town the President was in. We were not in charge of \nanything, really, in Kosovo. We have deployments here with walls around \nthem, fences and everything else. We do not wander down the street or \noutside the compound.\n  Similarly, in Mitrovica, we have a GI at one end of the block, a GI \nat the other end of the block, and a GI in the middle of the block on a \n24-hour, three times eight, 24-hour routine, guarding people going to \nthe grocery store.\n  It's public knowledge what the reporter says in The Economist about \nthis thing not working:\n\n       The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. \n     On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.\n\n  There are the soldiers in the peacekeeping force, having to spend 6 \nmonths away from their families. People hate to waste time. We, in the \nSenate, we love wasting time. There is nothing to do tomorrow and \nnothing on Monday. We cannot wait for November and the Presidential \nelection to be over with so we can all go back to work. But the normal \nattitude is not to waste time and, you see, that is exactly what is \nhappening in Kosovo.\n  I finally understood about the Albanians when I was in London and I \nmet with one of the leaders of Parliament. He said the Albanians are \nbringing 14- and 15-year-old girls to Portsmouth and forcing them into \nprostitution. They have drugs all over England now. He said: It's the \nworst threat and problem that we have here in England. He said: I never \nthought I would ever say anything good about Milosevic, but I can sort \nof understand his problem.\n\n  That is not to say Milosevic is a good guy, or the Albanians are all \nbad. But you generally get a feel for what is out there and what is \ngoing on when responsible people tell you: Look, all the Afghanistan \ndrugs are coming up through Kosovo, and into Europe. Instead of keeping \nthe peace, we are keeping the flow of drugs.\n  The GI with any common sense is saying to himself: Where is this \npeace we have here? We have one fellow who murdered another one but we \nhad to let him go in 48 hours because we only had 93 slots in the \nprison and the United Nations had not supplied a police force. The \nUnited Nations had not supplied a court system. The United Nations had \nnot put up their money for a prison system.\n  So we go right to the ultimatum. If this is diplomacy, let me quote \nnone other than our friend, the former Secretary of State, Henry \nKissinger:\n\n       Rambouillet was not a negotiation--as is often claimed--but \n     an ultimatum. This marked an astounding departure for an \n     administration that had entered office proclaiming its \n     devotion to the UN Charter and multilateral procedures.\n\n  And on and on.\n\n       The transformation of Alliance from a defensive military \n     grouping into an institution prepared to impose its values by \n     force occurred in the same month that three former Soviet \n     satellites joined NATO.\n\n  That is none other than Kissinger himself. In that light, I am glad \nwe did not send Secretary Albright to Northern Ireland. We sent Senator \nGeorge Mitchell instead. But under the Albright policy, you either \nagree by 12 o'clock midnight or we go bombing. Come on. This thing is \nafoul, amiss, and a mistake, and we don't have to wait for 25 years to \nknow it. Those are my words, the words of the Senator from South \nCarolina, and not the words of the Senator from West Virginia. He will \nbe glad at the first of the week--I am confident he will be in good \nshape again. He will explain it, no doubt, to everyone's satisfaction.\n  We all agree on one thing. With GIs deployed on account of our \nmistakes, we are going to give them every dollar necessary, every \nbenefit, every support we possibly can.\n  We cannot possibly continue day in and day out in limbo with a flawed \npolicy and act like it is a policy. It is a nonpolicy and a flawed \npolicy and a mistaken policy. We have to somehow bring it to a head.\n  How do we do that in a deliberate, tactful manner? What we say is: \nLook, get these countries of the U.N. to support it.\n  Of course, we learned at the briefings that the Greeks were not for \nit in their sector. They did not like it. The French, are comme ci \ncomme ca. The Soviets never were for it, and they do not adhere to us. \nNATO responds to Moscow. The Brits are pulling out. In one place they \npulled out, 3 hours later a church was burned.\n  I asked our British friends what their reason for pulling out was and \nthey said they were too stretched. We are stretched, too. We have nine \npeacekeeping missions. We have Kosovo, Sierra Leone, the Congo, and \nEast Timor. There are four more we are going to be asking for. The GIs \nare given a policeman's duty in a totally hostile place where one \ncannot take sides and one has to defend oneself and not act like an \nauthority on keeping the peace but, by gosh, keep out of trouble.\n  We are not in charge in Kosovo, nor is the U.N., nor is NATO. We have \ninvaded a sovereign country without a full debate. We made that mistake \nin Vietnam. We have the feeling of responsibility. I understand the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona is very much in favor of Kosovo. I \ncould have saved him 4 or 5 years in prison if I knew at the time I got \nto the Senate in 1966 that McNamara felt Vietnam was a mistake.\n  Come on. Are we going to continue just because we do not want to send \na message to Milosevic? Do my colleagues really think that Milosevic \ndoes not know what is going on? He has already removed the opposition \nauthorities in Montenegro. If he went in there tonight, what would we \ndo? Nothing. He is corralling his support. Read this week's Time \nmagazine about what the Air Force did not hit. I wish my colleagues \nwould get a copy and read it because it reports we were misled in that \nparticular briefing about how we destroyed so many tanks, so many \nplanes, so many targets; we just ruined the country.\n  Our distinguished friend, the Secretary of State, said: Give peace a \nchance; it takes time to get the roads and the bridges and industry and \nthe hospitals and the air fields all repaired.\n  I remember a visit I had when I first came to the Senate. I was at \nthe Connaught in London having dinner with Martin Agronsky who had been \nbehind the lines in Northern Ireland for a 3-week period. He came out \nin despair. He said: That crowd is never going to get together.\n  Fortunately, under the leadership of President Clinton and Senator \nMitchell, there was a break last Friday, and, finally, the IRA says \nthey are going to disarm, and it looks like it might work.\n  For 30 years, they have had the infrastructure--the roads, the \nbridges, the hospitals, the universities. I have been to Northern \nIreland. Some sections of Belfast have better housing than my hometown. \nWith all that infrastructure, the British troops are still deployed \nyears and years later.\n  Is that the policy of the United States of America with our GIs? That\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nis why we rise this afternoon and are ready, willing, and able to draw \nsome lines that are understandable that will develop into a firm \npolicy.\n  If the U.N. wants to get in there, fine, but if they are not going to \nsupport it, then we have a problem. I will never forget the story about \nVaclav Havel saying he hoped Secretary Albright could come back to the \nCzech Republic, her native land, and succeed him as President. He said \nthe one difficulty was that 75 percent of the people of the Czech \nRepublic opposed ``Madeleine's war.''\n  Take a rollcall. Go up to the U.N. See how enthused they are about \nthe nonpolicy.\n  Quit giving this patina of deliberation and positivity by doing \nnothing and keeping the troops out there and praying like we all do \nthat no one gets assaulted or loses a life at Bonsteel. We have an \nimpossible situation. It is not going to get better in the foreseeable \nfuture. We ought to bring it to a head and certainly let the next \nPresident, whomever that is, have a 6-month period to review the \nmistake we made and say: Wait a minute, it was not a mistake.\n\n  I do not mind if they are right and I am wrong. I can tell my \ncolleagues right now though, unfortunately, I think I gave the right \nvote when I opposed the Biden amendment.\n  I appreciate the leadership and the conscientious approach the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, has given this responsibility. We are not trying to \nembarrass the President. We are not trying to take a political \nposition. On the contrary, I have my GIs out there. I saw what happened \nin Vietnam, and I saw what happened in Somalia. If it had not been for \nthe Byrd amendment, we could possibly still be there.\n  This is a similar call to arms politically for us to set the policy \nand do so in a judicious way. We all know they want to try to subvert \nit; they do not want to talk about it. With this crowd in Washington, \nyou have to be on message: Let's not talk about it because it might get \non to the weekend shows, and if it gets on to the weekend shows, it \nmight send the wrong message to Milosevic. Bah humbug to Milosevic. I \nam trying to send a message to those fellows at Bonsteel. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nSouth Carolina. I remember when I first came to the Senate 22 years \nago, two-thirds of the Senate or more had the opportunity to serve in \nuniform. Today, there are fewer. I cast no aspersion against those who \ndo not. It is just a generational thing.\n  Listening to my dear friend from South Carolina, I know he draws on \nhis experiences in the army in World War II as a young officer in the \nbattle to free Europe when he had the responsibility of life. No one \nelse but him, as an officer, had the responsibility for those young men \nunder his command.\n  This type of amendment we discussed--certainly I have and others--\nwith many veterans who have worn the uniform of this country and many \nwho are on active duty today.\n  The distinguished Senator said he has seen war. I saw it in the \ncontinental limits in World War II, and then I had a brief tour in \nKorea as a ground officer with an air wing. I saw the others who had to \nfight it, but I never put myself in the category of a combat soldier. I \nhave always said my orders did not take me there, but they took the \nSenator there and he saw it.\n  I know in the course of this debate, the issue will be raised: We may \nbe putting the young men and women in the Armed Forces in jeopardy as a \nconsequence of this amendment, even the act of filing it and debating \nit.\n  I want to get into that. I am sure the Senator will rejoin in this \ndebate if and when that happens.\n  I see our distinguished colleague here, who is a naval veteran, who \nis about to speak. I do not know if it is on this matter or on another \nmatter. It is not on this matter.\n  But I am willing to join in that debate. When 23 members of the \nAppropriations Committee voted ``yea'' to put this in--and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina can correct me--but of that \ngroup who voted ``yea,'' the following have been privileged to wear the \nuniform of our country: Senator Cochran, Senator Specter, Senator \nGorton, Senator Burns, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Senator Daniel \nInouye, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Senator Herbert Kohl, and Senator \nStevens, the chairman. They are veterans.\n  Let us debate it, but let us debate it with great care.\n  The letter which I put in the Record from Senator Byrd and myself \nstates our point of view. This letter is just going out to Members, but \nalready the following cosponsors, who likewise were veterans, have \nsigned on: Senator Roberts, Senator Strom Thurmond, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Robert Smith, and Senator Sessions. So a goodly number of those \nwho have been privileged to wear the uniform of our country have joined \nbehind this.\n  We would not have done it, I say to the Senator, if we had had a \nmoment's concern we were increasing the risk to our people. They are at \nrisk today. They will be at risk tomorrow and the next day. And as we \nare drifting into this endless--endless--commitment, they are at risk \nevery single day.\n  This amendment simply says: Congress, either join with the President \nor state your case and bring them home. That is the purpose of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Vice President of the United States is \nflying to Oregon this evening, or tomorrow morning, for a visit to that \nState. On the last five or six occasions on which he has visited the \nState of Washington, I have inquired of him, as politely as possible, \nas to his intentions with respect to the future of four dams on the \nSnake River. This inquiry is of significant importance to the people of \nthe State of Washington, as well as the people of the State of Oregon. \nThe answer from the Vice President is peculiarly important because of \nthe disarray of the present administration. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has recommended that the dams come down, be removed, for salmon \nrecovery. The Corps of Engineers, almost a year ago, was ready to \nrecommend that the dams stay in place and that we deal with salmon \nrecovery in another productive fashion. That recommendation was vetoed \nby the White House and removed physically from the Corps of Engineers' \nreport.\n  More recently, the National Marine Fishery Service has said that we \ndon't know enough to decide whether or not we should remove the dams \nand that the decision may be at least 5 or 10 years away. The Governor \nof Oregon has recommended that the dams come down. The Governor of \nWashington, also a Democrat, has opposed that recommendation. As you \nknow, Mr. President, so have I, in the most vehement possible terms. Of \nall of the proposals for salmon recovery, dam removal is, first, the \nmost ineffective and, second, of the most marginal utility with respect \nto the recovery of the salmon resource in the Pacific Northwest.\n  At a capital expenditure of $1 billion to $2 billion, and annual \nlosses of at\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nleast a third of a billion dollars in perpetuity, the promise of salmon \nrecovery from dam removal is extremely marginal, with no impact on some \nof the endangered runs, and only a modest improvement in the order of \n10 to 20 percent in the prospects for certain other runs. Weighed \nagainst that are the potential real successes from the Salmon Recovery \nBoard of the State of Washington, which has for the current year an \nappropriation from the Congress of $18 million for the work of citizen-\nbased salmon recovery teams, which will be the beneficiary of an \nappropriation from this body of about $4 million.\n  There is a very real concern with predation at the mouth of the \nColumbia River--a concern now frustrated by a lawsuit against any \nremoval of Caspian terns from an artificial island at the mouth of the \nriver by at least a temporary injunction. These and dozens of other \nprojects in the Pacific Northwest have a far greater promise for the \nsalmon recovery than does dam removal, with all of its devastating \nimpacts on the loss of benign, renewable energy power, to be \nsubstituted by the use of fossil fuels, for all of the loss of \nagricultural land that requires irrigation to be anything other than a \ndesert, for all the loss of a transportation system which is the most \nefficient and environmentally benign for the transportation of grain to \nports on the lower Columbia River.\n  All of these factors argue against dam removal. But the Vice \nPresident of the United States, in his candidacy for President of the \nUnited States, refuses to make any commitment whatsoever on this \nmatter. Now, it may be that he didn't want to respond to this Senator \non these visits to the State of Washington. But he is now going to be \nasked to respond by the Governor of Oregon, who supports his candidacy. \nHis response has been demanded by the Portland Oregonian, the largest \nnewspaper in the State of Oregon, which, incidentally, holds my \nposition and that of my colleague, Senator Smith of Oregon, on the \nsubject. One hopes that the Vice President will finally be able to come \nup with an opinion. Now, he has taken positions on other local issues. \nHe is certainly quite willing to tell the people of South Carolina what \nflag they can fly. But he seems unwilling to tell the people of \nWashington and Oregon what his views are on an issue of vital \nimportance to them and to their regional economy.\n  So I am here to express the hope that the Vice President will finally \ncome clean with his views on this subject. But I must express the \nexpectation that he will, once again, dodge the issue, pretend that he \nhas not made up his mind when, in fact, he has, and claim that he can't \nmake a substantive comment on this until after the election in November \nis over. I will regret that, Mr. President. His opponent, the Governor \nof Texas, has taken the forthright stand that it is improper and \nuneconomical and unwise to remove those dams. He will protect the \nphysical infrastructure of the Pacific Northwest. I am here to invite \nthe Vice President of the United States to do likewise, without, I \nregret to say, any expectation that he is willing to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished \ncolleague from Kansas, Senator Roberts, to continue our dialog on the \nglobal role of the United States. This is the third such dialog in what \nwe have intended to be a year-long series. In February, we began by \ntaking a broad look at the priorities and approaches of U.S. foreign \npolicy in the post-cold-war period. A few weeks ago we narrowed the \nfocus somewhat by trying to define and defend our national interest, \nwhich must be the first step in arriving at a coherent national \nsecurity strategy.\n  Today, as we start to go from general principles to concrete \napplications, Senator Roberts and I, along with several of our \ncolleagues, will attempt to zero in on the U.S. role in multilateral \norganizations which strongly impact our national security, especially \nNATO and the U.N.\n  I have just returned from a trip to Brussels and Italy where we were \nbriefed on the air campaign from Aviano Air Base. In Brussels, I met \nwith the Deputy Secretary General of NATO. As I said, Italy and then on \nto Macedonia, where we saw the regions where the refugees were kept \nduring the war in Kosovo. Then, into Kosovo itself.\n  I met with key military leaders and key political leaders from the \nUnited States, European nations, and NATO. These meetings only served \nto reinforce my strong belief that there is a pressing need to address \nthe global role of the United States, both in our own national \nstrategic planning and in NATO's planning. This conclusion is not a \nresult of the recent actions taken in Serbia and Kosovo. Rather, these \nactions were merely symptomatic of, I think, the problem.\n  A large portion of the military operation in Kosovo was supplied by \nthe United States. I believe it is now time for the United States to \nlead in finding a political solution. Similarly, I believe the time has \ncome to ``Europeanize'' the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo. While the \nsoldiers I spoke with at Camp Bond steel certainly displayed high \nmorale, reflected in the excellent job they actually have done, if we \nstay in the Balkans indefinitely with no clear way out, I believe we \nrun an increasing risk of further overextending our military, thus \nexacerbating our recruitment and retention problems and lessening our \ncapability to respond to more serious challenges to our vital national \ninterests.\n  From my perspective, the basic problem in the Balkans today is \npolitical, not military, and requires a political rather than military \nsolution. Essentially, at this point in time, the various communities \nwish to live apart and exercise self-determination along ethnic lines. \nI would agree that such a development is unfortunate and not in keeping \nwith our American view of the way the world should be. However, for any \nsolution to the current situation to be acceptable to the parties \ndirectly involved--and, thus, durable--this inescapable fact must be \ntaken into account.\n\n  On June 30 of last year, the Senate accepted by voice vote my \namendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill which expressed \n``the sense of the Senate that the United States should call \nimmediately for the convening of an international conference on the \nBalkans'' to develop a final political settlement of both the Kosovo \nand Bosnia conflicts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Amendment No. 1163 to S. 1234, Fiscal Year 2000 Foreign Operations \n  Appropriations Supporting an International Conference To Achieve a \n              Durable Political Settlement in the Balkans\n\n          (Adopted by Senate by unanimous consent on 6/30/99)\n\n     SEC. X. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INTERNATIONAL \n                   CONFERENCE ON THE BALKANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and its allies in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization (NATO) conducted large-scale military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (2) At the conclusion of 78 days of these hostilities, the \n     United States and its NATO allies suspended military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia based \n     upon credible assurances by the latter that it would fulfill \n     the following conditions as laid down by the so called Group \n     of Eight (G-8):\n       (A) An immediate and verifiable end of violence and \n     repression in Kosovo.\n       (B) Staged withdrawal of all Yugoslav military, police and \n     paramilitary forces from Kosovo.\n       (C) Deployment in Kosovo of effective international and \n     security presences, endorsed and adopted by the United \n     Nations Security Council, and capable of guaranteeing the \n     achievement of the agreed objectives.\n       (D) Establishment of an interim administration for Kosovo, \n     to be decided by the United Nations Security Council which \n     will seek to ensure conditions for a peaceful and normal life \n     for all inhabitants in Kosovo.\n       (E) Provision for the safe and free return of all refugees \n     and displaced persons from Kosovo and an unimpeded access to \n     Kosovo by humanitarian aid organizations.\n       (3) These objectives appear to have been fulfilled, or to \n     be in the process of being fulfilled, which has led the \n     United States and its NATO allies to terminate military \n     operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (4) The G-8 also called for a comprehensive approach to the \n     economic development and\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\n     stabilization of the crisis region, and the European Union \n     has announced plans for $1,500,000,000 over the next 3 years \n     for the reconstruction of Kosovo, for the convening in July \n     of an international donors' conference for Kosovo aid, and \n     for subsequent provision of reconstruction aid to the other \n     countries in the region affected by the recent hostilities \n     followed by reconstruction aid directed at the Balkans \n     region as a whole;\n       (5) The United States and some of its NATO allies oppose \n     the provision of any aid, other than limited humanitarian \n     assistance, to Serbia until Yugoslav President Slobodan \n     Milosevic is out of office.\n       (6) The policy of providing reconstruction aid to Kosovo \n     and other countries in the region affected by the recent \n     hostilities while withholding such aid for Serbia presents a \n     number of practical problems, including the absence in Kosovo \n     of financial and other institutions independent of \n     Yugoslavia, the difficulty in drawing clear and enforceable \n     distinctions between humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance, and the difficulty in reconstructing Montenegro \n     in the absence of similar efforts in Serbia.\n       (7) In any case, the achievement of effective and durable \n     economic reconstruction and revitalization in the countries \n     of the Balkans is unlikely until a political settlement is \n     reached as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia.\n       (8) The G-8 proposed a political process towards the \n     establishment of an interim political framework agreement for \n     a substantial self-government for Kosovo, taking into full \n     account the final Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-\n     Government in Kosovo, also known as the Rambouillet Accords, \n     and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \n     of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the other countries \n     of the region, and the demilitarization of the UCK (Kosovo \n     Liberation Army).\n       (9) The G-8 proposal contains no guidance as to a final \n     political settlement for Kosovo and Yugoslavia, while the \n     original position of the United States and the other \n     participants in the so-called Contact Group on this matter, \n     as reflected in the Rambouillet Accords, called for the \n     convening of an international conference, after three years, \n     to determine a mechanism for a final settlement of Kosovo \n     status based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act.\n       (10) The current position of the United States and its NATO \n     allies as to the final status of Kosovo and Yugoslavia calls \n     for an autonomous, multiethnic, democratic Kosovo which would \n     remain as part of Serbia, and such an outcome is not \n     supported by any of the Parties directly involved, including \n     the governments of Yugoslavia and Serbia, representatives of \n     the Kosovar Albanians, and the people of Yugoslavia, Serbia \n     and Kosovo.\n       (11) There has been no final political settlement in \n     Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the armed forces of the United \n     States, its NATO allies, and other non-Balkan nations have \n     been enforcing an uneasy peace since 1996, at a cost to the \n     United States alone of over $10,000,000,000 with no clear end \n     in sight to such enforcement.\n       (12) The trend throughout the Balkans since 1990 has been \n     in the direction of ethnically-based particularism, as \n     exemplified by the 1991 declarations of independence from \n     Yugoslavia by Slovenia and Croatia, and the country in the \n     Balkans which currently comes the closest to the goal of a \n     democratic government which respects the human rights of its \n     citizens is the nation of Slovenia, which was the first \n     portion of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to \n     secede and is also the nation in the region with the greatest \n     ethnic homogeneity, with a population which is 91 percent \n     Slovene.\n       (13) The boundaries of the various national and sub-\n     national divisions in the Balkans have been altered \n     repeatedly throughout history, and international conferences \n     have frequently played the decisive role in fixing such \n     boundaries in the modern era, including the Berlin Congress \n     of 1878, the London Conference of 1913, and the Paris Peace \n     Conference of 1919.\n       (14) The development of an effective exit strategy for the \n     withdrawal from the Balkans of foreign military forces, \n     including the armed forces of the United States, its NATO \n     allies, Russia, and any other nation from outside the Balkans \n     which has such forces in the Balkans is in the best interests \n     of all such nations.\n       (15) The ultimate withdrawal of foreign military forces, \n     accompanied by the establishment of durable and peaceful \n     relations among all of the nations and peoples of the Balkans \n     is in the best interests of those nations and peoples;\n       (16) An effective exit strategy for the withdrawal from the \n     Balkans of foreign military forces is contingent upon the \n     achievement of a lasting political settlement for the region, \n     and only such a settlement, acceptable to all parties \n     involved, can ensure the fundamental goals of the United \n     States of peace, stability and human rights in the Balkans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) The United States should call immediately for the \n     convening of an international conference on the Balkans, \n     under the auspices of the United Nations, and based upon the \n     principles of the Rambouillet Accords for a final settlement \n     of Kosovo status, namely that such a settlement should be \n     based on the will of the people, opinions of relevant \n     authorities, each Party's efforts regarding the \n     implementation of the agreement and the provisions of the \n     Helsinki Final Act;\n       (2) The international conference on the Balkans should also \n     be empowered to seek a final settlement for Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina based on the same principles as specified for \n     Kosovo in the Rambouillet Accords; and\n       (3) In order to produce a lasting political settlement in \n     the Balkans acceptable to all parties, which can lead to the \n     departure from the Balkans in timely fashion of all foreign \n     military forces, including those of the United States, the \n     international conference should have the authority to \n     consider any and all of the following: political boundaries; \n     humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for all nations in \n     the Balkans; stationing of UN peacekeeping forces along \n     international boundaries; security arrangements and \n     guarantees for all of the nations of the Balkans; and \n     tangible, enforceable and verifiable human rights guarantees \n     for the individuals and peoples of the Balkans.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I truly believe that such an approach is the best, if \nnot the only, way to resolve the difficulties in Bosnia and Kosovo--\nallowing our troops eventually to come home but avoiding an \nunacceptable security vacuum in southeast Europe--and is definitely in \nthe best interest of the United States and Europe.\n  Two years ago this week, the Senate was debating the expansion of \nNATO, and I should add that I found that discussion to be perhaps the \nfinest deliberation on national security issues that I have witnessed \nin the time I have served in the U.S. Senate. The debate raised serious \nquestions regarding both the makeup and purpose of NATO, but, in the \nend, I, and a large majority of the Senate, concluded that extension of \nNATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary was in our, \nand NATO's, best interest because NATO was the only entity ready and \nable to fill the security void in northeastern Europe.\n  Much has changed in the time since that vote, including the launching \nof the first offensive military operations in the history of the \nalliance last year in Kosovo and Serbia, an action which also \nrepresented the first time NATO asserted the right to intervene in the \ninternal affairs of a sovereign nation. Both of these were significant \ndepartures from the Senate's understanding of NATO as expressed during \nthat debate as well as the representations we made to other nations, \nmost notably Russia, about the goals and the intentions of NATO in the \naftermath its eastward expansion. Specifically, section 3 of the Senate \nResolution of Ratification affirmed that the ``core mission'' of NATO \nremains ``collective self-defense,'' and we sought to calm Russian \nanxieties by pointing to the 50-year record of NATO in never launching \noffensive operations, and never violating the sovereignty of states \nexcept in pursuit of collective self-defense.\n  Since we voted for NATO expansion we have also witnessed the issuance \nof a new Strategic Concept for NATO, in April of 1999, and here again, \nthe results were not exactly as anticipated at the time of the Senate's \nratification vote on NATO expansion 2 years ago. For a particularly \ninsightful and detailed treatment of this subject, I would commend to \nall Senators a May 24, 1999 floor statement by my distinguished \ncolleague from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, which dissected in some detail the \nnumerous departures from the Senate's 1998 Resolution of Ratification \nin the April 1999 NATO Strategic Concept.\n\n  For purposes of today's discussion on how multilateral organizations \nimpact on the U.S. global role, I would like to highlight just two of \nthe issues identified by Senator Roberts: the central issue of NATO's \npurpose, or ``core mission,'' and the matter of how European nations \nshould provide for their own defense, the so-called European Security \nand Defense Identity.\n  For its first 50 years, which culminated in its victory in the Cold \nWar without ever having to fight a battle, the core purpose of NATO, \nrecognized by friend and foe alike, was set forth in article 5 of the \nNorth Atlantic treaty of April 4, 1949:\n\n       The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more \n     of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an \n     attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if \n     such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the \n     right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by \n     Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist \n     the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith, \n     individually and\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n     in concert with other Parties, such action as it deems \n     necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and \n     maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n\n  In contrast, the new NATO Strategic Concept goes well beyond the \ntraditional collective security role in its aspirations for NATO. Item \n24 in the April 24, 1999 text states that:\n\n       Any armed attack on the territory of the Allies, from \n     whatever direction, would be covered by Article 5 and 6 of \n     the Washington Treaty. However, Alliance security must also \n     take account of the global context. Alliance security \n     interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, \n     including acts of terrorism, sabotage, and organized crime, \n     and by the disruption of the flow of vital resources.\n\n  I wonder if NATO is designed to track terrorism around the world, \nsabotage around the world, and organized crime around the world.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       The uncontrolled movement of large numbers of people, \n     particularly as a consequence of armed conflicts, can also \n     pose problems for security and stability affecting the \n     Alliance.\n\n  Item 10 in that document includes as ``fundamental security tasks'' \nfor NATO the traditional objectives of security, consultation, and \ndeterrence and defense, as well as ``crisis management,'' within which \nallies are ``to stand ready, case-by-case and by consensus, in \nconformity of Article 7 of the Washington Treaty, to contribute to \neffective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis \nmanagement, including crisis response operations.''\n  I wonder if NATO has become not a self-defense organization but a \ncrisis management and crisis intervention organization. I wonder.\n  I point out that Article 7 of the NATO Treaty says that:\n\n       This Treaty does not affect, and shall not be interpreted \n     as affecting in any way the rights and obligations under the \n     Charter of the Parties which are members of the United \n     Nations, or the primary responsibility of the Security \n     Council for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security.\n\n  While some Western observers, especially in the United States, \nmaintain that the 1999 Strategic Concept does not represent a \nsignificant change in NATO's policy, I believe that the Norwegian \nnewspaper, Oslo Aftenposten, was much closer to the mark when it wrote \nlast April that:\n\n       In its new ``strategic concept'' NATO has approved a \n     radical expansion of the alliance's tasks, both \n     geographically and with regard to content. From now on it \n     will be the alliance's task to promote ``security and \n     stability in the Euro-Atlantic area'' by ``becoming actively \n     involved in dealing with crises, including operations in \n     response to crises.'' We see the first example in Kosovo.\n\n  It is my view that the members of the NATO alliance, and especially \nthe United States, need to think much more carefully about the expanded \naspirations of their new strategic concept, and the costs--economic, \npolitical, and human resource--they are willing and able to pay in \npursuit of these aspirations. Specifically, at the very least I believe \nboth Houses of Congress, especially this House, the Senate, need to \nundertake a thorough series of hearings on the strategic concept and \nthe future of NATO.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I could not urge this \nset of hearings more strongly.\n  The Norwegian paper goes on to say that:\n\n       It is also new and important that the alliance said ``yes'' \n     at the summit meeting to the desire of the EU countries to \n     play a more independent role and thus acquire greater \n     political weight in the NATO cooperation. Behind this also \n     lies a desire for a cautious counterweight to a United \n     States that is perhaps more strongly dominant now, \n     militarily and politically, than ever before in NATO's \n     history.\n\n  Distinguished colleagues, this leads to my other major concern about \nthe United States and NATO: the question of a ``more independent role'' \nfor the European Union countries. John Keegan, one of the world's \nleading military historians, summed up the current debate in an article \nlast December. He said:\n\n       Though it has long been American policy to encourage \n     European political and economic integration on the model of \n     its own federal structure, the United States is far less \n     ready to welcome moves by the Europeans to go their own \n     strategic way. There are two reasons for that. The first is \n     that the United States sees its own security as inextricably \n     bound up within the alliance system in which it is a partner. \n     The second is that it doubts the ability of the Europeans to \n     construct parallel systems which will deliver military value. \n     . . . The Americans are right to regard all current European \n     attempts, either through the European Union, or the \n     belatedly revived Western European Union or through ad hoc \n     arrangements such as the newly announced Anglo-French \n     force, to bypass NATO as damaging to the security \n     structure that already exists.\n\n  Despite its advances in economic integration, the European community \nstill lags far behind in developing a common national security \nstructure. As we witnessed in Bosnia, and most recently Kosovo, Europe \nlacks either the will or the means, or both, to conduct independent \nmilitary operations even in its own backyard. And whatever the end \nresult of the recent European Security and Defense Initiative, or \nIdentity it will be many years before the Europeans can develop a \nmilitary capable of significant action independent of the United \nStates. When one adds the additional questions of national sovereignty, \ndomestic pressures to cut defense spending, and, of course, the need \nfor consensus on how and when to take military action, the challenges \nfacing the Europeans are daunting indeed.\n  Until Europe can surmount these challenges, which, most likely, will \nbe many years from now, American involvement and leadership via NATO \nwill still be seen, by Europeans at least, as essential. On my recent \ntrip, I was discussing the role of the United States in Europe with the \nDeputy Secretary of NATO, Sergio Balanzio, when he told me that the \nUnited States is, ``a European power whether you like it or not --\nobviously, indicating we are a European power, whether we like it or \nnot, in Europe and in the Balkans. I responded that it is one thing to \nbe on the point of the spear and to bear the heavy load in certain \ncases, as the U.S. did in Bosnia and Kosovo, but quite another to \nalways be called upon to ride to the rescue, even in Europe itself.\n\n  Going back to 1949, when NATO was formed, one of the quotes that \nrings in my ears is a quote from Lord Ismay, the first Secretary \nGeneral of NATO. When he was asked the purpose of NATO, Lord Ismay \nsaid: The purpose of NATO is to keep the Americans in, the Russians \nout, and the Germans down.\n  I have serious reservations about that particular mission statement \nnow. There is no need to keep the Russians out. As a matter of fact, we \nare wrapping our arms around the big bear in every way in every trade \nagreement, every cooperative agreement we can possibly put together. \nSecondly, there is no need to keep the Germans down. They are an \nemerging strong force on the European continent.\n  I wonder, though, having just come back from dealing with my NATO \nfriends and our NATO allies, and having gone to Kosovo, whether the \nreal ultimate purpose of NATO for the Europeans now is to keep the \nAmericans in.\n  Personally, I do not mind sharing power. I do mind always being the \nlead dog that is called upon to bear the burden. I think more and more \nAmericans are feeling that way themselves.\n  For me, however, the bottom line is that, despite all of the \ndifficulties, despite the possibility that there may well be some \nshort-term disadvantages for the United States, I believe the United \nStates must, I repeat must, be unequivocally supportive of the \ndevelopment of a strong, independent European military capability to \naccompany Europe's growing economic and political integration. There is \nat present, and for the foreseeable future, no overwhelming threat to \nEuropean security such as that posed by the Soviet Union and Warsaw \nPact. Europe should be able to attend to its own defenses in the post-\nCold War world. The fact that it has not done so is certainly \nattributable to many factors, especially its divided and conflict-\nridden history, but if it does not act now--when the threat is so low--\nthen when will it?\n\n  Developing the necessary support structures, both political and \nmilitary, to produce an effective European security identity will be \nneither quick, nor easy, nor cheap. But they have to start sometime, \nand while the United States must avoid precipitous actions--such as \nthreatening a unilateral troop pull-out--I believe we must clearly \nsignal that we fully understand and support moves toward greater \nEuropean self-defense capabilities. Such moves may well produce some \nshort-term redundancies and inefficiencies in\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\nNATO, but I believe that unless we encourage the Europeans to develop \ntheir own capabilities for their own defense, we will not see the kind \nof increased defense efforts that Europe ought to undertake. Certainly \nAmerican taxpayers have done their share, throughout most of the 20th \nCentury, to contribute to European security.\n  I think British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it best in a November \n22, 1999 speech in London. He said:\n\n       We must shape European Defence policy in a way designed to \n     strengthen (the) transatlantic bond by making NATO a more \n     balanced partnership, and by giving Europeans the capacity to \n     act whenever the United States, for its own reasons, decides \n     not to be involved. Only then will Europe pull its weight in \n     world security and share more of the burden with the United \n     States.\n\n  I could not have said it better.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the floor to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas, my friend and colleague in these dialogs on the U.S. \nglobal role in the world, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, let me again thank my good friend and a \ndistinguished American hero and statesman, the Senator from Georgia, \nfor setting in motion our bipartisan foreign policy dialog. His common \nsense approach and his insightfulness to our country's national \nsecurity obligations, I think, have been most helpful and most \neducational.\n  I say to the Senator, I believe and I hope that our endeavor is \naccomplishing the original goals we outlined in our first dialog. Our \ndialog has attracted attention from the media, and some academics. We \nhave been invited to participate in various academic panel discussions \nand foreign policy dialogs.\n  I hope both our colleagues and the American public have been paying \nattention in our effort to come to grips with America's role in an \nenvironment so different that we cannot even name it, other than \ncalling it the post-Cold War period.\n  When I have the opportunity to go back to Kansas and address the \nissue of what our vital national security interests are; I realize \nforeign policy is not a very bright return on the public radar screen \nwhich is unfortunate.\n  Robert Kagan recently stated that the campaign for the Presidency \nshould focus more on foreign policy. I certainly think that is the \ncase. He asked a simple question, ``Is the world a safer place than it \nwas 8 years ago?'' His article took us on a world tour of \nuncertainties, specifically identifying Iraq, the Balkans, China, \nTaiwan, and weapons of mass destruction proliferation, Haiti, Colombia \nand Russia.\n  A realistic evaluation of emerging patterns in the world lead us to \nthe fact that the world is dangerously close to coming apart at the \nseams. It is time for a serious debate about foreign policy, and this \ndialog we have started is a small step in that direction.\n  In our last dialog Senator Cleland and I discussed the importance of \nidentifying and establishing levels of priority to our U.S. vital \nnational interests. Many other think tanks and foreign policy \norganizations have recommended a similar priority ranking. I noticed \nthe other day in an article that Vice President Gore has recently \narticulated, a new kind of foreign policy suggestion--a new agenda--\nadding the destruction of the natural environment and the AIDS pandemic \noverseas as ``a threat to U.S. national security interests.'' These \nunique and unprecedented issues are important issues, however, they \nhave never made the cut in any other U.S. national interest lists. They \ndefinitely did not make the cut in the last bipartisan dialog that I \nhad with my friend and colleague from Georgia. Nonetheless, it is a \nhealthy debate, and I think it is a very proper debate for our country \nand the Presidential candidates.\n  What did make the cut is the fact that the United States does not \nwant a hostile regional hegemon to develop in Europe or Asia. And then, \nin the meantime, what happened in the Balkans post-Bosnia and post-\nKosovo is the fact that we have a paradox of enormous irony. The irony \nis the United States continues in the role of being a world hegemon, or \nsuperpower--the only one. Some critics say we have developed into a \nhumanitarian world global cop and our actions and means are viewed by \nthem as contrary to their own national interests.\n  Mr. President, the consequence of the U.S. role is the rest of the \nworld is responding as any sovereign nation would respond to a hegemon.\n  Former Ambassador Bob Ellsworth, a former Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and Dr. Michael May, wrote in the Los Angeles Times \nthat U.S. military forces are so large, so advanced technologically, \nand so active all over the world, that a climate of ``hegemony envy'' \nhas developed in key strategic areas in Asia, Europe, and the Middle \nEast.\n  Ambassador Ellsworth explains, the U.S. post-Cold War, change in \nposture from defense and deterrence to enlargement and offense, and the \nClinton doctrine proclaiming and executing intervention around the \nworld in regard to a rather questionable definition of U.S. vital \nnational interests is creating antihegemonic coalitions against the \nUnited States.\n  This current trend of both allies and nonallies asserting themselves \nagainst the U.S. is a very troubling digression.\n  The Nobel Prize novelist and diplomat, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, \nobserved that ``President Clinton has found the political legacy he \nwants to leave behind: The Imperial American Model.'' Obviously, that \ndepiction of American foreign policy is counter to the goal of \nmultilateral cooperation in the world today.\n  As Senator Cleland stated, our third dialog today will focus on the \nrole of multilateral organizations in foreign policy.\n  What are we talking about? Well, currently the United States is a \nmember of a staggering 90 multilateral organizations and numerous other \nbilateral agreements. It took a great deal of effort by staff and by \nresearch specialists to determine the number of multilateral \norganizations where the U.S. is obligated. I venture to guess, I say to \nmy colleague, that the State Department, the Department of Defense, the \nCongress, and most foreign policy experts really don't have any idea \nindividually or collectively of the responsibilities, commitments, or \nobligations or the money that these organizations require of the U.S. \nall throughout the world.\n\n  Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution tried to tackle the issue \nof how much the U.S. should try to do, largely or entirely on its own--\nunilaterally--depending on the policy priorities or the level of U.S. \nnational interests versus how much the U.S. should do in cooperation \nwith others. He articulated that the choice is very complicated, as the \nmultilateral options subsume multiple approaches of multiple \norganizations, including using the U.N. and other international \ninstitutions, alliances, and other regional organizations, and \ncoalitions of those able and willing to act.\n  The fact is, the U.S. almost never acts unilaterally, and it probably \nshould not. The U.S. has fought five major wars during the 20th \ncentury, and in each of these conflicts the U.S. operated as part of an \nalliance or a coalition. The recent U.S. actions all were conducted in \nconjunction with forces from other nations, even as our military \nsuperiority has reached a level unmatched in history.\n  Therefore, if the U.S. is going to operate within the constraints of \nmultilateral organizations--and that appears to be the case--the U.S. \nmust structure alliances in such a way that promotes our national \ninterests and ensures that U.S. power is not undermined.\n  The following list of multilateral organizations associated with \ncountries that the U.S. has current, ongoing operations is staggering: \nIraq, 23; East Timor, 5; Korea, 42; Kosovo, 6; Yugoslavia, 30; \nColombia, 15.\n  We don't have enough time in the rest of the session of Congress to \nexamine all of the multilateral organizations where the U.S. has \nobligations. Obviously, that is going to be an effort that should take \nplace as we change administrations, whether it be the Vice President or \nwhether it be the Governor from Texas. Today, like my colleague, I want \nto focus on NATO a bit and offer some possible suggestions for the \nfuture of America's alliances.\n  During the Cold War, containment of Soviet power provided a simple \nand easily definable job of deterrence from Warsaw Pact aggression. The \nnew Strategic Concept that was adopted over a year ago during the 50th \nanniversary of\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\nNATO is a far different concept from the collective defense \norganization originally developed from the ashes of World War II.\n  If you read the Strategic Concept, you will find that the new \ncommitments outlined have evolved, as I have indicated, NATO from a \ncollective security organization concerned with self-defense to an \ninternational crisis management and humanitarian relief operation and \norganization.\n  Alexander Vershbow, U.S. Permanent Representative on the North \nAtlantic Council, recently said:\n\n       Unbeknownst to many is the fact that the Strategic \n     Concept's most important function is to instruct Alliance \n     military authorities how to configure NATO defense forces so \n     that they are equipped for the full range of Alliance \n     missions, from collective defense to peacekeeping.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       The U.S. believes that the most important new elements of \n     the revised Strategic Concept is the recognition that the \n     fundamental tasks of the Alliance is to carry out so-called \n     ``non-article 5'' missions--operations in response to crises \n     that go beyond the defense of a Allied territory.\n\n  I am concerned that the most important and successful alliance in the \nhistory of our country has been so dramatically restructured that the \nfuture of the alliance is uncertain. Our force structure cannot stand \nanother swampy intervention with unclear and unsound objectives with no \nexit strategy in sight.\n  The new Strategic Concept, as tested in Kosovo, in my personal \nopinion, is drying out the Cold War glue which holds the alliance \ntogether. Targeting by committee and escalation warfare has stressed \nthe system and turned a 3-day war into a 78-day war of limited \nescalation. As indicated by the debate on this floor just about an hour \nor two ago, an amendment introduced by both Senator Byrd and Senator \nWarner will cause considerable and useful debate on Monday and Tuesday \nending in a critical vote about the future of the Kosovo operation.\n  Gen. Brent Scowcroft expressed his concern last November stating:\n\n       The revised Strategic Concept of NATO and the U.N. \n     Secretary General separately have taken on the task of \n     advocating the support of persecuted minorities inside state \n     boundaries; that is, humanitarian operations such as those in \n     Kosovo. In Yugoslavia, we heavily bombed a country in an \n     attempt to protect a minority within that country. Now we are \n     in Kosovo presiding over reverse ethnic cleansing--surely a \n     case of unintended consequences.\n\n  Joseph S. Nye, Jr., Dean of the Kennedy School of Government, \nrecently posed several thought-provoking questions:\n\n       After the collapse of the Soviet Union, what should be the \n     limits of NATO's mission? With the Kosovo crisis, NATO fired \n     its first shot in anger in a region outside the alliance's \n     treaty area, on declared humanitarian grounds. What criteria \n     might NATO draw on to guide a policy on the threat, or use, \n     of its force in a new strategic environment of the 21st \n     century?\n\n  Some experts predict, and I hope they are not right, that due to the \nugliness of Kosovo, NATO may never again mount another military \noffensive. I fear that Kosovo or future Kosovo-type interventions will \nalso undermine U.N. Security Council credibility. By the way, that \ncredibility is being questioned with the U.N. mission in Africa.\n  Mr. President, if knowing what we know now about the new Strategic \nConcept and NATO with respect to a Kosovo or a Chechnya or Rwanda, \nwould Senators still support the changes?\n  Again, I maintain that most Senators are not aware of all the \nobligations listed in the Strategic Concept. I said it at the time, I \nsaid it 6 months ago, I said it during the first dialog, and I say it \nagain today. How many people need to be placed in jeopardy before we \nact? What criteria do we set for humanitarian or C-list interventions? \nDoes the United States intervene with or without NATO allies or U.N. \nSecurity Council approval on humanitarian grounds? Can we possibly \njustify intervention in some areas of the world and not others when \nnone reach the threshold of  vital or important national interests?\n\n  Our country cannot support militarily a future which pursues U.S. and \nallied interests more widely around the world. The new Strategic \nConcept that our country is currently operating under effectively \nenrolls the United States and NATO as a world policeman.\n  Some say that is not all bad. Some say that is what we must do as the \nworld's only superpower.\n  In this regard, as the distinguished Senator from Georgia pointed \nout, Europe is not standing still. They are proceeding with a Defense \nCapability Initiative and the development of the European Security and \nDefense Identity (ESDI) within the alliance.\n  I believe it is in U.S. interests for the European alliance to \ndevelop their defense capabilities, to strengthen their collective \nwill, and to make a greater contribution to security and defense in \nEurope. However, my Dodge City gut feeling says, sure, go ahead and \nprovide for your own defense, and bring our American men and women \nhome. The Balkans are in your ball park. You decide the players.\n  However, history and military experience, and the experience and \nexpertise of others, rightly point out that challenges with force \nstructure, allocation, balance, interoperability, and the growing gap \nin tactics and capability between our countries underlying the auspices \nof NATO are counterproductive to peace.\n  In Kosovo, the U.S. aircraft flew two-thirds of the strike missions. \nNearly every precision-guided munition was launched from an American \naircraft, and U.S. intelligence identified almost all the targets. With \nthe current European shrinking defense budgets and a reluctance to \nsupport the current mission, the road to ESDI may be a rocky one filled \nwith potholes indeed.\n  Even members of NATO who do not belong to the European Union are \nworried that plans for yet another new E.U. military force could weaken \nthe collective defense.\n  Another concern of hierarchy and command structure with respect to \nESDI, E.U. corps, and NATO still retaining the rights of first refusal \nand how the U.N. Security Council structure fits among the \norganizations is also a very troubling problem to overcome.\n  The number one concern should be to preserve NATO as the overarching \nframework and avoid duplication of effort or any political divisiveness \nfrom establishing separate capabilities. The Kosovo crisis raises \nquestions that must be answered about the alliance's capability to \nreshape itself for new conflicts of the 21st century and at the same \ntime accommodate the E.U.'s ambition to play a greater role in the \ncontinent's security.\n  Mr. President, I also want to address the issue of NATO expansion.\n  I realize the NATO membership is an affair of the heart for many \nnations who aspire to become members. However, as Senator Lugar has \nalluded to we need to step back a little bit and keep the door open but \nput the future enlargement on hold.\n  We had a lunch hosted yesterday by the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana and Gen. Wesley Clark. Gen. Clark emphasized the fact that \nnations in Europe who aspire to become either members of the European \nUnion, Partnership for Peace, or NATO without recognizing the \ntremendous fervor and the tremendous emotion involved in regard to \ntheir self-determination and what they think will be the bulwark for \nthem and their individual liberty.\n  First and foremost, NATO, I think, must rebuild Russian relations, \nwhich were strained over the Kosovo conflict. I know that belief is \nshared by Senator Levin. We have been working together on a cooperative \nthreat reduction program within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services \nCommittee which we believe will make some meaningful threat reduction \nprogress and at the same time help rebuild stressed relations.\n  The London Times diplomatic editor, Christopher Lockwood, reflects \nthat NATO's possible new members at the current time cannot contribute \nmilitarily with force structure, compatible doctrine, or political and \neconomic stability.\n  I have been a strong supporter of NATO. I will remain a strong \nsupporter of NATO. But I think we have to rethink the current NATO \nflightpath and answer the hard questions that require our attention.\n  Mr. President, I now want to offer what I think are extremely \ninsightful approaches to the future of multilateral organizations.\n  Richard Haass expressed:\n\n       Alliances, such as NATO, are one manifestation, although \n     such groupings are rare\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\n     and likely to become even less common in a world of few fixed \n     adversaries. Much more common are informal coalitions of \n     parties able and willing to work together on behalf of a \n     common purpose--be it to rescue the Mexican economy, contain \n     Sadam Hussein, or enter East Timor. Such groupings are not \n     ideal--they are invariably ad hoc and reactive and lack the \n     legitimacy of more formal regional or UN undertakings--but \n     they are consistent with a world where the willingness of \n     governments to cooperate varies from crisis to crisis and \n     situation to situation, where great power consensus in \n     unreliable, and where U.S. resources, however great, are \n     still limited.\n\n  Samuel Huntington, in this book ``The Clash of Civilizations'' \nexplain: ``In the emerging era, clashes of civilizations are the \ngreatest threat to world peace, and an international order based on \ncivilizations is the surest safeguard against war.'' And, since the \nCold War the question of ``Which side are you on?'' has been replaced \nby the much more fundamental one, ``Who are you?'' Every state has to \nhave an answer. That answer, its cultural identify, defines the state's \nplace in world politics, its friends, and its enemies.\n  Mr. Huntington further explains that we must nurture other Western \ncultures that identify with the U.S. and accept our civilization as \nunique not universal and uniting to renew and preserve it against \nchallenges from non-Western societies. Avoidance of a global war of \ncivilizations depends on world leaders accepting and cooperating to \nmaintain the multi civilizational character of global politics.\n  Roberts translation: Why not concentrate in areas of the world where \nWestern values, Western democracy, have been cherished, nurtured, and \nappreciated? At the same time the U.S. needs to stop trying to impose \nWestern values in areas where they are not and will not take root?\n  Andrew Krepinevich from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary \nAssessments recently finished a thought-provoking future vision titled \n``Transforming America's Alliances.'' He believes that America's \nalliances are in need of transformation due to the following reasons: \nRelative decline in U.S. global power, the rise and recovery of great \nregional power, with an increased focus on Asia, the eroding of current \nally durability and reliability, the current military revolution will \nmake power projection more difficult, and finally the growing need to \nprovide for homeland defense.\n\n  Mr. President, I feel Mr. Krepinevich's assessment undertakes bold \nsteps toward the future in his following statement:\n\n       If the U.S. is to preserve the current favorable military \n     balance in regions around the globe in the future, it will \n     find itself increasingly dependent upon allies for support. \n     This may require a somewhat different set of alliances than \n     exist today. Restructuring alliance relationships to meet \n     requirements will take years, perhaps decades. Yet the \n     geopolitical and military revolutions that will likely stress \n     the U.S. alliance relationships should be undertaken now.\n  Mr. President, that is what we are trying to do. That is what Senator \nCleland and I are trying to accomplish with our foreign policy dialog. \nAmerica cannot afford to miss this opportunity to shape the future.\n  I thank my colleague for initiating the third dialog. I especially \nthank my colleagues who have been very patient listening to my remarks. \nSenator Lugar, Senator Levin, and I welcome their input.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator from Indiana yield for 2 minutes?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent, after the Senator from Indiana is \nfinished with his remarks, I be recognized to participate in the dialog \nwhich is going on between Senator Roberts and Senator Cleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia controls the time.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I yield the time necessary to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask the Presiding Officer how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators from Kansas and Georgia are \nsharing the time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. So the time remaining in regard to both Senators is now \n9 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That does not give enough time for the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan or the distinguished Senator from Indiana. I ask \nunanimous consent we be granted an additional 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent, after the Senator from Indiana \nhas completed his statement, I be recognized with whatever time is \navailable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record a letter from me along with one I received \ntoday from Gen. Wesley Clark, who, until last week, was NATO's Supreme \nAllied Commander in Europe and the senior military commander of the \nNATO-led operation at Kosovo. It relates to his views on the Byrd-\nWarner amendment, as it is called, which is part of the military \nconstruction appropriations bill.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       U.S. Senate\n\n\n                                   Committee on Armed Services\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2000.\n     General Wesley K. Clark, USA,\n     Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Clark: Following up on our conversation today, \n     I am enclosing a copy of an amendment adopted by the \n     Appropriations Committee yesterday that, among other things, \n     would terminate funding for deployment of U.S. ground combat \n     troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the President \n     requests and Congress enacts a joint resolution specifically \n     authorizing their continued deployment.\n       I would very much like to have your personal views on this \n     amendment, particularly your views on the impact this \n     amendment could have on U.S. troops currently on the ground \n     in Kosovo and whether or not this amendment would increase \n     the risk to those troops; the impact of this amendment on \n     U.S. interests in the region; and the impact of this \n     amendment on our relationship with our NATO allies.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Minority Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of 10 May and \n     the opportunity to provide my personal views on the amendment \n     adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee governing the \n     future of U.S. troops in Kosovo.\n       While I support efforts of the Congress and the \n     Administration to encourage our allies to fulfill their \n     commitments to the United Nations mission in Kosovo, I am \n     opposed to the specific measures called for in the amendment. \n     These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-\n     out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate \n     the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and \n     their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans.\n       Regional stability and peace in the Balkans are very \n     important interests of the United States. Our allies are \n     already providing over 85 percent of the military forces and \n     the funding for reconstruction efforts. US leadership in \n     Kosovo exercised through the Supreme Allied Commander, \n     Europe, as well as our diplomatic offices, is a bargain. It \n     is an effective 6:1 ratio of diplomatic throw-weight to our \n     investment. We cannot do significantly less. Our allies would \n     see this as a unilateral, adverse move that splits fifty \n     years of shared burdens, shared risks, and shared benefits in \n     NATO.\n       This action will also undermine specific plans and \n     commitments made within the Alliance. At the time that US \n     military and diplomatic personnel are pressing other nations \n     to fulfill and expand their commitment of forces, \n     capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally \n     mandated pullout would undercut their leadership and all \n     parallel diplomatic efforts.\n       All over Europe, nations are looking to the United States. \n     We are their inspiration, their model, and their hope for the \n     future. Small nations, weary of oppression, ravaged by a \n     century of war, looking to the future, look to us. The \n     promise of NATO enlargement, led by the United States, is the \n     promise of the expansion of the sphere of peace and stability \n     from Western Europe eastward. This powerful, stabilizing \n     force would be undercut by this legislation, which would be \n     perceived to significantly curtail US commitment and \n     influence in Europe.\n       Setting a specific deadline for US pull-out would signal to \n     the Albanians the limits of\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\n     the international security guarantees providing for their \n     protection. This, in turn, would give them cause to rearm and \n     prepare to protect themselves from what they would view as an \n     inevitable Serbian reentry. The more radical elements of the \n     Albanian population in Kosovo would be encouraged to increase \n     the level of violence directed against the Serb minority, \n     thereby increasing instability as well as placing US forces \n     on the ground at increased risk. Mr. Milosevic, in \n     anticipation of the pullout and ultimate breakup of KFOR, \n     would likely encourage civil disturbances and authorize the \n     increased infiltration of para-military forces to raise the \n     level of violence. He would also take other actions aimed at \n     preparing the way for Serbian military and police \n     reoccupation of the province.\n       Our servicemen and women, and their families, have made \n     great sacrifices in bringing peace and stability to the \n     Balkans. This amendment introduces uncertainty in the \n     planning and funding of the Kosovo mission. This uncertainly \n     will be undermine our service members' confidence in our \n     resolve and may call into question the sacrifices we have \n     asked of them and their families. A US withdrawal could give \n     Mr. Milosevic the victory he could not achieve on the \n     battlefield.\n       In all of our activities in NATO, the appropriate \n     distribution of burdens and risk remains a longstanding and \n     legitimate issue among the nations. Increased European burden \n     sharing is an imperative in Europe as well as the United \n     States. European nations are endeavoring to meet this \n     challenge in Kosovo, and in the whole KFOR and UNMIK \n     constitute a burdensharing success story, even as we \n     encourage Europeans to do even more. The United States must \n     continue to act in our own best interests. This legislation, \n     if enacted, would see its worthy intent generating \n     consequences adverse to some of our most fundamental security \n     interests.\n       Thank you again for your support of our servicemen and \n     women.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                                  Wesley K. Clark,\n                                               General, U.S. Army.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will take 30 seconds to read two paragraphs about the \nlanguage in the letter from Wesley Clark:\n\n       These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto \n     pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate \n     the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and \n     their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans.\n       Setting a specific deadline for U.S. pull-out would signal \n     to the Albanians the limits of the international security \n     guarantees providing for their protection. This, in turn, \n     would give them cause to rearm and prepare to protect \n     themselves from what they would view as an inevitable Serbian \n     reentry. The more radical elements of the Albanian population \n     in Kosovo would be encouraged to increase the level of \n     violence directed against the Serb minority, thereby \n     increasing instability as well as placing U.S. forces on the \n     ground at increased risk.\n\n  Mr. Milosevic, in anticipation of the pullout and ultimate breakup of \nKFOR, would likely encourage civil disturbances and authorize the \nincreased infiltration of para-military forces to raise the level of \nviolence. He would also take other actions aimed at preparing the way \nfor Serbian military police reoccupation of the province.\n  I know this subject will be a matter of some debate on Monday and \nTuesday. I intend to participate in that debate on the appropriations \nbill containing the Byrd-Warner provision. But at this time, because of \nthe interest in the letter of General Clark, I thought I would ask that \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Indiana for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from \nGeorgia and Kansas. It is a privilege to follow on some of the thoughts \nof the distinguished Senator from Kansas, as he has discussed \nmultilateral organizations and focused especially on NATO which, in the \njudgment of many of us, is the most important and successful of these \norganizations in which the United States is a member.\n  It is axiomatic, at least for many in foreign policy, that Europe \ncounts for the United States. By that I mean simply this: that although \nthroughout our history many have argued that we could get along by \nourselves on this continent and that entanglement in the affairs of \nEurope was often described as nefarious skullduggery statesmanship \nwithout scruple, that eventually we come back to the fact that in the \nsmall world in which we live now, what happens on that continent \nmatters a great deal to our security and to our prosperity.\n  It is for this reason that the United States stayed in Europe after \nWorld War II. To state it very simply, as German Foreign Minister \nFischer stated when he visited with our Foreign Relations Committee \nthis week: The United States presence, the decision to stay, made all \nthe difference in the last half century. It made a difference in terms \nof peace on the Europe continent, which had not had such an era of \npeace in a whole millennium.\n  It made a very great difference for us, the United States, leaving \naside NATO and the security it provided, because of the collective \ndefense of NATO members against the perceived menace of the former \nSoviet Union and its allies. The fact is that through the Marshall \nPlan, and through many other economic associations, the European \ncountries grew substantially and so did our markets and so did our \nprosperity. We tend to take this all for granted, but only in the last \n50 years has this been a fact.\n  We came to a point after the breakup of the former Soviet Union in \nwhich many argued, and I was not the one who originated the term, but I \nadopted it in a tour I took of Europe in 1993, that either NATO would \ngo ``out of area or out of business.'' By that I meant simply that the \nidea of collective defense against the former Soviet Union, which had \nbroken up, made much less sense than it had made before. Some would \nhave said the Soviet Union might revive suddenly and attack hapless \nEuropean nations, but this became less and less likely. In fact, we \nfound in the Desert Storm war, that our problem was that NATO was not \nequipped to deal with conflicts out of area. It was a pickup game in \nwhich we enlisted various nations.\n  This out of area action had been contemplated at the time of the \nUnited Nations Charter in Article 4, which Senator Roberts has cited. \nJohn Foster Dulles spoke openly and eloquently on that point. It was \nanticipated that NATO members from time to time would act out of area \nin their collective efforts and for collective security. So we did that \nin Desert Storm and the idea was always, from the time of the United \nNations Charter and the NATO Charter onward, that nations could freely \ndecide to join in such actions. In the case of Desert Storm they did \nso.\n  Now that a whole new set of facts began to come forward, in which \nthere were countries--Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and others--\nbut mainly the first three--in which the point was made: We are a \ndemocracy. We are searching for freedom. We are searching for relevance \nand association with others who want freedom as we do.\n  Some argued the evolution of Europe might have come entirely through \nthe European Union, through the economic union of the members. But most \nof us noted that was going very slowly. It still goes slowly. Poland is \nnot a member of the European Union as we speak, and it is not \ncontemplated that it will be for several years. This is now a very \nlarge country with a functioning  economy and a democracy.\n\n  The point was that collective security meant making certain that the \ngains, the victories of the cold war, were ensured and were solidified. \nThat was the debate that we had a short time ago with regard to \nexpansion of NATO. Some argued: Why expand if there is no particular \nthreat? Why not wait and see how the threat shapes up? You can always \ntake on new members in the event things are troubled.\n  But many argued, and I was one, that the integration of forces, the \nbuilding of institutions, takes time. Even in the successful war we \nfought in the desert, the weapons systems that were employed took 25 \nyears to evolve. It is very probable that the strengths we are now \nbuilding with new members in Europe, in NATO, will make a difference in \nterms of their collective security, and I believe in ours. With the \ncrisis over, many persons in the United States and maybe in this body, \ntend to ask: Why are we involved in Europe? In fact, why can't \nEuropeans run their own affairs? They say it is a troublesome situation \nto have our forces involved there, meddling and in harm's way.\n  We went through this in a very practical way with regard to the war \nin Bosnia. As you may recall, in the latter stages of the Bush \nadministration,\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\nthere was anxiety on the part of President Bush as to what was \nhappening in the former Yugoslavia. He was strongly advised by European \nleaders that they knew better what was happening there, that our \ninvolvement was really not particularly welcomed. President Bush may \nhave welcomed that advice, for all I know. But in any event, his \ndetermination was to leave that problem alone, so the conflict \ncontinued to progress badly in terms of the loss of life and \ndisplacement of persons and refugees and so forth.\n  President Clinton attacked former President Bush in the 1992 campaign \nfor failing to have a plan for Bosnia. But when President Clinton came \ninto office in 1993 he found out how difficult that situation was.\n  I know from my own experience, traveling with Senator Nunn in 1993, \ntalking on the phone with President Clinton over long distance as he \nasked what we were finding out and how things were going? He was \nattempting to evolve a policy.\n  He sent Secretary Christopher to Europe about that time, a trip which \nwas very unsuccessful. The Secretary talked with the British and then \nthe French and gave our views and asked their views. They had all sorts \nof views, all of them contradictory, and none of them helpful with \nregard to anything we had in mind.\n  As a result, things drifted. Some may say that was simply too bad. \nHere are people with intractable views, demagogs. Whatever was \nhappening in Yugoslavia was miserable and unfortunate for those people, \nand especially for their neighbors, our European allies. But that was \ntheir problem--and perhaps it was. But late in the game, Europeans came \nto us and said: We cannot solve it. It is insoluble without the United \nStates.\n  We might have said, ``Tough luck. You are on your own. This is what \nyou wanted. You made your bed, now sleep in it.''\n  We could have said that. We could have watched the unraveling of \nvarious parts of Europe as refugees and economic difficulties and \naggression proceeded. But we took a different view--I think the correct \nview--namely, we are the leaders in NATO. NATO was relevant to that \nsituation.\n  That was a big step but not all Senators agreed. The point being made \nin the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia and the distinguished Senator from Virginia is that we have \nnot gone to war very often. We have declared war even less. It is time \nto stop these informal arrangements in which we get involved in \noperations without having an up-or-down vote or authorization to spend \nmoney or send the troops.\n  That is a good point. I can remember arguing before the Desert Storm \nwar that we ought to do that, and there was great anxiety in the White \nHouse about any such vote for fear it might come out badly that Saddam \nHussein, therefore, would have a free ride. Ultimately, the vote was \nvery close.\n  I understand the constitutional point very well. It could very well \nbe that historians will argue we misplayed our hand at Rambouillet, \nthat our diplomacy was not as swift as it should have been, that we \nmade threats when we did not understand the military power that would \nbe necessary to make those threats good, and that even having made the \nthreats, we did not have a very good plan once we were tested. I make \nno apologies for any of what proceeded, but the point is, we finally \ncome back to the fact we are in Europe because it is our security--our \nsecurity--that is at stake. It could be argued, too, that for the \nmoment the Europeans are not sharing the burden, although they would \nargue, by this time, that they are shouldering their burden--but that \nis another debate all by itself. Or they might argue we should not be \ninvolved without having up-or-down votes in the Congress on these \nthings in any event, or that many Americans believe we are in Kosovo or \nin Bosnia purely for humanitarian purposes, not for gut strategic \npurposes of the United States, but because of ethnic cleansing or \nrefugees or displaced persons.\n  The case will be made that this is not a real war, this is a policing \naction; it is a structural problem, like that faced by a mayor of a \ncity or police or other situations analogous that can be handled by \npolice, and European policemen rather than American policemen.\n  We keep coming back to this haunting question that President George \nBush had to face and then President Bill Clinton when the Europeans \nsaid: We cannot make it by ourselves. Ultimately, Europeans might say: \nWe can; we are different now; we have new institutions--whether they be \nsecurity or economic--and you Americans can go home; we can get along \nwithout you; it's been nice to have you around.\n  That is not what they are saying. As a matter of fact, every European \nstatesman who comes to Washington--and the Chair presides over these \ncoffees in our Foreign Relations Committee--we hear every single \nforeign minister and defense minister vowing how important it is the \nUnited States is there, stays there, stays there big, how we must take \nthe lead and help organize the situation. We may say in our impatience: \nWill they never be able to pull it together? Perhaps not in our \nlifetime.\n  What are the consequences if we leave? The consequence is the same \none the German foreign minister told us this week. We left after the \nFirst World War. As a matter of fact, throughout the 1930s, we were not \nonly isolationists, we were glad we were not close to the action, and \nwe suffered for that. We lost a lot of lives. We had a war around the \nworld that was touch and go for some time because we were not prepared \nto do the difficult work, the tedious work, the actual intervention day \nby day, the grimy, grubby work of diplomacy country by country, case by \ncase. That is the problem.\n  Duty in Kosovo, duty in Bosnia is not a popular assignment for \nanybody and never will be. I can think of various other places in \nEurope in which it is not going to be very pleasant. Yet to keep the \npeace for over 50 years, to have prosperity for them and for us, to \nmake a difference in terms of stability of the world, that counts for \nsomething.\n  On the cheap, we can say, by and large, we did not vote for it, we \nare tired of paying too much for it. Europeans understand that a little \nbit, and I give credit to the distinguished Senator from Virginia for \ntrying to urge them to step up to the plate, and they have now \ndemonstrated they are paying more than 85 percent--the lion's share--\nwhether it is the policing side or the economic side, and that we are \npaying 15 percent, and that is about what we  agreed to do.\n\n  They said, in essence: You fought most of the war, we will pick up \nfive-sixths of the cost. That may or may not be a good agreement, but \nthat is roughly where we have come to in Kosovo. We could say we are \ntired of paying the 15 percent and, as a matter of fact, our 5,000 or \n6,000 troops are tired of being there and, as a Senate, we are tired of \ndebating the issue. We would just like to get a vote on this and get \nrid of it cleanly. Tell the President, whoever he is, where to go in \nthis situation. It makes no difference whether we have a Secretary of \nState negotiating over there or not, we know better because we \nrepresent the people and we have the power of the purse and we can jerk \nthis thing out immediately.\n  Some will argue whether or not to do that as a matter of fact. The \nvote would not come for a year. General Clark has testified to this in \nthe letter the distinguished Senator from Michigan just read, that \nother countries will make their own calculations. We, frankly, do not \nknow what the foreign policy of President Putin of Russia will be. We \nsuspect, as a matter of fact, as we have heard from the Russian \nAmbassador and from others that the Russians want a zone in Kosovo, \nmaybe ours. Let's say we withdraw and the Russians say: It would be \nfine, as a matter of fact, if we were there because we could help \nintegrate the Serbs as they want to come back to their homes, or help \nwith a little bridge there; that would be a good thing in terms of \nintegration of Europe as we see it; and we are here as Russians; the \nAmericans have gone home; they were tired of this, tired of the \npolicing action and all the burdens, all the difficulties. That is one \npossibility.\n  President Milosevic might say: Let's be at ease for a year, wait it \nout. Kosovo was sort of a contretemps, a bad nightmare. A good many \nbombs were dropped around the country, there was some difficulties with \nthe power stations and difficulties in terms of\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\ndeprivation, but, by and large, that is in the past, and in a year's \ntime, we can be home free. We can begin to operate business as usual.\n  The Albanians noting the situation likewise say: We have a year to \nprepare for the war to take on the Serbs who are back with perhaps the \nhelp of Russian friends and others who come in to fill this vacuum.\n  European allies will be accused frequently of withdrawing people from \nthe country. They will say, by and large, the Americans are a strange \nleader; they are gone. This is the only war NATO ever fought and some \nmay feel the only one it ever will fight because there was not very \nmuch leadership here, not much standing to talk to us about whether we \nhave an independent force, whether it is with NATO or anybody else.\n  We have a very fateful vote coming up, and it comes right to the \npoint we are discussing today: multinational organizations and \nparticularly NATO, the most important security alliance, because Europe \ncounts.\n  I suggest we do reaffirm NATO.\n  As a matter of fact, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas pointed \nout, I suggested last year at the NATO celebration that we consider \ncarefully new members. There were nine applicants. I say it is \nimperative that we keep hope alive for all nine. That is the incentive \nfor their reform and for the courage to continue on.\n  As a matter of fact, I hope we will move to adopt new members. I hope \nwe will offer leadership to fill out much more substantially those who \nhave fought for freedom, those who have a lot at stake in the kind of \nEurope we think would be more secure for them and for us.\n  I think we ought to be devoting more resources to NATO rather than \nless. It seems to me we have a golden opportunity. Historically, we \nhave been established there for a long time. To abandon or weaken NATO \nat this point, or to give hints we are going to abandon it, or to give \nhints that it can be taken for granted, would be an unfortunate policy.\n  By the same token, this debate gives us an opportunity to finally \nestablish, once and for all the question: Does Europe count? Do we \ncare? Can Europe make it without us? I believe it counts. I do not \nthink they can make it without us. I think we have to be there. And if \nwe are going to be there, we ought to lead, and we ought to have the \nresources that make it count. We ought to expand the operation, as a \nmatter of fact. We ought to be assertive and bold as opposed to timidly \npulling back into our tent.\n  I believe that is what the debate ought to be about. It ought to be \nabout the strength of the very best multinational organization we have, \nabout the reasons our allies are important to us, and what we intend to \ndo about it.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to give this address.\n  I thank the distinguished Senators from Georgia and Kansas, again, \nfor inviting me to be a part of the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. How much time is left on our time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks with \nsome additional thoughts and comments.\n  I thank Senator Lugar, a distinguished student and practitioner of \nforeign policy in this body for many years, and the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and thank him for his wonderful \nletter from General Clark, who is a man with whom I have shared a meal \nrecently and discussed Kosovo and many other matters. He is a \ndistinguished American. I respect him highly.\n  I thank my distinguished colleague from Kansas. One of the things \nthat impressed me was the point the Senator from Kansas mentioned, that \nthis country is committed and obligated in some form or fashion to 90 \ndifferent treaties or organizations, and that is indeed quite an \nastounding number.\n  I have two basic fears about America's global role. One is that, like \nGulliver, we will get wrapped up in many lilliputian events and \ntreaties and entanglements and not be free to move to crises in the \nworld where we need to have a maximum impact; secondly, that we get \ndrawn into power vacuums around the world, particularly in the wake of \nthe fall of the Soviet Union, and institute a pax Americana.\n  I was recently in Macedonia. As the helicopter took off, headed \ntoward Kosovo, an Army colonel pointed out that if you looked out of \nthe helicopter to your left, you could see a Roman aqueduct. I had \nnever really been in that part of the world. It was amazing to actually \nsee a Roman aqueduct put together by the Roman armies there in \nMacedonia over 2,000 years ago and it still be intact.\n  I began to think the very ground over which I was flying had been \noccupied by not only Alexander the Great but his father Philip, and \nthat Greek and Roman armies had gone over this very terrain. Later, \nafter the Dark Ages, for some 600 years the Turks and the Ottoman \nEmpire occupied this particular land. Now we, the Americans, were \nthere.\n  It was a sobering moment for me. I wondered exactly how effective we \ncould really be in that part of the world with those conflicts which \nseem to be eternal. I wondered exactly what we could do there, what we \ncould contribute, especially with our military force.\n  Those are some thoughts I have.\n  I would like to address one other issue in terms of our multilateral \nand multinational relations, and that is our relationship with the \nUnited Nations.\n  In large part because of American support, the UN was founded in 1945 \nwith the purpose, according to its Charter:\n\n       To maintain international peace and security, and to that \n     end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention \n     and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression \n     of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to \n     bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the \n     principles of justice and international law, adjustment or \n     settlement of international disputes or situations which \n     might lead to a breach of the peace.\n\n  Furthermore, under Article 34 of the U.N. Charter, U.N. ``members \nconfer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the \nmaintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in \ncarrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council \nacts on their behalf.'' And Article 52 provides that:\n\n       Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of \n     regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such \n     matters relating to the maintenance of international peace \n     and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided \n     that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are \n     consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United \n     Nations.\n\n  In recent years, the United States has worked with, and sometimes \nwithout, the cooperation of the U.N. Security Council when seeking to \naccomplish its objectives. Despite all the difficulties associated with \nit, the Security Council remains the only widely accepted, \nmultinational, legitimizing force for conducting military operations \nagainst a sovereign nation. In the 1995 book, ``Beyond Westphalia,'' \neditors Gene Lyons, Michael Mustanduno and their colleagues tackled the \ndifficult question of ``state sovereignty and international \nintervention.'' The authors write that:\n\n       A historical transition was marked by the settlement of \n     Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War and \n     opened the quest-- which goes on to this day-- to find a way \n     for independent states, each enjoying sovereignty over a \n     given territory, to pursue their interests without destroying \n     each other or the international system of which each is a \n     part.\n\n  One of the recurring themes which has been highlighted in these floor \ndialogues organized by Senator Roberts and myself about the global role \nof the United States in the post-Cold War world is on this very \nquestion of sovereignty. More specifically, under what conditions is it \npermissible and appropriate for a nation or coalition of nations to \nintervene in the internal affairs of another sovereign state?\n\n  In an April 1999 speech in Chicago, British Prime Minister Blair \nposed the question in a way which is representative of the concerns of \nmany of those--especially in the Western democracies--who believe that, \nunder certain egregious circumstances, there must be limits on national \nsovereignty in today's world. Prime Minister Blair said:\n\n       The most pressing foreign policy problem we face is to \n     identify the circumstances in\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n     which we should get actively involved in other people's \n     conflicts. Non-interference has long been considered an \n     important principle of international order. And it is not one \n     we would want to jettison too readily. One state should not \n     feel it has the right to change the political system of \n     another or foment subversion or seize pieces of territory to \n     which it feels it should have some claim. But the principle \n     of non-interference must be qualified in important respects. \n     Acts of genocide can never be a purely internal matter. When \n     oppression produces massive flows of refugees which unsettle \n     neighboring countries then they can properly be described as \n     ``threats to international peace and security.''\n\n  It is interesting that on that same day in 1999, Brazilian President \nFernando Henrique Cardoso offered some related observations, with his \nviews on the Kosovo War, which he and his country supported. President \nCardoso's views reflect the concerns of many of those in the developing \nworld who worry about the consequences of a loss of sovereignty in \nreducing their ability to control their own destiny.\n  We heard Senator Roberts talk about the fear of the United States and \nits growing hegemony or being a great hegemony in various portions of \nthe world, or being the ``big dog.''\n  President Cardoso said this:\n\n       Who has the authority and approval of the international \n     community to drop bombs? Such attacks are not endorsed by an \n     international organization that legalized such actions. The \n     United Nations was left aside . . . The United States \n     currently constitutes the only large center of political, \n     economic, technologic, and even cultural power. This country \n     has everything to exert its domain on the rest of the world, \n     but it must share it. There must be rules, even for the \n     stronger ones. When the strongest one makes decisions without \n     listening, everything becomes a bit more difficult. In \n     this European war, NATO made the decision, but who \n     legalized it? That is the main problem. I am convinced \n     more than ever that we need a new political order in the \n     world.\n\n  How do we reconcile these different and sometimes conflicting, yet \nboth legitimate, concerns: the need on the one hand to protect \npowerless individuals from the depredations of their own governments, \nand on the other to protect less powerful nations from unilateral or \neven multilateral decisions by the stronger powers?\n  Mr. President, in the last dialog, I tried to quote President \nKennedy. I think I got the quote wrong. I think he said that ``we must \ndream of a world in which the strong are just, the weak secure, and the \npeace preserved.'' I think that is what President Cardoso was after.\n  The editors of Beyond Westphalia draw four principal conclusions \nwhich bear on this matter. The first two offer encouragement to those \nwho see a clear need for constraints on unfettered sovereignty, \nespecially in cases of massive human rights violations:\n\n       First, constraints on state sovereignty not only have a \n     long history but have been increasing significantly in recent \n     years as a consequence of both growing interdependence and \n     the end of the cold war . . . (Second), while constraints on \n     state sovereignty traditionally were largely constraints on \n     states' behavior with regard to other states, in recent \n     decades constraints on sovereignty have increasingly involved \n     the internal affairs of states, or how governments relate to \n     their own citizens, economies, and territories.\n\n  However, the current limits on international interventions are \ncaptured in the final two observations:\n\n       (Third), the international community has developed a \n     formidable institutional presence, yet clearly lacks the \n     resources and organizational capacity to serve as a viable \n     alternative to the society of sovereign states . . . \n     (Fourth), the legitimacy of the international community will \n     continue to be questionable as long as there are fundamental \n     differences between North and South with regard to whose \n     values and interests the international community represents . \n     . . If the major powers claim to be acting, through the \n     exercise of their international decisionmaking authority, as \n     the guardians of the common good, less powerful states \n     seem to want to know, who is guarding the guardians?\n\n  Lyons and Mastanduno conclude that we are likely to experience an \nongoing ``chipping away'' at the sovereign autonomy of nations. \nHowever, they end with the following cautionary note:\n\n       The idea of state sovereignty is alive and well among both \n     the more powerful and less powerful members of contemporary \n     international society. Even if states increasingly share \n     authority with intergovernmental and nongovernmental \n     organizations, the state system endures.\n\n  So where does that leave us? For the isolationists and the \nunilateralists, the question of international intervention is, of \ncourse, not important for they believe that the United States should \nnot, or need not, rely on other nations or the international community \nin advancing our security interests. However, as I have said in the \nfirst two of these dialogues, I do not believe the people of our \ncountry are prepared now, or in the foreseeable future, to pay the \nsubstantial--albeit quite different--costs arising out of either the \nisolationists' or the unilateralists' agendas.\n  For everyone else, including balance of power realists, Wilsonian \nidealists and everyone in between, they have to face the dilemma of \nbalancing the reality of the continuing dominance of the nation state \nas the key player in international security affairs with the increasing \ntransnational communications, economic forces, and values which are \ncircumscribing national sovereignty.\n  In my opinion, we have no choice but to try to improve the \ninternational machinery for legitimating and, in some circumstances \nconducting, interventions in extreme cases where a nation's actions \nwithin its own borders necessitate such a response. To do otherwise \nwould be to ignore the trends noted by Lyons and Mastanduno in 1995 and \nwhich have certainly considered apace since then. And whatever its \nshortcomings, and they are many, it is clear that the international \nmachinery of choice, for the United States as well as for most of the \nworld, and recognized in solemn commitments--for example including \nNATO's own charter--is the United Nations and more particularly its \nSecurity Council.\n  But it is equally clear that the UN's machinery is not now capable of \nfulfilling this role assigned to it by the international community. The \nsad current events in Sierra Leone, and previously in Bosnia, in \nRwanda, in Angola, and in Somalia demonstrate convincingly that the UN \ncannot enforce the will of the international community unless all local \nparties accept its intervention. In other words, it can enforce an \nexisting peace but cannot make peace.\n  And in the absence of an effective United Nations, I say to the \nadvocates of humanitarian intervention, we have to proceed with great \ncaution. Furthermore, while various Western leaders and theorists have \nproposed standards to determine when and how national sovereignty \nshould be overridden, such standards are neither comprehensive, nor \nclear, nor widely accepted.\n  Though I do not oppose the notion of international intervention in \nprinciple--because as I said before various global trends are moving us \nin that direction--in my opinion much will have to be done before we \ncan or should stake important national interests on it. Among the steps \nwhich must be undertaken are:\n\n  Reforming the peacekeeping operations and decision-making processes \nwithin the UN and the Security Council.\n  Strengthening the capabilities of regional organizations, like the \nOrganization for African Unity, the Organization of American States, \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations--and as I suggested earlier \nthe European Union-- to deal with regional threats to international \norder.\n  Thoroughly debating--including in this body--the proposed frameworks \nfor intervention put forward by the Clinton Administration, the British \ngovernment, and others.\n  None of these steps will be easy. For example, reforming the \ndecision-making processes of the Security Council in a way that \nimproves its ability to act would presumably involve curtailing the \nveto power of the permanent members. However, while such a change would \neliminate or reduce the ability of China or Russia to block what we \nview as appropriate interventions, it would also similarly constrain \nour own capacity to prevent what we view as undesirable actions by the \nUN. Strengthening the capabilities of regional entities raises resource \nquestions, and, as already discussed, developing a serious European \ndefense capability raises a number of additional concerns. And \ndeveloping any sort of meaningful consensus about the principles for \ninternational interventions even among NATO members--let alone among \nboth developed and developing countries--will be an extremely long\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nand difficult process. But for anyone who can conceive of circumstances \nwhere an international response will be in our national interest, it is \nthe type of effort we will have to undertake.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks in this, our third session \non the US Global Role. Our next discussion will hopefully take place \nduring the week of May 22, and in many ways is at the heart of the \nconcerns which motivated both me and Senator Roberts to initiate these \ndialogs: the central question of when and how to employ American \nmilitary forces abroad. I look forward to that debate--which will \nappropriately occur just before the Memorial Day break-- and I hope \nother Senators will participate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3904-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3904-S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MULTILATERAL ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Cleland and \nSenator Roberts for instituting this bipartisan dialogue relating to \nthe global role of the United States. We normally only discuss these \nissues when a real-world contingency is looming and we do so under \nsignificant time constraints and within the dynamic of rapidly \nunfolding crises. This dialogue, which allows us to discuss these \nissues in a better setting, will hopefully contribute in a better \nunderstanding of the various perspectives on these issues and may bring \nus closer to a consensus on the fundamental issue of the global role of \nthe United States.\n  This week's subject--``Multilateral Organizations''--is a very broad \narea. I will confine my remarks to those multilateral organizations \nthat have responsibilities relating to the maintenance of international \npeace and security. I have in mind organizations like the United \nNations, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union, \nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the mutual \ndefense treaties to which the United States is a party.\n  I would like to briefly discuss several recent international crises \nand the role that the various multilateral organizations played in \naddressing those crises. I want to note, at the outset, that sometimes \nthey were successful and sometimes they failed.\n  Mr. President, I don't know how many of my colleagues have ever been \nto Dubrovnik. It is an ancient and breathtakingly beautiful seaside \ncity on Croatia's Dalmatian coast. When the Yugoslav Army subjected \nDubrovnik to indiscriminate shelling in October 1991, resulting in the \nsystematic destruction in the old city and the loss of many civilian \nlives, the European Union or the Western European Union should have \nused force to end this barbarity in their own backyard. If they had, \nthe ensuing damage and loss of life throughout the Balkans might have \nbeen avoided. Instead of acting with force, however, the European Union \ndeclined to take any forceful action. For its part, the UN Security \nCouncil imposed an international embargo on the supply of arms to the \ncombatants, thus succeeding in locking in the advantage that the \nYugoslav Army enjoyed. It doesn't appear that NATO even considered \ntaking action at that stage of the Balkan conflict. This was an example \nof the inability or unwillingness of the United Nations, the European \nUnion, NATO and other multilateral organizations to effectively deal \nwith a real-world crisis that had the potential of spreading.\n  It should be noted that NATO has substantial forces under its command \nbut the United Nations does not have a standing UN army, nor, in my \nview, should it. The United Nations is dependent upon the political \nwill of its members to supply the forces and the financial resources to \ntake action. It is ironic that politicians of all nations feel free to \ncriticize the United Nations for failing to successfully carry out its \nmissions but the reality is that any failure of the United Nations is a \nfailure of the UN member nations to provide the UN with the necessary \nmeans for its missions. We can't have it both ways--we can't refuse to \nprovide the UN with the necessary means to do its job and then hammer \nthe UN for its failings.\n  UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, in commenting upon a December 1999 \nReport of an Independent Inquiry that he commissioned and that \ndocumented the UN failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda and on his own \nearlier report on the UN's failure to safeguard Srebrenica, stated that \n``Of all my aims as Secretary General, there is none to which I feel \nmore deeply committed than that of enabling the United Nations never \nagain to fail in protecting a civilian population from genocide or mass \nslaughter.''\n  Mr. President, I welcome Secretary General Kofi Annan's statement, \nbut I recognize the reality that the UN's ability to take effective \naction in the future--even to prevent genocide--remains dependent upon \nthe political will of UN member nations to provide the UN with the \nforces and the financial resources it needs.\n  Mr. President, just as the United Nations has learned some hard \nlessons in places like Rwanda and Srebrenica, so the United States \nlearned a hard lesson in Somalia, where we lost 18 of our finest \nsoldiers in a single engagement.\n  In response to the need for an effective peacekeeping capability in \nAfrica, the United States, Britain and France are embarked on parallel \nand coordinated programs to enhance the capabilities of African \ncountries to carry out humanitarian and peacekeeping operations in \nAfrica. The United States program, called the African Crisis Response \nInitiative or ACRI, has trained over 6,000 peacekeepers from the \nAfrican nations of Benin, Ghana, Malawi, Mali, Uganda, and Senegal. The \nACRI program, whose program of instruction has been approved by the UN \nDepartment of Peacekeeping, also promotes professional apolitical \nmilitaries and reinforces respect for human rights and the proper role \nof a military in a democracy.\n  Mr. President, while most people only associate the UN with \npeacekeeping or peace enforcement missions, there are other actions \nthat it has undertaken. In December 1992, the UN Security Council, at \nthe request of the Government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of \nMacedonia, established a preventive deployment mission in Macedonia in \nan effort to prevent the Balkan conflict from spreading into that \nnation. Originally composed of a Nordic battalion, it was augmented by \na U.S. Army contingent in July 1993. The conflict did not spread to \nMacedonia, perhaps because of this mission. It was the first deployment \nof an international force prior to an initiation of hostilities.\n  The crisis in Kosovo also produced unprecedented actions by several \nmultilateral organizations. In 1998, amidst mounting repression of the \nethnic Albanian population by the Yugoslav Army and special police, \nYugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reached an agreement with U.S. \nenvoy Dick Holbrooke to comply with UN demands for a cease-fire and to \naccept an intrusive verification regime of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Involving approximately \n2,000 unarmed personnel, this was the largest, most complex and \npotentially most dangerous mission ever undertaken by the OSCE. \nAdditionally, NATO deployed an Extraction Force to neighboring \nMacedonia that was poised to come to the assistance of the OSCE \npersonnel if they came under attack. While the OSCE mission was not \nable to prevent all armed attacks, particularly the mass killing of \nethnic Albanians in Racak in January 1999, it did enable international \nhumanitarian relief organizations to provide direly needed assistance \nto the Kosovar population until forced to withdraw on March 20, 1999 in \nthe face of an untenable situation, including additional large-scale \ndeployments of Milosevic's military, special police and paramilitary \nforces into Kosovo.\n\n  By the time of the OSCE's withdrawal from Kosovo, repression of the \nethnic-Albanian population of Kosovo escalated to a full-scale attempt \nto ethnically cleanse Kosovo. Unfortunately, the UN Security Council \nwas unable to act as both Russia and China signaled that they would \nveto any resolution authorizing the use of force against the security \nforces of Slobodan\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\nMilosevic. Despite the lack of international legitimation that a UN \nSecurity Council authorization would have provided, NATO was resolute \nand launched a 78-day air campaign that forced Slobodan Milosevic to \naccede to NATO's demands. This was the first time in its fifty-year \nhistory that NATO had embarked on a large-scale combat operation. \nFollowing the air campaign, the UN Security Council established a UN \nmission to administer Kosovo and authorized an international armed \nforce under NATO leadership to provide a secure environment. And for \nthe first time in the 20th Century, ethnic cleansing in Europe was \nreversed. The United States bore the major burden in NATO's air \ncampaign but the European Union pledged to bear the major share of the \nreconstruction effort and has provided most of the peacekeeping forces \nfor Kosovo. I welcome the fact that the United States is playing a \njunior role in the peacekeeping effort with only about 15 percent of \nthe troops, and I also welcome our European NATO allies' expressed \ndetermination to play a more substantial role in future conflicts in \nEurope, either as part of a NATO or a European Union-led effort.\n  Additionally, in a departure from the normal UN practice, the UN \nMission in Kosovo or UNMIK has been organized into four pillars, under \nthe overall supervision of the UNMIK head, Dr. Kouchner. Those four \npillars are: civil administration under the United Nations itself; \nhumanitarian assistance, led by the Office of the UN High Commissioner \nfor Refugees; democratization and institution-building, led by the \nOSCE; and economic reconstruction, managed by the EU.\n  Despite the fact that our NATO allies would have borne the effects of \na massive flow of ethnic-Albanian Kosovars, regional instability, and \nthe potential involvement of two of its member nations--Greece and \nTurkey--on opposite sides of the conflict, no individual European \nnation had the military or political wherewithal to use force against \nSerbia to end its barbarous acts. I doubt that a coalition of European \nnations could have done so. Although the United States had the military \ncapability to carry out such an operation, as Secretary Cohen and \nGeneral Shelton noted in their joint statement to the Armed Services \nCommittee, ``Operation Allied Force could not have been conducted \nwithout the NATO Alliance and without the infrastructure, transit and \nbasing access, host-nation force contributions, and most importantly, \npolitical and diplomatic support provided by the allies and other \nmembers of the coalition.''\n  Mr. President, much has been said and written about NATO's use of \nless than overwhelming, decisive force in the air campaign against the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia. NATO's capability was limited to what I \ncall ``maximum achievable force,'' i.e., the maximum force that is \npolitically achievable and sustainable. As General Wes Clark, NATO's \nSupreme Allied Commander during the air campaign, testified in response \nto my use of the concept ``maximum achievable force''.\n  ``We knew we had to avoid collateral damage, keep the allies \ntogether, do the most we could against the targets on the ground, and \navoid the loss of air crews. We had to keep it in balance. It was, as \nyou put it, a maximum achievable force strategy.''\n  An Alliance goes to war differently than an individual nation does. \nThe United States clearly would have carried out the air campaign more \nrobustly from the outset if we had been acting unilaterally.\n  Overwhelming, decisive force undoubtedly is the first and most \npreferred option for the United States in any military operation. That \nis the lesson of Vietnam. But if it is not possible, as it will rarely \nbe when a coalition is considering action, then the next option is to \nuse the maximum achievable force in an alliance setting. The question \nthen becomes whether the greater risks entailed in using less than \noverwhelming, decisive force are worth taking.\n  If the participation of the whole NATO Alliance was both critical to \nthe success of the military operation against Milosevic and the only \npolitically achievable option, were we wise to proceed? If so, does \nthis mean that we should automatically resign ourselves to using less \nthan overwhelming, decisive force in any future conflict?\n  The answer is we should not resign ourselves to the use of less than \noverwhelming divisive force. But there will be times when because we \ncan achieve an alliance action with maximum achievable force that it \nwill be worth the risk, and there will be times when it will not.\n  An overwhelming, decisive force strategy is best when U.S. forces are \ninvolved in hostilities. In the case of Kosovo, our NATO allies were \nunwilling to adopt such a strategy. Our remaining options were to do \nnothing, to go it alone, or to use a maximum achievable force strategy, \nwhich meant a phased air campaign and no ground forces.\n  In my view, while there were drawbacks to going to war in Kosovo as \npart of a coalition, the benefits of fighting as part of the NATO \ncoalition, under all the circumstances, outweighed those drawbacks. \nNapoleon said it well: ``The only thing worse than fighting in a \ncoalition is fighting against one.''\n  If the use of overwhelming, decisive force is also not an option in \nsome future conflict, we will once again have to make the judgment \nwhether the risk involved in utilizing maximum achievable force, i.e. \nless than overwhelming, decisive force, outweighs the risk to U.S. \ninterests of not proceeding.\n  Meanwhile across the globe in East Timor, the international community \nreacted in horror at the death and destruction wrought by pro-\nIndonesian militias in the aftermath of a referendum that \noverwhelmingly favored independence from Indonesia. The UN Security \nCouncil authorized a multinational force to restore peace and security \nin East Timor. Australia took the lead in this peace enforcement \nmission and the United States provided support but did not provide any \nground combat forces. As Admiral Blair, Commander in Chief of the \nPacific Command, put it in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee, ``East Timor demonstrated the value of having the U.S. in a \nsupporting role to a competent ally, providing unique and significant \ncapabilities needed to ensure success without stretching the capability \nof U.S. forces and resources to conduct other operations worldwide.''\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot be the world's policeman. But \nwe also cannot withdraw to fortress America and seek to ignore what \ngoes on in the rest of the world. The United States possesses \nunparalleled economic and military strength. But no nation--no matter \nhow strong--can go it alone. Understanding this, our forebears formed \nalliances many years ago throughout the globe. Our collective defense \ntreaties with the other 18 nations of the NATO Alliance and with \ncountries like Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and the Republic of \nKorea are major contributors to the protection of our national security \ninterests. Our status as one of the five permanent members of the UN \nSecurity Council, with veto power, also enables us to ensure that the \nactions of the Security Council are consistent with our national \nsecurity interests. Our Alliances and our participation in the United \nNations and other multilateral organizations also help to ensure that \nthere is a shared responsibility for maintaining international peace \nand security. The UN's authorization and approval of a mission adds \ngreat universal political support to the undertaking.\n  None of these organizations I have described are perfect and none of \nthem will succeed in maintaining the peace if their Member nations lack \nthe political will to provide the military forces, the financial \nresources, and, increasingly, the police forces to carry out the \nmissions that are undertaken.\n  Mr. President, I realize that Senators Cleland, Roberts and others \ntalked about the security interests of the United States in a prior \nweek. I don't plan to comment at length on that subject today, but I do \nbelieve that it is necessary to touch on it with respect to \nmultilateral organizations.\n  The obvious point is that the extent to which the United States \nparticipates with its armed forces in a particular mission will be \ndetermined by the extent to which our national interests are involved \nand the degree of risk it entails, including, as noted above, the \ngreater risks that may result from acting within a coalition.\n  Accordingly, the United States has made clear that it will not \nprovide\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\ntroops for the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo. In the same vein, the United States will not provide \ntroops for the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor, the \nfollow-on mission to the Australian-led intervention force, but will \nprovide a few U.S. officers to serve as observers and will, as part of \ntheir normal exercises, periodically deploy U.S. personnel to perform \nactivities such as the rebuilding of schools and the restoration of \nmedical services.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is in the United States national \ninterest to support the United Nations as it seeks to fulfill its \nprimary responsibility to maintain international peace and stability. \nWe also need to work to strengthen our alliances and to encourage our \nallies to strengthen their military capabilities so that they can share \nthe common burden. We also need to utilize the various other \nmultilateral organizations that can contribute to international peace \nand stability. Finally, we need to explore every opportunity to bring \nabout actions that will serve to end conflict at the earliest possible \ntime, as wasn't done in 1991 at the time of the initial shelling of \nDubrovnik, and to prevent the spread of conflict, as was done by the UN \npreventive deployment mission to Macedonia in 1992.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to end in the same way that I started; \nnamely, by commending Senator Cleland and Senator Roberts for \ninstituting this dialogue. I look forward to the continuation of this \ndialogue in the coming weeks and I hope to be able to participate again \nin the future.\n  I again thank our good friends from Georgia and Kansas. I add my \nthanks also to the Senator from Indiana for his extraordinarily \nthoughtful remarks this afternoon. I was not able to hear all of it. I \nwould like to have heard all of it. But I heard enough to know that, as \nusual, the Senator from Indiana adds an extremely thoughtful and \nthorough contribution to this debate.\n  I commend our good friends from Georgia and Kansas for carrying on \nwhat I consider to be a very significant dialog. It takes a lot of \neffort and a lot of energy to do what they are doing. It is critical to \nthis nation's security. Both of them have already made huge \ncontributions to our Nation's security. Now, on the floor of the \nSenate, they are making an additional major contribution, and this \ncountry is again in their debt.\n  I thank my friends.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

The fact is that we have \namendments that could have been offered on either side. We have \nindicated a willingness to even offer time agreements on virtually all \namendments. There are a number of amendments that are pending. We are \ntold that we just do not have time on the schedule to revisit ESEA this \nweek. I really question that. The fact is that we have been in morning \nbusiness all afternoon. We are not going to be in session tomorrow. We \nwill be in debate only scheduled on Monday for the military \nconstruction bill. We are not overworked here.\n  It seems to me that on an issue as important as ESEA needs to be \naddressed. The fact is, it should have been reauthorized last year. It \nwasn't. It needs to be reauthorized this year.\n  We have fewer than 40 legislative days left between now and the time \nthat we are scheduled to adjourn. With appropriations bills, the China \ndebate, and a number of other issues unfinished--bankruptcy we hope, \nand other issues--there is very little time.\n  So it seems to me that we ought to be using what time we have \navailable to us to our best advantage. Being in morning business for \nmost of the day is not my concept of utilization of time in an \nappropriate way.\n  Again, I express the regret that we haven't had more of a chance this \nweek to deal with this very, very critical bill. The education bill \nought to be finished. We worked on it in a very constructive way, I \nhave felt. There has been progress--limited, but, nonetheless, \nprogress. We could have had a lot more progress. There is no reason why \nwe can't finish this bill. There is no reason why we couldn't have done \nanother bloc of amendments today and some amendments tomorrow. In fact, \nI think maybe we could have finished the bill this week. That is now \nimpossible. And there is no prospect of bringing the bill up at least \nfor the foreseeable future, given what the majority leader has \nindicated is his intention with regard to appropriations bills. I am \ntroubled and disappointed by that.\n\n  I make note of that as we end the day today. Hopefully, we will have \nmore productive weeks and more opportunities to debate this issue. But \ntime is going by quickly. We don't have that much more time. I hope we \ncan better use the time we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have had the privilege for the last hour of \nsitting in that chair and hearing our colleagues debate the issue of \nNATO and our place in Europe and the broader national security issues \nand the specific issue of whether or not we should remain in Kosovo. It \nis entirely appropriate that this body debate this issue. No one should \ncriticize any Senator for bringing that up or for crafting a piece of \nlegislation designed to focus this Government on an exit strategy. \nEveryone knows we need one.\n  I add my voice to that of Senator Lugar, Senator Levin, and others, \nwho have expressed concern that while it is appropriate to debate, it \nis not appropriate to leave at this moment. I wish I could say it is \ntime to leave, but I believe America still has a place in Europe. I \nbelieve if we set in motion the wheels to leave Kosovo, we will set in \nmotion the mechanism to decouple the United States and NATO with \nEurope. I think we need to be very thoughtful about that.\n  I wish Mr. Putin and the new Russian Federation well, and I hope they \njoin the democratic nations of Europe. I hope we can include them in \nmore ways than ever imaginable throughout all of my lifetime. But I \nthink the jury is still out. I hear from their neighbors, still, they \nare afraid of what happened in Chechnya. The Nation of Georgia \ntrembles. I know Moldovians do, I know Ukranians do, I know Romanians \ndo. They have all been in my office this week, worried that the United \nStates would pull out its stabilizing influence, an influence that, \nfrankly, these emerging democracies look to, count on, and still need. \nI know we are tired of it. I know we are tired of funding it. I know \nour fighting men and women don't like being in a police operation.\n  But I also know the cost of leaving Europe is a cost that is much \nlarger than the one we are paying now to stay in Europe. I hope \nPresident Clinton and Madeleine Albright and others in our executive \nbranch can figure out how we can get out of there, but get out in a way \nthat does not destroy this institution called NATO, which the world \nstill needs. As Senator Lugar said, that day may come, that we can go \nhome and the Europeans say goodbye, but that day is not now.\n  I think we should have a vigorous debate, but I think we should be \nexceedingly careful before we say to our European allies and to \neveryone watching the United States and counting on the United States, \nthat we are pulling out of Dodge. I don't think we can say that yet. I \nhope we can say it soon. But I know we can't say it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3906-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3906-S3908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES IN OREGON\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have come to talk to citizens \nof my State who have a rare privilege in the next few days: The two \nleading candidates for the highest office in our land will be in the \nState of Oregon. Vice President Gore will be there tomorrow, and \nGovernor Bush will be\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\nthere on Tuesday. I will have occasion to be with Governor Bush, and my \nfriend and colleague, Ron Wyden, will have occasion to be with Vice \nPresident Gore tomorrow.\n  Oregonians need to ask a lot of questions to find out where these men \nare on issues that affect their lives. I came to speak in terms similar \nto those of Senator Gorton, who wants Washingtonians to ask what I want \nOregonians to ask; that is, Mr. Vice President, where are you on the \nissue of hydroelectric power on the four Snake River dams in the State \nof Washington? I am not sure I know of an issue of greater importance \nto our State's environment and our State's economy. As a background to \nthis question, Mr. Gore, where are you on the question of breaching \nthese dams?\n  I would like to talk a little bit about our energy policy in this \ncountry. So I say to any Oregonians that may be watching, I want to \nshare a memo which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Energy Secretary Richardson Announces Six Short-Term Actions To Help \n                         Prevent Power Outages\n\n\n stresses need for institutional change to protect reliability in the \n                               long term\n\n       Energy Secretary Bill Richardson today announced a series \n     of short-term actions that the Department of Energy will take \n     to help ensure the reliability of the nation's power supply \n     in the coming months. Several regions across the country have \n     experienced reliability problems in recent summers and there \n     are concerns about the reliability of the nation's grid this \n     summer.\n       These short-term actions by the Department of Energy, while \n     not a cure-all, are designed to help keep the lights on this \n     summer,'' said Secretary Richardson. ``To protect reliability \n     in the long term, we need new policies and passage of federal \n     electricity legislation to keep pace with rapidly changing \n     market developments.\n       The Department of Energy will: work with other agencies to \n     identify opportunities to reduce electric consumption at \n     federal water projects during times of peak demand; urge the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utility \n     commissions to solicit and approve tariffs that will help \n     reduce electricity demands during peak time periods. For \n     instance, large industrial consumers could find it to their \n     advantage to sell their power entitlement back to their \n     utility if it would be profitable; explore opportunities for \n     the use of existing backup generators during power supply \n     emergencies to reduce the strain on electric systems and help \n     avoid blackouts; conduct an emergency exercise with state and \n     local governments to help prepare for potential summer power \n     supply emergencies; work closely with the utility industry to \n     gain up-to-date relevant information about potential grid-\n     related problems as quickly as possible; and prepare public \n     service announcements to provide tips to help consumers \n     reduce electricity use and lower their bills.\n       Secretary Richardson began a series of regional summits \n     this week between federal, state and local government \n     officials, regulators, utilities and consumers to discuss \n     ways to enhance the reliability of our electric system. The \n     first meetings are taking place on April 24 in Hartford, \n     Newark and New Orleans. On April 28, he will co-host a summit \n     in Sacramento.\n       After last summer's outages Secretary Richardson formed a \n     Power Outage Study Team to review the events of last year and \n     provide recommendations for making the nation's grid more \n     reliable. The team's final report, issued last month, is \n     available online at http://www.policy.energy.gov.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. This is a news release from Department of Energy \nSecretary Richardson announcing six short-term actions to help prevent \npower outages.\n  This will blow your mind.\n  We are expecting power outages all over the United States this \nsummer. The long-term forecast for the Pacific Northwest is for energy \nshortages, as well. If you look at the six proposals for what this \nGovernment is going to do, there isn't one proposal about producing \nenergy. The first one is: Look for opportunities to reduce electric \nconsumption at Federal water projects.\n  Let me tell the farmers what that means, they are turning off the \nswitch and they are turning off the water. That is what that means.\n  Second, solicit and approve tariffs that will help reduce electricity \ndemands during peak times. Do you know what that means, Mr. President? \nThat means the rates are going up. It is like a tax increase. So the \ncost of your energy is going up. We are not going to produce any more, \nHeaven forbid, we are just going to make it more expensive.\n  The next actions prescribed: The Energy Department will conduct an \nemergency exercise with State and local governments to help prepare for \npotential summer power supply emergencies. So we essentially will do a \nfire drill to see what happens when a whole city shuts down because \nelectricity isn't produced when hitting a switch. Somebody has to turn \nsomething before we can have lights.\n  The next one prescribed: the Government is going to gain up-to-date \nrelevant information about potential grid-related problems as quickly \nas possible.\n  Great. We don't already have that information?\n  Finally, we are going to prepare public service announcements to \nprovide tips for how you can conserve electricity.\n  Nothing in the news release about producing.\n  When Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are in the State of Oregon, I want \nOregonians to ask about our power. I want them to ask how are our \nlights going to go on at night? How are we going to stay warm in the \nwinter? How are our factories going to continue to operate? How will we \nhave jobs?\n  This is not a hypothetical situation I am posing. These are real \npotential threats.\n  In spite of all of that, the Vice President is talking about shutting \ndown any offshore drilling. Fine, but realize that has a cost to the \nenvironment.\n  Talk about not renewing nuclear licenses for energy plants--but that \nhas an environmental cost as well. I see Senator Byrd on the floor all \nthe time, decrying how the coal fields of West Virginia are being shut \ndown because this Administration does not want to produce any more \ncoal. I hear the people in the northeastern United States screaming \nabout skyrocketing fuel prices in the winter, yet we are becoming more \ndependent upon foreign oil. Now I hear this Administration, in my neck \nof the woods, the Pacific Northwest, saying they are going to tear out \nour hydroelectric power.\n  It is not unreasonable, my fellow Americans, to ask how are the \nlights going to go on? Our own Energy Department is admitting we have a \nproblem on the horizon. I think the whole country was just reminded \nthat gasoline does not come from a filling station. It is $2 a gallon \nand climbing in some cases, falling in others, I hope.\n  We need an energy policy.\n  I support conservation initiatives. Raise CAFE standards? I am for \nthat. I am looking for ways to conserve. But Americans are demanding \nenergy and this Administration's policy is to shut down domestic energy \nproduction and leave America more dependent on foreign oil. This does \nnot add up.\n  I hope Oregonians understand that it is very important to ask the \nVice President of the United States what his policy on energy is. Mr. \nBush has already answered it. He said if he is elected President, the \ndams will stay and you will keep your jobs and the lights will go on at \nnight. I like that answer. It is clear.\n  He also made the point that we can have our energy and we can have \nour fish as well. Let me tell you a real dirty little secret. As we \nspeak, all that can be heard here in Washington is the gloom and doom \nabout the fish going away. Do you know that in the Columbia/Snake \nRivers right now, those rivers are teeming with salmon coming back to \nspawn?\n  Let me give some numbers. As of today, at the furthest dam they want \nto take out, called the Lower Granite, 18,000 chinook have passed \nthrough this season. Some say, ``Oh, but they must be hatchery fish.'' \nTo those I say no, they are not. A few of the fish are from hatchery \nstock, but many of them are wild. Do you know how many fish passed \nthrough this same dam last year? It was 240. This year it was 18,000. \nThese numbers have many in the environmental community looking pretty \nashen-faced.\n  The first dam on the Columbia River that the fish pass through is \ncalled the Bonneville Dam, a dam Franklin Roosevelt dedicated, I \nbelieve in 1936. As of today, 160,000 spring chinook have passed over \nthat dam this season. These are big returns. There are lots of fish \nreturning. In fact, there are so many coming back that the Oregon \nDepartment of Fish and Wildlife is clubbing nearly every fish they can \nfind\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nthat is a hatchery fish. They are killing them so they will not spawn \nbecause they say that hatchery stock affects the ethnic purity of the \nwild stocks.\n  The real secret about hatchery fish is that their eggs come from wild \nfish. But, nevertheless, we have so many fish now, apparently, that we \nhave the luxury of clubbing them to death before they can spawn. By the \nway, the hatchery fish in the Atlantic salmon recovery program are \ntreated the same as wild fish. But in spite of all this, we're told in \nthe Pacific Northwest that we have to take out our dams. We have to \ntake them out in order to have a normative river.\n  What do we hear from the administration? We hear on the one hand that \nFish and Wildlife has concluded the dams have to come out. The National \nMarine Fisheries Service says we need to study dam breaching for at \nleast 10 years because we do not have a good answer yet. And, by the \nway, the studies they have been producing are all predicated on data \nfrom 1980 to the current date. However, if you look at data dating back \nto 1960, which is available, you do not come up with extinction \nmodeling. But federal agencies just picked the years that had the worst \nocean conditions to argue that the salmon are going to become extinct \nunless we tear out our dams. I want the fish but I don't want the \npeople to be suckers. I think we are being set up to be that.\n\n  I would like to know, also from Mr. Gore, why it is that the Corps of \nEngineers was about to issue their recommendation, which was don't take \nthe dams out, and they were ordered by the White House not to make that \nrecommendation? Why were they ordered to make no recommendation? What \nthat adds up to, I believe, is that this is not about science--this is \nabout political science. Political science is not the basis upon which \nthis decision should be made, particularly when our rivers are full of \nfish as we speak.\n  What are the consequences if they pull the dams out? I have named a \nfew already, but I do know it adds 13 cents a bushel to every farmer's \nwheat. I know it means $11 million a year lost in revenue to the \nbarging industry. When you take this wheat from the barges and put it \non a truck, do you know how many trucks it takes to replace those \nbarges per day? It takes 2,000 semi trucks a day. You say you care \nabout the environment? Are you going to burn that kind of fuel, burn up \nthose kinds of miles, cause that kind of congestion in the city of \nPortland and the city of Seattle? Not on my watch you will not.\n  What else does tearing out the dams mean? It means a loss of about \n$130 million in property values to farmers. What does that mean to \nproperty taxes? School support? Roads? All those things are in jeopardy \nif you take those dams down. Dam breaching takes 37,000 acres of wheat \nout of production. What happens to those families? Their land goes back \nto sagebrush.\n  It takes at least 5,370 direct jobs in Portland. I actually think it \nis higher than that when you look at the ripple effect. When you take \nout these dams, you lose longshoremen in Portland and the many other \nservice-related jobs that depend on them. Not only that, but to take \nthese dams out, it would cost $809 million. Some have said that it \ncould cost that much for each dam--I don't know whether we can get \nthrough this body an appropriation to destroy Federal assets that will \nbe in the billions of dollars. What are you going to replace the energy \nwith? What are you going to burn? This is crazy.\n  What else do you lose? You lose 3,033 megawatts of clean \nhydroelectric power. That is the amount it takes to run the city of \nSeattle every day. We are going to take that out in the face of \nprojected energy shortages? Not on my watch.\n  So I say with the Senator from Washington: No, not on our watch.\n  I say to my fellow citizens in Oregon, this is the most important \nquestion you can ask Al Gore. Governor Bush has answered it. Please, \nMr. Vice President, tell us what is your position on tearing out \nhydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest? One of your agencies says \ndo it. Another says we don't know enough yet. A third says don't do it. \nAnd Gore is refusing to answer the question.\n  We can have our fish and we can have our power. There are many things \nwe can do, short of destroying our energy infrastructure and our clean, \nhydroelectric power. There are many things we can do to save fish short \nof the destruction of this kind of energy. To replace our clean energy \nwith any other type, you are going to burn something and Oregonians \nwill live in a dirtier place. I do not want them to.\n  I ask the Vice President, respectfully, to answer the question. What \nis your policy on dam breaching?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3908-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EUROPEAN UNION HUSHKIT REGULATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization, ICAO, is a specialized agency of the U.N. that has been \ntasked for more than 50 years with the safe and orderly growth of \ninternational civil aviation. Based in Montreal, this 185 countries \nstrong organization develops international standards on such critical \nissues as noise, emissions, and air worthiness.\n  I am saddened to report that, last week, the European Union dealt a \nsevere blow to the integrity and future viability of this critical \norganization. I, of course, am speaking of the EU's implementation of \nthe so-called hushkit regulation. This regulation bans hushkitted \naircraft from being registered in Europe, prohibits such aircraft that \nare not European registered from flying in Europe within two years, and \nbars certain reengined aircraft with low by-pass ratios from European \nairspace. The regulation was implemented despite the fact that the \naircraft in question meet the highest international noise standards.\n  Thankfully, in March, the U.S. filed an Article 84 case within ICAO \nagainst the fifteen EU Member States arguing that the regulation \nviolated the Chicago Convention. ICAO will review the matter this fall, \nand hopefully resolve it in a way that reaffirms its position as the \nsole, international standard setting body.\n  Ironically, the EU wants to have its cake and eat it too. EU Members \nStates are now anxious for ICAO to establish new, more stringent, Stage \n4 noise standards. Indeed, the U.S. is working with ICAO on this \nendeavor as we speak. The key question becomes, why should we develop \nnew standards if the EU has demonstrated that the old ones can be \ndisregarded at whim? If the EU wants Stage 4, it must begin by \ndemonstrating its respect for Stage 3 by withdrawing the hushkit \nregulation.\n  Mr. President, I will be following the resolution of this dispute \nvery carefully. It is critical to future trading opportunities that the \nintegrity of the ICAO process be upheld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3908-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3908-S3909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECURITY AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITE IMAGERY\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I am concerned about an emerging issue \nthat has important implications for our national security: the \ncommercial satellite imaging industry. Soon the public will have access \nto high resolution pictures able to show objects as small as three feet \nin size.\n  The rapid evolution of satellite technology has suddenly made the \n``eye in the sky'' accessible to everyone, from foreign governments to \nthe average individual. Secret sites are suddenly no longer secret. \nPhotos of Area 51, a top-secret military installation located in \nNevada, were recently made available by a private company selling \ncommercial satellite images. The wide availability of these pictures to \nany person or country that can afford to buy them has the potential to \nboth help or hinder our security.\n  Initially satellites were used during the Cold War for defense \npurposes. These classified images were only available to the \ngovernment. However, civilians began to benefit from satellite pictures \nabout thirty years ago when the government satellite, Landsat, began to \nsell photos to the public for agricultural planning purposes. The first \ncommercial satellite launch did not occur until 1986, when France, \nSweden and Belgium jointly launched SPOT I.\n  The technology of satellites today has evolved considerably since\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nLandsat, in 1972, began providing photos to the public. Those pictures \ncould only render images of objects larger than 250 feet across.\n  This all changed when earlier this year a private company called \nSpace Imaging made history by distributing the first high-resolution \nsatellite images of a North Korean ballistic missile site. Their photos \nhad a one-meter resolution, providing the public a detailed look at the \nmissile facilities of this rogue nation. Ruts in the road used by North \nKorean trucks could be seen.\n  The industry for commercial satellites is growing steadily. In 1994 \nPresident Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 which \npermitted the Commerce Department to license 12 U.S. companies to \noperate remote-sensing satellites. Space Imaging and Aerial Images, the \ncompany which took the Area 51 pictures, may be the first two of these \ncompanies to get a satellite aloft, but there are more to come. At \nleast two other U.S. companies plan on launching satellites this year \nand several foreign companies have similar plans.\n  Legal restrictions surrounding these photo purchases are few. Imaging \ncompanies do not have to identify either their customers or their \npictures. An amendment to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act prohibits \nU.S. companies from selling satellite images of Israel that show \nobjects with a diameter under 6 feet. Any sale of images to a terrorist \nstate or any regime under U.S. or international sanctions is also \nprohibited. Aside from these restrictions, there are virtually no \nlimitations on any satellite or any sale of satellite pictures. And \neven these restrictions are going to be harder to maintain as \ncompetition increases from more companies outside the United States.\n\n  At the moment, the images are expensive, limited in coverage but not \ndifficult to purchase. Foreign governments, private groups or \nindividuals can now place their orders. In a competitive market with \nmore countries offering this service, there will be competition to \nprovide more precise pictures, of a greater number of subjects, in a \nmore timely manner, at less cost. The restrictions the U.S. now imposes \nwill be harder to maintain in such a free market. What was secret once, \nwill be secret no longer.\n  Pictures of Area 51, for example, were provided by a Russian launched \nsatellite. India is also beginning a program to launch high-resolution \nimaging satellites and Israel is planning to launch its own commercial \nsatellite. American restrictions on satellite images of Israel only \napply to American satellites. Soon commercial satellites will also be \nusing radar imaging--and thus will no longer be limited by the need for \nclear skies--and hyperspectral sensors which permit analysis of \nchemical characteristics. The United States government has long been \npart of the action. NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing Program is based \nat the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.\n  But it is clear that as this competitive industry grows in the \nfuture, we should examine the impact of commercial satellites on our \nnation's security. Many have applauded the growth of this industry as a \nmeans of keeping the public well-informed and expanding the national \ndiscussion on issues of national and international security. It is true \nthat having access to satellite images of other countries does enable \nthe U.S. to monitor more areas around the world, to identify violations \nof international agreements, detect human rights abuses and watch for \npossible security threats. It will mean private, non-governmental \norganizations, such as the one which commissioned the pictures of North \nKorea, will be watching the world too, and issuing their intelligence \nbulletins.\n  This may result in confusing interpretations. Countries could take \nadvantage of the fact that they may be monitored by one of these \nsatellites. Knowing that they are being photographed by a satellite and \nthat these images may be made public, states could attempt to blackmail \nthe international community by staging what appears to be a more robust \nnuclear program or preparations for a missile test for the benefit of \nthe threatening images that this would produce. After all pictures do \nnot lie, do they? Or they could do exactly the opposite and disguise \ntheir advanced defense capabilities so that the images captured and \nreleased to the media actually reinforce a rogue nation's efforts to \ncircumvent international law.\n  This possibility calls to mind the pictures taken last January of the \nNodong missile launch site in North Korea. As I mentioned earlier, \nthose pictures depicted a crude missile site and a launch pad that cuts \nthrough a rice paddy, making the North Korean facilities appear \nprimitive and unthreatening. But these observations contradict the \nSeptember 1999 National Intelligence Estimate which believes North \nKorea to be the country most likely to develop ICBMs capable of \nthreatening the U.S. during the next fifteen years. If the U.S. accepts \nthese pictures as fact and believes that the North Korean missile site \nis as unthreatening as it appears, should we let down our guard and \ndisregard the threat they may pose to our country? I think not.\n  Similarly, in March of this year, satellite photos of Pakistan's \nnuclear facility and missile garrison were taken by a commercial \nsatellite and sold to a Washington-based arms control organization. \nThese images have sparked a public policy debate over their \ninterpretation and international security implications. The \norganization that purchased these photos insists that they are proof \nthat Pakistan will not be persuaded to give up its nuclear weapons \nprogram. However, a possible misinterpretation of this data could \neasily incite a flare-up of the already volatile relationship between \nPakistan and India.\n  We cannot make assumptions about what these pictures mean when \nconstructing our national security policy. Our eyes can deceive us. \nPhoto interpretation is going to open up a new area of commercial \nemployment for former government analysts. This evolving space race of \nthe commercial satellite industry can offer us many military and \ncivilian benefits. It can be an important tool in assisting us to make \nmany of our national security decisions in the future. But we must also \nbe wary about jumping to conclusions from what we see. A single picture \nmay not be worth a thousand words. We must contemplate the use of these \ncommercial satellites carefully and find the way to best utilize them \nso that they bolster, not threaten, our national security.\n  Just as Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices are now \nwidely accessible, we could have a situation in which an enemy uses GPS \nto attack an American target identified by commercial satellite \nimaging. Recently, the White House announced the United States would \nstop its intentional degradation of the GPS signals available to the \npublic, giving the public access to the precise location system \npreviously possible only for the Department of Defense. Defense is \nrequesting $500 million in FY2001 to sustain and modernize the GPS \nprogram. Much of the technology used in commercial space launches came \nfrom the military.\n  This is a strange new world. We need to gain a greater understanding \nof the implications of this technology on our national security. The \ntechnology may be inherently uncontrollable--just as export controls \nover computer encryption became impossible to sustain. Satellite \nimagery has the potential to be a major asset to the arms control, \nhuman rights, and environmental communities. We are witnessing the \nbirth of a new area of information technology. I would urge my \ncolleagues to consider this issue as we begin to examine American \nsecurity in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3909-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3909-S3910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 142ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADMISSION OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA INTO THE \n                        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the State of Minnesota has truly \nbeen blessed with a wide array of remarkable gifts. Few places on Earth \ncan boast such diversity amongst its abundant natural resources, \nprosperous industries, and exceptional people. Today marks the 142nd \nanniversary of Minnesota's admission as the thirty-second state of the \nUnion, and I want to take this opportunity to reflect on a few of the \nthings that make my state special. This is a difficult speech to make \nin such a short amount of time, as I am sure I could break Senator \nThurmond's twenty-four hour and eighteen minute\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\nfilibuster record by talking about Minnesota's contributions to America \nbut I will stick to just a few of the highlights and try to finish up \nby sundown.\n  Minnesota's natural beauty has been photographed and documented time \nand time again. License plates may proclaim Minnesota to be ``The Land \nof 10,000 Lakes,'' but in reality, our vast lakes number in excess of \n12,000, and we have more than 63,000 miles of natural rivers and \nstreams. But there is something about sitting on the shore of Mille \nLacs Lake at dawn on a Saturday in July that even a two-page spread in \nNational Geographic cannot capture.\n  Minnesotans have a unique relationship with their great outdoors. \nMany take advantage of our pristine environment through a large \nassortment of activities, such as taking a week to canoe through the \nBoundary Waters or going for a walk along the Mississippi River over a \nlunch hour. Minnesota is a true sportsman's paradise. Our unique \nhabitat creates some of the best hunting and fishing in the country. We \nare proud of our outdoor heritage, and take seriously our commitment to \nmaintaining the delicate balance between protecting the environment and \nthe responsible use of our resources.\n  Nor are we shy about sharing our bounty with others. Minnesota \nwelcomes more than 20 million vacationers every year, who support \n170,300 tourism jobs and return $9.1 billion to the local economy. Yet, \nfor all those visitors, our state offers places of such solitude that a \ncamper or canoeist can travel for a week and spot any number of deer, \nbears, and bald eagles, but never see another person.\n  The influence of agriculture on Minnesota life and traditions cannot \nbe overstated. Even as family farms struggle in today's difficult \nmarket, the resilience and dedication of our farmers establishes the \nbackbone of the Minnesota economy. One in every four Minnesota jobs is \ntied to the agriculture industry in some way. Minnesota has become a \nnational leader in international exports, as our producers export \nbillions of dollars worth of grains, meats, and other products every \nyear. I am proud of my ongoing efforts to ensure that even more world \nmarkets are opened to Minnesota agriculture products--they are among \nthe best products in the world, and they should be shared. Many of the \nnation's top job providers call Minnesota home. Well-known names like \nGeneral Mills, Pillsbury, 3M, Target, and Cargill have deep roots \nwithin our communities. Aside from the economic impacts made by our \ncorporate community, there is an impressive philanthropic presence in \nthe state. For example, Cargill's generous contributions to causes such \nas education, environment, and youth programs total in the tens of \nmillions of dollars.\n  Firms such as Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are national leaders in \nthe bio-medical industry. Their products have given hope to those who \npreviously faced a bleak medical outlook. Other Minnesota organizations \nare searching for answers to tomorrow's problems--today. The world-\nrenowned Mayo Clinic not only treats over half a million patients a \nyear, but is leading the charge against the mysteries of mankind's \ndeadly diseases through its ongoing research.\n  Of all the successful companies, natural beauty, and bountiful \nresources Minnesota plays host to, the real treasures are the people of \nmy state. Successful Minnesotans come from all walks of life. Some of \nthe most prolific writers of the past century have hailed from the \nNorth Star State. The first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize for \nLiterature was Sinclair Lewis, a native of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. F. \nScott Fitzgerald, Jon Hassler, and Garrison Keillor are all writers we \nare proud to call our own.\n  Something about the fresh air in Minnesota inspires us to do bigger \nand better things. Charles Lindbergh must have gotten a big whiff of \nthat air; so did Judy Garland, Kevin McHale, and Bob Dylan, just to \nname a few. Our state and nation recently mourned the loss of one of \nour most beloved natives. Charles Schulz captured the hearts of young \nand old alike with his long-running Peanuts comic strip, and we will \nmiss him each and every Sunday.\n  There are many Minnesota celebrities who have contributed to the \nrichness of our nation, but the people who really deserve the applause \nand recognition are the men and women who day in and day out strive to \nmake their communities, state, and nation a better place to live. The \nfarmer who harvests our nation's corn, the policewoman who patrols the \nstreets, the stay-at-home mom who supervises a household of kids, and \nthe volunteer who takes the time to visit a disabled veteran rarely \nreceive the accolades they deserve. These people are as indispensable \nto the growing, bustling community of St. Michael-Albertville as they \nare to the thriving metropolis of Minneapolis-St. Paul. I applaud them \nand am proud to represent each of them here in the United States \nSenate.\n  The quality of life in Minnesota is outstanding for a reason. Ideals \nsuch as hard work, dedication, personal responsibility, and a true \npassion for life are all essential to my state's success. Growing up on \na Minnesota dairy farm, I was fortunate enough to witness these \nqualities and their importance at a very young age.\n  And for any of my colleagues who may be wondering, you don't have to \nbe a native to spread the ``Minnesota Nice'' spirit. For example, some \nof the most outstanding Minnesota citizens are those from its many \nethnic communities. Their devotion and contribution to Minnesota's way \nof life is commendable, and representative of the way our state seems \nto bring out the very best in its people.\n  I am deeply proud of my state, Mr. President, and representing her \nand her citizens is a great honor. So, on this 142nd anniversary of our \nstatehood, I encourage Minnesotans to take time to discover something \nnew about our state and ponder some of the many treasures with which we \nhave been blessed. Visit one of our sky-tinted lakes, the Mall of \nAmerica, Split Rock Lighthouse, Fort Snelling, or even the world's \nlargest ball of twine. Take pride in our state and continue the efforts \nto make Minnesota an even better place to call home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3910-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3910-S3911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, for the eighth year in a row, the Uniform \nCrime Report indicates that violent crime has decreased across our \ncountry. In 1999, the number of murders, rapes, aggravated assaults, \nrobberies, and property crimes decreased eight percent in the Midwest \nand seven percent overall. While crime experts will argue endlessly on \nthe reasons behind this remarkable trend, I believe that local, state, \nand federal law enforcement are primarily responsible for making our \nstreets safer than a decade before.\n  While I am pleased with the results of this new report, it is \nimportant to remember that behind every crime statistic, there is a \nchild, a spouse, a relative, or a friend that has been victimized. Even \none crime is too many because that crime victim has been violated in a \nway that forever changes their life. In our country's haste to focus on \nwhat should happen to the criminal, the victim is too often overlooked. \nThat doesn't have to be the case, and I believe that more should be \ndone to assist crime victims in South Dakota and around the country.\n  As a former prosecutor, I am well aware that victimization in and of \nitself is terrible to cope with, let alone the anguish of a legal \nproceeding and restitution recovery. The voice of the victim should be \nheard at every step of the criminal process, and local and state \nprograms should have adequate resources to effectively deal with crime \nvictims.\n  States have taken the lead in protecting the rights of crime victims, \nand it is time for the federal government to follow suit. South Dakota \nprovides a number of specific ``victims rights'' including the right to \nrestitution, notices of scheduled hearings and releases, an explanation \nof the criminal charges and process, and the opportunity to present a \nwritten or oral victim impact statement at trial. South Dakota also has \nvictim/witness assistants in many of the prosecutor's offices across \nthe state who work with crime victims on a daily basis.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Crime Victims Assistance Act which enhances \nvictims' rights for federal crimes and provides several grants for \nstate and local prosecutors, judges, prison employees, and law \nenforcement officials\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\nto improve their handling of crime victims as well. However, instead of \npassing this important piece of legislation that would have an \nimmediate impact on state and local efforts to improve crime victims \nservices, some in Congress prefer to focus their attention on proposals \nto amend the United States Constitution. I have reservations about \namending the constitution while Congress has the ability to enact \nlegislation instead to accomplish the same goal. I am more concerned \nthat this focus on a constitutional amendment has slowed the pace of \ncrime victim legislation over the past several years. It is critical \nthat Congress pass and the President sign into law the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act this year.\n  In addition to the Crime Victims Assistance Act, Congress must pass \nthis year the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (VAWA II). \nSince enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number \nof forcible rapes of women have declined, and the number of sexual \nassaults nationwide have gone down as well. South Dakota organizations \nhave received $6.7 million in federal funding for domestic abuse \nprograms and $1.6 million in federal funding for battered women's \nshelters.\n  Despite the success of the Violence Against Women Act, domestic abuse \nand violence against women continue to plague our communities. Consider \nthe fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this country and \nmore women are injured by domestic violence each year than by \nautomobile accidents and cancer deaths combined. Local and state \nofficials should have access to more--not fewer--resources to address \ndomestic violence, and it is critical that programs authorized through \nVAWA II receive stable levels of funding for the next five years.\n  Supporters of a constitutional amendment for crime victims have \nwithdrawn their proposal from consideration on the Senate floor this \nyear. I am hopeful that my colleagues will seize this opportunity to \ncontinue the very valuable discussion on crime victims' rights and work \nto pass the Crime Victims Assistance Act and VAWA II as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3911-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

KERR\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nmember of my staff, an advisor, and a man I feel honored to call my \nfriend, Gordon Kerr.\n  Gordon, who has served as my Chief of Staff since 1982, has retired \nfrom government service to join the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation as the Director of Congressional Affairs. His 17 years as \nmy top aide made him the dean of Senate Chiefs of Staff.\n  Gordon has served me for these many years in a variety of ways. He \nhas been an invaluable advisor on issues of public policy and \nlegislative strategy, as well as on personal and political matters. He \nhas a clear-eyed, straightforward, right-in-your-face way of evaluating \nissues and events, and expressing his opinion about them which makes it \nnearly impossible to walk a bad idea past him. At least not without his \ncalling you on it.\n  And yet, the first thing that anyone who knows Gordon immediately \nsays is, ``what a wonderful human being''. How does a plain-speaking, \nrealist like Gordon, come to be so uniformly regarded with such warmth \nand affection? It's simple when you think about it. Gordon is so open, \nprincipled, ethical and kind-hearted in his approach to the people he \ncomes in contact with that it is nearly impossible to take offense at \nhis candid advice. I'm reminded of what I've read about Robert Kennedy \nwho also was known both for his brusque, sometimes harsh candor, but \nalso for his high principles, and thoughtful consideration of others. \n``My, he is unassimilated, isn't he?'' poet Robert Lowell was reported \nto have said when he first met him.\n  In all, Gordon spent more than 30 years on Capitol Hill, beginning as \na Legislative Assistant for former-Congressman James Scheuer of New \nYork in 1970, joining former-Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of Texas in \n1973, and then working for former-Congressman Jonathan Bingham of New \nYork from 1973 until 1982, when he joined my staff as Chief of Staff. \nGordon is a graduate of Yale University with a B.A. degree in Political \nScience and he holds a Masters degree in Public Administration with \nDistinction from American University, awarded in 1980. He served in the \nUnited States Navy as an Intelligence Officer for three years.\n  In 1990, Gordon served as my campaign manager. Former Senator Eugene \nMcCarthy, with his wonderful irreverent sense of humor, once remarked \nthat practicing politics is a little ``like being a football coach; you \nhave to be smart enough to understand the game, but dumb enough to \nthink it's important.'' Well, Gordon is a brilliant strategist, an \noutstanding ``coach'', and although his acute sense of humor would \nappreciate Senator McCarthy's self-deprecating quip, nonetheless he's \nalways known the importance of the game. He's proud of the work he's \ndone in the Senate as a public servant, and rightly so. And, he's proud \nof his work in the world of campaigns and politics, doing his part on \nthat tough battleground. He was ever-conscious of the role of politics, \nwhich we sometimes tend to forget, in the accountability which is at \nthe heart of the democratic system.\n  Characteristic of Gordon is his ability to see things from a new, \nfresh, sometimes unique angle. In a time when even the public policy \ndebate is increasingly driven by political polls, television sound-\nbites, and oversimplified sloganeering, it was particularly valuable to \nme to have his contributions. Even when I did not ultimately adopt his \nviewpoint or accept his recommendation, having the benefit of Gordon's \ninput nearly always informed my decisions.\n  While Gordon has been a dedicated public servant and loyal and hard-\nworking employee, his first priority has always been his wonderful \nfamily. His love of his wife Suzy, his son Charlie and daughter Sarah \nwere evident in his voice whenever he spoke of them and in the special \nsparkle in his eyes when he was with them. I know I speak not only for \nmyself and the Levin family, but for the entire Levin staff and many in \nthe Senate family, when I say we will miss Gordon and the Kerr family. \nFortunately, in his new role at the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation he won't be too far away.\n  Mr. President, I owe Gordon Kerr a great debt for the loyal service \nwhich he has performed; and I believe that all of us here in the \nSenate, in my home state of Michigan, and in the nation, owe a debt of \ngratitude to him and the many like him who serve us here. This tribute \nto Gordon Kerr, in a small way, is an effort to recognize that \nrole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3911-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3911-S3912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO EDWARD KEHOE\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary Vermonter and a determined leader, Edward Kehoe. Ed Kehoe \nwas born in Rutland, my hometown, to the late James and Grace Kehoe and \ngraduated from Rutland High School\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\nbefore serving in the U.S. Army with the 26th Infantry Regiment during \nWorld War II. As a decorated war hero, Ed Kehoe returned to Vermont to \nown and operate Kehoe's Diner in Hydeville.\n  Ed Kehoe served as the town manager of Castleton from 1955 to 1965 \nbefore being elected the Vermont House for a single term. In August \n1965, Ed Kehoe was appointed to head the Fish and Game Department where \nhe served as the Vermont fish and wildlife commissioner under four \ngovernors until he retired in August 1982. He was an avid sportsman and \nmember of an many Vermont sportsmen organizations until his death in \nlate April. At the time of his appointment Ed Kehoe was initially \ntroubled by his lack of a ``professional'' background in biology or \nwildlife management. However, his experience as a hunter and angler \ngave him the needed edge.\n  Led by his ability to draw on experience and heed the advise of \nbiologists, Ed Kehoe led the Vermont crusade to resist development \npressures. During his 17-year tenure as commissioner, Ed Kehoe \nestablished two Green Mountain Conservation camps to help teach younger \nVermonters how to fish and camp, helped to improve the state warden \nforce, expanded the statewide Hunter Safety Program, and worked to \nrestore Connecticut River salmon and wild turkeys throughout Vermont. \nPerhaps Ed Kehoe's greatest contribution to the state was his ability \nto push, acquire, and protect lands with significant wildlife and \nrecreation value.\n  Ed Kehoe's most recent award speaks to his accomplishments. Last year \nthe Rutland Herald honored his visionary concerns about nongame species \nand protection of important property by naming him, ``Outdoorsman of \nthe Century.'' John Hall, spokesman with Fish and Wildlife Department, \nrecently alluded to Ed Kehoe's achievement, ``Ed wanted to make sure we \nwere passing on the hunting and fishing traditions to future \ngenerations of Vermonter to enjoy. He always had the everyday Vermonter \nin mind, the average person of average means. He was the supreme \nsteward of fish and wildlife resources.''\n  I pay tribute today to a man who paid tribute every day, to the \nvalues the everyday Vermonter holds dear. We have lost an extraordinary \nman, but his contributions to Vermont wildlife policy will live \non.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3912-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TAIWANESE AMERICAN WEEK\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this month I join Americans \nthroughout Wisconsin and across the nation in celebrating Taiwanese \nAmerican Heritage Week, honoring the many important contributions to \nAmerican society of the more than half a million Taiwanese Americans in \nthe United States. Without the contributions of Taiwanese Americans, we \nwould lack the important AIDS research of Dr. David Ho. We would be \ndenied the work of Nobel Laureate chemist Dr. Lee Yuan-Tse and that of \nthe many American scientists he inspired. We would not be able to \nsearch for information on the internet by using Yahoo, co-founded by \nJerry Yang. Thousands of Taiwanese Americans throughout the country \nhave made important achievements in a wide range of sectors, including \ndoctors, teachers, lawyers, and computer technology experts. They have \nimproved the lives of their fellow American citizens, and they will \nplay an integral role in our future.\n  Besides their many contributions here at home, Taiwanese Americans \nhave also played a vital role in the political transformation of \nTaiwan. For many years, they organized letter-writing campaigns, \nplanned marches and demonstrations, and talked to any U.S. policy-maker \nwho would listen about their dreams for Taiwan's future as free and \ndemocratic. Many risked arrest in--or exile from--their homeland as a \nresult of their activities. The tireless work of Taiwanese Americans \nhelped ensure the success of Taiwan's democratic evolution, beginning \nwith the lifting of martial law in 1987 and culminating with the first \nfully democratic presidential election in 1996. These are achievements \nthat all Americans can celebrate. I join Taiwanese Americans in \ncongratulating the winners of the March presidential elections in \nTaiwan.\n  Mr. President, Taiwanese American Heritage Week recognizes the long-\nstanding friendship between the people of the United States and Taiwan, \nand celebrates our shared values. I commend the great accomplishments \nand contributions of the Taiwanese American community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3912-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BE KIND TO ANIMALS WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of ``Be \nKind to Animals Week.'' This week is a time to draw attention to how \nimportant animals are to our lives and to make sure they receive the \ntreatment and protection they deserve.\n  The American Humane Association was founded in 1877 with a goal to \nunite a few groups to give a national voice to those who could not \nspeak for themselves: animals. The Association established Be Kind to \nAnimals Week in 1915, the first national week specifically for animals \nand now the oldest week of its kind in existence in this country.\n  This is the 85th year ``Be Kind to Animals Week'' will be celebrated. \nThe leader of the American Humane Association in 1915 was Dr. William \nO. Stillman, who foresaw this week continuing on ``as annual events to \nstimulate and revive human thought.''\n  The three main goals of the first Be Kind to Animals Week were to \nencourage the clergy to spread the message about kindness to animals by \nobserving Humane Sunday, to visit schools and teach children the \nmessage of being humane, and to publicize the good works of our \nnation's humane societies. These noble goals continue on today through \nthe American Humane Association.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize the many Humane Societies in \nmy home state of Minnesota. These organizations are on the front lines \nof standing up for and protecting animals across Minnesota. By visiting \na local animal shelter, I know many citizens have bettered not only the \nlives of countless animals through adoption, but surely their own lives \nin the process. The staffs and volunteers of Minnesota Humane Societies \ncontinue to make this possible for all citizens--and their efforts to \nteach people the importance of spay-neuter programs have also been \nextremely helpful.\n  Animals certainly have a tremendous effect on our lives. Domesticated \nanimals are considered family members to many of us. Farm animals \nprovide nourishment to families here at home and around the world. And \nwild animals provide a balance to our overall ecosystem.\n  I am sure Dr. Stillman would be extremely pleased to see his plan of \nhaving an annual week to remember the important role of animals \ncontinuing on in its 85th year. I want to urge everyone to use this \nweek to take a minute and reflect on what animals mean to our lives, \nand how we can continue to give animals the protection and care they \ndeserve every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3912-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3912-S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD BUNKER\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished \nNevadan, a good man, and a good friend, Mr. Richard Bunker. Richard \nwill be receiving the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's \nHumanitarian Award on June 3, 2000. The Humanitarian Award recognizes \nindividuals who have made significant civic and charitable \ncontributions, and whose concern is not personal, but for the greater \ncommunity. There is no one more deserving of this honor than Richard \nBunker.\n  Richard's legacy of service to the state of Nevada is long and \nremarkable. He has served as Assistant City Manager of Las Vegas and \nClark County Manager, before being appointed Chairman of the \nprestigious State Gaming Control Board, and is now a member of the \nColorado River Commission while being a member of the Board of Trustees \nfor the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union \nWelfare/Pension Funds. I was Chairman of the Gaming Commission when \nRichard was Chairman of the Gaming Control Board. We were partners then \nand still are.\n  As Chairman of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, Richard is \nNevada's ambassador on the Colorado River. With shrewdness and finesse, \nhe has developed positive relations with officials of the Colorado \nRiver basin states. His political skill has firmly reestablished Nevada \nas a player on the important issues of the Colorado River\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\ncommunity. He also made the critically needed expansion of Southern \nNevada water facilities a reality when he brokered a financial plan \nwith the business, developer, and gaming communities.\n  Over the years, Richard Bunker has also been recognized by a variety \nof distinguished organizations. In 1993, he received the prestigious \nDistinguished Nevadan of the Year award from the University of Nevada, \nLas Vegas. The Anti-Defamation League honored Richard with the \nDistinguished Community Service Award in 1996. In June 1999, he was \npresented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Nevada Gaming \nAttorneys and the Clark County Bar Association.\n  For those of us who have had the pleasure to work closely with \nRichard, as I have, the above awards pale in comparison to his true \ngrit. He is knowledgeable of the system of government and totally aware \nof the magic of our system of free enterprise. For the growth and \ndevelopment of southern Nevada, no one for the past twenty-five years \nhas played a more key role than Richard Bunker.\n  On a more personal note, Richard has played an important part in my \npolitical endeavors. He has been an advisor, counselor, and sounding \nboard. Above all else, he is a good listener, for this Richard, I am \ngrateful.\n  I extend to you my congratulations and the appreciation of all \nNevadans for your good work on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3913-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   A TRIBUTE TO GENERAL WESLEY CLARK\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, last week, in a EUCOM change of \ncommand ceremony, General Wesley Clark relinquished his position as \nSupreme Allied Commander Europe, concluding one of his generation's \nmost illustrious and eventful military careers. As he testifies before \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence today, I want to highlight \nthe contributions of General Clark to the national security of the \nUnited States and to its friends and allies in Europe and around the \nglobe, and thank him for his service to NATO as Supreme Allied \nCommander Europe.\n  As NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson put it: Wes Clark has been \nthe right man, in the right place, at the right time. He has been \ninstrumental in bringing a degree of stability to Bosnia-Herzegovina, \nso that efforts at reconstruction and reconciliation could proceed. \nGeneral Clark welcomed three new members to the Alliance and has worked \ntirelessly to integrate them fully--militarily and politically--into \nthe activities and decision-making processes of the Alliance. The \nGeneral has worked to turn the Partnerships for Peace into stepping \nstones rather than alternatives to Alliance membership, and he has kept \nthe door open to new entrants, while setting forth high military \nstandards for full integration.\n  But nowhere have General Clark's political and leadership qualities \nbeen more evident than during NATO's Kosovo campaign. Having been a key \nparticipant in diplomatic efforts seeking a solution to Yugoslavia's \nethnic turmoil and disintegration, General Clark changed hats without \nmissing a beat and assumed command of the Alliance strategy to \ncomplement diplomacy with military power. General Clark's steadfast \npursuit of military victory coupled with the maintenance of political \ncohesion in Alliance planning cells at NATO Headquarters brought the \nWestern coalition to one of its finest hours in its 50-year history.\n  Equally important, General Clark recognized that military success \ncould not produce peace, prosperity and stability on the ground without \nan effective civil implementation program that allowed the peoples of \nthe Balkans the tools to address their historical grievances toward one \nanother. He knew that the political unity he helped to forge as a \nprerequisite to military success must now be sustained and strengthened \nif the civilianization process is to succeed.\n  Secretary of Defense Cohen put it well at the EUCOM Change of Command \nceremony last week in Europe. He said:\n\n       In General Wes Clark, America found a scholar, a soldier \n     and a statesman: a scholar of unquestioned courage, a bronze \n     and silver star hero who, despite grievous wounds, inspired \n     his unit to survive in the jungles of Vietnam; a soldier of \n     insight who returned to train those who prevailed in Desert \n     Storm. He is a statesman whose influence has been felt from \n     the Americas where he helped to guide the fight against drug \n     barons to Dayton where his counsel helped end the \n     bloodletting in Bosnia.\n\n  Those sentiments are shared by those of us in the Senate who have \nbenefitted from General Clark's wise counsel over the years. He was \nnever too busy for one more briefing at NATO Headquarters or in the \nfield. When the relevant committees held their hearings, General Clark \nwas on the plane so that he might address Congressional concerns across \nthe table, not across the ocean.\n  Members of both branches of government are now in the process of \nassimilating the ``lessons learned'' from the Kosovo campaign. General \nClark has recently completed his own ``after action'' report. But for \nthe United States, there is one incontrovertible lesson to be learned: \nIf the history of the last year or so in the Balkans were to repeat \nitself, the United States and the Alliance would be well served by \nhaving Wes Clark again at the helm of a coalition of nations intent on \ndefending their common interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3913-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3913-S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF DON GUNDERSON\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on May 21, students and former \nstudents, their parents, teachers and administrators of Los Altos High \nSchool, will come together in Southern California to show their \nappreciation, and express their thanks and best wishes to Don \nGunderson, who is retiring this year after 41 years as a music \neducator.\n  Don Gunderson began his teaching career at the halfway point of \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower's second term, working with his mentor in \nWashington state, teaching instrumental music in the junior high, as \nwell as music to elementary schoolers. Three years later, in 1961, Mr. \nGunderson came to Anaheim, California to be the band, orchestra and \nchoir director at Crescent Junior High School, which was still in \nconstruction when he was hired. Five years later, he began a very \ndistinguished eleven-year career as the band and orchestra director at \nSavannah High School in Anaheim. In 1978, Mr. Gunderson rose to the \ncollege ranks, serving as head of the jazz and student teacher programs \nat California State University at Fullerton.\n  Three years later, in 1981, Don Gunderson decided to return to high \nschool instruction at Los Altos High School, in Hacienda Heights. At \nthat time, Los Altos was one of the largest musical programs in \nSouthern California, with a strong reputation in marching band \ncompetitions. For the next nineteen years, Los Altos High School would \nbecome more than just the home of one of Southern California's largest \nmarching bands--it would be the site of one of our nation's \ninternationally recognized music education programs. The Los Altos \nEntertainment Unit has performed at the Fiesta Bowl pageant twice and \nmarched in the Tournament of Roses Parade four times. They've been here \nin Washington, where they performed at the White House, and traveled \nfor performances in Florida and the Bahamas.\n  Don Gunderson began building the music program's international \ncredentials in 1982, when he led the Los Altos Entertainment Unit on a \ntwo week tour of England and Scotland. Knowing that very few, if any \nAmericans, knew of Hacienda Heights, Mr. Gunderson was prepared when \ninquiring Brits asked where in the world is Hacienda Heights: ``We're \nnot far from Disneyland'' was his reply. It's safe to say that after \nthat 1982 trip, along with a return visit ten years later as guests of \nthe British Military as part of the prestigious Royal Tournament, the \npeople of Britain know how to find Hacienda Heights on a map. The same \ncan be said for music-lovers that had the good fortune to see and hear \nLos Altos perform in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. The Los \nAltos Entertainment Unit has been the recipient of countless awards and \nachievements. Los Altos was designated the Official Youth Band of the \n1984 Summer Olympics, and was crowned three times as marching band \nchampions at the Southern California Tournament of Champions. And \nthat's just the marching band, color guard and dance team. Don \nGunderson brought to Los Altos a commitment to a total music program, \nand strived to establish the same standard of excellence to the \norchestral and jazz programs.\n\n[[Page S3914]]\n\n  Perhaps just as significant are the signs of recognition and respect \ngiven to this program in ways other than award ceremonies. Go to a \nFriday night football game at Los Altos and you're sure to find a few \nyoung people from other high schools in Southern California in the \nstands not to see the football team, but to watch and hear the \nEntertainment Unit. Those same football games certainly sparked the \nimaginations of young elementary and junior high school students, who \nwould come home interested in learning music and being a part of the \nEntertainment Unit. Come to the football field on a night when the \nEntertainment Unit is rehearsing and you're sure to find parents, \nstudents, teachers, former students, and even students from other high \nschools in the stands. Trace the career paths of those who learned from \nDon Gunderson and yes, you'll find those who have gone on to rewarding \ncareers in music and music education. However, there are many more \nalumni of the Los Altos Entertainment Unit that pursued other careers, \nbut they carry with them lessons learned from Don Gunderson on football \nfields, concert halls, or the band room that go beyond musical notes on \na page--lessons in teamwork, preparation, determination, and \nexcellence.\n  Mr. President, those who have learned and applied these and countless \nother lessons from Don Gunderson will have an opportunity to say thanks \nin a few short weeks. Let me join them in expressing my admiration to a \nman who has brought the joy of music to thousands of students and \nparents, and to countless more around the world who have heard the \nstirring opening fanfare, ``Conquistadores.'' Perhaps more important, \nlet me express my own thanks to Don Gunderson for the honor and \ninspiration he has brought to the teaching profession for more than \nforty years. To borrow from the Los Altos motto, Don Gunderson has \nengaged and conquered.\n  I wish Don Gunderson, his wife Judy and his family, all the very \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3914-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REAR ADMIRAL STEPHEN TODD FISHER\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nhonor Rear Admiral (Upper Half) Stephen Todd Fisher as he retires from \nthe United States Navy after more than thirty-four years of active duty \nservice. For the last five years, Rear Admiral Fisher has been the \nDeputy Surgeon General of the Navy-the first non-physician officer to \nserve in that position.\n  In addition, Rear Admiral Fisher was the first Medical Service Corps \nofficer to be selected by a board to the rank of two-star Admiral \nwithin the Department of Defense. He served as the Director of the \nMedical Service Corps from 1993--1995. RADM Fisher's assignments \nincluded tours on the U.S.S Repose (AH 16); Headquarters, Fleet Marine \nForce, Pacific; various Navy Hospitals and Clinics; the Naval School of \nHealth Sciences; the office of the Chief of Naval Operations; and the \nHeadquarters for Navy Medicine. He is also the recipient of the 2000 \nAmerican Hospital Association award for Excellence in Federal Service.\n  Rear Admiral Fisher's leadership as the Executive Agent for the \nDepartment of Defense Clinical Business Area led to the development of \na computerized patient record which will be tested and evaluated this \nsummer for government-wide adoption. This accomplishment has been \nhighly praised by the National Library of Medicine Board of Regents and \ncompletes the planning segment of the Composite Health Care System II \nprogram. As Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Government \nComputerized Patient Record, Rear Admiral Fisher coordinated linkage \nbetween the Department of Veteran's Health Administration, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Indian Health Services. A prototype of \nthe Computerized Patient Record has been developed and will be alpha \ntested in Alaska in 2001. Under his leadership, the Composite Health \nCare System II Program Office was selected for the Government \nTechnology Leadership Award and the Smithsonian Technology Award in \nrecognition of its visionary use of information technology.\n  As a principal member of the Military Health System Information \nManagement Proponent Committee, Rear Admiral Fisher worked closely with \nthe Deputy Surgeons General of the Air Force and Army, and the \nExecutive Director of the Defense Medical Information Management System \norchestrating the development, prioritization, and achievement of \ninformation management goals for medical readiness and peacetime health \ncare programs for the Department of Defense. His contributions are far-\nreaching and will positively impact military health care for years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, Rear Admiral Fisher's many meritorious awards and \ndecorations demonstrate his contributions in a tangible way, but it is \nthe legacy he leaves behind for the Navy Medical Service Corps, the \nUnited States Navy, and the Department of Defense for which we are most \nappreciative. It is with pride that I congratulate Rear Admiral Fisher \non his outstanding career of exemplary service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3914-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3914-S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF JO-ANN MOLNAR\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to share just a few \nwords about a good friend we recently lost, someone I have known since \nI first ran for Lieutenant Governor in Massachusetts in 1982, a good \nhearted and selfless individual who was always an inspiration, Jo-Ann \nMolnar. Jo-Ann recently passed away after bravely battling cancer, and \nI know that I am not alone in saying that as someone whose life was \ntouched by Jo-Ann Molnar's service, activism, and warmth, there is \ntoday a deep and profound sense of loss. In Jo-Ann many of us have \nlost--and today I would like to honor--a committed activist, a person \nof enormous courage and character and, most simply, a great friend.\n  I first met Jo-Ann Molnar when I was running for Lieutenant Governor \nof Massachusetts, and Jo-Ann approached me at one of our earliest \nevents and offered to help in any way she could. It was on that race in \nthe middle of a difficult and heated campaign that Jo-Ann first \ndemonstrated to me not just that she was an indefatigable volunteer, \nbut that she was one of those individuals who--through her commitment \nto do what is right, through her belief in politics not as sport but as \na fight for principle--could reaffirm precisely why politics matters \nand why public service is worthwhile.\n  Jo-Ann and I remained close ever since that first campaign, and I \nlooked forward to and always appreciated Jo-Ann's warm cards and \ngreetings. Always a loyal friend, Jo-Ann would share with me her \nthoughts on issues of importance, keep me abreast of her \naccomplishments, and offer me words of encouragement as I worked to \nfind my way in the United States Senate.\n  It was through her frequent cards and letters--and the occasional \nhappy meeting either in Massachusetts or at political gatherings around \nthe Maryland area--that I learned of the many ways in which Jo-Ann \ncontinued to dedicate herself to public service. Her determination to \nmake a difference led her to remarkable achievements. In 1977, Jo-Ann \ngraduated magna cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University, with a \ndegree in history and political science. She went on to earn a master's \ndegree in political science from American University. Jo-Ann selflessly \noffered her leadership to her fellow Democrats, serving admirably as \nPresident of the Montgomery County, Maryland Young Democrats, as Vice \nChair of the Handicapped Commission in Montgomery County, and on the \nBoard of Directors of the Montgomery County public libraries. In \naddition to her help with my campaigns, Jo-Ann served as a legislative \nintern to U.S. Senator Donald Reigle, U.S. Representative Gene Andrew \nMaguire, and Montgomery County Council member Michael L. Gudis. She \nalso worked as a Congressional Liaison Assistant for the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. For almost a decade, Jo-Ann \nserved as a legal researcher for the Human Relations Commission. She \ngave of herself as a Sunday School teacher and a confirmation teacher \nat the Foundary United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C, as well as \nan instructor at Colesville United Methodist Church in Silver Spring, \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, Jo-Ann lived a life true to her ideals of service--\nservice to community, service to faith. I would add, though, that none \nof these achievements would have been possible if Jo-Ann had not worked \nso hard to overcome cerebral palsy. Jo-Ann refused to be slowed by her \ndisability--\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\nand in fact rejected the notion that she should in any way lower her \nexpectations for herself or expect different expectations from those to \nwhom she so selflessly offered her best efforts. Jo-Ann was a fighter, \nand I continually marveled at her drive to rise above what some would \nview as limitations.\n  For that reason, Jo-Ann served as one of the best possible advocates \nand activists for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Honored as a \nteenager for her activism on the Education for All Handicapped Children \nAct, Jo-Ann kept pushing as an adult to break down barriers in our \nsociety that she believed kept disabled Americans from maximizing their \ncontributions to their communities and our nation. Jo-Ann was not just \nan advocate for legislation to protect and empower disabled Americans--\nshe was the living embodiment of those efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is difficult to accept that we have all lost a \nfriend in Jo-Ann Molnar, but it is particularly difficult, I know, for \nJo-Ann's family--her mother, Helen, and her two sisters, Dorothy and \nIlona. They are in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I was comforted, though, to learn that Jo-Ann was able to enjoy life \nas she had always done, up until her last days. Jo-Ann's mother, Helen, \nlet me know that she had a wonderful Christmas with her family and was \nable to attend a New Millenium New Year's Eve celebration, complete \nwith the 60's rock music she loved. Just as she did throughout her \nlife, even in her most difficult days, Jo-Ann kept on doing the things \nthat she loved--and she moved forward in so many remarkable efforts \ndriven by a real sense of social conscience.\n  Mr. President, today I remember Jo-Ann for her service, her \nfriendship, and her kindness. All of us who knew her continue to draw \nstrength from her courage and her faith, and Jo-Ann's life continues to \ninspire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3915-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3915-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3709.

A bill to amend the Robert R. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to include airplane and rail accidents within \nthe meaning of the term ``major disaster''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n     amendment to stafford act to cover airline and rail accidents\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance \nAct. Senator Stafford, my Vermont colleague whose seat in this body I \nam honored to hold today, authored the legislation creating FEMA more \nthan 25 years a go. Thanks to his foresight and leadership in this \narea, the federal government has helped thousands of ordinary citizens \nrecover from disasters and other incidents beyond their control.\n  Today we have a chance to build on the legacy of Senator Stafford by \nadding airline and rail accidents to the list of ``major disasters'' \ndefined in the act that governs the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency.\n  While extremely rare occurrences, major airline and rail disasters \nplace an incredible burden on the states and municipalities in which \nthey occur. Due in part to the extraordinary level of national \nattention these accidents receive, states and municipalities face \nmillions of dollars in unexpected and unbudgeted expenditures that \noften cripple local finances. Fees associated with initial response, \nsecurity, and other health and safety measures often cost several \nmillion dollars.\n  This legislation standardizes procedure for federal reimbursement of \naffected communities. While the federal government has regularly \nreimbursed states and municipalities during the 1990s for their role in \nthese most national of disasters, the process is an ad hoc one. This \nbody has considered and approved at least three special line item \nappropriations for areas affected by the recent ValueJet, TWA, and \nCOMAIR accidents. A bill to reimburse Rhode Island for its costs \nassociated with last fall's Egypt Air disaster is currently working its \nway through the Congress as part of the appropriation for the National \nTransportation Safety Board.\n  This process causes needless headache and anxiety for local \ncommunities, as well as unnecessary chores for the NTSB and Congress. \nIt forces states and municipalities to wait as reimbursement requests \nfind their way through the complicated appropriations process while \ncreating more work for our overburdened appropriators.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. States and local communities spend \nmillions of dollars to respond to these accidents. While they are \nultimately reimbursed by the federal government, the uncertainty and \nslow pace of the process often places affected communities in a \nfinancial bind. Money that could be spent on education, health care, or \npublic safety is lost in an unnecessary limbo.\n  Under this bill, airline and rail accidents will be treated like any \nother disaster under the Stafford Act. Like an earthquake, blizzard or \nany other disaster, FEMA, upon the request of a governor, will examine \nthe scene of such an accident and advise the President on whether \nfederal reimbursement is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, this bill simply standardizes procedure for a \ncommitment already made by the federal government. It requires to new \ncosts or expenses\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nand actually saves money by streamlining a bureaucratic and complicated \nprocess. The International Association of Emergency Managers and the \nNTSB supports this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join these groups in supporting this bill \nthat will bring standardization to an ad hoc process that has the \npotential to cause so much harm to our states and communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2544. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \ncompensation and benefits to children of female Vietnam veterans who \nwere born with certain birth defects, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n        Children of Women Vietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and \nSenator Murray, I wish to introduce a bill, the Children of Women \nVietnam Veterans' Benefits Act of 2000, which would amend title 38, \nUnited States Code, to provide compensation and benefits to children \nborn with certain birth defects to women Vietnam veterans.\n  This bill is essentially similar, except for minor technical \ncorrections, to S. 2494, the Children of Female Vietnam Veterans' \nBenefits Act of 2000, which I introduced on May 2, 2000. Mrs. Murray \nhad asked to be an original cosponsor of that bill, but through an \ninadvertent clerical error, she was not listed as an original cosponsor \non the bill when it was printed. I wish to note, for the record, that \nit was her intent to be an original cosponsor of S. 2494.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the enhancement to study, research, \nand other activities in the United States relating to information \ntechnology and information protection technology; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\nbarry goldwater scholarship and excellence in education enhancement act\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to increase the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and \nExcellence in Education Foundation from the current $61 million to $81 \nmillion. I am pleased to have the support and able assistance of the \nSenior Senator from Nebraska, Senator J. Robert Kerrey in joining me to \nintroduce this bill. This increase allows the Foundation to add another \n100 young people to the 300 that they now support. This substantial \nincrease will augment the influence the Foundation already has on \nAmerican higher education.\n  Goldwater scholarships are awarded to college juniors and seniors in \nmath and science. The increased funding in this legislation is set \naside for information technology students. Channeling these funds \nthrough the existing Goldwater framework will maximize the amount of \nmoney directly available to students. These students are selected on \nthe basis of academic merit from a field of approximately 1,200 \nmathematics, science and engineering students nominated by the \nfaculties of colleges and universities from the fifty states and Puerto \nRico. Since 1988, 2,711 scholarships have been awarded, providing about \n$28 million to outstanding scholars from colleges and universities \nthroughout the United States.\n  Goldwater Scholars are top notch. As evidence, I cite the large \nnumber of Goldwater Scholars who have been awarded prestigious graduate \nscholarships. Goldwater Scholars have won a total of 25 Rhodes \nScholarships over the years. Last year alone, almost 20 percent of the \nawards--six out of 32--were Goldwater Scholars. Goldwater Scholars also \npopulate the ranks of other distinguished fellowships. In the last \neleven years, the scholars have won 19 Marshall, six Churchill, nine \nFulbright, 23 Hughes, and 65 National Science Foundation fellowships.\n  These are the students we need in our economy. For the U.S. to \ncontinue to be competitive and support our growing economy, we must \nencourage our young men and women to enter the high technology \nindustry. America's explosive demand for highly skilled workers is \ncreating a new labor shortage. Under current conditions, we do not have \nenough U.S. workers trained in high technology fields. This forces our \nlocal businesses to resort to immigration to make up for this \nshortfall. Highly skilled immigrants enter the country under the H1-B \nvisa waiver program. To help meet the growing demand, Congress raised \nthe cap on H1-B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 in FY 1999 and 2000, and \n107,500 in 2001. Unfortunately, even this increase is not enough. A \ntight labor market, increasing globalization and burgeoning economic \ngrowth continue to increase U.S. demands for highly skilled workers. \nThe 1999 cap on H-1B visas was reached in June of last year and it is \nprojected we will reach the cap even earlier this year. Later this \nmonth, we expect the Senate to consider another increase of H1-B visas \nto raise the cap to 195,000 a year for FY 2000, 2001 and 2002.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, I firmly believe that we have the \nresponsibility to adequately train our own labor force to meet the \nbusiness and industry demands of today and tomorrow. We simply cannot \nrely on workers from other countries to do our sensitive technology \nwork. As we saw in the Y2K reprogram with our great dependence on \nforeign security workers, we are sorely in need of a domestic \ntechnology workforce.\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this effort to expand the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship and \nExcellence in Education Foundation and renew our commitment to \neducating young people in the fields of math and science. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS UNDER BARRY GOLDWATER \n                   SCHOLARSHIP AND EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION PROGRAM \n                   FOR STUDY RELATING TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \n                   AND INFORMATION PROTECTION TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       (a) Availability.--Section 1405(a) of the Barry Goldwater \n     Scholarship and Excellence in Education Act (title XIV of \n     Public Law 99-661; 20 U.S.C. 4704(a)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``science and mathematics'' and inserting ``science, \n     mathematics, and information technology and information \n     protection technology''; and\n       (2) in paragraphs (2) and (3), by striking ``mathematics \n     and the natural sciences'' and inserting ``mathematics, the \n     natural sciences, and information technology and information \n     protection technology''.\n       (b) Funding.--(1) There is authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2001, $20,000,000 for deposit in the Barry \n     Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Fund \n     established by section 1408(a) of the Barry Goldwater \n     Scholarship and Excellence in Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     4707(a)).\n       (2) Amounts deposited under paragraph (1) in the Fund \n     referred to in that paragraph shall be available for purposes \n     of providing scholarships and fellowships under section \n     1405(a) of that Act, as amended by subsection (a) of this \n     section, for persons pursuing study in the field of \n     information technology and information protection \n     technology.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in today's information age, the threat of \nelectronic attack is more likely than a\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\nnuclear attack. Words such as ``cyber-terrorism'' and ``hackers'' have \ncrept into everyday talk, no longer confined to the world of computer \nnerds and geeks. Despite being one of the most technologically-advanced \ncountries in the world, United States technology is not capable of \nkeeping intruders out and secrets in. Flaws have been found in the \ncomputer systems of the Pentagon, IRS, bank networks, utility \ncompanies, and telecommunications providers, among others, making all \nof them vulnerable to attack.\n  The question, then, is what can we do as a country to protect both \nthe government and industries from electronic attack? I believe we need \nto start early to equip more people with technological skills needed to \nbuild and maintain secure information technology networks. Today, along \nwith my good friend Senator Roberts from Kansas, I am pleased to be \nintroducing legislation that will do just that.\n  The vehicle we use to achieve this is the highly reputable Barry M. \nGoldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation, which \ncurrently awards scholarships to college juniors and seniors studying \nmath and science. I doubt any of my colleagues would dispute the vast \nsuccess of the Goldwater foundation. Nearly 20 percent of last year's \nRhodes Scholars were Goldwater Scholars first; and in the last eleven \nyears, Goldwater Scholars have won 19 Marshall, 6 Churchill, 9 \nFulbright, 23 Hughes, 65 NSF and numerous other fellowships.\n  Our bill is simple: We increase funding for the Goldwater foundation \nby 20 million dollars, taking it from 61 to 81 million dollars. That \nmoney will go for scholarships to a new category of students, those \nstudying ``information protection technology''. By training these young \npeople, we can set up our technological infrastructure so it becomes \nsafe from intruders.\n  Let me paint you a picture. Fifty years ago we suffered a devastating \nattack on Pearl Harbor. The siege lasted five hours. 2403 lives were \nlost, as were twenty ships and 188 aircraft. That attack catapulted the \nUnited States into World War II. As a country, however, we emerged from \nthe war more powerful than we had been entering it. Along with the \nSoviet Union, the U.S. was deemed a ``superpower,'' and we have yet to \ngive up that title.\n  A devastating attack today would take a much different form and have \nmuch more catastrophic consequences. We are not likely to be attacked \nby airplanes and ships. Rather, it is far more likely that we will be \nattacked through our technology systems. The attack can occur in as \nlittle as ten seconds, and the effects can devastate our whole \nindustrial and governmental infrastructure. A cyber-terrorist can wipe \nout all financial records, plunge aircraft from the air with no \nwarning, corrupt our entire national defense system, and render \ntelecommunications useless. And it can happen in just seconds, \nvirtually undetected. And we were worried about Y2K.\n  If this scenario frightens you, good. These threats are very real, \nand with our growing dependence on informational systems, as a country \nwe become more vulnerable every day. One needs to look no further than \nthe now infamous ``I love you'' computer virus that swept this world \nlast week to get a glimpse at how quickly this can occur, and how \ndevastating such an attack can be.\n  The Pentagon, other government agencies, and many industries have set \nup departments to handle cyber-security, but we need to do everything \nwe can to ensure that these departments can be staffed by knowledgeable \ninformation-protection experts. Without skilled staff, these \ndepartments are useless. The Information Protection Technology \nScholarships will help ensure that the students in college have the \nopportunity to learn as much as possible about protecting technology. \nIn turn, these students will repay the nation by putting their skills \nto work to make our technological infrastructure more secure. Twenty \nmillion dollars is not much to ask for to protect the entire United \nStates from the possibility of wide-ranging cyber-terrorism.\n  One final note. With such a shortage of qualified American workers, \nAmerica's high tech industry is hiring people from other countries to \ncome to the United States and fill these jobs. Highly trained \nimmigrants enter this country under the H1-B visa program. Congress \nraised the cap on H1-B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for FY '99, and it \nwasn't enough: we reached that cap by June last year. Later this month, \nthe Senate is expected to consider another increase of H1-B visas to \n195,000 per year for FY00, 01 and 02. I support this proposed increase; \nhowever, I firmly believe we must do everything in our power to grow \nour own labor force. That is why I intend to offer this bill as an \namendment to S. 2045 when it is considered on the Senate floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Ashcroft, \n        and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 2546. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the use of \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether, to provide flexibility within the \noxygenate requirement of the reformulated gasoline program of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to promote the use of renewable \nethanol, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environmental and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n              clean air and water preservation act of 2000\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the \nClean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 with my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin. Our bill will accomplish the following: 1. \nPhases down to elimination MTBE within 3 years of enactment; 2. \nMaintains the oxygenate standard; 3. Probably has the strongest \nenvironmental anti-backsliding provisions of any bill; 4. A temporary \nwaiver from oxygenate standard could be granted if the USDA and DOE \ncertify that there is an issue with supply; and 5. Highway \napportionment percentages will stay the same.\n  Low grain prices high fuel prices, and the clean water problems \nassociated with MTBE have highlighted the need for this bipartisan \neffort to protect our water, protect our air, and to protect our rural \neconomy. Our region and the nation require a renewable, environmentally \nfriendly alternative to MTBE that helps create local jobs, which adds \nvalue to our farmer's product, which moves us away from an energy-\nhostage situation where our reliance on foreign-produced oil makes our \nproducers, consumers and economy subject to the whims of international \ncartel autocrats, and protects our air and water.\n  My colleagues and friends on this issue, Senators Daschle and Lugar, \nhave also introduced a bill on this issue. I commend them for their \ninvolvement and look forward to working with them; however, I do not \nbelieve their bill solves all the problems. Specifically, their bill \neliminates the oxygenate requirement.\n  The federal oxygen-content requirement was adopted for several \nreasons. First, Congress understood that oxygenates provide a source of \nclean octane-displacing toxic compounds such as benzene and reducing \nozone-forming exhaust emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. \nSecond, Congress recognized the energy-security benefits of \nsubstituting a certain percentage of imported petroleum with \ndomestically-produced, renewable fuels such as ethanol. Finally, the \nCongress hoped the Federal oxygen requirement could provide new market \nopportunities for farmers by stimulating new demand for ethanol. I \nbelieve each of these objectives remain as valid today as they were in \n1990.\n  Unfortunately, the refiners' decision to utilize MTBE, rather than \nethanol, has created a serious and growing problem nationwide. The U.S. \nGeological Survey reports that MTBE has been detected in 21 percent of \nthe drinking water wells in RFG areas nationwide. States with detected \nMTBE water contamination include Missouri, Illinois, California, Texas, \nVirginia, Florida, Connecticut, and many more.\n  It is important to recognize that the Clean Air Act Amendments of \n1990 did not mandate the use of MTBE. Indeed, in Chicago and other \nareas where ethanol RFG is used, the program has been declared a huge \nair quality success. Replicating the Chicago ethanol RFG model in areas \nwhere MTBE is being used today would assure continued air quality \nprogress without compromising water quality by its use. It would also \nprovide a tremendous economic stimulus to rural America by creating \nvalue-added demand for as\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nmuch as 500 million bushels of grain. The Department of Agriculture \nrecently reported that replacing MTBE with ethanol in RFG markets would \nincrease net farm income $1 billion annually, create 13,000 new jobs, \nenhance our balance of trade and reduce farm program costs over the \nnext ten years. Moreover, USDA reports ethanol can replace MTBE without \nprice spikes or shortages in supplies within three years.\n  Let us be very clear about this issue. The environmental problem at \nhand is real. However, the problem is not ethanol, the problem is MTBE.\n  Fortunately some States are already taking action to ban MTBE. Some \nare not moving fast enough. We need to make certain that all States ban \nMTBE to eliminate its contamination of our water supplies. To ensure \nthat we do not have a piecemeal approach to banning MTBE it is \nimportant to pass legislation to ensure we have a national solution.\n  This bill is supported by the National Corn Growers, Missouri Corn \nGrowers, Renewable Fuels Association, and the Missouri Farm Bureau. I \nlook forward to other groups supporting this bill as well.\n  I am pleased that Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, and Senator \nAshcroft have joined me in introducing this vitally important bill. I \nlook forward to working with them and all the other members that join \nus in this endeavor to ensure that we have a national solution that \nwill protect our water and still ensure that we maintain our air \nquality benefits produced from the Federal oxygenate requirement. In \naddition, we will be promoting positive energy and rural economic \npolicy objectives, which includes ethanol.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, in introducing the Clean Air and Water \nPreservation Act of 2000, a bill that will ban the gasoline additive \nMTBE and promote the use of renewable ethanol fuel.\n  By now, many of us are aware of the dangers methyl tertiary butyl \nether (MTBE) poses to our environment, our water supply, and our \ncommunities. Although this additive has only been widely used for about \nfive years, it is now one of the most frequently detected volatile \norganic chemicals in drinking water supplies across the nation. In \nfact, MTBE contamination has affected communities in my home state of \nIllinois raising many public health concerns.\n  This legislation addresses these problems by banning MTBE within \nthree years and urging refiners to replace it with ethanol. The bill \nalso increases consumer protection by requiring gasoline stations to \nlabel pumps that still sell MTBE. And the Environmental Protection \nAgency is directed to assist states in getting the chemical out of \ntheir groundwater.\n  Furthermore, the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 \nincludes strict anti-backsliding provisions to ensure we do not lose \nthe air quality benefits that we have already achieved. Protection from \ntoxic chemicals and environmentally sound emission levels will not be \ncompromised.\n  Most important, this legislation upholds the air quality benefits of \nthe reformulated gasoline (RFG) program by maintaining the oxygenate \nstandard. Adding oxygen to our gasoline has helped clean the air in \nmany cities across the nation. With the use of ethanol, the Chicago RFG \nprogram has proven highly successful in improving the air quality in \nIllinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.\n  I am proud to say that Illinois is the nation's largest ethanol \nproducer and that one in every six rows of Illinois corn--280 million \nbushels--goes to ethanol production. But, an expanded role for this \nrenewable fuel is more than a boost to industry; it is jobs to rural \nAmerica, and it is energy security. As we look for solutions to high \noil prices, we must remember that ethanol is a viable alternative \nfuel--domestically produced and environmentally friendly. In fact, \nevery 23 gallons of ethanol displaces a barrel of foreign oil.\n  I commend the Clinton administration and Senators Daschle and Lugar \nfor their efforts aimed at solving the problems associated with MTBE \nand opening a dialogue on renewable fuel content standards. However, I \nstrongly feel we need to maintain our commitment to preserving the \noxygenate standard, which has proven to be integral to achieving the \ngoals of the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 is good for our \nenvironment and public health and a boost for rural economies. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \nSenator Bond and Senator Durbin, as an original cosponsor to the Clean \nAir and Water Preservation Act of 2000. I commend them for their \nleadership in resolving a very real problem--not a phony problem.\n  The real problem is that MTBE is contaminating our Nation's water \nsupplies.\n  The phony problem is the proposition that the Clean Air Act's \noxygenate standard caused the MTBE water contamination.\n  Unfortunately, powerful, influential forces are trying to sucker \nCongress and the American public into embracing the phony problem.\n  Some propagandists of the phony problem may be motivated by greed. \nAfter all, if the petroleum industry gets its way, its profits will \nballoon. If they can get Congress or the administration to grant \nwaivers of the oxygenate standard, big oil will be able to squeeze out \nthe 3 to 4 percent of the market currently supplied by alternatives.\n  The Department of Energy has determined that even a small amount of \nalternative fuels can save consumers billions of dollars each year by \nleveraging lower gasoline prices.\n  Petroleum companies also tell us that they can produce a gasoline \njust as clean for the air, but without oxygenates. Of course, they tell \nyou that it will come at some extra cost.\n  Mr. President, I must ask my colleagues: Do we really need to give \nthe petroleum industry both the ability and the excuse to jack up \ngasoline prices and further gouge American consumers?\n  Of course not. And the way to make certain this does not happen is by \nenacting the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000.\n  Other propagandists of the phony problem may be political \nopportunists seeking to engage in some self-serving election-year \nshenanigans.\n  The Clinton administration is facing a tough political dilemma. \nChevron and other petroleum interests have convinced California's \nGovernor that the only solution to the MTBE problem is to waive the \noxygenate requirement.\n  California represents enormous political stakes for November's \nelections. Understandably, the Clinton administration does not want to \nsay ``no'' to California.\n  But the Clinton administration does not want to say ``no'' to \nAmerica's farmers. If the administration gives California and other \nstates a waiver from the oxygenate standard, they will have single-\nhandedly destroyed a $1 billion per year market for America's farmers.\n  So, what's the easy political solution? Simple. Throw the hot-potato \ninto the laps of Congress. Hold a press conference laying out quote, \nend-quote, legislative principles for solving the MTBE problem.\n  By dumping this on Congress, the administration does not have to make \nthe tough decisions, and will be in a position to second-guess and \nattack anything and everything Congress does do to try to work this \nout.\n  And the irony of all of this, is that had the Clinton administration \nfollowed Congressional intent about the Clean Air Act Reformulated \nFuels Program, instead of listening to the oil companies and some \nmisguided environmentalists, other oxygenates such as ethanol could \nhave competed with MTBE, and we would have far less MTBE water \ncontamination today.\n  The Clinton administration was warned loud and clear about the health \nand environmental problems of MTBE. I personally sent many letters and \nmade a lengthy floor statement in 1993 warning then about MTBE and \nurging that they not give Big Oil a regulation guaranteeing them a \nmarket monopoly over the oxygenated problem.\n  Anyone who has ever smelled MTBE, knows that had consumers been given \na choice, they would have overwhelmingly chose to buy reformulated fuel \nmade with ethanol, not MTBE.\n  So the Clinton administration created this MTBE problem in the first\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\nplace, and now they tell the world that the only way to correct it is \nfor Congress to fix it.\n\n  That's just not true. But the truth sort of got lost during the \nadministration's press conference by EPA's Carol Browner. She forgot to \ntell the American public the truth that each and every State has the \nauthority to protect its water supplies from MTBE contamination. As \nlong as the States pass laws designed to protect the water, as opposed \nto protecting the air, the Clean Air Act does not legally pre-empt the \nStates from taking action on their own.\n  And I received assurances from EPA during a recent hearing that they \nwould never attempt to stop a State from protecting water supplies from \nMTBE contamination.\n  Now, some would argue that the oil industry would try to challenge \nsuch efforts in court.\n  Mr. President, that proposition is ridiculous. The oil companies \nchose to use MTBE instead of ethanol. They are now liable for what \ncould be billions of dollars of MTBE clean up costs. And these \nliability costs mount with every day that passes, that the oil \ncompanies refuse to replace MTBE with other oxygenates.\n  Therefore, who in their right mind could think that the oil companies \nare stupid enough to take court action to block a State from banning \nthe use of MTBE?\n  So, why didn't EPA's Carol Browner announce to the world the States \nalready have the authority to ban MTBE--the source of the real problem?\n  Well, if the administration admits the truth, and if they fail to \nconvince Americans and Congress that only Congress can fix this \nproblem, then the Clinton administration is stuck back at ``square \none'' having to choose between California or America's farmers who have \nsuffered the lowest prices in decades.\n  Mr. President, there are others pushing the phony problem who may \nsimply be struggling to save face, hoping that they not suffer the \nembarrassment of being proven wrong--wrong in their efforts to help \npetroleum interests in securing a Clinton administration regulation \nguaranteeing that MTBE would monopolize the oxygenate market.\n  These environmentalists would like the public to believe that ethanol \nwas never really a viable option--not then, not now. If they ever \nconcede that point, then it will be clear to Americans that these \nenvironmentalists were key promoters of what has turned out to be one \nof the biggest environmental crises ever to face America.\n  Mr. President, there are some environmentalists who do not like \nethanol, simply because it is something that can be made by farmers. \nThey don't like farmers because sometimes they have to use fertilizers \nand chemicals. It is that simple-minded.\n  Mr. President, the real problem is MTBE, and the real solution to \nthis problem is passing the bill introduced today by our colleagues \nSenator Bond and Senator Durbin.\n  I warn my colleagues, however, that if they buy into the phony \nproblem, they will end up having to buy into phony solutions.\n  For instance, the Clinton administration suggested that Congress \nmight want to only reduce the amount of MTBE used, as opposed to \nbanning it altogether. Well, that's a phony solution.\n  No level of MTBE in gasoline can protect our water supply.\n  My State of Iowa is facing an MTBE water contamination disaster. \nFirst, understand, we sell no Clean Air Act reformulated gasoline in \nIowa. Second, understand that for years now, no gasoline was supposed \nto be sold in Iowa that contained more than 1 percent MTBE unless \nwarning labels were posted.\n  Nevertheless, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources recently found \nthat 29 percent of Iowa's water supplies tested contained MTBE above \nthe acceptable levels established by EPA.\n  So what does this mean? Simply this: MTBE is used in conventional \nfuel as an octane enhancer and will contaminate your water.\n  If a State is allowed to waive out of the oxygenate requirement, MTBE \nwill still be used and will continue to contaminate our water supplies.\n  It is phony to argue the oxygenate requirement is the problem, and it \nis phony to argue waiving or eliminating the oxygenate requirement will \nprotect our water supplies.\n  Mr. President, this is just one of many phony issues that we are \nbeing asked to embrace. I will be speaking further about this at a \nlater time.\n  But in closing, I ask my colleagues to cosponsor our legislation. It \nprovides real solutions to the real problem: MTBE water contamination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 2547. A bill to provide for the establishment of the Great Sand \nDunes National Park and the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve in the \nState of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n               great sand dunes national park act of 2000\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park and the Great Sand \nDunes National Preserve.\n  This legislation is a major step in protection and preservation of \nthe Great Sand Dunes and San Luis Valley water. I along with \nCongressman McInnis decided to introduce companion bills at the request \nof valley residents, locally elected officials and the Rio Grande Water \nConservation District. In an era of Presidential threats and \nquestionable uses of the Antiquities Act, a locally driven legislative \nprocess is something I strongly support.\n  Anyone who has visited the Sand Dunes understands the unique feeling \nthey offer the visitor, the dunes seem out of place--a contradiction in \nnature. The San Luis Valley serenely placed between the Sangre De \nCristo and the San Juan Mountains is the last place one would expect to \nsee 750 foot high sand dunes. Still, the Sand Dunes offered the early \nresidents and explorers a unique look into the earth's geological \nwonders. This bill will help to ensure that future generations have \nthat same opportunity.\n  Developing legislation that satisfies everyone is a difficult task, \nbut this bill reflects compromises on all sides and puts forth a unique \nproposal for a complicated issue. The provisions of the bill allow for \n(1) establishing the Great Sand Dunes National Park; (2) establishing \nthe Great Sand Dunes National Preserve; (3) the acquisition of the Luis \nMaria Baca Grant No. 4; (4) protection of San Luis Valley's water \nresources; (5) hunting in the new Great Sand Dunes National Preserve; \n(6) creation of a new National Wildlife Refuge and (7) a local advisory \ncouncil.\n  Protection of the valley's water resources is very important to the \ncitizens of Colorado and a primary motivation for virtually everyone's \nsupport for this measure. An integral part of the water component is \nthe federal acquisition of the Baca Ranch. While I am usually very \nskeptical of additional federal ownership of land, it makes sense here \nto purchase the land from willing sellers and incorporate it into the \ncombination park, wildlife refuge and forest. The legislation requires \nthe Department of the Interior to work with the State of Colorado to \nprotect the water dependent resources of the Sand Dunes while not \njeopardizing valid existing water rights held by others. I want to \nassure everyone that this bill does not create a federal reserve water \nright.\n  The Great Sand Dunes National Preserve allows the Secretaries of the \nInterior and Agriculture to transfer existing Forest Service lands to \nthe Park Service and manage these lands as a Preserve. The transfer \nwould allow the Park Service jurisdiction of the watershed affecting \nthe Sand Dunes, while not affecting the wilderness status or existing \nhunting in the area. As a veterinarian I understand and recognize \nhunting as an important tool in game management. The bill stipulates \nthat the Colorado Division of Wildlife will play an integral role in \ncontinued game management of the area.\n  The bill also creates a new National Wildlife Refuge on the western \nedge of the existing Baca Ranch and adjacent state trust lands. This \nnew Refuge will provide additional hunting opportunities in an area \nthat has been historically closed to public hunting. It has extensive \nwetlands and is home to an extensive diversity of plants and animals, \nincluding a large elk herd. The Refuge would also give the affected \ncounty an additional source of revenue\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nthrough the Refuge and Revenue Sharing Act as an offset to the loss of \nproperty taxes from the federal acquisition of the Baca.\n  President Herbert Hoover in 1932 recognized the unique \ncharacteristics of the sand dunes and wanted to protect their scenic, \nscientific and educational features. With the support of the local \ncommunity, the Great Sand Dunes National Monument was established. Now \nsixty-eight years later, residents of the San Luis Valley are \nadvocating expansion and upgrade of the national monument to a national \npark.\n  Last December, I along with Senator Campbell, Congressman McInnis, \nSecretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt and Colorado Attorney General \nKen Salazar met at the Great Sand Dunes to discuss the merits of \nexpanding and protecting the resources of the San Luis Valley. We all \nrecognized the significance of the meeting and vowed to work towards \npassage of a bill.\n  Our time is short in Congress this year, and soon I will be asking \nfor a hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \nThis is an important issue to Coloradans, and I look forward to Senate \npassage of my legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2548. A bill to provide that extension of nondiscriminatory trade \ntreatment to the People's Republic of China be contingent on the United \nStates and People's Republic of China entering into a bilateral \nagreement relating to enforcement; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n   securing heightened opportunities for workers, manufacturers, and \n                       agriculture exporters act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I want to discuss an issue that, \njudging from my discussions with Missourians, establishing the right \ntrade policy with China is of increasing concern to Americans, and \nMissourians in particular.\n  Missourians want more opportunities to use their economic freedom to \nshape the future for their families. They want increasing opportunities \nto sell their products. They want reciprocity and fairness. This is why \nI want to ensure that Missouri businesses, farmers, and workers will \nget what they are promised. Access to a market that is almost one-\nfourth of the world's population can create higher paying jobs. But if \nChina doesn't live up to its agreements like in the past--no new jobs \nwill be created in Missouri.\n  The WTO agreement that the United States concluded with China last \nNovember could give Missourians substantial benefits. Tariffs on \nindustrial goods could fall from 25 to 9 percent--this means that all \nof the parts manufacturer5s for aerospace, automobiles, appliances \nwould all face substantial ``tax decrease.'' Also, tariffs on \nagricultural goods would be reduced from 31 to 17 percent. Missouri, as \na leader in agricultural production, would benefit substantially from \nthese reductions. Cattlemen and pork producers would experience \nsignificant gains when tariffs are dropped to 12 percent. I also want \nMissouri farmers to have direct access to Chinese consumers instead of \nhaving to go through a bunch of middle-men. In addition, China has made \ncommitments to eliminate eventually many of its current restrictions on \nservices, such as distribution, banking, insurance, telecommunications, \naccounting, consulting, and other financial services.\n  But these are the promises that are on paper. Missourians in the \n``Show-Me'' state are leery of relying only on promises when they don't \nknow whether there is adequate enforcement. I've visited many factories \nwhere the workers want to make sure that they get a fair shake. They \nwant real opportunities. They don't want hollow promises. I've been all \nover the state visiting farm families, and this is what they want as \nwell.\n  Several of my constituents have a fairly accurate perspective on \nChina's record of not voluntarily living up to its agreements. Let me \nread from a constituent letter, from the International Association of \nMachinists and Aerospace Workers, District 9, Bridgeton, Mo., dated \nMarch 17, 2000:\n\n       China has a history of failing to live up to every other \n     trade agreement it has signed with the United States (the \n     1992 Memorandum on Prison Labor, the 1996 Bilateral Agreement \n     on Unilateral Property Rights, the 1994 Bilateral Agreement \n     on Textiles, and the 1992 memorandum of Understanding on \n     Market Access).\n\n  I think this constituent has a pretty accurate assessment of China's \ndismal trade record. Quite honestly, China's trade record has been \npoor. In a 1992 agreement, the so-called ``Market Access'' Agreement, \nMissouri farmers, ranchers, and workers weren't actually given much \nmarket access. In 1995 China eliminated 176 licensing requirements, but \nthen imposed 400 new de facto licensing requirements. By 1999, China \nhad removed over 1,0000 quotas and licenses, but the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative reports that China is erecting new barriers to restrict \nimports. Also, despite the commitment not to require import \nsubstitution, China announced a new ``Industrial Policy for the 1990s'' \nwhich could undermine the U.S. automobile, telecommunications, \ntransportation, machinery, electronics, and construction industries.\n\n  Another one of my constituents has additional concerns that once we \napprove PNTR, the U.S. will lose substantial leverage. From the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters of Kansas City, Mo, Local \nUnion No. 42, dated March 28, 2000:\n\n       Granting PNTR will . . . reduce our ability to use \n     unilateral tools to respond to continued Chinese failure to \n     live up to its commitments. Our ability to take unilateral \n     action is our only leverage against the Chinese government. \n     Proponents of PNTR admit that only by using unilateral \n     actions we were able to make even modest progress on \n     intellectual property rights. The Chinese government has not \n     lived up to the promises they made in every single trade \n     agreement signed with the U.S. in the past ten years.\n\n  This Missourian is absolutely correct. In 1994 when we negotiated the \nWTO, the United States gave up the right to threaten a level of \nretaliation that was ``appropriate in the circumstances'' to get \ncompliance. However, now we are bound to retaliate at a level that the \nWTO decides. We have seen where this has taken us with exporting our \nbeef to Europe--absolutely nowhere.\n  We need to avoid creating an endless lawsuit with China that gets us \nnowhere. Missourians want some guarantees that they will in fact get \nexport opportunities and not just a lot of litigation with no real \nresults as with the Europeans in the beef and banana cases, where the \nretaliation level was reduced by the WTO body.\n  My goal is consistent with the ``show me'' state. It is straight-\nforward. Open China's market to Missouri goods and services. In order \nto do that, however, we must have enforcement that works. That is why I \nam proposing the ``SHOW ME'' Act.\n  My bill is simple. It would require the Administration to work out an \narrangement with China whereby if the U.S. wins a WTO case but can't \nget compliance, China would agree not to challenge the U.S. level of \nretaliation. The Administration could negotiate this concession from \nChina as a side letter to the November agreement or could negotiate as \na part of the protocol of the accession phase.\n  There is precedent for this requirement. The Administration \nnegotiated a 12 to 15 year phase out of special rules for safeguards \nand anti-dumping and countervailing duties (which are tools to protect \nour market), yet they did not work out a 15 year phase out of use of \nSection 301 (which is a foreign market opening tool). Both are needed--\nsurge protection and market access tools. Market access is crucial to \nthe farming community in Missouri, which gets about one-fourth of its \nfarm income from overseas sales.\n  In closing, Mr. President, quite frankly, there is declining \nsatisfaction in America's heartland with our inability to pry open \nforeign markets. The only way we will rebuild is with real enforcement. \nA lot of my constituents from the ``Show Me'' state want to see more \nassurances from us and the Administration that what happened on the EU \nbeef and banana cases won't reverberate through the Chinese market. \nThey want our trade policy to create jobs in practice, not just in \ntheory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3922-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3922-S3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 s. 74\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Bryan) was added as a cosponsor of S. 74, a bill to amend the Fair \nLabor Standards Act of 1938 to provide more\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\neffective remedies to victims of discrimination in the payment of wages \non the basis of sex, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 746\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, his name was added as a \ncosponsor of S. 746, a bill to provide for analysis of major rules, to \npromote the public's right to know the costs and benefits of major \nrules, and to increase the accountability of quality of Government.\n\n\n                                 S. 779\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Daschle) and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 779, a bill to provide that no Federal income \ntax shall be imposed on amounts received by Holocaust victims or their \nheirs.\n\n\n                                 S. 890\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the name of the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 890, a bill to \nfacilitate the naturalization of aliens who served with special \nguerrilla units or irregular forces in Laos.\n\n\n                                S. 1020\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Enzi) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1020, a bill to amend chapter \n1 of title 9, United States Code, to provide for greater fairness in \nthe arbitration process relating to motor vehicle franchise contracts.\n\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the names of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) were added \nas cosponsors of S. 1028, a bill to simplify and expedite access to the \nFederal courts for injured parties whose rights and privileges, secured \nby the United States Constitution, have been deprived by final actions \nof Federal agencies, or other government officials or entities acting \nunder color of State law, and for other purposes.\n  At the request of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, his name was added as \ncosponsor of S. 1028, supra.\n\n\n                                S. 1185\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1185, a bill to \nprovide small business certain protections from litigation excesses and \nto limit the product liability of non-manufacturer product sellers.\n\n\n                                S. 1322\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Wellstone) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1322, a bill to prohibit \nhealth insurance and employment discrimination against individuals and \ntheir family members on the basis of predictive genetic information or \ngenetic services.\n\n\n                                S. 1638\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith of New Jersey, his name was added as a \ncosponsor of S. 1638, a bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to extend the retroactive eligibility data for \nfinancial assistance for higher education for spouses and dependent \nchildren of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who are \nkilled in the line of duty.\n\n\n                                S. 1658\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1658, a bill to \nauthorize the construction of a Reconciliation Place in Fort Pierre, \nSouth Dakota, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                s. 1691\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inhofe, the names of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Baucus) and the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1691, a bill to amend the Robert T.

Res. 306\n\n       Whereas motherhood is a God-given right of women to bear \n     and rear children;\n       Whereas, since 1914, the United States has officially \n     observed the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day to display \n     public expression of love and reverence for all American \n     mothers;\n       Whereas Mother's Day is recognized by the United States and \n     many other countries in affirmation of the invaluable role \n     mothers play in providing a family upbringing for children;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination \n     Against Women integrates a derogatory sentiment toward \n     motherhood as manifested in the Convention's January 3, 2000 \n     Committee Report on Belarus specifically condemning symbols \n     such as Mother's Day;\n       Whereas the Senate affirms its commitment that the United \n     States should work with other nations to enhance the \n     protection of the fundamental right of motherhood, including \n     the condemnation of coercive population control programs \n     where expectant mothers are forced to undergo abortions or \n     sterilizations;\n       Whereas the Convention's agenda to promote abortion \n     worldwide invades the laws of countries that hold a religious \n     or moral belief that abortion is the destruction of innocent \n     human life and that it subjects expectant mothers to physical \n     and emotional trauma;\n       Whereas the Convention seeks to supplant the primary care \n     and nurturing provided by stay-at-home mothers with \n     institutionalized daycare facilities as advocated in the \n     Convention's August 12, 1997 Committee Report on Slovenia, \n     which stated that children cared for at home are deprived of \n     ``educational and social opportunities offered in formal \n     daycare institutions''; and\n       Whereas more than a hundred United States-based family, \n     religious, and educational organizations representing \n     countless millions of Americans strongly oppose United States \n     ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of \n     Discrimination Against Women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the tenets of the Convention on the Elimination of \n     Discrimination Against Women are incompatible with the \n     tradition and policy of the United States to uphold \n     motherhood and to regard motherhood with the highest degree \n     of honor and respect;\n       (2) the Convention would create negative perceptions toward \n     motherhood; and\n       (3) the Senate should not give its advice and consent to \n     ratification of the fundamentally flawed Convention on the \n     Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, mothers across America will be showered \nwith love and appreciation this Sunday as an annual expression of love \nand gratitude for the selfless acts mothers make for their families \nevery day. Sunday is one of the truly special days of the year. It is \nMother's Day.\n  Americans have a tradition of honoring mothers, dating back to 1914, \nwhen the second Sunday of May was first recognized as ``Mother's Day''\n  It is especially significant in this year 2000 because of the irony \nthat a number of high-profile women in the Clinton Administration--and \nin Congress--are so vocally supportive of the so-called U.N. Convention \non the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which they call \nCEDAW--which rhymes with hee-haw.\n  In any case, the point is this, Mr. President, the radical feminists \ngroups around the country have gone to extreme lengths with incessant \ndeclarations, shouting, and even rudely disrupting at least one \ncongressional hearing in their futile efforts to convince American \nwomen that the CEDAW Treaty somehow protects the rights of women, which \nit absolutely would not do--even in the highly unlikely event that the \nSenate ever gives CEDAW a second glance.\n  The problem for the radical feminists is that the truth has been \ncirculated across the land that the proposed treaty fails to offer \nincreased opportunities for women. All the same, the radical feminists \nhave tried to turn the proposed treaty into a feminist manifesto, and \nthe militant women have fallen on their faces in the process.\n  Mr. President, one needs only to examine the reports of the various \nCEDAW committees, and it is clear that motherhood is not favorably \nviewed by the CEDAW advocates.\n  For instance, Mr. President, earlier this year, one such committee \nsolemnly warned the nation Belarus that there was great ``concern \n[over] the continuing prevalence of such [stereotypical] symbols as a \nMother's Day.'' Now get that--``the continuing prevalence of such \n[stereotypical] symbols as a Mother's Day.'' The nation Armenia was \nlectured about the need to ``combat the traditional stereotype of women \nin the noble role of mother.''\n  Another CEDAW committee warned Slovenia that too many Slovenian \nmothers (that's right, too many mothers) were staying home (in the \nopinion of the CEDAW ladies) to raise their children. Think of that bad \nsituation,\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nmothers staying home to raise their children. The CEDAW crowd also \nwarned that because only 30 percent of children in Slovenia were in \nday-care centers, the other 70 percent were in grave danger of \n``miss[ing] out on educational and social opportunities offered in \n(the) formal day-care institutions.'' One can surmise they mean that \nall this is more important and more effective than motherhood in the \nhome.\n  So, in spite of CEDAW's noisy advocates, Mr. President, the so-called \nConvention of Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against \nWomen--and that is a jawbreaker within itself--has been left at the \nstarting gate simply because this unwise proposed treaty was clearly \nnegotiated by radical feminists with the intent of enshrining their \nradical anti-family agenda into international law.\n  That is why this CEDAW mishmash has been collecting dust in the \nSenate for 20 years. And when I say Senate, I mean the Committee on \nForeign Relations. It was sent to the Senate by President Carter in \n1980--since which the Democratic Party was in control of the Senate for \n10 years. But the treaty is so obviously bad that the Democrats never \nbrought it up for a vote, and if I have anything to do with it--and I \nthink I do--it will never see the light of day on my watch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of more than 100 \nU.S. groups, representing countless millions of Americans who oppose \nthe CEDAW, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOver 100 Organizations Representing Countless Millions Who Oppose CEDAW\n\n       The Alliance of Catholic Women,

Res. 307\n\n       Whereas motherhood is a God-given right of women to bear \n     and rear children;\n       Whereas, since 1914, the United States has officially \n     observed the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day to display \n     public expression of love and reverence for all American \n     mothers;\n       Whereas Mother's Day is recognized by the United States and \n     many other countries in affirmation of the invaluable role \n     mothers play in providing a family upbringing for children;\n       Whereas the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination \n     Against Women integrates a derogatory sentiment toward \n     motherhood as manifested in the Convention's January 3, 2000 \n     Committee Report on Belarus specifically condemning symbols \n     such as Mother's Day;\n       Whereas the Senate affirms its commitment that the United \n     States should work with other nations to enhance the \n     protection of the fundamental right of motherhood, including \n     the condemnation of coercive population control programs \n     where expectant mothers are forced to undergo abortions or \n     sterilizations;\n       Whereas the Convention's agenda to promote abortion \n     worldwide invades the laws of countries that hold a religious \n     or moral belief that abortion is the destruction of innocent \n     human life and that it subjects expectant mothers to physical \n     and emotional trauma;\n       Whereas the Convention seeks to supplant the primary care \n     and nurturing provided by stay-at-home mothers with \n     institutionalized daycare facilities as advocated in the \n     Convention's August 12, 1997 Committee Report on Slovenia, \n     which stated that children cared for at home are deprived of \n     ``educational and social opportunities offered in formal \n     daycare institutions''; and\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\n       Whereas more than a hundred United States-based family, \n     religious, and educational organizations representing \n     countless millions of Americans strongly oppose United States \n     ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of \n     Discrimination Against Women: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the tenets of the Convention on the Elimination of \n     Discrimination Against Women are incompatible with the \n     tradition and policy of the United States to uphold \n     motherhood and to regard motherhood with the highest degree \n     of honor and respect;\n       (2) the Convention would create negative perceptions toward \n     motherhood; and\n       (3) the Senate should not give its advice and consent to \n     ratification of the fundamentally flawed Convention on the \n     Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/11/senate-section/article/S3927-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
