The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 so \nthat the party conferences can meet and have lunch.

Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, and Senator Kerrey, the ranking member, spoke on the \nimportance of intelligence authorization. They have been doing good \nwork together in a bipartisan way, as they should on matters of \nintelligence. This is a very important bill, one we should move forward \nas expeditiously as we can. Of course, the issue that is still being \ndebated in connection with this intelligence authorization bill is, how \ndo we deal with reorganizing the Department of Energy so we can stop \nthe leaks that have been occurring at our labs.\n  There was a report in the papers just this morning that while some \nprogress has been made in some areas, the necessary actions to stop \nthese leaks and make sure they don't happen in the future haven't even \nbegun. Senator Domenici, Senator Kyl, and Senator Murkowski have done \nreal good work in this area. This should be a bipartisan solution where \nwe get the focus at the Department of Energy rearranged in such a way \nthat there is direct reporting so we have a quasi-autonomous agency \nwithin the Department of Energy. I hope we can still find a way to get \nthis done because the American people understand that real damage has \nalready been done. We should make sure, at the minimum, that it will \nnot continue in the future.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. President, Californians have been deeply saddened and \nmoved by a number of losses we have faced. One involves the death of \nthe senior member of our California Democratic delegation, George \nBrown, who was a beloved Congressman on both sides of the aisle. As a \nmatter of fact, one of the Republicans in the House said on his \npassing, if everyone was like George Brown, we would not need to go on \nretreats to find out how to get along better with one another.\n  George Brown was that kind of person. George was a man of great \ncompassion, of great reason. He was consistent. He never changed his \nviews according to the polls. He was a mentor of mine when he ran for \nthe Senate in 1970, which takes us back a long time. I very proudly \nworked on his campaign simply as a volunteer. He was an advocate for \nscience and technology, and although he was 79 years old, he was an \nageless person. He had so many young ideas, and he was so future \noriented.\n  Then, of course, the Nation faced the tragedy that befell the Kennedy \nfamily once again with the tragic loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr., and his \nwife and her sister. The press was calling and asking for a comment. I \nsaid it truly is a tragedy beyond words. I think at times such as these \nall you can really do is pray that the family will be able to cope with \na loss of such enormity.\n  I particularly want to spend a moment talking about my colleague, Ted \nKennedy, because after all the tragedies with which the family has had \nto deal, Ted has become a real father figure to the entire next \ngeneration of Kennedys. I know how Senator Kennedy teaches those of us \nwho have not been here as long as he, how he monitors us and guides us.\n  I can just imagine the close bond he had with John Kennedy, Jr., and \nwhat this has done to his heart. I know when he does come back, every \none of us will give him our strength.\n  When President Kennedy died, Robert Kennedy said the following. He \nsaid:\n\n       When I think of President Kennedy, I think of what \n     Shakespeare said in Romeo and Juliet:\n\n     When he shall die,\n     take him and cut him out into stars\n     and he shall make the face of heaven so fine\n     that all the world will be in love with night\n     and pay no worship to the garish sun.\n\n  I think when we think of John Kennedy, Jr., we will think of him \nsharing in those bright stars.\n  To close, I have a poem that was written by someone who is in her \nthirties. I think the words will have meaning for those who look to \nJohn, Jr., for their future. This is what it is called: ``If Only We \nCould Have Said Goodbye.''\n\n     Our special son\n     the namesake he\n     of honorable tradition\n     to serve our great country\n\n     Passed down through generations\n     of dedicated, determined souls\n     He understood our devotion\n     and carried with him a nation's hope\n\n     This honor never did he shun\n     In public he graced us well\n     With patience he regaled us\n     with tales\n     Of hiding behind\n     the Oval's chair,\n     Or that indelible salute\n\n     We mourned together his father's fate\n     While marveling his mother's grace\n     These traits were passed on to Kennedy's own\n     to John, indeed\n\n     Could he be the return of Camelot?\n     We wondered\n     and inside we cheered this Kennedy's fate\n     with the wish that he could fulfill in his time\n     those hopes left so unmade\n\n     Or perhaps\n     just share with us,\n     a bit of the mystery, a bit of your name\n     If only we could have said goodbye\n\n  Mr. President, it is a sad day across this land. Our prayers are with \nthe Kennedy family and the Bessette family.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding me this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8818-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8818-S8824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000--MOTION TO \n                            PROCEED--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I understand I am in charge of our half hour.\n  I say to the other side, you have a half hour on this also. We \nclearly would like to move back and forth with the time on each side \nfor various speakers, but for now we have two or three speakers who \nhave already indicated they want to address this issue. So I yield 8 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. Then, \nwithin the next 30 or 40 minutes, if Senator Frank Murkowski, the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, desires to \nspeak, we will give him some time. I understand the Senator from \nKentucky would like to speak on our side also, so we will make time for \nhim.\n  We will proceed now. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I thank Senator Domenici for his leadership on this issue. It \nwas really his leadership that brought this entire matter of \nreorganization of the Department of Energy to the fore. I appreciate \nhis ability to predict what the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board was going to be recommending to the President because \nindeed it was Senator Domenici's idea for the reorganization of the \nDepartment of Energy that eventually the Rudman board, the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board--it was really that same idea that \nwas recommended by the President's board which we have embodied in \nlegislation that we bring to the floor.\n  As the leader announced a few minutes ago, at 10:40 this morning we \nwill vote on whether to invoke cloture on a motion to proceed to the \nintelligence authorization bill, which will include this reorganization \nof the Department of Energy amendment.\n  This is the amendment Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and I have \ndrafted with the purpose to halt the ongoing losses of our Nation's \nmost sensitive military secrets from our Nation's laboratories.\n  As I look back over the last few months, it seems as if every week \nbrought more news about Chinese espionage at our National Laboratories, \nabout how the Chinese have obtained our country's nuclear secrets.\n  In May, the declassified version of the Cox committee report was \nreleased. It painted a sobering picture of the increased danger the \nUnited States now faces as a result of the Chinese espionage at our \nnuclear labs. This bipartisan committee unanimously concluded that \nChina stole classified information on every nuclear warhead currently \nin the U.S. arsenal, as well as the neutron bomb--literally the crown \njewels of our nuclear stockpile.\n  Worst still, the Cox committee noted that China also acquired other \nadvanced American technology, including missile guidance and reentry \nvehicle technology, the results of developmental work on \nelectromagnetic weapons that could be used to attack satellites and \nmissiles, and radar technology and techniques that may someday allow \nChina to track U.S. Navy submarines while they are submerged beneath \nthe ocean's surface.\n  Chinese acquisition of this technology is particularly troublesome \nbecause the majority of its roughly 20\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nlong-range nuclear missiles are aimed at U.S. cities. As we all know, \nthe United States currently has no defense against missile attack.\n  Although one individual at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Wen Ho Lee, has \nbeen fired, Chinese espionage at our nuclear labs is presumably ongoing \ntoday. As the Cox committee stated in its report, China has engaged in \na ``sustained espionage effort targeted at United States nuclear \nweapons facilities.''\n  Furthermore, the report notes: ``The successful penetration by \n[China] of our nuclear weapons laboratories has taken place over the \nlast several decades, and almost certainly continues to the present.''\n  After the effects of China's espionage came to light earlier this \nyear, the President asked the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, led \nby former Senator Warren Rudman, to examine why China was able to steal \nour nuclear secrets. The President's board released its findings in \nJune, calling for sweeping organizational reform of the Energy \nDepartment to address what it described as ``the worst security record \non secrecy'' that the panel members ``have ever encountered.''\n\n  The Presidential panel cited as the root cause of DOE's poor security \nrecord ``organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture of \narrogance . . . [which] conspired to create an espionage scandal \nwaiting to happen.'' Terrible problems were uncovered during the \npanel's investigation. For example, employees at nuclear facilities \ncompared their computer systems to automatic teller machines, allowing \ntop secret withdrawals at our Nation's expense.\n  As public pressure has grown, Energy Secretary Richardson has \nannounced various reforms; but these steps have been criticized as too \nlittle too late. In fact, the President's own advisory panel said, ``We \nseriously doubt [Energy Secretary Richardson's] initiatives will \nachieve lasting success,'' and noted ``these initiatives simply do not \ngo far enough.'' In fact, though the Energy Secretary says he and his \nDepartment are on top of the situation, the Presidential panel warned \nthat ``the Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has \nproven it is incapable of reforming itself.'' Instead, the panel \nrecommended that Congress reorganize the Department.\n  That is what Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and I have written \nlegislation to do, to implement this recommendation of the President's \nadvisory group. Our proposal would gather all of the parts of the \nnuclear weapons program under one semiautonomous agency within the \nEnergy Department. It would separate the nuclear weapons work at the \nEnergy Department from the other things they do there, such as setting \nefficiency standards for refrigerators.\n  The new agency will have clear lines of authority, responsibility, \nand accountability, with one person in charge, who will continue to \nreport to the Energy Secretary. This would replace the current tangled \nbureaucratic structure that has led to the situation where everyone is \nresponsible so no one is responsible. This is the only way to ensure \nthat new security and counterintelligence measures are implemented to \nprevent future espionage from occurring unchecked.\n  I am pleased that the legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support. In \naddition to Senator Domenici, who chairs the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Murkowski, who chairs the \nEnergy Committee, it is cosponsored by the chairman and vice chairman \nof the Intelligence Committee, Senators Shelby and Kerrey; the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee and its subcommittee chairman on \nStrategic Forces, Senator Warner and Senator Smith; the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson; the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Helms; the former chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Specter; as well as Senators Feinstein, \nHutchinson, Gregg, Bunning, Fitzgerald, and the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Lott.\n  Despite Secretary Richardson's recent announcement that he is \nprepared to drop his opposition to the creation of a semiautonomous \nagency, the reality is that he continues to oppose the core concepts \nunderlying such an agency. Despite extensive discussions that the \nsponsors have had with the Secretary and his staff, he continues to \noppose our legislation.\n\n  The time has clearly come for the Senate to debate and adopt strong \nmeasures to safeguard our Nation and its nuclear secrets. As my \ncolleagues will recall, in May Senators Domenici and Murkowski and I \nattempted to offer a similar amendment to the defense authorization \nbill which was met with a Democratic filibuster and a threat by the \nEnergy Secretary that he would recommend the President veto the bill. \nIn justifying his refusal to allow debate or even a vote on our \namendment, the Democratic whip termed our proposal ``premature'' and \nurged the Senate to hold hearings on the measure.\n  Over the past 2 months, four committees of the Senate have held six \nhearings specifically on our amendment. Furthermore, in the time since \nwe first offered our amendment to the defense authorization bill, the \nPresidential panel headed by former Senator Rudman has published its \nreport vindicating the approach of our original amendment. It is well \npast time to fix the chronic problems at our nuclear weapons \nfacilities. Failure to move forward will only further jeopardize our \nNation's security.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to rise above \npartisan politics, not to vote for obstruction and vulnerability but \ninstead to vote in favor of cloture so the Senate can debate this \nimportant amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Domenici.\n  Yesterday we had an opportunity to discuss the pending amendment at \nsome length. I think I spoke for some 45 minutes, so I will not repeat \nwhat I said yesterday, but I am going to focus in on why we need this \namendment.\n  This whole issue associated with the lack of security in our labs has \nreceived a lot of attention over the last several months. My committee, \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, has held nine hearings. \nWe had the pleasure of getting together with four other committees--the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the \nIntelligence Committee, joining with the Energy Committee--and it was \nthe first time we had ever assembled four committees together. We had \nover 30 Senators present. So there has been a good deal of time, \neffort, and examination on this matter.\n  I am very pleased to join Senator Domenici, Senator Kyl, and a number \nof other cosponsors, including Senators Kerrey, Lott, Feinstein, Smith, \nGregg, Hutchinson, Shelby, Warner, Bunning, Helms, Fitzgerald, Specter, \nThompson, and others in bringing this matter before the Senate.\n  We need this amendment because time is passing. This report, the \nRudman report, entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst,'' \nin effect says it all. This was the expert panel authorized by the \nPresident, a special investigative panel of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board headed by former Senator Rudman. Again, the \nemphasis is on the title, recognizing that science has contributed \nprobably the best in the world at the labs, but security at its worst.\n  Now, why do we need this amendment? Why do we need it now? I will be \nvery brief. I am going to give you a few quotes from the Rudman report.\n\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect and a culture \n     of arrogance, both at the Department of Energy headquarters \n     and the labs themselves, conspired to create an espionage \n     scandal waiting to happen.\n\n  Further from the report:\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself.\n\n  Further:\n\n       Accountability at the Department of Energy labs has been \n     spread so thinly and erratically that it is now almost \n     impossible to find.\n\n  That is the key word--``accountability.'' We had no accountability, \nas we look back on the espionage charges associated with the alleged \nWen Ho Lee affair, no accountability. There it is.\n  Further, I quote:\n\n       Never have the members of the special investigative panel \n     witnessed a bureaucratic\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\n     culture so thoroughly saturated with cynicism and disregard \n     for authority.\n\n  Further, I quote:\n\n       Never before has this panel found such a cavalier attitude \n     toward one of the most serious responsibilities in the \n     Federal Government: control of the design information \n     relating to nuclear weapons.\n\n  Further, I quote:\n\n       Never before has the panel found an agency with the \n     bureaucratic insolence to disrupt, delay and resist \n     implementation of a presidential directive on security.\n\n  These are but a few of the quotes from the Rudman report. These few \nquotes and the full report itself speak eloquently about the need for \nthis amendment, the justification for this amendment. While considering \nwhether to vote for or against this amendment and the motion to invoke \ncloture, there is really only one relevant question: Do you want to put \nan end to lax management practices at the Department of Energy that \nhave contributed to the poor security? In other words, do you want to \nfix it? Or do you want to do everything you can to prevent espionage \nfrom occurring again, further damaging national security?\n  I urge Members to vote for cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from ``Science at its Best; \nSecurity at its Worst'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Selected Excerpts from the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \n Board Report: Science at Its Best; Security at Its Worst: A Report on \n           Security Problems at the U.S. Department of Energy\n\n       Findings (pp. 1-6):\n       As the repository of America's most advanced know-how in \n     nuclear and related armaments and the home of some of \n     America's finest scientific minds, these labs have been and \n     will continue to be a major target of foreign intelligence \n     services, friendly as well as hostile. p.1\n       More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal \n     inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, \n     independent panels, and even DOE itself--have identified a \n     multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence \n     problems at all of the weapons labs. p.2\n       Critical security flaws--have been cited for immediate \n     attention and resolution--over and over and over--ad nauseam.\n       The open-source information alone on the weapons \n     laboratories overwhelmingly supports a troubling conclusion: \n     their security and counterintelligence operations have been \n     seriously hobbled and relegated to low-priority status for \n     decades. p.2\n       . . . the DOE and its weapons labs have been Pollyannaish. \n     The predominant attitude toward security and \n     counterintelligence among many DOE and lab managers has \n     ranged from half-hearted, grudging accommodation been to smug \n     disregard. Thus the panel is convinced that the potential for \n     major leaks and thefts of sensitive information and material \n     has been substantial.\n       Organizational disarray, managerial neglect, and a culture \n     of arrogance--both at DOE headquarters and the labs \n     themselves--conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting \n     to happen. pp.2-3\n       Among the defects this panel found:\n       Inefficient personnel clearance programs. Loosely \n     controlled and casually monitored programs for thousands of \n     unauthorized foreign scientists and assignees.\n       Feckless systems for control of classified documents, which \n     periodically resulted in thousands of documents being \n     declared lost.\n       Counterintelligence programs with part-time CI officers, \n     who often operated with little experience, minimal budgets, \n     and employed little more than crude ``awareness'' briefings \n     of foreign threats and perfunctory and sporadic debriefings \n     of scientists . . .\n       A lab security management reporting system that led \n     everywhere but to responsible authority.\n       Computer security methods that were naive at best and \n     dangerously irresponsible at worst.\n       DOE has had a dysfunctional management structure and \n     culture that only occasionally gave proper credence to the \n     need for rigorous security and counterintelligence programs \n     at the weapons labs. For starters, there has been a \n     persisting lack of real leadership and effective management \n     at DOE.\n       The nature of the intelligence-gathering methods used by \n     the People's Republic of China poses a special challenge to \n     the U.S. in general and the weapons labs in particular. p.3\n       Despite widely publicized assertions of wholesale losses of \n     nuclear weapons technology from specific laboratories to \n     particular nations, the factual record in the majority of \n     cases regarding the DOE weapons laboratories supports \n     plausible inferences--but not irrefutable proof--about the \n     source and scope of espionage and the channels through which \n     recipient nations received information. pp.3-4.\n       The actual damage done to U.S. security interests is, at \n     the least, currently unknown; at worst, it may be unknowable.\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. p. 4\n       Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and \n     erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.\n       Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many \n     specific problems with security and counterintelligence in \n     the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of \n     accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire \n     Department. p. 4\n       Convoluted, confusing, and often contradictory reporting \n     channels make the relationship between DOE headquarters and \n     the labs, in particular, tense, internecine, and chaotic.\n       The criteria for the selection of Energy Secretaries have \n     been inconsistent in the past. Regardless of the outcome of \n     ongoing or contemplated reforms, the minimum qualifications \n     for an Energy Secretary should include experience in not only \n     energy and scientific issues, but national security and \n     intelligence issues as well. p. 5\n       DOE cannot be fixed with a single legislative act: \n     management must follow mandate. The research functions of the \n     labs are vital to the nation's long term interest, and \n     instituting effective gates between weapons and nonweapons \n     research functions will require both disinterested scientific \n     expertise, judicious decision making, and considerable \n     political finesse. p. 5\n       Thus both Congress and the Executive Branch . . . should be \n     prepared to monitor the progress of the Department's reforms \n     for years to come.\n       The Foreign Visitor's and Assignments Program has been and \n     should continue to be a valuable contribution to the \n     scientific and technological progress of the nation. p. 5\n       That said, DOE clearly requires measures to ensure that \n     legitimate use of the research laboratories for scientific \n     collaboration is not an open door to foreign espionage \n     agents.\n       In commenting on security issues at DOE, we believe that \n     both Congressional and Executive branch leaders have resorted \n     to simplification and hyperbole in the past few months. The \n     panel found neither the dramatic damage assessments nor the \n     categorical reassurances of the Department's advocates to be \n     wholly substantiated. pp. 5-6\n       However, the Board is extremely skeptical that any reform \n     effort, no matter how well-intentioned, well-designed, and \n     effectively applied, will gain more than a toehold at DOE, \n     given its labyrinthine management structure, fractious and \n     arrogant culture, and the fast-approaching reality of another \n     transition in DOE leadership. Thus we believe that he has \n     overstated the case when he asserts, as he did several weeks \n     ago, that ``Americans can be reassured: our nation's nuclear \n     secrets are, today, safe and secure.''\n       Fundamental change in DOE's institutional culture--\n     including the ingrained attitudes toward security among \n     personnel of the weapons laboratories--will be just as \n     important as organizational redesign. p. 6\n       Never have the members of the Special Investigative Panel \n     witnessed a bureaucratic culture so thoroughly saturated with \n     cynicism and disregard for authority. Never before has this \n     panel found such a cavalier attitude toward one of the most \n     serious responsibilities in the federal government--control \n     of the design information relating to nuclear weapons. \n     Particularly egregious have been the failures to enforce \n     cyber-security measures to protect and control important \n     nuclear weapons design information, Never before has the \n     panel found an agency with the bureaucratic insolence to \n     dispute, delay, and resist implementation of a Presidential \n     directive on security, as DOE's bureaucracy tried to do the \n     Presidential Decision Directive No. 61 in February 1998.\n       The best nuclear weapons expertise in the U.S. government \n     resides at the national weapons labs, and this asset should \n     be better used by the intelligence community. p. 6.\n       Reorganization pp. 43-53:\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To \n     achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must \n     have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous \n     operational structure free of all the other obligations \n     imposed by DOE management. We strongly believe that this \n     cleaving can be best achieved by constituting a new \n     government agency that is far more mission-focused and \n     bureaucratically streamlined than its antecedent, and devoted \n     principally to nuclear weapons and national security matters. \n     (emphasis in original) p. 46\n       The agency can be constructed in one of two ways. It could \n     remain an element of DOE but become semi-autonomous--by that \n     we mean strictly segregated from the rest of the Department. \n     This would be accomplished by having the agency director \n     report only to the Secretary of Energy. The agency \n     directorship also could be ``dual-hatted'' as an Under \n     Secretary, thereby investing it with extra bureaucratic clout \n     both inside and outside the Department. p. 46\n       Regardless of the mold in which this agency is cast, it \n     must have staffing and support functions that are autonomous \n     from the remaining operations at DOE. p. 46\n       To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be \n     established by statute. p. 47\n       Whichever solution Congress enacts, we do feel strongly \n     that the new agency never should be subordinated to the \n     Defense Department. p. 47\n       Specifically, we recommend that the Congress pass and the \n     President sign legislation that: pp. 47-49\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\n       Creates a new, semi-autonomous Agency for Nuclear \n     Stewardship (ANS), whose Director will report directly to the \n     Secretary of Energy.\n       Streamlines the ANS/Weapons Lab management structure by \n     abolishing ties between the weapons labs and all DOE \n     regional, field and site offices, and all contractor \n     intermediaries.\n       Mandates that the Director/ANS be appointed by the \n     President with the consent of the Senate and, ideally, have \n     an extensive background in national security, organizational \n     management, and appropriate technical fields.\n       Stems the historical ``revolving door'' and management \n     expertise problems at DOE. . . .\n       Ensures effective administration of safeguards, security, \n     and counterintelligence at all the weapons labs and plants by \n     creating a coherent security/CI structure within the new \n     agency.\n       Abolishes the Office of Energy Intelligence.\n       Shifts the balance of analytic billets . . . to bolster \n     intelligence community technical expertise on nuclear \n     matters.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from New Mexico, how is \nthe time being controlled?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Nebraska has 30 minutes and has used \nnone of it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Do I have to use my time to speak against or not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator may speak either way.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President I yield such time as is necessary from our \nside to speak in favor of the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment.\n  I believe this reorganization plan complements the reforms already \nincluded in our defense authorization bill as well as the reforms set \nforth by Secretary Richardson and that they help him achieve his \nmission. This plan, which is contained in this amendment, will sustain \nand improve the extraordinary science performed by the nuclear \nlaboratories of the Energy Department while significantly improving \nsecurity and counterintelligence.\n  Under this reorganization, the Secretary of Energy will set policy \nand maintain authority over all elements of the new Agency for Nuclear \nStewardship. The agency director will then implement his policy and \ndemand that the highest security standards are maintained within the \nnuclear weapons laboratories.\n  This plan reduces the bureaucracy that both stifles scientific \nendeavors and hinders security and counterintelligence at our \nlaboratories. The agency will maintain the links between the weapons \nlabs and other labs in parts of the Department of Energy, thereby \npreserving the capability to cross-fertilize science that is being \nperformed in different programs and in different locations.\n  Numerous reviews that have been performed over the past 25 years by \nexecutive branch agencies, the General Accounting Office, the Congress, \nindependent panels, and the Energy Department itself have found \nsecurity wanting and lax at all of the weapons laboratories. A spate of \nespionage cases over the last 15 years, cases involving the potential \ntheft of our most potent nuclear weapons designs, shows that \ncounterintelligence at the Energy Department needs serious improvement. \nIn recent hearings, witnesses before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and other committees have described the confused lines of \nauthority, lack of accountability, and both inadvertent and conscious \ndisregard for security concerns.\n  Last month the President's National Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard, the PFIAB, led by former Senator Warren Rudman, issued the \nlatest in a long series of reports critical of security and \ncounterintelligence at the weapons laboratories.\n  In its report entitled ``Science At Its Best, Security At Its \nWorst,'' the PFIAB found that ``organization disarray, managerial \nneglect and a culture of arrogance both at DOE headquarters and the \nlabs themselves, conspired to create an espionage scandal waiting to \nhappen.''\n  In response to these problems, the Rudman panel calls for \nreorganization as necessary ``to resolve the many specific problems \nwith security and counterintelligence in the weapons laboratories but \nalso to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic \nthroughout the entire Department.''\n  The new structure envisioned in this amendment strengthens the \nmanagement structure overseeing the nuclear weapons laboratories. By \nremoving the unnecessary involvement of redundant officials in the \nrunning of the labs, the new Agency for Nuclear Stewardship sets both \nclear lines of authority and defined lines of accountability in how the \nlabs are managed. This helps assure that policy directives are properly \nand expeditiously developed, and that officials can be held accountable \nfor success and failure related to scientific research and security \nmeasures.\n  No management structure, however well designed, can be effective if \nthe personnel filling the organization chart are not up to the job. The \nUnder Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will be appointed by the \nPresident and subject to the advice and consent of the Senate. He or \nshe will be required by statute to have an extensive background in \nnational security, organizational management, and the appropriate \ntechnical areas relevant to weapons design work. This individual will \nbe assisted within the Agency by three Deputy Directors for defense \nprograms, nonproliferation and materials disposition, and naval \nreactors. To promote security throughout the Agency, the Director will \nbe assisted by a Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence, a \nChief of Nuclear Stewardship Security, and a Chief of Nuclear \nStewardship Intelligence who will work to promote the awareness of and \nimplement measures related to security and counterintelligence.\n  Under this amendment, the Under Secretary will have the necessary \nauthority to effectively manage the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. \nThis Under Secretary will follow the policies established by the \nSecretary. The Agency's subordinate security, counterintelligence, and \nintelligence chiefs will follow policies developed by their \ncorresponding Energy Department offices and approved by the Secretary.\n  The point here is that the Secretary remains accountable, the \nSecretary retains authority, and as a consequence, the Secretary \nretains responsibility for the work that is being done.\n  This amendment essentially, under statute, will remove much of the \nmiddle-level structure that has built up over the years, which has made \nit extremely difficult to manage and almost impossible to determine who \nis responsible. Despite the end of the cold war, our Nation still faces \na nuclear threat, and that threat continues to grow. We must not allow \nthe nuclear secrets paid for by the toil and ingenuity of Americans to \nbecome tools of those who may wish to harm our Nation. The new Agency \nfor Nuclear Stewardship will help protect those secrets and keep our \nnuclear arsenal the most advanced and safest among nations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off our side to the \nSenator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, our national laboratories have become \nrevolving doors. On the way in, you have billions of dollars from the \ntaxpayers to research and develop the most sophisticated weapons in the \nworld, and on the way out you have all the plans and information any \ncountry needs to build a nuclear weapon.\n  Unfortunately, the doors to our labs are still open. While the \nDepartment of Energy has made some cosmetic changes in their security \nprocedures, we are still stuck with the same bureaucratic mess that \ncreated this problem.\n  There is no accountability. Not one person has stood up and said, \n``the buck stops here.''--Not the lab directors--not any of the former \nSecretaries of Energy--not even the President has taken any \nresponsibility for what occurred at Los Alamos Laboratory.\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\n  It is clear that our nuclear weapons programs are in desperate need \nof accountability, leadership, and supervision. The amendment we are \ndebating today will provide these essential ingredients.\n  Mr. President, the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment, creates a new \nagency for nuclear stewardship, which will provide clear lines of \nauthority and responsibility within the Department of Energy. It will \nbe managed by an administrator who will be directly responsible for all \nnuclear weapons production. Finally, someone will be able to say, ``the \nbuck stops here.''\n  In addition, the amendment will codify an Office of \nCounterintelligence in the Department of Energy. The Director of this \nOffice will have the power to create preventative programs to make sure \nthis kind of espionage does not occur again.\n  The administration has proposed a number of band-aid type reforms, \nbut none of them get to the heart of the problem. There are too many \ntangled lines of authority within the Department of Energy, and no one \nwants to take responsibility.\n  According to the Cox report, ``the PRC's theft of nuclear secrets \nfrom our National Weapons Laboratories enabled the PRC to design, \ndevelop, and successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner \nthan would otherwise have been possible.''\n  Since the Chinese, who sell weapons around the world have these \nsecrets, we can only ask who else may have this information. Iran? \nIraq? Syria? North Korea?\n  While it is scary to think about who may have access to our nuclear \nsecrets, it is even more frightening to think that this kind of \nespionage could still be going on. We need the clear lines of authority \nand leadership that would be established by the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski \namendment, to close the revolving door.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for cloture and \nsupport this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask the distinguished Senator, \nMr. Bunning, would he like to speak for an additional couple of \nminutes?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I have finished. I thank the Senator. I have completed \nmy statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know how we are going to use the \nrest of the time. I will use a little bit of time. If anyone wants to \nspeak on either side of the issue, there is some time between now and \n10:40 or so when we are going to vote on cloture. I yield myself such \ntime as I may use.\n  I, too, urge that everybody vote for cloture. There is absolutely no \nreason for us not to proceed with the intelligence bill, which has been \ncarefully thought out. It is not my bailiwick. I am not a chairman, \ncochairman, or a member, but I have attended meetings with them since \nthe breaking news about the Chinese and their involvement in gathering \nup very secure and secret information from the United States through \nour laboratories.\n  That bill should not be held up, and the Senate has already agreed by \nunanimous consent that when it comes up--the amendment we are alluding \nto, the amendment that has been talked about now for a number of weeks, \nhas been prepared in its final form for some time. It has been \ncirculated to whomever needs it. It has been discussed in various \ncommittees, and it has been criticized, praised, and modified.\n  Before it came to the floor, it had the input from the now famous \nboard that Senator Rudman headed with four other distinguished \nAmericans with great expertise in the area. Their recommendations are \nin the amendment. We had people who know the Department and who know \nthe Department of Defense help us draft it. It was conceived and being \nprepared even before the Rudman board made their final recommendations.\n  Personally this Senator had arrived at the conclusion that something \ndrastic had to be done even before the report. Now we can have some \ntime this afternoon and this evening for those who want to argue about \nthe potency of this amendment or whether it has some shortcomings to \noffer amendments.\n  We will be meeting at about 11:30 in the leader's office with five or \nsix Senators who have a particular interest or bipartisan interests and \nmay have amendments. We will be meeting in the leader's office to see \nif we can't discuss them.\n  I hope Senators who have raised issues about it and who have \nindicated they have amendments will join us and be prepared to talk on \nour bill on which they have amendments, and to bring forth their ideas \nalso.\n  Later in the day, if we continue to debate this issue, I will have \nmore to say about why we need it, and I will discuss the specific \nprovisions of this amendment in more detail.\n  Let me just quickly read three or four provisions that I think should \ndispel some of the concerns that have been raised. If they do not quite \ndo the job, let's talk about it.\n  On page 2 of the amendment, for those who are wondering whether the \nSecretary of Energy, a Cabinet member, will still be in charge of this \nsemiautonomous agency, when you call it ``semiautonomous,'' it means \nthat somebody is in control of it and, therefore, it is not autonomous. \nThat is why semiautonomous is included as a description.\n\n  But the amendment says, first:\n\n       The Secretary shall be responsible for all policies of the \n     agency. The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship shall \n     report solely and directly to the Secretary, and shall be \n     subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary.\n\n  Skipping on a bit, to page 2 of the amendment:\n\n       The Secretary may direct other officials of the Department \n     who are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship to \n     review the agency's program and to make recommendations to \n     the Secretary regarding the administration of such programs, \n     including the consistency with other similar programs and \n     activities of the Department.\n\n  There are some who want to make sure the Secretary has sufficient \ninput, that he will have sufficient opportunity to look at what they \nare doing and make determinations as to the propriety of consistency \nwith the Secretary's policies.\n  I think what we just said makes the case.\n  This morning, one of those writers who has been covering the \ndeliberations in the Washington Post talked about the chief of nuclear \nstewardship counterintelligence and how there might be some \ninconsistency within that particular person's effort and what the \nSecretary's policies are on counterintelligence.\n  I refer to page 4 of the amendment. I read the following at the \nbottom of the page:\n\n       The Chief of Nuclear Stewardship Counterintelligence shall \n     report to the Under Secretary, and implement the \n     counterintelligence policies directed by the Secretary and \n     the Under Secretary. The Chief of Nuclear Stewardship \n     Counterintelligence shall have direct access to the Secretary \n     and all other officials of the Department and its contractors \n     concerning counterintelligence matters, and shall be \n     responsible for. . . .\n\n  Then it proceeds to delineate for what they will be responsible.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our side, and \nhow much remains as a whole?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from New Mexico has 30 \nminutes 22 seconds. The Democratic time remaining is 23 minutes 12 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note Senator Kyl's presence on the floor. I want to \ntalk with him for a moment.\n  I am not at all sure there will be additional time used on the other \nside of the aisle. When Senator Kerrey left the floor for other urgent \nbusiness, he suggested there was not any more time on that side. I \nwould like to yield to Senator Kyl the remaining time on our side. I am \nvery hopeful, if there is going to be a wrap-up before the vote, that \nwe will be able to get 2 or 3 minutes from the other side, although I \nam not sure that is the case at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, perhaps we can inquire of the Democratic side \nif there is no one else who wishes to speak for that time to be \nyielded. I can take about 3 minutes now, and we can be prepared to vote \nat whatever time Members are ready.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that is not possible. I understand there \nare some who are now relying upon the time that is set for the vote \naround 20 minutes of 11 and who may be absent from the Hill. So we \ncan't do that.\n\n[[Page S8823]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. So as not to be in an unproductive quorum call, perhaps we \ncould yield back time so we could speak in morning business.\n  Mr. President, I echo one of the thoughts of Chairman Domenici; that \nis, as we consider amendments to the proposal for a semiautonomous \nagency that tracks the recommendations of the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board, I think we need to be very careful to \nensure that the spirit of the recommendation, the fundamental basis for \nthe recommendation of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory \nBoard--the so-called Rudman panel--is not in any way degrading.\n  That spirit, that fundamental basis, was to go directly to the heart \nof the criticism of the Department of Energy to date that it is \nincapable of reorganizing itself; that there are too many disparate \ngroups within the Department that want control of the nuclear weapons \nprogram, or at least their particular part of control; that what is \nreally needed within the Department, the President's panel said, was a \nvery clear direct line of responsibility from the Secretary right down \nthrough this entire nuclear weapons program so that no one else within \nthe Department of Energy, in effect, could get their hands on it; and \nthat there was only one line of responsibility, and it was the Under \nSecretary with his authority and his responsibility to make that \nprogram work.\n  The amendments we have received from Members on the other side--all \nto one degree or another--picked that apart. They said, well, the \nSecretary can designate other people outside this semiautonomous agency \nto be in charge of certain personnel matters, or things of that sort, \nor we could have the Secretary interspersed between the Secretary of \nEnergy and the Under Secretary in charge of these nuclear weapons \nprograms.\n  Those kinds of structural changes may not appear to be significant on \nthe surface, but each one of them detracts from this concept of a \nsemiautonomous agency, which is the fundamental basis of our amendment.\n  It is what the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, or \npanel, said was the critical component of any reform to ensure that \nthere are not other areas of responsibility.\n  One of the proposals is that the Under Secretary would have to have \nfield administrative staff administering this program. That is exactly \nwhat the Rudman panel said you didn't want. That was part of this \nbifurcation of responsibility that was creating the problem to date--\ntoo many people having to sign off on too many different things.\n  The point I want to make as we are prepared to vote on whether to \nproceed--I gather it will be a nearly unanimous vote--with the debate \nand potential amendment of this legislation, to echo what Senator \nDomenici said, is that whatever amendments we consider we have to \nremain true to the basic concept. You can't have a semiautonomous \nagency in name but have the same old disparate responsibility in \npractice. That is why we are not going to be agreeing to amendments \nthat detract from the autonomy of this structure--this semiautonomous \nnature of the jurisdiction of the Under Secretary.\n  That is going to be a critical component of this reform. We are going \nto have to reject all amendments, as benign sounding as they may be, \nthat detract from that central concept.\n  I hope, if Members are going to present amendments, that they will \nunderstand, at least from the sponsors of the legislation, they will be \nmet with opposition if they detract from that central principle. We are \ngoing to be standing very firm to support the President's own advisory \nboard recommendations to the President. We hope, obviously, that the \nPresident in the end will support those as well.\n  My hope is, if there is no one else on the Democratic side who wishes \nto address this, that we can get some time yielded so we can address it \nfrom our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank a number of people.\n  We have come a long way from not knowing exactly what we ought to do \nto a very strong cadre of Senators in a bipartisan nature who have \ndecided that this amendment should be adopted, and perhaps a couple of \nchanges and technical adjustments can be made. But this is not just the \nwork of three sponsors. I am very pleased to have been one of the three \nwho has gathered.\n  I note the Armed Services Committee's input is represented in this \nbill and has been present at almost all the meetings in the form of the \nchairman, John Warner. Senator Warner has been an integral part, along \nwith the Armed Services Committee staff which has knowledge in this \nparticular area.\n  The Intelligence Committee has been excellent. While they have \nconducted their hearings--and they had a heavy workload to get ready \nfor this bill--they have taken significant time to discuss this issue \nand to discuss this approach.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by the chairman and cochairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. I thank Senator Shelby, the chairman, for his \nfine cooperation and that of his staff, and, obviously, the presence of \nSenator Bob Kerrey on the floor indicates he is totally cognizant, \nfully aware of this, and supports what we are trying to do.\n  In addition, obviously there has been tireless work in terms of \ntrying to get the facts in the name of the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. Senator Murkowski of Alaska has spent a \ngreat deal of time with a very competent staff. It is small in number \nbut efficient and knowledgeable. They have conducted some of the best \nhearings on this subject matter. I am very pleased he is taking an \nactive role. The fact he is on this bill and articulately defending the \napproach within the amendment is very helpful and should be helpful to \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I also note Senator Thompson, the chairman of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, which has responsibility for \nmonitoring the organization and providing oversight to the Departments \nof Government, is also very interested and has provided assistance. I \nknow he wants to speak on this later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute off \ntheir side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Senator Thompson and his staff have been \nvery objective. Obviously, his committee has a lot of jurisdiction to \nconduct hearings with reference to restructuring of anything in \nGovernment. We are very pleased he chose to join us and he chose to \nlend us the excellence and expertise of his staff as we put this \npackage together.\n  It is a very good approach. After 20 years of actually floundering \naround within a bureaucracy at the Department of Energy that was very \ntop heavy, as reported by various commissions, I am very thrilled to be \nin this Chamber and able to say we are going to try to do better by the \nmost serious research and the activities which are most apt to harm us \nin the future if others get them. It is the national security of \nAmerica and perhaps peace in the world that hangs on whether this \nDepartment can do its job right, this autonomous agency with reference \nto nuclear activities, and whether we can find a better way to maintain \nfreedom for those scientists, the greatest in the world, so they will \ncome and do their work and at the same time do a far better job of \nsecuring the secrets that are within the minds and the products that \nour great scientists are producing at the nuclear laboratories.\n  In the meantime, there are some who want to punish the laboratories. \nI note with some interest the appropriations bill in the House from the \nsubcommittee that is supposed to fund our nuclear activities. \nObviously, it has been reduced so dramatically I am not at all sure \nthey can function. I do not know if that is a function of not having \nenough money or a function of saying: Let's do something about the fact \nthat we are worried about security.\n  That is not the way to do it. The way to do it is to adopt this \namendment in both Houses, send it to the President, and get started \nwith the task, for the first time in 22 years, of trying to set up an \nappropriate semiautonomous agency to do our nuclear work, to conduct \nthe activities of our nuclear laboratories.\n  I have been asked by the leader, unless my colleagues have an \nobjection,\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\nto ask unanimous consent that all the time be considered used on both \nsides of the aisle and the cloture vote occur at 10:40 this morning. \nThis means we will go into a quorum call, and anybody who wants to can \ncall off the quorum and speak. Is that fair enough to the Senator from \nIdaho?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I propose that unanimous consent request I just \narticulated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Arizona for their leadership on the issue of our \nlaboratories and our concern about nuclear weapons security and the \nwork they have done and the vote that will soon be taken in the Senate \non that effort. It is of prime national importance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8824-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8824-S8825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KENNETH CHRISTOPHER FOSS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this \nmorning to report a sad event to my colleagues. This past Saturday, \nJuly 17, I received news of the untimely death of Kenneth Christopher \nFoss, one of the analysts on the staff of the Republican Policy \nCommittee, of which I am chairman. He was 29 years old and had been a \nlifelong sufferer of diabetes.\n  Since assuming the RPC chairmanship in 1996, I had gotten to know Ken \nvery well. Most recently, I had worked very closely with him on \nlegislation affecting Second Amendment rights. As anyone who knew Ken \ncan attest, he was not a man to compromise on principle. He was an \nextraordinary individual who stood on solid moral and conservative \nprinciples. In an age of relative values and indifference to truth, he \nwill be sorely missed. For Ken, devotion to principle was not an \noption, it was an imperative.\n  Ken's achievements during his all-too-short time in the Senate and on \nEarth were truly remarkable. He began his career with former Senator \nDan Coats, first as an intern and then as a staff assistant. He moved \nover to the RPC during the chairmanship of my predecessor, Senator Don \nNickles.\n  Many of my colleagues may not fully be aware of Ken's contributions \nto the operation of the committee's in-house cable television facility, \nchannel 2, which we all know is an indispensable tool for Senators and \ntheir staffs to keep abreast of floor action. This past year, Ken was \nthe backbone of channel 2 as its manager.\n  In addition, he had shouldered the increased responsibility of a \nconstantly growing list of issues as a policy analyst, including guns, \neducation, alcohol and tobacco, drugs, immigration, American flag \nprotection, census ``sampling'', prosecutorial ethics and asset \nforfeiture, and adoption, among others.\n  For Ken, these were not just a list of bureaucratic responsibilities \nat the RPC--they were to him truly a passion, objects of his deeply \nheld commitment to justice, the rule of law, and the truest values of \nthe American Republic. I might add, his passion extended to the issue \nof Puerto Rican statehood, where his position was diametrically opposed \nto mine. Though he was gentleman enough not to be obvious about it, it \nwas very clear to me where he stood.\n  Whatever he worked on, he was meticulous and thorough. Whatever his \ntask, he was the first to volunteer for the heavy lifting, to collect \nall the background, to consult all the authoritative sources, to do all \nthe detailed reading and analysis, to become a walking library on the \nissue at hand. As anyone who has been to what we call the ``big room'' \nat the RPC or down to his basement station at channel 2 in the Capitol, \nknown as ``the cave,'' Ken's desk was a veritable archive, testimony to \nboth his devotion to duty and to his active mind.\n  I want to mention two matters in particular that define Ken and his \nwork in the Senate. To say that Ken was devoted to defending American \nrights under the Second Amendment is a masterpiece of understatement. \nAs one of the bumper stickers displayed on his desk puts it: ``A man \nwith a gun is a citizen; a man without a gun is a subject.'' For Ken, \nthose were words by which to live. Ken had a keen devotion to the \nconcept of ordered liberty under constitutional government and the \nreciprocal rights and duties of the citizens, especially armed \ncitizens. Whatever the gun-related issue--concealed-carry laws, instant \nbackground checks, mandatory trigger locks, or any other efforts to \ncircumvent our founders' clear words--Ken was Horatio at the bridge. \nHis assistance to me during the recent debate on gun show restrictions \nwas invaluable. He will be sorely missed by me certainly, and by the \nNation.\n  Second, it would be impossible to talk about Ken Foss without \nmentioning his devotion to the unique cultural heritage of the South, \nand especially his native State, the Commonwealth of Virginia. In all \nhe did, in his stubborn unwillingness to forsake a cause that he \nthought was just, he was constantly following, and consciously \nfollowing, in the footsteps of famous Virginians of the past upon whom \nhe looked as role models: George Washington, Patrick Henry, George \nMason, Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson. Philosophically in agreement \nwith the antifederalism of Mason and Henry, Ken really did believe that \neternal vigilance is the price of liberty, and his tireless work \nreflected that conviction.\n  His love of Virginia and of the South extended from honoring and \nemulating the great names of the past and ``Sic Semper Tyrannis,'' the \nmotto of the State of Virginia on the screen-saver on his computer, to \nhis fondness for Allman's barbecue down in Fredericksburg, southern \nrock music, and Alabama football.\n  Ken prized the distinctive heritage of his State and his region and \nwas afraid that in our modern, homogenized world, we were losing an \nirreplaceable part of a precious cultural patrimony. In his passing, \nVirginia and the South have lost a true son, and the Nation is, I \nthink, poorer for it.\n  Ken is survived by his parents, Gary and Andra Foss, and by his \nbrother Eric. I am sure I speak for all my colleagues in expressing our \ncondolences to his family. Ken's father, Gary Foss, is director of the \nFredericksburg Christian School.\n  In closing, I should mention that Ken's dedication in his \nnonprofessional life extended no less to the principles of Christian \neducation and the Reformed tradition. For Ken, service to God, to his \nchurch, to his parents, to his fellow man was an expression of the same \nqualities he demonstrated in his professional life. Whether it was the \nTen Commandments or the Constitution, Ken knew his duty and inspired \nothers to respond to the call.\n  This is how I remember him, and this is how I believe he will be \nremembered. We will all miss Ken Foss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague and friend, \nSenator Craig, in making a few comments about a friend of ours--both of \nours--Ken Foss, who passed away this past Saturday.\n  His passing is a real loss to the Senate and a real loss to this \ncountry. He was a very dedicated member of the Senate family, a person \nwith whom I had the pleasure of working for several years. When I was \nchairman of the Policy Committee, I got to know Ken Foss. He started \nhis career when he worked for Senator Coats, starting in 1990 or 1991. \nHe did good work for Senator Coats, and was an asset to our former \ncolleague's staff.\n  In 1992, I stole him from Senator Coats' office because he had great \ntalent, and great promise; and he quickly became an integral part of \nour team at the Policy Committee.\n  I was fortunate enough to be chairman of the Policy Committee from \n1991 to 1996, and blessed to know this energetic person who had a real \nlove affair with this country and a real love affair with history. Ken \nwas energetic. He worked with a lot of zeal, a lot of passion, and a \nlot of real belief.\n  I remember him working in the Policy Committee as a person who always \ndid his homework. On any issue, he did his research, and he knew his \nsubject. I remember also his dedicated work in the cave, down in the \nbasement of the Capitol, doing television work, keeping Members--all \nMembers--apprised of what was going on on the floor. He was one of the \nindividuals on whom you could count to give an update of what was \nhappening on the floor, what was happening politically, what was \nhappening substantively, what was happening procedurally, keeping \ncolleagues and staff fully informed and ready to act when the time \ncame.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  I remember one time traveling to Richmond, VA, to speak at a GOP \ngathering--actually a State convention. It was an effort to try to \nbring the party together after a somewhat divisive campaign. Ken was my \nguide to all the party officials, from those with high rank to those \nwhom we never hear much about, but make our party work. His \nunderstanding and devotion to the Virginia State Republican party was \nstrong, and unwavering, and Virginia benefited from his dedication and \nhard work.\n\n  But his political knowledge was equaled, and exceeded, by his vast \nstorehouse of knowledge about Virginia history. He knew more on this \nsubject than any person I have ever met. From the beginning of the \nCommonwealth as a colony of England, to the present day, you had no \nbetter guide than Ken. When you are talking about Civil War \nbattlefields, which I happen to be interested in, my small knowledge \npaled in comparison to Ken Foss's. And all this information, Ken shared \nfreely, enthusiastically, from school children to the elderly, \ninspiring many whom he met.\n  As all of our colleagues know, we are renovating the Rotunda. I had \nthe pleasure earlier this year of making my second or third trip to see \nthe Rotunda in my Senate career. Of course, Ken Foss wanted to \nparticipate in that, and he climbed all the way to the top with us. All \nof us on that tour certainly enjoyed his presence that morning, \nbecause, again, his ability to be able to illuminate history, going \nback to Washington, going back to the founding of our country, and \nexplaining various facts about our Capitol, was certainly informative \nand reminded us all of what a resource the Capitol is to tell our \ncountry's story to her citizens.\n  To Ken Foss's family, to his father and mother, to his brother, to \nhis countless friends, to his colleagues in the Senate, certainly he \nwill be missed by all of us. We deeply appreciate his dedication to the \nSenate. We wish to extend our condolences and sincere sympathies to his \nfamily and to his friends.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Holly Vineyard, \na Finance Committee detailee from the Department of Commerce, be \ngranted floor privileges during the pendency of S.J. Res. 27 and S.J. \nRes. 28.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nSmith's motions to discharge the Finance Committee of S.J. Res 27 and \n28. These resolutions would overturn the President's extension of the \nJackson-Vanik waiver authority with respect to China and Vietnam.\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\n  I can understand Senator Smith's desire to have the Senator consider \nand debate these resolutions. Our economic relationship with these \ncountries is clearly worth our attention.\n  This, however, is not the time for such a debate. There is a process \nalready underway in the House on these resolutions that we should allow \nto continue. The Ways and Means Committee has already reported out \nthese resoltuions--both adversely, I might add. Floor action in the \nHouse on both these measures is already planned for the next few weeks. \nWith the House ready to act, there is no reason for us to undercut that \nprocess by taking these matters up at this time.\n  If the House does pass either of these resolutions, then the Senate \nshould consider them on their merits. On the issue of China, I will be \nready, along with many of my colleagues, to discuss why maintaining \nnormal trade relations with that country is in our national interest. \nIn short, there are--and there will continue to be--areas of \nsignificant disagreement between our two nations. But the record is \nclear that our commercial relationship with China has been good for our \neconomy. It has also helped bring about positive change in China.\n  On the issue of Vietnam, I look to my colleagues, Senators John \nKerry, McCain, Bob Kerrey, Hagel, Robb, and Cleland. These Senators--\nall Vietnam veterans--support the Jackson-Vanik waiver. In their view, \nthe President's waiver has helped in resolving the problems we have had \nwith Vietnam on emigration.\n  While these are my views, in brief, a more substantive discussion of \nthese issues should come at a later time. Until the House acts, we \nshould complete our work on the matters already before us. After all, \nthe motions to discharge the committee are effectively motions to \nproceed to the resolutions themselves. That means, under the Jackson-\nVanik statute, 20 hours of floor debate on each measure. That also \nmeans putting off our consideration of the appropriations bills.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator \nSmith's motions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose Senator Smith's motion to \ndischarge from the Senate Finance Committee his resolution disapproving \nof the extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam. I do so \nbecause I believe the House should properly act first on a measure of \nthis nature, because the Committee should be afforded the opportunity \nto render judgment on Senator Smith's resolution before it is taken up \nby the full Senate, and because Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver, like \nChina's Normal Trade Relation status, is too important to fall victim \nto the political currents buffeting the Senate at this time.\n  Procedurally, the Senate has traditionally reserved consideration of \nJackson-Vanik waivers and the granting of Normal Trade Relation status \nuntil after the House has acted. As my colleagues know, the House Ways \nand Means Committee has unfavorably reported the House resolutions of \ndisapproval for both Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver and China's Normal \nTrade Relation status. These measures are scheduled for floor action in \nthe House. The Senate should not rush to judgment on either of these \nmeasures until the House has voted on them. Indeed, the Senate has over \n40 remaining days under the statutory deadline for action on the \nwaiver.\n  Substantively, the Jackson-Vanik amendment exists to promote freedom \nof emigration from non-democratic countries. The law calls for a waiver \nif it would enhance opportunities to emigrate freely. Opportunities for \nemigration from Vietnam have clearly increased since the President \nfirst waived the Jackson-Vanik amendment in 1998. The waiver has \nencouraged measurable Vietnamese cooperation in processing applications \nfor emigration under the Orderly Departure Program (ODP) and the \nResettlement Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees agreement (ROVR).\n  The Jackson-Vanik waiver has also allowed the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation (OPIC), the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), and the \nDepartment of Agriculture (USDA) to support American businesses in \nVietnam. Withdrawing OPIC, EXIM, and USDA guarantees would hurt U.S. \nbusinesses and slow progress on economic normalization. It would \nreinforce the position of hard-liners in Hanoi who believe Vietnam's \nopening to the West has proceeded too rapidly.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that I harbor no illusions about the \nhuman rights situation in Vietnam. There is clearly room for \nimprovement. The question is how best to advance both the cause of \nhuman rights and U.S. economic and security interests. The answer lies \nin the continued expansion of U.S. relations with Vietnam.\n  Although the Jackson-Vanik waiver does not relate to our POW/MIA \naccounting efforts, Vietnam-related legislation often serves as a \nreferendum on broader U.S.-Vietnam relations, in which accounting for \nour missing personnel is the United States' first priority. Thirty-\nthree Joint Field Activities conducted by the Department of Defense \nover the past six years, and the consequent repatriation of 266 sets of \nremains of American military personnel during that period, attest to \nthe ongoing cooperation between Vietnamese and American officials in \nour efforts to account for our missing service men. I am confident that \nsuch progress will continue.\n  Just as the naysayers who insisted that Vietnamese cooperation on \nPOW/MIA issues would cease altogether when we normalized relations with \nVietnam were proven wrong, so have those who insisted that Vietnam \nwould cease cooperation on emigration issues once we waived Jackson-\nVanik been proven wrong by the course of events since the original \nwaiver was issued in March 1998.\n  The Jackson-Vanik amendment was designed to link U.S. trade to the \nemigration policies of communist countries, primarily the Soviet Union. \nThe end of the Cold War fundamentally restructured global economic and \nsecurity arrangements. As the recent expansion of NATO demonstrated, \nold enemies have become new friends. Moreover, meaningful economic and \npolitical reform can only occur in Vietnam if the United States remains \nengaged there.\n  Last year, I initiated a Dear Colleague letter to members of the \nHouse of Representatives signed by every Vietnam veteran in the Senate \nbut Senator Smith, who has opposed every step in the gradual process of \nnormalizing our relations with Vietnam over the years. There are those \nin Congress, including Senator Smith, who remain opposed to the \nextension of Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver. But they do not include \nany other United States Senator who served in Vietnam and who, as a \nconsequence, might be understandably skeptical of closer U.S.-Vietnam \nrelations.\n  That body of opinion reminds us that, whatever one may think of the \ncharacter of the Vietnamese regime, such considerations should not \nobscure our clear humanitarian interest in promoting freedom of \nemigration from Vietnam. The Jackson-Vanik waiver serves that interest. \nConsequently, I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Smith's \nextraordinary motion to discharge consideration of his resolution from \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the minority of the Finance \nCommittee, I want to associate myself wholly with the remarks of our \nchairman.\n  This is not the time to engage in protracted debate on the Senate \nfloor over our economic relations with China and Vietnam. The Finance \nCommittee has not yet had an opportunity to consider the disapproval \nresolutions that the Senator from New Hampshire seeks to discharge. Nor \nhas the House acted on the companion measures. It will do so later this \nmonth. If the motions to discharge the Finance Committee are approved, \nthe Senate will be committing itself, as the Trade Act of 1974 \nprovides, to 20 hours of debate on Vietnam and 20 hours of debate on \nChina. The Senate's time is better spent on other matters.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has moved to discharge the Finance \nCommittee from further consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 27 and \nSenate Joint Resolution 28. Let us be clear what is at issue here. S.J. \nRes. 27 and S.J. Res. 28 disapprove of the President's decision of June \n3, 1999 to extend for another year his waiver of the so-called \n``Jackson-Vanik'' amendment as\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\nit applies to China and Vietnam, respectively.\n  A bit of history is in order. The Jackson-Vanik amendment was the \nvision of Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington, who, in 1972, first \nproposed:\n\n       . . . an unprecedented measure to bring the blessings of \n     liberty to these brave men and women who have asked only for \n     the chance to find freedom in a new land.\n\n``Scoop'' Jackson's amendment was precipitated by the decision of the \nSoviet Union, in August 1972, to assess exorbitant fees on persons \nwishing to emigrate. Cloaked as ``education reimbursement fees'' or \n``diploma taxes,'' the Soviet authorities argued that emigrants owed an \nobligation to reimburse the Government for their free education, since, \nby reason of their departure, the emigrants would no longer put their \neducation to use for the benefit of Soviet society.\n  The exit taxes applied to all emigrants, but affected primarily \nSoviet Jews wishing to emigrate to Israel or the United States. Thus \nwas born the Jackson-Vanik amendment. Representative Charles Vanik of \nOhio was the chief sponsor in the House. The amendment--Section 402 of \nthe Trade Act of 1974--provides that no country shall be eligible to \nreceive Normal Trade Relations tariff treatment or to participate in \nany United States Government programs that extend credit or credit \nguarantees or investment guarantees if that country:\n  (1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate;\n  (2) imposes more than a nominal tax on emigration or on the visas or \nother documents required for emigration, for any purpose or cause \nwhatsoever; or\n  (3) imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge \non any citizen as a consequence of the desire of such citizen to \nemigrate to the country of his choice.\n  Under the law, the President may waive these restrictions if he \ndetermines that:\n\n       . . . such waiver will substantially promote the objectives \n     of this section . . . and he has received assurances that the \n     emigration practices of that country will henceforth lead \n     substantially to the achievement of the objectives of this \n     section.\n\n  The United States has granted NTR status to China since 1980, on the \nbasis of a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik provisions. Vietnam does not yet \nenjoy NTR status, but, since 1998, when the President first waived the \nJackson-Vanik requirements, U.S. exports to Vietnam and investment \nprojects in that country have been eligible for certain U.S. Government \ncredits and credit and investment guarantees issued by the United \nStates Export-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation \nand the United States Department of Agriculture.\n  The issue before the Senate, then, is whether the Senate agrees with \nthe President's assessment of the emigration policies and practices of \nChina and Vietnam. At stake are our economic relations with those \ncountries.\n  The first point to be made is that the authors of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment had neither China nor Vietnam in mind when they drafted their \nprovision. The amendment was a creature of the Cold War, and is today \nan anachronism in many respects.\n  The President's June 3, 1999 report to the Congress, which \naccompanied his determination to extend the Jackson-Vanik waiver to \nChina for another year, made the following points:\n\n       In FY 1998, 27,776 U.S. immigrant visas were issued to \n     Chinese nationals abroad, up slightly from FY 1997 . . . and \n     up to the numerical limitation under U.S. law . . . .\n       The principal constraint on increased emigration continues \n     to be the capacity and willingness of other nations to absorb \n     Chinese immigrants rather than Chinese policy.\n\n  On Vietnam, the President reported the following:\n\n       Overall, Vietnam's emigration policy has liberalized \n     considerably in the last decade and a half. Vietnam has a \n     solid record of cooperation with the United States in \n     permitting Vietnamese to emigrate. Over 500,000 Vietnamese \n     have emigrated as refugees or immigrants to the United States \n     under the Orderly Departure Program (ODP), and only a small \n     number of refugee applicants remain to be processed.\n\n  The President reported particular progress in the so-called ROVR \nprogram--the Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Returnees \nprogram--formalized in 1997 to facilitate the emigration of Vietnamese \nwho were still in asylum camps in Southeast Asia or who had recently \nreturned to Vietnam.\n  As the President noted in his June 3, 1999 report:\n\n       After a slow start, processing of eligible cases under the \n     ROVR program accelerated dramatically in 1998 and is now near \n     completion. As of June 1, 1999, the [Government of Vietnam] \n     had cleared for interview 19,975 individuals, or 96 percent \n     of the ROVR applicants.\n\n  Given these findings, I would submit that the President's \ndetermination to waive the Jackson-Vanik freedom-of-emigration \nprovisions with respect to both China and Vietnam was fully in \naccordance with the law. I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nmotion to discharge the Finance Committee from further consideration of \nthe disapproval resolutions: there is no need to take the Senate's time \nat this point.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the able Senator from New Hampshire is to \nbe commended for bringing to the attention of the Senate the issue of \nnormal trade relations with the communist regimes of China and Vietnam.\n  Few Senators have so steadfastly opposed communism in East Asia as \nSenator Bob Smith. During this decade when it has been fashionable to \ndeclare the cold war over and just forget about the billion-plus people \nwho continue to suffer under communist oppression, Senator Smith has \nremained firm in his commitment to freedom in East Asia and that is why \nhe is bringing these motions before the Senate today.\n  And on that score, I join Senator Smith in support of the policies \nthat he is emphasizing here today--that of denying normal trade status \nto Communist China and Vietnam. The Senator is right on the mark. \nNeither of these illegitimate regimes merits this honor. Mr. President, \ntoo often, in our search for trade dollars, we neglect to ask \nourselves: With whom are we doing business?\n  Well, let's ask.\n  We are dealing with a communist regime in China that has \nillegitimately held power for 50 years. The same regime, in fact, that \nkilled so many U.S. soldiers in the Korean war. The same regime that \nhas killed tens of millions of its own people since 1949. And the same \nregime that has consistently identified the United States as the number \none obstacle to its strategic agenda.\n  Supporters of the engagement theory dismiss all of this. They say \nthat normal trade with China is in the U.S. interest and, in any event, \nwill change China's behavior for the better. Reality has yet to catch \nup with the theory. Red China's behavior continues to be unacceptable \nand it is difficult to see which U.S. interests are being served by \ntrade-as-usual with this regime.\n  This year, as in the past, there is voluminous evidence to contradict \nthe claims of the engagement theorists. Whether it be national security \nissues or human rights, the picture in China is even bleaker than it \nwas a year ago, the exact opposite of what the engagement theorists \nhave predicted.\n  For starters, we have the Cox Committee's revelations of China's \nmassive pilfering of our nuclear secrets. At a minimum, the Cox report \nhas laid waste to the notion of China as a strategic partner. And the \norchestration of anti-American riots by the Chinese government in May \nhas reminded us that the true colors of the communist regime remain \nunchanged.\n  Meanwhile, China continues its reckless foreign policies that \nengagement was supposed to help moderate. In March, ace reporter Bill \nGertz revealed that despite its promises to the Clinton administration, \nChina continues to proliferate weapons of mass destruction to fellow \nrogue regimes around the world.\n  In February, the Pentagon reported that China is engaged in a massive \nbuildup of missiles aimed at the democratic country of Taiwan.\n  Similar to national security issues, human rights have also regressed \nafter another year of normal trade with China. The State Department \nitself was forced to admit this in April in its annual Country Reports \non Human Rights Practices. Even on the economic front, where one might \nexpect some benefits to accrue to America from trade with China, the \nyield is minimal. In 1998, American exports to Communist China were \njust $14 billion, less than one-fifth of one percent of GNP and fifty \npercent less than we export to democratic Taiwan.\n  The picture in Vietnam is similar. That country is still run by the \nsame\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\ncommunist autocrats as when the U.S. trade relationship resumed in \n1994. These, of course, were the same revolutionaries who killed 58,000 \nAmericans in the Vietnam war. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese people today \nstill don't enjoy any real freedoms of speech, assembly, religion or \npolitical activity. The Vietnamese government continues to put up \nroadblocks to emigration for Montagnards and other citizens who wish to \nescape the misery and tyranny of Communist Vietnam. The economy is \nstill a socialist mess, riddled with bureaucracy and corruption.\n  And yet again, Mr. President, we cannot stand here today and honestly \nclaim that the Vietnamese government has provided a full accounting of \nour missing soldiers from the Vietnam war.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that granting normal trade \nrelations to China and Vietnam has purchased precious little for the \nUnited States and we ought to revoke the status for both countries.\n  But while I support Senator Smith from a policy point of view, I \ncannot agree with the method that is being used here today. I am \nconcerned that utilizing a motion to discharge these resolutions \ninfringes on the prerogatives of the committee of jurisdiction, in this \ncase the Finance Committee. Thus, I cannot support these motions.\n  However, given the gravity of the underlying policy issues, I would \nstrongly encourage the Committee on Finance to report out Senate Joint \nResolutions 27 and 28 so that the Senate can debate these important \nmeasures.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank Senator Helms for \nhis support of both the motion to discharge on the Vietnam issue, as \nwell as the China issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. In response to my colleague \nfrom Delaware regarding what has happened in the past on the \ndifferences between the House and the Senate on such resolutions, I \nstate for the record that the Trade Act of 1974, which is the item in \nquestion, on procedures in the Senate regarding discharges, says:\n\n       If the Senate passes a resolution before receiving from the \n     House of Representatives a joint resolution that contains the \n     identical matter, the joint resolution shall be held at the \n     desk pending receipt of the joint resolution from the House.\n\n  So there is absolutely no problem whatsoever in having the Senate \ndeal with this. In the past, the Senate has deferred action on the \nJackson-Vanik waivers, according to Senator Roth, and the House has \nacted first. But we don't have to wait for the House to pass anything \nto act on it. It is clearly within the act of 1974. And so, with all \ndue respect, I am not trying to assume any powers that aren't in the \nact itself.\n  I also want to respond to the point that Chairman Roth made in which \nhe said: Until the House acts, there is no need to defer action on the \ncritical matters currently before the Senate. Indeed, House action may \nmoot the need to take up these resolutions at all.\n  Let me also point out that should the discharge motion prevail, there \nis no attempt by me to bring this up immediately and get into the \nSenate's time. If the majority leader and minority leader determine \nthey want to take this up at another time other than today or tomorrow \nor even this week, that is perfectly all right with me. I am not in any \nway trying to interrupt the Senate schedule. There is simply an hour \nequally divided on these motions. So it will take 2 hours of the \nSenate's time and that is it, as far as I am concerned today. Unless \nthe leaders decide they want to take it up now, that would be OK.\n  Also, regarding critical matters before the Senate, China has been in \nthe news a lot lately, to say the least, and if the situation in China \nin terms of the human rights violations, the spy scandal, and all the \nother things that have gone on--if that is not a critical matter to \nbring before the Senate, I guess I am not sure what critical is. I \nbelieve it is critical, and I think it should be discussed.\n  In spite of that, should the leaders determine this should not be \ndiscussed today, tomorrow, or next week, I am amenable to whatever \nschedule the majority leader would like to work out to bring this \nmatter to the floor for the 20 hours of debate, which would follow if \nthe discharge resolution prevails.\n  For the information of my colleagues, the discharge motion I have \nmade as a sponsor of S.J. Res. 28 is a privileged matter and in \naccordance with the Trade Act of 1974. I am very pleased to have the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, as a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  The discharge motion now before the Senate is in order under the 1974 \nTrade Act simply because more than 30 days have expired since I \nintroduced it on June 7, 1999. And to date, the resolution has not been \nreported by the Finance Committee. I am sure it is not being reported \nbecause, respectfully, the chairman disagrees with me on this. He has \nevery right to not report it, and I respect that. But I also have the \nright to discharge it.\n  What is S.J. Res. 128 in layman's terms, and why do I want my \ncolleagues on both sides to allow this bill to be discharged and placed \non the Senate calendar? It is a fair question and I want to answer \ndirectly.\n  Under section 402 of the Trade Act of 1974, Communist countries--in \nthis case the Socialist Republic of Vietnam--are not eligible to \nparticipate, either directly or indirectly, in U.S. Government programs \nthat extend credit or investment guarantees if the country denies its \ncitizens the right or opportunity to emigrate, if it denies its \ncitizens the right to emigrate, if it imposes more than a nominal tax \non emigration and visa papers, and more than a nominal tax, levies a \nfine, fee, or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of that \ncitizen's desire to emigrate or leave their country. In other words, if \na citizen is taxed to leave, or denied the right to leave, then this is \nwhat the Trade Act is all about.\n  Simply put--and this would not surprise many colleagues, I hope--\nVietnam severely restricts the rights of its citizens to have the \nopportunity to emigrate. It has done so since the fall of Saigon, and \nit continues to do so. Corruption and bribery by Vietnamese officials \nis rampant with respect to those desperately trying to get out through \nthe application process. Many of these people bring their life savings, \nsome of them borrowing money to get out, and then after the money is \nconfiscated they are still denied.\n  That is why Vietnam has historically not been eligible to take \nadvantage of American taxpayer-funded programs which subsidize business \ndeals between American companies and the Communist Government agencies \nin Hanoi; that is, until last year. It is very important.\n  When President Clinton decided to use the section of this same Trade \nAct of 1974 which allows him to grant a waiver of Jackson-Vanik, the \nfreedom of immigration requirement, if he determines that such a waiver \nwill ``substantially promote the objections of this section,'' which, \nas I said, is to ensure that countries do not impose more than a \nnominal tax fee or fee to immigrate and they don't hinder the human \nrights--if the President determines that there are no human rights \nviolations, or no fees beyond nominal fees to get out processing, then \nwe grant this waiver.\n  But the question is: Is that true? I don't think it is.\n  I would like to have the opportunity--which is all I am asking for in \nthis discharge motion--to prove that on the floor of the Senate. I know \nthere are 20 hours equally divided. I don't need 10 hours, but I would \nlike to have a little time to prove it. I hope my colleagues will \nrespect me on that.\n  The President cannot use the waiver unless he has received assurances \nthat the immigration practices of that country will henceforth lead \nsubstantially to the achievement of the objectives I just outlined \nbefore, such as stopping bribery and corruption by Communist officials. \nBut the President's use of this waiver authority with regard to Vietnam \nhas been in effect now for a little over a year.\n  My colleagues should understand that we now have the opportunity to \ngo back and look over the past several months and make an informed \njudgment about whether the President's waiver of the freedom of \nimmigration requirement during this period has actually resulted in \n``substantial promotion'' in Vietnam's human rights records on \nimmigration matters.\n  If you believe it has, then you should not be afraid to come to the \nfloor and debate me on it whenever the leader\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\ndecides to bring it here. You will have the opportunity to vote against \na disapproval resolution I have introduced with Senator Helms to \nnullify the President's waiver. But why would you? Why would you be \nafraid to stand up and defend it? If you think that everything is fine \nand that all of these policies have not been violated, then come to the \nSenate floor and debate me, and we will see who wins on that point.\n  If you think President Clinton should not abuse this waiver based on \nVietnam's performance, if you think President Clinton should have \ninstead insisted that Vietnam actually comply with the freedom of \nimmigration standards, then you would vote for this discharge. You \nwould vote for S.J. Res. 28, and ultimately you would vote against \ngranting the waiver.\n  However--this is important--in order to have the debate on the \nresolution, in order to carry out our constitutional duty under article \nI, section 8, to regulate trade matters with foreign nations, we need \nto discharge the bill and bring it to the floor.\n  I want to point out, because sometimes we forget we took an oath to \nthe Constitution of the United States, it says in article I, section 8, \nthat ``Congress shall have Power to . . . regulate Commerce with \nForeign Nations . . . '' It is pretty clear.\n  If there is some difference of opinion as to a particular law \nregarding commerce with foreign nations, then we ought to have the \nopportunity to debate it on the floor. That is all I am asking in this \nresolution. It is that simple. As I said in my ``Dear Colleague,'' \nwhether you support or whether you oppose the actual underlying \nresolution, you should at least be willing to support having a debate \non the measure.\n\n  That is all I am asking: Could we have a debate on it, instead of \nleaving the bill bottled up in the Finance Committee where it \nautomatically becomes effective. Come down, make your arguments, and \nallow me to make mine. That is what the American people expect us to \ndo. Then we will have a vote after a few hours of debate.\n  I have studied it. People say there are so many other important \nthings. I am not too sure about that. In the case of Vietnam, we still \nhave MIA matters unresolved. We have foreign businesses that are going \nto make huge profits if we allow all of these things to go on. We have \nVietnamese citizens in this country who escaped and who have had a lot \nof their earnings confiscated. They sent them over there to try to get \ntheir families out. What happened? The Vietnamese Government \nconfiscated the money, and then they did not let the family members \nout.\n  I have been going over this a lot over the past several months. I \nhave heard from countless Vietnamese Americans all across this country \nin all 50 of our States. They have family members and friends in \nVietnam, many of whom fought alongside the United States during the \nVietnam war. I want to tell you their stories. I want to share the \nstories of these people who have tried so hard to get their loved ones \nout after they themselves have been able to escape. But I can't do it \nin half an hour. I can't do it in 30 minutes. I need the time to do it \nso we can make an intelligent decision on this waiver that the \nPresident has granted.\n  Every Member of the Senate needs to hear these accounts of \npersecution and corruption that many Vietnamese continue to experience \nat the hands of Communist Government officials throughout that nation. \nSome of them have been forced to pay bribes into the thousands of \ndollars, and even after they paid the bribes, they have been denied the \nright to emigrate. I want to tell you those stories.\n  I have also heard from our staff who are assisting refugees in \nSoutheast Asia who are trying to help these Vietnamese. I want to share \nwith you all of what they have been telling me. But I am not going to \nbe able to get into any serious level of detail on these matters if 51 \nof my colleagues prevent me from debating this on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me say up front that I am a Vietnam veteran who feels very \nstrongly about this issue. Some of my colleagues neglect to mention \nthat when they are talking about Vietnam veterans. But I am one in the \nSenate. However, there are others, such as the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, who is here today, and the senior Senator from Arizona, \nwho disagree with me. That is fine. I asked them, and the four other \nVietnam vets in the Senate--indeed, every Member in the Senate--not to \nduck the debate, to come down and debate me, to have a good debate, and \nthen let the Senate decide based on what they hear. But let's not \nbottle this up in the Senate Finance Committee. Vote to let this debate \ntake place. Come down and participate. I look forward to debating you. \nIt is going to take a little bit of the Senate's time. It is worth it. \nIt is the taxpayers' money that is being used. People's lives are being \naffected. Good American citizens, who have family members in Vietnam, \nhave a right to have this heard on the Senate floor.\n\n  I am not asking people to vote with me on the underlying resolution. \nI am just asking people to give me a chance to debate it and make a \ndecision. It might take an afternoon. It might take an evening. I am \ncertainly not going to use 10 hours, but I am prepared to do this in \ndetail at whatever time the majority leader says so. I think we owe the \nAmerican people that. I think it is wrong to prevent this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the effort of the Senator from New \nHampshire whose efforts on this are long and untiring. I respect his \ncommitment to the opposing point of view, but I disagree with him, as I \nknow a number of my colleagues do.\n  I agree with the procedural arguments that the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee has made. On the merits of the issue, I \nstrongly support the President's decision to renew the waiver of the \nJackson-Vanik amendment for Vietnam. There is no question that \noverturning that waiver would have serious consequences--negative \nconsequences--for our bilateral relations with Vietnam and for our \nlarger interests in the region.\n  The United States has very important interests, as we know. One is \nfor obtaining the fullest possible accounting of American servicemen \nmissing from the war. That still remains the first priority of our \nrelationship. But in addition to that, we have interests in promoting \nfreedom of immigration, promoting human rights and freedoms, and \nencouraging Vietnam to maintain its course of economic reform and to \nopen its markets to American and to other companies.\n  We also have important political and strategic interests in promoting \nthe stability of the often volatile region of Southeast Asia, as well \nas in balancing some of the interests of China in the region, and \nclearly our relationship with Vietnam is important in that effort. \nThese interests, in my judgment, dictate that we should maintain a very \nactive presence and a very effective working relationship with all of \nthe countries in the region, including Vietnam.\n  The real question to be asked is, How do you promote the most \neffective relationship in the region, and with Vietnam? It is, in my \njudgment, not by denying Vietnam trade and other benefits of \ninteraction with the United States, nor do we do it by engaging them in \nan incremental process of building an effective and mutually beneficial \npolicy of engagement.\n\n  Some of us have been engaged in this issue for a long time in the \nSenate. I have been involved in it for the 15 years I have been here.\n  As the former chairman of the POW/MIA committee that set up the \npolicy whereby we began to get some answers to the questions regarding \nour missing servicepeople, let me just say that there is one clear fact \nthat is irrefutable. For 20 years we denied a relationship. For 20 \nyears we didn't engage. For 20 years we refused to build the kind of \ncooperative effort in which we are currently engaged. For those 20 \nyears after the war, we didn't get any\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\nanswers at all regarding our missing. The fact is that it was under \nPresident Reagan and President Bush that we began a process of \nengagement. President Bush and General Scowcroft moved us carefully \ndown that road, and President Clinton has continued that policy of \neliciting from the Vietnamese the kind of cooperation that has provided \nthe answers to many families in this country about their loved ones who \nare missing in Vietnam.\n  I have recounted that progress many times in this Chamber. I don't \nintend to go through it again now, in the interest of time. Let me just \nemphasis one very important point.\n  Last year, those who opposed the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik \namendment suggested as one of the arguments for opposing it that POW/\nMIA accounting was going to stop or it would decrease. In fact, the \nopposite is true. Their predictions of dire impact last year have \nproven wrong, just as the predictions that, by being more hard-line and \nnot involving ourselves with them, we would get answers have proven \nwrong.\n  The Vietnamese have continued to conduct bilateral and unilateral \ninvestigations and document searches and to cooperate in the trilateral \ninvestigations. Leads that might help resolve outstanding discrepancy \ncases continue to be investigated by the Vietnamese and the American \nteams. In fact, the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment last year \nserved as an incentive for continued progress on immigration. As a \nresult, the processing of our applicants under the orderly departure \nprogram and the ROVR program have continued to the point that we are \nextraordinarily satisfied.\n  Although progress in the area of human rights is not everything we \nwant it to be, even liberalization has continued over the last year, as \nevidenced by increased participation in religious activities, \nVietnamese access to the Internet, 60 strikes by workers, including \nstrikes against state-owned enterprises, as well as the release of 24 \nprisoners of conscience.\n  If we overturn the Jackson-Vanik waiver, in my judgment and in the \njudgment of Senator McCain, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Chuck Robb, and \nSenator Hagel, and others who have served, we run the risk of setting \nback progress on these issues as well as negating the current \nextraordinary progress on the bilateral trade agreement, which I \nbelieve is extraordinarily close to being signed.\n  Our step-by-step approach to normalizing relations is working, and it \nis in keeping with the many interests of our Government that I have \nexpressed. I believe we should stay the course and therefore oppose the \nefforts of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the motion to discharge the Committee on Finance from further \nconsideration of the resolution disapproving the extension of the \nJackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam.\n  The chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator Roth, has explained \nwhy this is a premature and unnecessary motion because the underlying \nresolution is privileged, and if the House passes either resolution, \nthen the full Senate would be required to take up the resolution. It is \nexpected that the full House will vote on the measure soon. So let's \nkeep our attention on the very important and timely legislation \ncurrently being considered by the Senate.\n  But I also want to stress that even if this were the right time to \nconsider the Jackson-Vanik waiver, the Senate should not adopt a \nresolution of disapproval. Although it is often forgotten in the debate \nover normal trade relations, the Jackson-Vanik waiver's chief objective \nis promoting freedom of emigration.\n  The President extended Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver because he \ndetermined that doing so would substantially promote greater freedom of \nemigration in the future in Vietnam. I support this determination \nbecause of Vietnam's record of progress on emigration and on Vietnam's \ncontinued and intensified cooperation on U.S. refugee programs.\n  According to testimony by the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete \nPeterson, Vietnam's emigration policy has opened considerably in the \nlast decade and a half. As a consequence, over 500,000 Vietnamese have \nemigrated as refugees or immigrants to the United States under the \nOrderly Departure Program, and only a small number of refugee \napplications remain.\n  So on the merits, the waiver is justified. But I also believe that \nsince it was first granted in March 1998, the Jackson-Vanik waiver has \nbeen an essential component of our policy of engagement and has \ndirectly furthered progress with Vietnam on furthering U.S. policy \ngoals. Goals which include, first and foremost, accounting for the \nmissing from the Vietnam war--our MIAs, promoting regional stability, \nimproving respect for human rights, and opening markets for U.S. \nbusiness.\n  I support the President's decision because I continue to believe, and \nthe evidence supports, that increased access to Vietnam leads to \nincrease progress on the accounting issue.\n  Resolvin the fate of our MIAs has been, and will remain, the highest \npriority for our government. This nation owes that to the men and the \nfamilies of the men that made the ultimate sacrifice for their country \nand for freedom.\n  In pursuit of that goal, I have traveled to Vietnam three times and \nI held over 40 hours of hearings on the issue in 1986 as chairman of \nthe Veterans' Committee. The comparison between the situation in 1986 \nand today is dramatic.\n\n  In 1986, I was appalled to learn that we had no first hand \ninformation about the fate of POW/MIAs because we had no access to the \nVietnamese government or to its military archives or prisons. We could \nnot travel to crash sites. We had no opportunity to interview \nVietnamese individuals or officials.\n  In 1993, opponents of ending our isolationist policy argued that \nlifting the trade embargo would mean an end to Vietnamese cooperation. \nThis is distinctly not the case. American Joint Task Force--Full \nAccounting (JTF-FA) personnel located in Hanoi have access to Vietnam's \ngovernment and to its military archives and prisons. They freely travel \nto crash sites and interview Vietnamese citizens and officials.\n  During the post-embargo period, the Vietnam Government cooperated on \nother issues as well, including resolving millions of dollars in \ndiplomatic property and private claims of Americans who lost property \nat the end of the war.\n  The Jackson-Vanik waiver has helped the U.S. government influence \nVietnam's progress toward an open, market-oriented economy. It has also \nbenefited U.S. companies by making available a number of U.S. \nGovernment trade promotion and investment support programs that enhance \ntheir ability to compete in this potentially important market. And I \nhope that soon our trade negotiators will be able to complete a sound, \ncommercially viable trade agreement with Vietnam that will further \nexpand market opportunities for American companies.\n  Before I close, let me urge my colleagues who may be unsure about \ntheir vote to consult with the U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete \nPeterson. Ambassador Peterson, a Vietnam veteran who himself was a \nprisoner of war, and who also served in the House of Representatives, \nhas been a tireless advocate of U.S. interests in Vietnam. With his \nbackground and experience, his counsel should be trusted.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to discharge.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of my \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I \noppose this motion to discharge S.J. Res. 28 from the Finance \nCommittee. I oppose this for both procedural and substantive reasons.\n  Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives must initiate \nall tax, trade, and revenue measures. The Senate has always deferred to \nthe House to take first action on Jackson-Vanik waivers because they \nare tax-and-trade measures.\n  On July 1, the House Ways and Means Committee voted out the House \nversion of this resolution with a negative recommendation. The House \nwill soon take up that resolution. I expect the full House to repeat \nits vote of last year and defeat that resolution.\n  Last year, the House defeated 260 to 163 a resolution to disapprove \nthe\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nPresident's Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam. If the House should pass \neither the China or Vietnam resolution, the Senate would then take up \nthat resolution. The motions to discharge the Finance Committee of \nthese two resolutions are inappropriate and premature.\n  The comments made by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, in \nmy opinion, capture the essence of this issue. Vietnam is still an \nauthoritarian government. Much progress yet needs to be made. But it is \nthe opinion of many of us that the best way to encourage that progress \nand to lead that progress is to engage. That means open not just \ndialog, but opportunities. History has been rather clear that commerce \nis the one bridge, the one vehicle that has done the most over the \nhundreds and thousands of years of human history to accomplish these \nissues we still must deal with--human rights issues, immigration issues \nand, certainly, as the Senator from Massachusetts opened his speech, \nthe MIA issue.\n  There is not a Senator in this body, certainly none of us who served \nin Vietnam, who does not take that as a serious responsibility. I think \nthis approach is a mistaken approach but well-intended. I salute my \nfriend and colleague from New Hampshire for his efforts, but I believe \nit is taking us down the wrong path.\n  I am proud to stand with Ambassador Pete Peterson and the other five \nVietnam veterans in the Senate to support the Jackson-Vanik waiver for \nVietnam. The other Senate Vietnam veterans are: Senators McCain, John \nKerry, Bob Kerrey, Robb, and Cleland.\n  Is Vietnam a Jeffersonian Democracy and a full market economy? Of \ncourse not. But Vietnam has made progress. We should nurture that \nprogress, not turn back the clock.\n  It is ironic that we would undermine our modest trade relationship \nwith Vietnam at this time. Ambassador Barshefsky is in the final stages \nof negotiating a trade agreement that would substantially open \nVietnam's market. We should support her efforts to open Vietnam's \nmarkets and promote economic reform.\n  The Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam primarily benefits Americans, \nnot Vietnamese. It allows the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas \nPrivate Investment Corporation to support American exports and jobs.\n  This is not about normal trading relations or expanding access to the \nU.S. market. We not yet provide NTR status to Vietnam, although Vietnam \nprovides NTR status to the United States.\n  We can only have normal trading relations with Vietnam if we conclude \nan agreement that would increase U.S. access to the Vietnamese market. \nThat would be the time to debate whether it serves our Nation's \ninterest to have normal trade relations with Vietnam.\n  The Jackson-Vanik amendment was all about trying to apply leverage on \nthe Soviet Union in the 1970s to increase Jewish emigration. The Soviet \nUnion no longer exists. But it was written into permanent law to affect \nall ``non-market economies,'' including Vietnam.\n  Is Vietnam perfect? No, far from it. But look how far Vietnam has \ncome and U.S.-Vietnam relations have come in five short years:\n  Before 1994, the U.S. and Vietnam had no political or economic \nrelations;\n  In January 1994, John McCain and John Kerry offered an amendment \ncalling for and end to the U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam;\n  In February 1994, President Clinton followed the lead of the Senate \nand ended the U.S. trade embargo;\n  In July 1995, the President granted diplomatic recognition to \nVietnam;\n  In April 1997, the Senate confirmed our first Ambassador to Vietnam, \nPete Peterson; and\n  In March 1998, the President waived the Jackson-Vanik law and \npermitted our trade promotion agencies to operate in Vietnam. This has \nalways been the first step to full compliance with the law, the \nnegotiation of a trade agreement, and the establishment of normal \ntrading relations.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire honestly believes that turning back \nthe clock of the last five years is a better policy than engagement. I \nrespect the Senator's views, but believe that his position is simply \nwrong.\n  I will not engage in the debate on whether emigration from Vietnam is \ntotally free. Vietnam itself is not totally free. Far from it. But \nthere has been tremendous improvement.\n  In fiscal year 1998, 9,742 Vietnamese were granted immigrant visas to \nthe United States under the ``Orderly Departure Program.'' The State \nDepartment expects that number to rise to 25,000 this year and 30,000 \nnext year.\n  In the last 15 years, 500,000 Vietnamese have immigrated to the \nUnited States, and very few refugees remain to be processed. As a \nresult of the first Jackson-Vanik waiver granted last year, Vietnam's \ncooperation on immigration matters has intensified.\n  The State Department expects that processing will be completed for \nall special caseloads, including the Orderly Departure Program [ODP] \nand the Resettlement Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees [ROVR] \nprograms.\n  Again, we must consider how to encourage Vietnam to do even more to \nopen up its society, its economy and its political system. Do we \nencourage openness through isolation? No, we spread American values \nthrough economic, cultural and political contact between our two \npeoples.\n  I urge defeat of this motion, and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from \nNebraska, with respect, if there is information and evidence which \nindicates that Vietnam or China--but, in this case, Vietnam--was not \nfollowing the spirit and intent of Jackson-Vanik, why does my colleague \noppose the opportunity to have me present that information to the \nSenate? We may respectfully disagree after looking at all the \ninformation, but it seems to me a reasonable request on my part to \ndischarge this. To not discharge it, I say to my colleagues, bottles it \nup, does not give us the opportunity to debate it, does not give me the \nopportunity to present to my colleagues information I have that will \nshow dramatically that that is not the case.\n  I only have, at the most, 15 minutes, so let me do it as quickly as I \ncan with the facts at my disposal. I regret very much I am not going to \nget the opportunity, unless my colleagues support me on this.\n  This is a memorandum from the Joint Voluntary Agency that runs the \nOrderly Departure Program in Bangkok, July 14, 1999:\n\n       request for refugee statistics and assessment of odp cases\n\n       Corruption and Bribery by the Vietnamese Government: \n     Although ODP has no formal statistics . . . over the years we \n     have received and continue to receive communications from ODP \n     applicants that point to consistent and continuing cases of \n     bribery, extortion and other kinds of malpractice. . . .\n       Re-education Camp Detainee Caseload: At the present rate of \n     granting interview permission, we do not expect Re-education \n     Camp Detainee Caseload to be completed by the end of [the] \n     Fiscal Year. . . .\n       Contact With the Montagnards: Prior to March, 1998, people \n     from this ethnic group experienced tremendous difficulties \n     communicating with ODP . . . Since March, 1998, contact with \n     the Montagnards has continued to be limited. The Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam has made it clear they do not want ODP to \n     contact applicants directly. . . .\n\n  I do not have the time to get into this. I want to take the time. \nPlease give me that opportunity. This is the Joint Voluntary Agency \nthat runs the Orderly Departure Program in Bangkok. They do not have an \nax to grind with anybody. They are trying to do their job. My \ncolleagues are not going to give me the time, if you defeat my motion \nto discharge, to bring this information to the forefront.\n  Let's look at another one. This is a memorandum from the Joint \nVoluntary Agency, Orderly Departure Program, American Embassy, Bangkok, \nJuly 14, 1999:\n\n       request for refugee statistics and assessment of odp cases\n\n       The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has frequently determined \n     applicants did not meet ODP criteria, despite our \n     confirmation that they did; many applicants are still \n     awaiting interview authorization . . . As of July 9th, there \n     are 3,432 ODP refugee applicants and 747 ROVR applicants \n     awaiting Vietnamese Government authorization for interview . \n     . . ODP has continually received requests from applicants for \n     assistance in dealing with local officials; many applicants \n     originally applied to ODP as long ago as 1988 but have yet to \n     be given authorization by the Vietnamese Government to attend \n     an interview.\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n       Impact of Jackson-Vanik Waiver: It would not appear that \n     Jackson-Vanik had a telling impact on ODP activities . . . \n     Staff [of the Joint Voluntary Agency] are of the opinion \n     that there has been little, if any, indication of \n     improvement in the Vietnamese Government's efforts to deal \n     with remaining ODP cases.\n\n  If given the opportunity, I will present to you that evidence. I do \nnot have time in another 5 or 6 minutes.\n  This is from the State Department, Dewey Pendergrass, most recent \nOrderly Departure director and current director of Consular Services in \nSaigon, November 24, 1998. Listen to what the State Department is \nsaying. Because they support MFN with China, because they are not \npaying any attention to ODP, they do not care about these people who \nare trying to desperately get their loved ones out and paying \nexorbitant fines and fees and still cannot get them out. Listen to what \nhe says and then tell me you do not want to give me opportunity to \ndebate this:\n\n       Generally speaking, I would discourage any dialogue with \n     the U.S. Catholic Conference or the International Catholic \n     Migration Commission, or any of the other refugee advocacy \n     organizations, on Vietnamese refugee processing . . . You are \n     dealing here with true believers.\n\n  My God, true believers. They want to get these people out. They are \ntrying to get them out of Vietnam. They are trying to stop the \npersecution so they are labeled ``true believers.'' What is wrong with \nthat? This is a State Department official. This is a memo we are not \nsupposed to have:\n\n       I would not try to explain why we are doing what we are \n     doing. From long and unhappy experience, I can assure you \n     that you do not want to get mired in a ``dialogue'' with \n     these guys . . .\n\n  Of course not; if you get mired in a dialog, you will find out the \ntruth. God forbid we find out the truth. Let's sweep it all under the \nrug. Let's make sure we get most-favored-nation treatment for this \ncommunist dictator group that tramples on the human rights of its own \npeople, refuses to give us answers still on our missing service \npersonnel, and we are going to sweep this under the rug.\n  Dewey Pendergrass from the State Department says this. Let's finish \nit:\n\n       As I said, these are true believers, and they are fighting \n     at this very moment to expand refugee processing as we near \n     the completion of the residual caseload . . . I'm sounding \n     paranoid here, right? Believe me, I know whereof I speak . . \n     . I really am not exaggerating. Again, I recommend that you \n     do not meet with them, not explain, not apologize, regardless \n     of any professional courtesy you may think is due. Just send \n     the polite acknowledgment.\n\n  The State Department, which is there to help these people, is making \nthose kinds of comments. It is an absolute insult, and the man should \nbe fired on the spot.\n\n       To: Joint Voluntary Agency.\n       From: Orderly Departure Program, Bangkok.\n       Subject: JVA Failure to Destroy Denied Ameriasian Files \n     Over Two Years Old as Instructed by Department of State.\n\n  So now we are going to destroy files to make darn sure that if they \nhave any opportunity to get out, they will not be able to get out. \nAmeriasians are children of American servicemen and Vietnamese women:\n\n       The Department has asked me to determine the reason for \n     JVA's failure to destroy the old files on Ameriasian cases \n     denied over two years ago as instructed. I note that JVA has \n     been instructed in writing to perform this task several \n     times--\n\n  To destroy these files.\n\n       I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a \n     satisfactory reason why these specific directions have not \n     been carried out.\n\n  He is chewing somebody out because they did not destroy these files \non people who are desperately trying to make contact with their \nfathers, their loved ones.\n\n       The goal of these reports is simple: to tell the truth \n     about human rights conditions . . . These reports form the \n     heart of United States human rights policy, for they provide \n     the official human rights information based upon which policy \n     judgments are made. They are designed to provide all three \n     branches of the Federal Government with an authoritative \n     factual basis for making decisions . . .\n\n  Testimony before Congress.\n  The 1998 country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Vietnam. Released \nFebruary 26, 1999, by the U.S. State Department:\n\n       The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a one-party state rule \n     and controlled by the Vietnamese Communist Party. The \n     Government's human rights record remains poor.\n\n  Poor, yet it is supposed to be good--it is not excellent --to have a \nwaiver.\n\n       There were credible reports that security officials beat \n     detainees. Prison conditions remain harsh. The Government \n     arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens. . . .\n\n  I say to my colleagues, give me the opportunity to get into the \ndetails on this before we vote. All I am asking is to discharge this so \nI can get on the floor and get into the details of these kinds of \nabuses.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes, 25 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. In the same report:\n\n       Citizens' access to exit permits frequently was constrained \n     by factors outside the law such as bribery and corruption. \n     Refugee and immigrant visa applicants to the Orderly \n     Departure Program sometimes encountered local officials who \n     arbitrarily delayed or denied exit permits. . .There are some \n     concerns that some members of the minority ethnic groups, \n     particularly nonethnic Vietnamese, such as the Montagnards, \n     may not have ready access to these programs. The Government \n     denied exit permits for emigration to certain Montagnard \n     applicants.\n\n  And on and on:\n\n       Vietnam's Politburo has issued its first-ever directive on \n     religion, in an apparent bid to tighten Communist Party \n     control over the clergy and over the places of worship. \n     Although no religions are mentioned by name, the directive, \n     published in the official Nhan Dan daily, targets the \n     unofficial Buddhist Church and the Catholic Church.\n\n  Unofficial. Interesting.\n\n       Banned practices include organizing meetings, printing and \n     circulating bibles, constructing and renovating places of \n     worship. . .The Communist Party strictly controls all \n     religious matters in Vietnam and many members of the Buddhist \n     Church and the Catholic Church are presently in detention or \n     under house arrest.\n\n  French Press Agency of Hanoi, July 8, 1998.\n  I say to my colleagues, we need to expose this. Why would you deny me \nthe opportunity to bring this matter to the floor? I urge you, please \ngive me the opportunity to get into these matters in the time allocated \nunder the rules. Yes, it is 20 hours equally divided, 10 hours each. \nWill I use 10 hours? Absolutely not; a couple hours probably would do \nit.\n  If my colleagues are not familiar with these issues, it will open \ntheir eyes. I have very specific details about what is happening to \nthese people. If Senators oppose me and they do not believe it, then \ncome down here and present the alternative information for my \ncolleagues and let our colleagues make the choice. But give me the \nopportunity by supporting me on this discharge. Do not let it stay \nbottled up.\n  That is the rule, and I respect the rule. The rule is, it stays \nthere. If the Finance Committee does not discharge it, it goes away. I \nknow that. That is why I am trying to discharge it. It goes away in the \nsense that the Jackson-Vanik waiver is granted because the burden is on \nus to prove otherwise. I want that opportunity, but I cannot get it if \nyou leave it buried in the Finance Committee and do not discharge it. \nThat is not a full debate.\n  Help me look at the issue. The bill needs to be put on the Senate \ncalendar so we can have debate. I repeat, if my colleagues missed it, I \nam not trying to take the Senate's time. If there is something else the \nleaders want out here, that is fine. I will work out something with the \nleaders where we can do 20 hours equally divided at any time the leader \nthinks it is appropriate.\n  Also, when we delegate waiver powers to the President--let me go back \nto the Constitution of the United States, article I, section 8--we lose \nour constitutional prerogative. We have the right to debate this. Do \nnot give up our constitutional prerogative to debate it. Do not be \nafraid to come out on the floor and challenge me on what I have to \noffer. I welcome it. I look forward to it.\n  I hope no one will come down here and say: Let's have the House kill \nthis first so we do not have to be accountable to the voters. That is \nbasically the pitch being made by my friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee: Let's have the House kill the bill first, and then \nthere will not be any need for us to debate it at all.\n  Vote for the discharge motion. Let's get on with the debate, under \nthe time agreement we will be bound by, and then the Senate can make an \ninformed\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\njudgment and go on record in favor or in opposition as to whether \nPresident Clinton's waiver of freedom of emigration requirements, in \nthe context of our trading with Vietnam, is appropriate or not. That is \nall I am asking.\n  I pray this body will not put the concerns about business profits or \nmost favored nation over principle. Support the discharge motion. Give \nme the opportunity to make these cases.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nJohn Sommer of The American Legion written to Congressman Philip Crane, \nthe chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways and Means, \nin support of discharge.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Phillip M. Crane,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Trade, Committee on Ways and Means, \n         House of Representatives, Longworth HOB, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It is unacceptable to The American \n     Legion for the United States to put business concerns over \n     the fate of Vietnamese citizens who fought alongside us \n     during the Vietnam war, and who have sacrificed so much for \n     so long and are still unable to freely emigrate to this \n     country.\n       The American Legion recognizes that the U.S. business \n     community is concerned with maintaining and strengthening \n     economic ties in Vietnam, but we cannot let these commercial \n     interests take precedence over the destiny of our former \n     allies who assisted us and are still loyal to our cause. The \n     retention of the Jackson-Vanik waiver can be a powerful sign \n     to show that we honor our commitments to human rights.\n       Obstacles continue to exist on the road to free emigration \n     for Vietnamese who want to come to the United States and \n     other countries in the free world. Ethnic groups that were \n     allied with the Americans during the war, namely the \n     Montagnards, and former employees of the U.S. government are \n     still discriminated against by the Vietnamese government when \n     applying and processing through the Resettlement \n     Opportunities for Vietnam Returnees program (ROVR), the \n     Orderly Departure Program (ODP), and others.\n       What better way to show that we truly are committed to \n     allowing those Vietnamese who have remained faithful to the \n     United States to emigrate than by denying U.S. exporters to \n     Vietnam access to U.S. Government credits. This would be a \n     powerful signal that we demand increased progress and \n     cooperation on the part of the Vietnamese government.\n       The American Legion strongly urges you and sub-committee \n     members to not grant the Jackson-Vanik waiver for this year.\n                                               John F. Sommer Jr.,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Montana for yielding me time.\n  Mr. President, just a few facts. We process 96 percent of the ROVR \napplications. Last year we processed only 78 percent. The Jackson-Vanik \nwaiver is working. Almost 16,000 applicants have been granted admission \nto the United States. Today there are only 79 outstanding ROVR cases. \nLast year there were 1,353 outstanding cases.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this motion to discharge from the Senate \nFinance Committee. It disapproves the extension of the Jackson-Vanik \nwaiver for Vietnam. I do so because I believe the House should properly \nact first on a measure of this nature, because the committee should be \nafforded the opportunity to render judgment on Senator Smith's \nresolution before it is taken up by the full Senate, and because \nVietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver, like China's normal trade relation \nstatus, is too important to fall victim to the political currents \nbuffeting the Senate at this time.\n  As we all know, procedurally, the Senate has traditionally reserved \nconsideration of Jackson-Vanik waivers and the granting of normal trade \nrelation status until after the House has acted. As my colleagues know, \nthe House Ways and Means Committee has unfavorably reported the House \nresolutions of disapproval for both Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver and \nChina's normal trade relation status. These measures are scheduled for \nfloor action in the House. The Senate should not rush to judgment on \neither of these measures until the House has voted on them. Indeed, the \nSenate has over 40 remaining days under the statutory deadline for \naction on the waiver.\n  Substantively, the Jackson-Vanik amendment exists to promote freedom \nof emigration from non-democratic countries. The law calls for a waiver \nif it would enhance opportunities to emigrate freely. Opportunities for \nemigration from Vietnam have clearly increased since the President \nfirst waived the Jackson-Vanik amendment in 1998. The waiver has \nencouraged measurable Vietnamese cooperation in processing applications \nfor emigration under the Orderly Departure Program and the Resettlement \nOpportunity for Vietnamese Returnees agreement, ROVR.\n  The Jackson-Vanik waiver has also allowed the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Department of \nAgriculture to support American businesses in Vietnam. Withdrawing \nOPIC, EXIM, and USDA guarantees would hurt U.S. businesses and slow \nprogress on economic normalization. It would reinforce the position of \nhard-liners in Hanoi who believe Vietnam's opening to the West has \nproceeded too rapidly.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that I harbor no illusions about the \nhuman rights situation in Vietnam. There is clearly room for \nimprovement. The question is how best to advance both the cause of \nhuman rights and U.S. economic and security interests. The answer lies \nin the continued expansion of U.S. relations with Vietnam.\n  Although the Jackson-Vanik waiver does not relate to our POW/MIA \naccounting efforts, Vietnam-related legislation often serves as a \nreferendum on broader U.S.-Vietnam relations, in which accounting for \nour missing personnel is the United States' first priority. Thirty-\nthree Joint Field Activities conducted by the Department of Defense \nover the past 6 years, and the consequent repatriation of 266 sets of \nremains of American military personnel during that period, attest to \nthe ongoing cooperation between Vietnamese and American officials in \nour efforts to account for our missing servicemen. I am confident that \nsuch progress will continue.\n  It really does not serve much of a purpose for us to have divided \nopinion on the degree of Vietnam cooperation. We should rely on the \nopinion of the U.S. military who are there on the ground in Vietnam \ndoing the job. Invariably, they will attest to the cooperation, despite \nperhaps the hopes of others. They will attest that the fact is the \nVietnamese are providing full cooperation as far as resolution of the \nVietnamese POW/MIA issues. Again, do not take my word for it; take the \nword of the American military who are on the ground doing the job.\n  Just as the naysayers who insisted that Vietnamese cooperation on \nPOW/MIA issues would cease altogether when we normalized relations with \nVietnam were proven wrong, so have those who insisted that Vietnam \nwould cease cooperation on emigration issues once we waived Jackson-\nVanik been proven wrong by the course of events since the original \nwaiver was issued in March 1998.\n  The Jackson-Vanik amendment was designed to link U.S. trade to the \nemigration policies of communist countries, primarily the Soviet Union. \nThe end of the Cold War fundamentally restructured global economic and \nsecurity arrangements. As the recent expansion of NATO demonstrated, \nold enemies have become new friends. Moreover, meaningful economic and \npolitical reform can only occur in Vietnam if the United States remains \nengaged there.\n  Last year, I initiated a Dear Colleague letter to Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, signed by every Vietnam veteran in the \nSenate, except Senator Smith, who has opposed every step in the gradual \nprocess of normalizing--I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Dear Colleague letter to Members of \nthe House of Representatives was signed by every Vietnam veteran in the \nSenate except Senator Smith, who has opposed every step in the gradual \nprocess of normalizing our relations with Vietnam over the years.\n  There are those in Congress, including Senator Smith, who remain \nopposed to the extension of Vietnam's Jackson-Vanik waiver. But they do \nnot include any other U.S. Senator who\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\nserved in Vietnam and who, as a consequence, might be understandably \nskeptical of closer U.S.-Vietnam relations.\n  That body of opinion reminds us that, whatever one may think of the \ncharacter of the Vietnamese regime, such considerations should not \nobscure our clear humanitarian interest in promoting freedom of \nemigration from Vietnam. The Jackson-Vanik waiver serves that interest. \nConsequently, I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Smith's \nextraordinary motion to discharge consideration of his resolution from \nthe Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion \nmade by the Senator from New Hampshire to discharge S.J. Res. 27, which \nwould disapprove of the President's recommendation of normal trade \nrelations with China, from further consideration by the Committee on \nFinance.\n  My opposition to this motion is based both on procedural grounds as \nwell as my opposition to the policy goals advocated by the proponents \nof this motion.\n  Aside from these procedural questions raised by this motion --whether \nthe Senate should act in advance of the House and whether the committee \nshould be discharged of this resolution before it has the opportunity \nto give it full consideration--which have been eloquently addressed by \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, there is also \na real factual question raised by this motion which must also be \naddressed.\n  The factual question is this: Is it in the U.S. interest to continue \nto extend normal trade relations to China?\n  In my view it is.\n  The United States extends NTR to all but a handful of rouge states: \nNorth Korea, Afghanistan, Cuba, Laos, and the Former Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Even Iraq and Iran--two countries \nwhich the United States is trying to isolate--currently have NTR. \nPlacing China on a short list or rouge nations to whom we deny NTR \nwould be an irreversible step in the wrong direction and a severe blow \nto the national interest of the United States.\n  Let us remember, we do not extend NTR to China as a favor to China, \nbut because maintenance of NTR with China is in our national interest.\n  It is in our national interest as a matter of simple economics. The \nUnited States benefits from, and should continue to foster, free and \nfair trade with China.\n  In 1991, United States-China bilateral trade totaled $25 billion. \nLast year it was close to $85 billion. In 1991 China was our eighth \nlargest trading partner. Today it is our fourth, and still moving up \nfast.U.S. trade with China supports hundreds of thousands of American \njobs. Revoking China's NTR status would be shooting ourselves in the \nfoot.\n  Indeed, for my state, California, the growth of trade relations with \nChina over the past decade has been just as dramatic. In 1998, exports \nto China and Hong Kong together were California's fourth largest export \ndestination. In 1998, while California's total exports declined 4.17%, \ndue to the Asian financial crisis, our exports to China (not including \nHong Kong) increased 9.28%.\n  Critics of United States-China trade relations may argue that \neven though U.S. exports to China have more than doubled in the past \ndecade, Chinese exports to the U.S. have gone up even faster, resulting \nin a sizable trade deficit. I would reply that this underscores the \nimportance of normalizing and improving our trade with China through \ncontinued NTR: U.S. companies must get continued and better access to \nemerging Chinese markets.\n\n  Extension of NTR is in our national interest because the United \nStates will benefit by the further integration of China into the world \ntrading system. The stakes are huge. Extension of NTR is a necessary \nprecursor for Chinese accession to the WTO, which presents us an \nhistoric opportunity to integrate China--soon to be the world's largest \neconomy--into the international trading system.\n  Extension of NTR is in our national interest because having China in \nthe world trading system levels the playing field. The WTO's system of \nreporting, compliance, and dispute resolution would require China to \nplay by same rules all WTO members follow.\n  Extension of China's NTR status is in our national interest because \nhistory has shown us that, despite the turmoil of the past few months, \nU.S. trade and engagement with China has encouraged economic, \npolitical, and social change in China. These changes have improved the \nliving standards for millions of Chinese and reduced cold-war tensions. \nThose who are serious about seeing China continue to change will \nunderstand and realize that extension of NTR is the best course of \naction for the U.S. to follow.\n  There is no question that China's political system remains \nundemocratic. But we should not fail to acknowledge the progress that \nhas been made over the past two decades, thanks in part to the leverage \nprovided by U.S. trade. To acknowledge this change is not to minimize \nthe real problems that do exist; it is only to recognize that changes \nare taking place, and that many of these changes are a direct result of \ngreater engagement with the West.\n  To seek to deny China NTR status is tantamount to seeking to slam \nshut the Chinese people's door to a free world, and consigning them to \nisolation and repression. That is certainly not in our national \ninterest, and it is not in the interest of the Chinese people, either.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleague to oppose this motion.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am voting in support of Senate \nJoint Resolution 27 which would disapprove normal trade relations \ntreatment to products produced in the People's Republic of China. I do \nso not because I do not want to see normal trade relations with China. \nRather, it is because I do not believe the Chinese Government deserves \nthis treatment until it ceases its brutal repression of Tibetans and \nothers who support democracy.\n  But there is a more specific concern I have about the fate of one \nindividual, which has caused me to support this Resolution.\n  For over 3 years people from around the world and all walks of life \nhave sought the release of and information about Mr. Ngawang Choephel, \na Tibetan who studied ethnomusicology at Middlebury College in Vermont \non a Fulbright Scholarship. On December 26, 1996, after detaining him \nincommunicado for months, Chinese authorities sentenced Mr. Choephel to \n18 years in prison for espionage. His crime? Making a documentary film \nabout Tibetan music and dance.\n  Since his arrest, Mr. Choephel's mother, Ms. Sonam Dekyi, has been \nactively seeking his release, as well as permission from the Chinese \nGovernment to travel to Tibet to visit her son. Although Ms. Dekyi has \ntried repeatedly to obtain a visa from the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi \nand written to the Chinese Prison Administration's Direct General about \nher request, Chinese authorities falsely deny knowledge of her request.\n  United States officials have raised Mr. Choephel with the Chinese \nGovernment at the highest levels. I have twice discussed my concerns \nwith Chinese President Jiang Zemin, once in Beijing and again in \nWashington. I asked him to personally review Mr. Choephel's case. I and \nother Members of Congress have written many letters to Chinese \nofficials on Mr. Choephel's and his mother's behalf. I have tried to \ndiscuss his case with Chinese authorities here in Washington, DC, as \nhas my staff. What has been the response? Deliberate and utter \ndisregard of my inquiries.\n  Mr. President, until the Chinese Government provides satisfactory \nanswers to my questions about Mr. Choephel's whereabouts, his health, \nthe reasons for his incarceration and the evidence against him, and \npermits his mother to visit him as she is entitled to, I cannot in good \nconscience vote for normal trade relations with China.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time is remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute 29 seconds remaining for the \nother side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply appreciate the concerns of the Senator from New \nHampshire. I think we all do. This is not an easy issue. But I think it \nis important to ask ourselves what is the best way, what is the most \nlikely way, we Americans will properly help achieve the objectives we \nare looking for in Vietnam, and I daresay also with\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nChina, because the China discharge resolution will be up before us at a \nlater time today.\n  I oppose both of the motions to discharge. I daresay most of my \ncolleagues will also oppose both of those motions. It is my judgment, \nand I think the judgment of most of us, that there are some differences \nbetween the United States and Vietnam and there are some differences \nbetween the United States and China. We know there are. But how do we \nbest accomplish our objectives with these two countries?\n  I believe it is best to continue with the Jackson/Vanik waiver with \nVietnam and what is called a ``normal trading relationship'' with \nChina, which, essentially, is really less than average because the \nUnited States has trade agreements with many other countries which, in \neffect, provide for much better than average trading relations.\n  So we are really talking about the bare minimum standard for trading \nrelationships. If we continue that standard for trade, that is, MFN or \nNTR, we will be more likely--working through other channels, and \ngovernment to government or group to group--to accomplish the goals for \nwhich we are looking.\n  The world is changing. It is changing dramatically. Trade and \ncommerce are so key, so vital. The more trade is encouraged among \ncountries--particularly Vietnam and China--clearly, the more help we \nprovide those countries in the form of government and judicial systems \nand enforcement systems that can be relied upon with predictability \nworldwide, not only for America but for other countries.\n  That is really the objective. There are certainly problems with \nVietnam and with China. But we should deal with those issues on the \nlevels in which they occur, whether it is China with human rights or \nnuclear proliferation or missile technology transfer or Taiwan or the \naccidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. We should deal \nwith those issues one at a time; that is, not deny minimal trade \nrelationships with a country just because we have other considerations \nand other problems.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire says he does not have the time to \npresent his case. The Senator from New Hampshire has lots of time to \npresent his evidence in many different ways before the Senate. If he \nhas a strong case, a compelling case, that would encourage the Senate \nto take another position, I encourage the Senator to give it. There is \nmorning business. There are lots of opportunities for the Senator to \nprovide the information he says he has.\n  I am not really sure he has much more than he already provided. I \nnote that other Senators, on both sides of the aisle, Senators who have \nserved in Vietnam--including Senator McCain from Arizona and Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts--as the Senate has heard, very strongly oppose \nthis discharge motion. They believe that non-trade issues are more \nlikely to be dealt with successfully along the path that has been taken \nalready in the past.\n  Countries have interests. Vietnam has an interest in world affairs; \nChina does; the United States does. We have to deal with this in a \nsolid way. The phrase that is often used is ``engagement.'' I think \nengagement makes sense, but more importantly it should be ``engagement \nwithout illusions''; that is, we talk with countries, we negotiate with \ncountries, we have to keep communicating with countries and looking for \nways to find solutions. Engaging without illusions--without illusions \nthat everything in that country is going along perfectly well. We have \nto be very realistic about things.\n\n  It is also important to remember at this time in the history of the \nworld that with the United States so big and so powerful, it is \nbeginning to cause some resentment worldwide. That is a new challenge \nfacing America, how to deal with it, how to deal with that angst, how \nto deal with that concern that maybe we are too big, we are too \ninclusive, the English language pervades too much, the Internet uses \nthe English language; American culture, McDonald's, and movies are too \npervasive in countries; American military might is just too \noverwhelming, even by European standards; the concern that we might, \nsince we did not lose a single life in Kosovo and won, that militarily \nwe might deal with other areas in the same way.\n  There are lots of different concerns people have now, watching what \nAmerica has done in the last several years. So we have to be careful. \nWe have to be prudent. To deny something that is normal and expected, \nthat is, a normal trade relation with China, would be unsettling and \nwould cause many more problems than it is going to solve.\n  I fully understand the points of the Senator from New Hampshire, but \noften there are different ways to skin a cat. The cat we are trying to \nskin is the effective way, not the ineffective way. It is my judgment \nthat the effective way is to continue the dialogue, continue the \nengagement, and continue the engagement without illusions but continue \nit nevertheless. I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote against the \nmotion to discharge the petition.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is my understanding I have 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from \nMontana, I know he understands, but he doesn't understand enough to let \nme have the opportunity to debate it. Under the rule of Jackson-Vanik, \nI have the right to have the 20 hours equally divided on the Senate \nfloor. That is the time to do it so that it is not misdirected in \nmorning business somewhere.\n  In response to Senator McCain, yes, there are six out of seven \nVietnam veterans in the Senate who support not debating this, who say \nthe Jackson-Vanik waiver should be granted, but there are 3 million or \nso in the American Legion, at least represented by a letter from the \nAmerican Legion, who think otherwise. I am not sure what the point is \non that one.\n  We have to feel very confident the waiver has reduced bribery and \ncorruption. Here is the law. It says to assure continued dedication to \nfundamental human rights, if these things happen, you should not grant \nthe waiver. No. 1, does Vietnam deny its citizens the right to \nemigrate? Yes. I can prove it, but nobody wants to hear it. No. 2, does \nit impose more than a nominal tax on emigration and the other visas? \nYes, and I have a stack of names of people, Vietnamese nationals, who \nhave said yes.\n  The bottom line is, if the Senate won't give me the chance to debate \nit, then as far as I am concerned my colleagues do not want to hear the \nfacts. I can't give them, as I said before, in 30 minutes.\n  I urge support of my resolution so that we have the opportunity to \ndebate this on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am delighted to engage in a colloquy now \nthat will involve a number of other Senators but particularly Senator \nLandrieu of Louisiana. I hesitate to even begin until she is present on \nthe floor, but I presume she will be here momentarily.\n  In her absence, I will praise her for her work on this particular \nlegislation, S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. Her \npersistence, her willingness to work with all parties involved--I don't \nmean political parties; I mean those who are interested in this\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\ntype legislation--has made it possible for us to have this bill put \ntogether and have it before the Energy Committee and have not only the \ncosponsorship of her colleague from Louisiana but also of the chairman \nof the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski. It \nhas a broad spectrum of support, and I think a lot of the credit goes \nto the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  I must say, it is a delicately balanced piece of legislation. If \namendments start being added or changes start developing, then it could \nget out of control. And even though I am a cosponsor, I would have \nproblems with that, even though clearly every piece of legislation can \nbe improved as it goes forward.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues S. 25. The American public \nhas an exciting opportunity for this Congress to enact landmark \nlegislation that will make a long-term commitment to natural \nconservation initiatives. We have the opportunity to begin the next \ncentury with the same major commitment to conservation that the Nation \nhad at the beginning of the century under the visionary leadership of \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt. I believe this legislation will serve our \nNation well for generations to come. I intend to be involved in its \nprocess through the committee and, hopefully, we will be able to bring \nit up for consideration in the full Senate before the year is out.\n  This legislation would dedicate a portion of the annual reserves \nreceived from the production of Federal oil and gas revenues on the \nOuter Continental Shelf to a variety of initiatives that will conserve \nand enhance our Nation's sustaining and renewable resources. I am \npleased to be a sponsor, joining a broad spectrum of my colleagues. The \nlegislation, which is modeled after the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, \nwill reinvest 50 percent of the revenues from the Federal OCS oil and \ngas production annually in coastal impact assistance and coastal \nconservation, in funding national, State, and local parks and \nrecreation opportunities, and in conserving our Nation's wildlife \nresources before those wildlife fall into threatened or endangered \nstatus under the Endangered Species Act.\n  It does have the support of various groups. I have felt for years \nthat those of us who live along the coasts and who take whatever risks \nare associated with offshore oil and gas exploration should get some \nbenefit from that activity and from the risks associated and that we \nshould have the funds that are necessary to deal with such things as \nbeach erosion, to preserve some of our delicate estuaries along the \ncoastal areas. We have not been getting our fair share.\n  So for the first time, I think this bill would move us in that \ndirection. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives, H.R. 701, introduced by Congressman Don Young, \nchairman of the House Resources Committee, with the cosponsorship of \nCongressman Dingell and Congressman Tauzin and others. I believe they \nhave some 80 cosponsors.\n  This important legislation will affect not just my State or not just \nthe coastal regions but the whole Nation. We are facing a continuing \nshortage of funds in wildlife conservation initiatives, for State and \nlocal parks and recreation initiatives, for conservation initiatives \nwith respect to the peculiar problems that confront our coastal \nregions, but also there are great concerns in the West and the areas \nthat are a long way from the coast.\n  Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, one-half of the revenue from \nFederal mineral resources that are developed in a State are shared with \nthat State by the Federal Government. Unfortunately, a similar \nprovision does not exist with regard to Federal oil and gas resources \nthat are produced off the coast of a State, even though the adjacent \ncoastal area could suffer impacts from that activity. Not until 1986 \ndid the Federal Government share any of the Federal OCS oil and gas \nrevenues with the coastal States, and then only a small portion of that \nrevenue from those offshore activities occurring in the first 3 miles \nof the OCS. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999 will correct \nthis inequity while also reinvesting a portion of the funds in \nconservation initiatives in all 50 States.\n  The concept of reinvesting a portion of the revenue from the Nation's \nnonrenewable resources in renewable resources of the Nation has \nattracted the support of Governors, mayors, county governments, \nconservation groups, sports groups, and others around the Nation. The \ncongressional hearings have created a record of great and broad \nsupport.\n  Some of the highlights of that testimony include Mr. Hurley Coleman, \ndirector of Wayne County, MI, Division of Parks. He testified:\n\n       You have the chance right now to take the place of the \n     visionaries of the past and support a process that will \n     provide for development, renovation and enhancement of \n     critical recreation resources in important living spaces \n     throughout the country.\n\n  He went on to say this was a moment of destiny. Obviously, he was \nvery supportive of the bill.\n  Mr. Mark Van Putten, President and CEO of the National Wildlife \nFederation, testified that it presented an ``historic opportunity to \nenact permanent and meaningful conservation funding that would benefit \nwildlife, wild places, and generations of Americans to come.''\n  We had support from the commissioner of Santa Fe County in New Mexico \non behalf of the National Association of Counties who endorsed the \nprinciples of this act that would reallocate Outer Continental Shelf \noil and gas revenues to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a coastal \nState revenue sharing program, and add funding to the Urban Park and \nRecreation Recovery Program and establish an innovative procedure for \nadding funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program.\n  That is a very important thing. In my State, and a lot of States \nwhere the Federal Government owns a large amount of land--in my State, \ntimberlands--and because, in my opinion, of bad national forest \npolicies, those funds have been reduced. We are not cutting the trees \nthat need to be cut. We had a disaster last year; a hurricane went \nthrough that affected two or three States. And because of resistance \nfrom certain environmental groups, the downed timber could not be \nremoved. Now it is basically useless. Who benefits from that? Nobody. \nThe timber that was downed wasn't used for the benefit of the lumber-\ntimber industry. And by allowing it to just lay there on the ground and \ndie raises the prospect of insects that would then infest other trees. \nIt makes no sense whatsoever. So the idea that we would get some more \nmoney for the payments in lieu of taxes is very attractive to me.\n  Governor Tom Carper of Delaware, on behalf of the National Governors' \nAssociation, testified in support of this legislation. Governor \nChristine Todd-Whitman of New Jersey also supported it. Mayor Victor \nAshe, the mayor of Knoxville, came and testified about how helpful this \nlegislation could be.\n  I know there are some concerns about how this money will be used. \nThere has been some concerns expressed by the Farm Bureau and by the \nLoggers Association. These are two groups that are very important in \nthis country and in my State in particular. I listened to them.\n  If they have concerns about how these funds would be used in \nconnection with land use, I would want to hear them out and make sure \nthere is not a problem technically with the bill or make sure this bill \ndoes not further discourage and dissipate our resources from farming \nand from timber in this country. I also don't want this to become an \nopportunity for public land use groups to try to grab more land.\n  While there are some public lands we want to have access to, we want \nto preserve, that is fine. But I think this administration, in \nparticular, has been exceeding what the law allows and is still trying \nto tie up more Federal lands when, in fact, we are providing proper \nstewardship of the lands we already have. One example is the Park \nService. Many of our national parks are deteriorating. Bridges are not \npassable, monuments eroding. Yet the Park Service seems to be more \ninterested in adding more land to the parks before we take care of what \nwe already have.\n  This bill may help deal with that problem because it would make these \nfunds more equitably available to go for not only coastal preservation \nbut also could go to the national and State parks.\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\n  I think we have a good idea here. It is one of those conservation \nbills that I think could be of benefit to everybody in this country, \nall States, and particularly my own State of Mississippi. I don't \ngenerally go on bills of this nature because I am very leery that these \nconservation efforts sometimes become--let's see, what is the word I am \nlooking for--``confiscation'' efforts rather than conservation. I don't \nbelieve that is what this bill does. This could lead us to some real \ngood policies that could bring together divergent groups in a way that \nwe have not had the opportunity in the past.\n  I am pleased to be here and point out to my colleagues this \nlegislation, S. 25. I encourage them to take a look at it. I thank the \nchairman of the committee for his good work, and I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Murkowski as we move forward on this very \nimportant Conservation and Reinvestment Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader and the Senator from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask if the Senator will yield me 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in \ncongratulating the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Louisiana \nfor putting forward this excellent proposal on land and water \nconservation. This is long overdue. I think it is an extraordinarily \npositive step.\n  The chairman of the key committee, Chairman Murkowski, has decided to \nput forward this proposal, to support it, and to have the support of \nthe majority leader.\n  Those are two pretty powerful figures in this Senate pushing forward \non this extremely positive conservation initiative. From the view of \nthe State of New Hampshire, the stateside land and water conservation \nfund is something in which we are very interested. There are places in \nthis country today where I think their representative Senators maybe \nthink that the Federal Government owns enough land. Maybe the Member in \nthe Chair is from one of those places, being from Wyoming. But those of \nus on the eastern seaboard still see critical pieces of land we would \nlike to have protected. We have a huge population, a megalopolis, \nrunning from Washington to Boston, that is always moving north.\n  In New Hampshire, there are critical elements of natural resources \nthat need to be protected as we go through these massive expansions and \nthese growth spurts, which are inevitable. The land and water \nconservation fund, over the years, has always been a positive force for \nprotection and for allowing communities to do things they think are \ncritical to making those communities better places to live--whether it \nhappens to be building a park or a recreational area. Therefore, to \nrefund or replenish the land and water conservation fund using the \nOuter Continental Shelf is absolutely appropriate and is absolutely \ncritical if States such as New Hampshire, which are, unfortunately, in \na wave of population growth, are going to be able to maintain their \ncharacteristics of being a rural environment and a pleasant place in \nwhich to raise a family.\n  I support Senator Murkowski's bill, and I certainly appreciate the \nSenator from Mississippi, the majority leader, also being in support of \nthis legislation. That bodes well for it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to the \nchairman of the committee. I see Senator Landrieu here, and I know she \nwill want to speak.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I don't want to \ninterrupt the flow on this bill, but I wanted 5 minutes to talk about \nthe 30th anniversary of the landing on the Moon. I wonder if I could \nhave 5 minutes at the end of the colloquy.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of my friend and colleague, \nSenator Landrieu, let me briefly comment on the status of the OCS \nrevenuesharing legislation that we introduced some time ago. This is a \nsignificant addition to a much-needed reform and, as a consequence, it \nhas been termed as the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999.\n  The bill itself reinvests OCS revenues. When I say ``reinvests,'' I \nam specifically noting the reality associated from where this revenue \ncomes. It comes from OCS activities of some States. It could include \nother States if indeed they wanted to have OCS activity exploration and \nproduction off of their individual shores. Some of the States have \nchosen not to. I appreciate and recognize their reluctance. But let's \nbe realistic and recognize that in order to have a successful \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, we have to have a continuation of \nOCS revenues occurring off the shores of some of our States--Louisiana, \nMississippi, and other States.\n  My State of Alaska has a very small OCS activity; most of our \nactivities are on land. But it is interesting to note the breadth of \nsupport for this legislation, which is related, to some extent, to \nthose States that see an opportunity to generate a source of revenue. \nThat is fine. That is the way Senator Landrieu and I constructed the \nlegislation. Make no mistake about it, in order for it to be \nsuccessful, we have to have, and encourage, OCS revenuesharing, as we \nhave off the coast of Texas, and other States that I could mention.\n  This is a coastal impact assistance and State coastal program funding \nmechanism for the land and water conservation fund, including \nfulfilling a long-delayed promise of support for State, local, and \nurban park and recreation facilities, as well as State wildlife \nprograms.\n\n  We have tried to cover a broad area of need, and I commend the \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, for her extraordinary ability \nto encompass, if you will, the various broad interest groups.\n  S. 25 gives States and local governments--and this is important--not \nthe Federal Government, the responsibility for determining the \nconservation needs of their citizens and provides funding to help meet \nthose needs.\n  Now, that is where we have a difference with the administration. The \nadministration proposes that it is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to make these decisions, and we say no. There are some \nother bills floating around that also propose to give the Federal \nGovernment the authority. We think responsible citizens know what their \nneeds are, and these funds should be provided so they can make the \ndecisions to help meet those needs, not a one-size-fits-all Federal \nGovernment.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the significance that the \nlocal people at the local level know what their needs are. A number of \nbills spending OCS revenues, and the administration's bill, which has \nbeen put forth, identifies the Lands Legacy Initiative. The Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which I chair and Senator Landrieu is a \nmember of, has had a series of hearings on all these proposals. We have \nlearned about the need for coastal impact assistance. We are aware of \nthe unavoidable social and environmental impacts on States that host \nOCS development. The State of Louisiana, for example, and the State of \nTexas, host, if you will, the impact because the activity is off their \nshores. It is an unavoidable social environmental impact, so they \nshould receive additional consideration.\n  Coastal impact assistance helps mitigate these burdens, even in \nStates that prohibit oil and gas activity off their coast, such as the \nState of Florida, where there is a unique coastal and marine need \nassociated with their set of priorities. We appreciate that and \nunderstand that.\n  We have also learned about the widespread support in this country for \nState park, recreation and wildlife programs from the hearings. We have \nheard from the mayors, Governors, easterners, residents of the Great \nPlains, soccer coaches, hunters, environmentalists, and farmers. As \nevidenced by the witnesses we have heard in the hearings and the \nhundreds of letters the committee has received, we understand that \nAmericans want meaningful conservation legislation. That is what we \nhave attempted to do. But don't forget from where it comes. It comes \nfrom OCS oil and gas activity. We have to have a continuation of \nsupport for those States that foster and\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\nrecognize the contribution of OCS activities. But those States have to \nbe recognized for the impact, and they have to share in this as well.\n  Now, their concerns have been expressed. We have had bills to provide \nmoney for Federal land acquisition. This may sound great to the Eastern \nStates, where there is no public land. But for those of us out West, it \nis a little difficult to suggest that we are going to fund Federal land \nacquisition when many of us out West think the Federal Government owns \nenough of the land out there. If they want to fund the Eastern States, \nwhy, that is something different. This is a problem that has to be \nrectified.\n  Residents of States with significant Federal land are worried that \nthese bills will lead to a massive Federal land grab. The Federal \nGovernment owns about 70 percent of my State of Alaska. I can \nunderstand the fears. Fortunately, when Texas came into the Union, they \nmade sure the Federal Government didn't own any. If we had it to do \nover again, I can assure you we would do it differently. Nevertheless, \nwhen we talk about the bill providing money for Federal land \nacquisition, the people in my State of Alaska, and in many of the \nWestern States--to suggest that they would become unglued is an \nunderstatement. They fear this legislation will result in a Federal \nland acquisition grab, not where it is needed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Louisiana has 20 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may have \n2 minutes to finish.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, that is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana.\n  At the risk of understating the importance of this bill, what we have \nattempted to do is find a balance, develop a compromise; but each time \nwe accommodate one group's special interest associated with this, there \nis a reaction from another group that perhaps gave us support and is \nconcerned that we have gone too far in any one area.\n  As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, my goal \nand objective in working with Senator Landrieu is to report a bill to \nthe Senate floor. We must have a bipartisan bill. The bill is going to \nhave to remedy the existing inequity in the distribution of OCS \nrevenues. It is going to have to provide funds for State conservation \nprograms. It is going to have to provide guarantees for a role of \nCongress in Federal land acquisition. In other words, Congress is going \nto have to have something to say about Federal land acquisition and \npurchases. Finally, it is going to have to assure westerners that there \nwill be no gain of Federal land in their States--no gain of Federal \nland in the Western States.\n  This isn't going to be easy, but I think, working with Senator \nLandrieu and others, it is going to be worth the effort. Therefore, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on this exciting \nopportunity, this exciting legislation. Previously, all of the OCS \nrevenue has gone into the general fund. Now we have an opportunity to \naddress this with some meaningful legislation that involves the OCS \nimpact assistance, land and water conservation fund amendments, and the \nwildlife conservation fund under a formula that has been agreed upon.\n  I encourage my colleagues, in consideration of this language, to \nallow the local people to make the decision, not a disinterested \nbureaucracy, a Federal Government that dictates one size fits all.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, for her \ngraciousness in allowing me this time and for her efforts to bring this \nbefore the body. I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, the Senator from \nAlaska, for his leadership in steering us to this point. We are just a \nshort time away from having an opportunity to mark up this historic \nbill, if you will, this historic effort in his committee.\n  I want to say that all of our committees have tremendous \nresponsibilities and very significant efforts are underway. But our \ncommittee, Energy and Natural Resources, in addition to this effort, \nhas the chairman negotiating a restructuring of our electricity \nindustry for this Nation and he is trying to maneuver through a waste \ndisposal bill that has been a source of great controversy. I thank him \nfor giving his time and energy and determination in moving through a \nhistoric piece of legislation for the environment. Perhaps if we can \naccomplish this--and I believe we can--future generations will look \nback on this effort.\n  I thank him and our majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, \nwho knows full well, from the perspective of a producing State, the \nsignificant negative impacts that are associated with an industry that \nboth of us support and the opportunity here to do something positive \nfor our States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alaska, as well as other \nStates in the Nation.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time, and at this point yield to \none of my colleagues from South Dakota, who has so graciously joined us \non the floor for this colloquy. As a member of one of the interior \nStates, and as one of the leading spokespersons on this bill, I thank \nSenator Johnson for being with us today. I yield to him 5 minutes to \nspeak on this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her \nleadership on this issue, as well as Chairman Murkowski.\n  I think we have an enormous opportunity this year to at last reach a \nbipartisan agreement to increase significantly the funding for several \ncritically important planned water and wildlife conservation programs. \nSeveral legislative efforts to establish mandatory funding for \nconservation programs utilizing Outer Continental Shelf, OCS, revenue \nare under bipartisan discussion.\n  I have been pleased to participate in hearings on these initiatives \nin the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. All of the \nconservation legislation introduced this year proposed significant \nsteps to support the restoration, preservation and conservation of our \nnatural resources. The hearings in our committee have been extremely \nuseful since, if we are to be successful this year, we have the \ndaunting task ahead of us of drafting a compromise conservation bill \nwhich meets the diverse needs of all fifty states. Consequently, we \nneed to hear as many perspectives and learn as much about the needs in \nthe states as possible before we begin drafting a compromise bill.\n  Preserving our natural resources is an issue to which many of us in \nthis body are committed. Earlier this year I joined 35 of my colleagues \nfrom both sides of the aisle in sending a letter to Budget Committee \nChairman Dominici and Senator Lautenberg requesting full funding for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Further, during consideration of the fiscal year 2000 budget \nresolution, Senator Boxer and I offered an amendment to establish a \nconservation reserve fund. This amendment was unanimously approved by \nthe Budget Committee, passed by the Senate but unfortunately dropped in \nthe conference committee. Nonetheless, the strong support from the \nSenate for this concept signals a commitment to finding a way to fund \nadditional conservation initiatives.\n  Additionally, one third of the Members of this body have cosponsored \none of the conservation proposals which have been introduced. This \nlevel of interest indicates that while we have not come to an agreement \non the details which should be included in a comprehensive conservation \nproposal, significant interest in this issue exists. This widespread \ninterest offers an opportunity to find a bipartisan compromise to \naddress this critically important issue.\n  I applaud Senator Boxer in particular for her efforts in this area, \nand I applaud Senators Landrieu and Murkowski for their work on S. 25.\n  One of the primary reasons I supported the bill earlier this year is \nthe sponsors' inclusion of the non-game wildlife initiative, often \ncalled Teaming With Wildlife (TWW). I am convinced that funding for \nspecified nongame conservation programs must\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\nbe secured if we want to successfully work to keep species off of \nthreatened and endangered species lists while also meeting the \nskyrocketing demand for outdoor recreation and education opportunities.\n  Currently, I am circulating a letter which I will be sending to \nChairman Murkowski and Senator Landrieu which advocates a higher \npercentage of funding for wildlife conservation than currently included \nin S. 25. Specifically, I am advocating increasing the funding \nallocation from 7 to 10. At this time other Senators joining me in \nsending the letter include: Senators Cleland, Frist, Lincoln, Daschle, \nKerrey, Gregg, and Bayh--and more Senators may join in our effort.\n  I commend Chairman Murkowski and Senator Landrieu for their support \nof the TWW concept and look forward to working with them to find an \nadequate level of funding for this important program.\n  There are other issues, of course, for which I have a great deal of \ninterest, including the funding for the PILT program and funding for \nhistoric preservation efforts.\n  However, probably the largest outstanding issue--and the potential \nshow stopper--for all of us who want to find a compromise conservation \nproposal is identifying whether we have room in the budget to increase \nfunding for conservation.\n  The recent mid-session review paints a rosy picture of our current \neconomic situation and I believe that targeted tax relief and paying \ndown the publicly held debt must be our top priorities. However, I also \nbelieve that within the context of a balanced budget, the new economic \nprojections give us room to consider modestly increasing funding for \ndomestic priorities, such as conversation.\n  Again, we have an opportunity this year to find a bipartisan \ncompromise which will ensure adequate funding for conservation, \nrestoration, and preservation efforts across this country. I again \ncommend Chairman Murkowski and Senator Landrieu for their bipartisan \neffort and look forward to working with them in the coming weeks and \nmonth to craft a bill which can pass this body and which will, in fact, \nbe signed by the President of the United States.\n\n  I yield such time as I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from South Dakota for those remarks, and again \nfor his hard work in getting us to this point.\n  I would like to yield, if I can, 4 minutes to my colleague from \nArkansas, for her remarks on this bill as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, and \nChairman Murkowski, for their fabulous leadership on this issue.\n  I rise today in support of greater funding for land and wildlife \nconservation programs as embodied in S. 25, the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act of 1999.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation to ensure \nthat a portion of the revenues from outer continental shelf oil and gas \nproduction are dedicated to land, water, and wildlife conservation \nprograms throughout the U.S. It is well past time that the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund is permanently funded and used as originally \nintended to provide for state and federal land purchases and to help \nstates with conservation and recreation needs. We need consistent, \ndependable funding for federal, state, and local governments to make \ninvestments in land preservation, habitat conservation, and wildlife \nmanagement.\n  I know in my home state of Arkansas, this funding is badly needed for \nprotection of exiting wildlife habitat and conservation programs as \nwell as for funding additional conservation and recreation needs. Since \ninception, the state and federal sides of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund have combined to provide Arkansas with over $84 \nmillion in targeted land purchases for preservation of tracts of \nforested lands, purchases of needed land for state and municipal parks, \nlands for schools, land for baseball fields, bike trails, zoos, and \nrecreation areas. The federal side of the LWCF has provided resources \nfor needed land purchases in the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests, \nWhite River and Cache River National Wildlife Refuges, the Buffalo \nNational River, and for preserving many other tracts of land. The state \nside of the LWCF has provided land for a ballpark in Bentonville, a \nschool park in Jonesboro, a zoo in Little Rock, a swimming pool is \nSearcy, a city park in Batesville, a swamp habitat in Woodruff County, \nand for over 600 other projects across my home state. And there are \nstill many needs for these resources. Funds are needed for in-holdings \npurchases in State and national forest and to assist rural communities \nwith building parks for children and to help urban areas with \npreserving needed green space.\n  S. 25 would also create a permanent source of funding for state-run \nwildlife conservation programs. Title III of the bill will help state \nagencies identify and prevent species from being listed listing under \nthe Endangered Species Act. In Arkansas, about 86 percent of all \nwildlife species are not pursued for sport or consumption, nor listed \nas threatened or endanger. It is these species that title III of S. 25 \nis targeted toward. There is currently no reliable, dedicated funding \nsource for conservation, recreation or education programs for these \nnon-game species. Title III will provide this necessary funding.\n  Two examples are the Swainson's warbler, traditionally found in the \nbottomland hardwoods of my home state, and the barn owl, traditionally \nfound across my state's delta. The Swainson's Warbler can still be \nfound in certain places in the Delta region of Arkansas, but is rapidly \ndeclining throughout its range due primarily to loss of its bottomland \nhardwood habitat. Funding from Title III of S.25 will help head off the \npotential future listing of the Swainson's Warbler as threatened or \nendangered by increasing the amount of suitable habitat through a \ncombination of management actions on public lands and habitat \nincentives for private lands.\n  The barn owl has been a traditional predator feeding almost \nexclusively on rodents that are agricultural pests. This owl has \npersisted in the Arkansas delta despite low population levels for \nyears. The barn owl responds well to artificial nest boxes that could \nbe erected on a large scale with funds provided, under Title III, \nespecially if this effort were combined with an intensive landowner \neducational campaign. Both of these prevention program can be \naccomplished easily under Title III of S. 25 without the disruptions \nand restrictions that would occur with a listing under the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on about the good things that land \nand wildlife conservation programs have done in the past and can \ncontinue to do into the future for all of Arkansas--the projects are \ntoo numerous to list--but I want to make clear that the programs in \ntitle II and title III of S. 25 are necessary sources of funding for \nstates and localities to complete needed, targeted land purchases for \nconservation and to prevent to continual decline of wildlife throughout \nmy home state and this Nation.\n  These are great examples of what this bill can do for States such as \nArkansas and many others. I join my colleagues in support of what \nSenator Landrieu and Chairman Murkowski are doing, and I look forward \nto seeing the bill on the floor where we can certainly see it pass in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for \ndescribing with such enthusiasm what this bill brings to her State of \nArkansas and to all of our States.\n  Let me take the remainder of my time to recap for a moment and to \nspeak from the Louisiana perspective as one of the producing States and \nshare with this Congress and with the Senate some of our perspectives.\n  First of all, as the majority leader said, this bill is a historic \neffort to provide a permanent and steady stream of revenue to do \nseveral important things: To fully fund the Land and Water Conservation \nFund; to provide a reliable stream of money for wildlife wetlands \nhabitat preservation; and to provide much-needed revenue for the \ncoastal impact assistance.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  We are also hoping to include some funding for historic preservation \nand urban park initiatives.\n  From the Louisiana perspective, you may not realize that over 80 \npercent of the Federal oil and gas that is produced annually from the \nOuter Continental Shelf is produced from waters adjacent to the State \nof Louisiana.\n  The onshore activities that support the Federal OCS development in \nthe Gulf of Mexico occur largely within the boundaries of our State. \nMississippi contributes to that, as well as Texas.\n  Almost all of the oil and gas produced from the gulf moves through \nthe State of Louisiana in pipelines thousands and thousands of miles in \nlength--delivering oil to refineries and to natural gas distribution \nsystems throughout our Nation.\n  We are happy to do our part to help this Nation in its need for \nenergy supply. However, we can no longer abide by the Federal \nGovernment's unwillingness to share even a portion of these revenues \nwith our State to help offset the adverse environmental impact and the \npublic service impact on Louisiana.\n  That view is shared by Mississippi, Alaska, Texas, and others. Let me \nexplain.\n  The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 provides that 50 percent of the \nrevenues received by the Federal Government for the development of oil \nand gas and other minerals on shore will be shared with States in which \nthose minerals are produced. Some of our interior States benefit from \nthat arrangement.\n  In addition, because the Federal minerals are within the geographic \nboundaries of particular States, the State has the power over and above \nthat sharing of 50 percent to collect a severance tax on the production \nand payment in lieu of taxes from the Federal Government for the acres \nof Federal land used for this endeavor.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which governs the production \nof Federal oil and gas minerals on the Outer Continental Shelf, \nhowever, contains no similar provision. In fact, from 1940, when this \nproduction began, until 1986, the State of Louisiana and other coastal \nStates received no portion of these oil and gas revenues. Not until \n1986 were we able to receive a very small portion of those revenues \ngenerated between a 3-mile and 6-mile line.\n  Just yesterday, however, exploration officials from British Petroleum \nannounced the discovery of the largest deep-water find in history 125 \nmiles southeast of New Orleans. The underwater find is dubbed ``Crazy \nHorse.'' It was discovered in 6,000 feet of water.\n  Imagine the kind of equipment that is going to take to mine this kind \nof find. We are happy to do this. The industry provides economic \nopportunity.\n\n  But can you imagine providing the infrastructure in your State, for a \nconstruction company building hundreds of skyscrapers such as this in \nyour backyard? These underwater skyscrapers all have to be built and \nparts manufactured and moved to the site. All of this material moves \nthrough the fragile environment of coastal Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nTexas.\n  If this monument, or if this structure, were out of the water to be \nseen, it would be as if you stacked the Washington Monument end to end \n10 times. It is the kind of structure that has to be built to mine \nthese sorts of finds in the gulf.\n  In 1998, Federal mineral development from offshore totaled \napproximately $2.8 billion. That is what we sent to the Federal \nGovernment. Yet we only received $20 million. That is less than a tenth \nof 1 percent.\n  Let me state that again--a tenth of 1 percent is what Louisiana was \nable to retain. Other States retained 50 percent. In addition, they \nreceived other payments. This situation is obviously not just; it is \nunfair, and this bill attempts to help correct that inequity.\n  As a result of OCS activity, Louisiana has suffered a significant \nnegative environmental impact. We have lost over 1,000 square miles of \ncoastal wetlands over the last 50 years. If we don't take action today, \nwe are liable to lose another 1,000 square miles more in the next 50 \nyears.\n  To bring this down to size, we lose a football field every day. We \nlose an area the size of the State of Rhode Island every year.\n  These losses are partially due to natural erosion but are aggravated \nby the way we have levied the Mississippi River, which, again, serves \nas a port for our entire Nation and not just our State, and it is also \nimpacted by the activities associated with oil and gas drilling.\n  The people of Louisiana, while understanding that this is very \nimportant and this is a national asset--and, again, we are happy for \nthe industry and want to promote an environmentally sensitive way of \ndrilling as we know it today--believe that we should be more justly \ncompensated for these impacts.\n  The distribution formula in S. 25 is weighted to provide an extra \nportion to those six States with Federal offshore oil production. We \nare not giving any incentive for future production. We want this to be \na drilling-neutral bill, if you will, but a revenue-sharing bill that \nacknowledges the contribution made by our producing States.\n  As proposed in S. 25, Louisiana will only receive 10 percent of the \nFederal revenues that are generated. Again, historically, we have \nreceived less than one-tenth of 1 percent. Historically and to date in \nthe law, the interior States have received 50 percent. We are asking \nfor our fair share and modest share of this money, and S. 25 outlines a \n10-percent portion.\n  The cosponsors of S. 25 believe it is appropriate to share a portion \nof Federal OCS revenues with coastal States that do not and will not \nhave any offshore oil production.\n  Today there is no dedicated source of funding for the variety of \ncoastal environmental problems that are being experienced around the \nNation, even in those States that are not producing. S. 25 recognizes \nthat the producing States should be acknowledged and those States which \nare nonproducing also have challenges with their coastline--beach \nerosion, et cetera.\n  When Congress created the Land and Water Conservation Fund over 30 \nyears ago, it was intended ``to provide a steady revenue stream to \npreserve 'irreplaceable lands of natural beauty and unique recreational \nvalue.' Royalties from offshore oil and gas leases will provide the \nmoney, giving the program an interesting symmetry. Dollars raised from \ndepleting one natural resource would be used to protect another.''\n  This, unfortunately, has not come true. These moneys were given but \ntaken away. They were appropriated in different amounts over the years. \nThis bill will attempt to use the dollars produced by depleting one \nnatural resource to preserve many areas of natural beauty in our \nNation, both on the coast and in our interior States.\n  This is an important bill for Louisiana and the gulf coast, but it is \nimportant for the entire Nation. Our legacy as leaders will be the land \nwe leave to our children and their children. At the rate we are going, \nwe might not have very much to give them.\n  This bill will give us a steady stream of revenue to provide full \nfunding for our land and water conservation, to give much-needed \nresources for our coastal States to mitigate some of this negative \nimpact and also to share justly with the other States in our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing us to have this time today. I, again, \nthank the majority leader and the chairman, and to the 20 or more \nsponsors we have for this legislation. It is my hope that we can mark \nthis up shortly and move this bill through the process.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Reserving the right to object, we were \nsupposed to be in the policy committee starting at 12:30 p.m.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8840-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8840-S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, S. 25, the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct, offers a unique opportunity for the entire nation to enjoy the \ntangible benefits of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas production. It \nredirects a portion of royalties from Outer Continental Shelf \nproduction directly back to States and local communities for \nenvironmental and conservation programs.\n  The effect of this bill will be to provide States and local \ncommunities\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nfunding to expand and maintain parks and to enhance hunting, fishing \nand other outdoor recreational activities.\n  In addition, this bill would redirect a portion of Outer Continental \nShelf Royalties back to the States which have endured the risks of \nproduction through the bill's Coastal Impact Assistance program. This \nprogram will provide dedicated funding to coastal States for air \nquality, water quality and to mitigate the environmental effects of \nOuter Continental Shelf infrastructure developments.\n  Alabama might use these funds to help ensure water quality in Mobile \nBay, part of the National Estuary Program, and for the preservation and \nrestoration of oyster beds and other sensitive environments areas along \nour coast. States may choose to establish a protected trust fund, as \nAlabama has with existing state royalties, in order to use the revenues \nin perpetuity for environmental and conservation purposes.\n  Alabama is one of only six States with active Outer Continental Shelf \nnatural gas production off its shore and onshore infrastructure to \nrefine and transport those resources. Alabama ranks ninth in the \ncountry for natural gas production and produced over 430 billion cubic \nfeet of natural gas in 1994. There are four onshore refineries and \nnumerous natural gas pipelines to process Outer Continental Shelf \nnatural gas. The State has made a significant investment in providing \nthe land and infrastructure to handle this production, yet has not been \nable to enjoy any direct royalty benefits from Outer Continental Shelf \nproduction.\n  This bill takes a step towards ensuring Alabama and the entire nation \nreceive at least a part of the direct benefits of Outer Continental \nShelf production.\n  I commend the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, for their tremendous leadership on this \nissue and look forward to the passage of this bill soon.\n  I express my appreciation to Senators Murkowski and Landrieu for \nworking on this legislation. I have worked with them from the \nbeginning. It has good potential to allow States to retain some of the \noil and gas money for remediating environmental damage from production \nand for improving their environmental quality in general.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to \nparticipate in today's discussion of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund (LWCF). Senator Landrieu and Senator Murkowski deserve great \ncredit for their efforts to restore the LWCF's important conservation \ngoals, as does Senator Lott for his commitment to addressing this issue \non a bipartisan basis.\n  Congress originally intended that revenues from off-shore oil and gas \ndrilling be deposited into a Land and Water Conservation Fund to allow \nthe federal and state governments to protect green space, improve \nwildlife habitat, and purchase lands for conservation purposes. I have \ncome to appreciate this program, as the Land and Water Conservation \nFund has been used by local and state governments in South Dakota to \npurchase park lands and develop many of the facilities that exist in \nmunicipal and state parks throughout the state.\n  For the past five years, however, the state side of the LWCF has not \nbeen funded, the revenues from off-shore oil and gas drilling have been \nused to fund other federal programs. As a result, much-needed local and \nstate park improvement projects have been held back, and there has been \ngrowing pressure in recent years to divert these funds back to their \noriginal purpose.\n  Americans depend increasingly on parks and open spaces for recreation \nbecause they allow all of us to deal better with the stress of modern \nlife. Therefore, it is important that states are given the resources \nthey need to improve parks and public lands, and I am prepared to work \nin a bipartisan fashion to enact legislation this year to ensure \ngreater annual funding of conservation efforts from off-shore oil and \ngas drilling revenues.\n  A number of proposals, many of which are bipartisan, have been \nproposed by the administration and members of Congress to ensure that \nfuture off-shore oil and gas drilling revenues are dedicated to \nconservation purposes. A consensus appears to be developing that \nconsiderably more resources should be invested to protect and maintain \nrural and urban parks, preserve farmland and forests, provide \nincentives for the protection of endangered species on private lands, \nfully fund payments-in-lieu-of-taxes, and protect coastal resources.\n  I believe that this legislation could have a tremendous positive \nimpact on local, state, and national parks, and greatly enhance outdoor \nrecreation and environmental education projects throughout South Dakota \nand the nation. It is my strong hope that Congress will produce \ncompromise legislation reflecting many of the basic objectives \ncontained in these proposals and ensure a strong future for our \nnation's natural resources. I am dedicated to working with Senators \nLandrieu, Murkowski, and Lott to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Breaux, Senator Lott, and others in \nsupporting the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. This \nimportant legislation will provide consistent funding to state fish and \nwildlife conservation programs to help maintain our precious natural \nresources, and will help to bring more Nebraskans back to the river--in \nour case, the Missouri River. This legislation will give states the \nnecessary funding to carry out a flexible, non-regulatory approach to \nconservation that prevents species and their habitats from becoming \nendangered and to restore fish and wildlife populations to healthy \nnumbers. This legislation is consistent with and fully complementary to \nthe Missouri River Valley Improvement Act of 1999 that I recently \nintroduced, along with my colleagues Senator Daschle and Senator \nJohnson.\n  The most important provisions of the Conservation and Reinvestment \nAct for my home state of Nebraska are Titles II and III, the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund reform provisions. Title III of this \nlegislation would restore state-side funding to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--funding that has been diverted in recent years for \nother uses. However, as emphasized by the bill's authors and \nsupporters, restoration of these funds to states is more important now \nthan ever before, as Nebraska and all states are faced with accelerated \npopulation growth and urban sprawl, and increased demand by families, \ncommunities, and the business sector for recreation and conservation \nareas--areas that draw people and economic growth. Nebraska, as well as \nother states, has relied on hunters and anglers to provide the bulk of \nfinancial support for fish and wildlife programs--particularly through \nthe purchase of hunting and fishing licenses and through excise taxes \non sporting goods. However, these funds have not been adequate to \naddress the needs of declining nongame species. Titles II and III of \nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act would provide a permanent Federal \nfunding source to meet these needs in Nebraska and other states, and \nwould revitalize the state matching grants program.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act, as passed in 1965, utilized \na portion of the proceeds from Outer Continental Shelf mineral leasing \nrevenues to give to state and local governments for recreation and \nconservation purposes as those governments deemed necessary and \nbeneficial for their communities. In 1997, a record $5.2 billion in \nroyalties, rents, and bonus payments from new lease sales was collected \nby the Federal government. Significant federal revenues from Outer \nContinental Shelf leasing and production has been designated by law for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, but since 1995, Congress has not \nappropriated these monies to the states, but rather has transferred \nmost of these funds to the U.S. Treasury for other uses. This important \nlegislation would rectify this, and bring the funding source back to \nNebraska and to local Nebraska communities. State and local governments \nmatch, dollar for dollar, Federal Land and Water Conservation funds for \nopen space conservation and recreation in our communities. This act \nwould restore the state and local funding, bolster the federal funding \ncomponent, and also secure funding for urban parks and recreational \nareas.\n  While this act would currently provide 7 percent of Land and Water \nConservation Funds to the states, I signed\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\na letter today, along with several of my colleagues in the Senate, \nurging that funding for this provision be increased to 10 percent--a \nlevel that I believe to be consistent with the needs that exist in my \nstate of Nebraska and in others. Besides providing recreational funding \nsupport for community needs, this source of funds can have a \nsignificant impact on non-regulatory approaches to preventing wildlife \nspecies from being listed as threatened or declined under the \nEndangered Species Act--listings which often find landowners embroiled \nin private property rights vs. species protection laws. By enabling \ncommunities and states to preserve identified areas where habitat and \nspecies can be allowed to flourish with minimal or little disruption on \nthe lives and activities of people, we can help to prevent future \nlistings, and to safeguard against some of the social and economic \ndisruptions that have often accompanied past listings.\n  Additionally, wildlife conservation, conservation education, and \nwildlife-associated recreational programs--all of which contribute \nincreasingly significant tourism and recreational dollar returns to the \nstate of Nebraska--are traditionally underfunded. The International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies estimates these needs \nnationally to be approximately one billion dollars per year.\n  Increasing Title III funding to 10 percent of Outer Continental Shelf \nreceipts would give Nebraska approximately an additional $1.7 million \nannually--money that I know from the people of Nebraska is both needed \nand would be well-spent.\n  The Nebraska State Legislature passed a resolution this year in \nsupport of this bill, as did the City of Grand Island in Nebraska. \nNebraska Governor Mike Johanns is one of 27 Governors to officially \nsupport this legislation. All 50 state fish and wildlife agencies, \nincluding the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and more than 3,000 local \nentities, businesses, clubs, and conservation organizations have \nendorsed the Conservation and Reinvestment Act of 1999. Nationwide, \nmore than 200 state and local ballot initiatives sought to commit \nbillions of dollars for conservation, farmland protection, and urban \nrevitalization policies. More than 70 percent of these initiatives were \nsupported by voters. I enthusiastically add my support to this \nimpressive list of supporters, and look forward to working with Senator \nLandrieu and our colleagues to finalize and pass this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8842-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize a \nday that is certainly going to be remembered, as we go into the next \nmillennium, as symbolizing this century. Each century has one or two \nthings that define it. It is what schoolchildren remember. It is what \nadults remember. Everyone remembers where they were when certain events \nhappened, whether it was President Roosevelt saying on the radio that \nthe war was over, whether it was the assassination of President John \nKennedy, or whether it was Neil Armstrong taking one giant leap for \nmankind.\n  I believe July 20, 1969, 30 years ago, was clearly one of the \ndefining moments of our century, although it would be very difficult to \nchoose which moment had the most lasting impact. The day Neil Armstrong \nstepped on the Moon, the spirit of America was rejuvenated. It also was \nthe culmination of years of discoveries, of scientific missions, of \nbehind-the-scenes scientific experiments that were all a big show on \nJuly 20. I think it is important for us on a day such as today to \nrecognize what all of those scientific experiences did and what we have \ngained from the space program.\n  In fact, when we look at the cost of the Apollo project, it cost \nabout $25 billion. In 1990 dollars, it would be about $95 billion. It \nwas an investment. The good news is, because America was willing to go \nfor it, because America said the Moon is there and we can do it, we \nhave had a 9-to-1 return on every dollar we have invested.\n  What is the 9-to-1 return? It is the newly created products and \ntechnologies and the new jobs that have come about as a result of those \ntechnologies that is the return on our investment. What space has given \nto our economy is a 9-to-1 return on our investment.\n  There have been 30,000 spinoffs from our space research. Let me tell \nyou a few.\n  Satellites: Satellites are part of our daily lives. We now get \ninstant access on the news anywhere in the world because of satellites. \nWe can see press conferences anywhere in the world live because of \nsatellites. We see satellites as part of our defense. A defense system \nfor an incoming missile is going to result because we have satellite \ntechnology.\n  Computers: The microchip--how has that made a difference in our \nlives? Who can even ask the question about what computers have done. We \nsee people with laptops in the airports, on airplanes. It is just \nphenomenal. This started with space research, not on the Senate floor, \nMr. President.\n  High-quality software, high-performance computing, fiber-optic \nnetworks, water purification systems, Teflon--Teflon has improved the \nquality of life for all of us in this country who have spent even 1 \nminute in the kitchen. Digital watches, cordless tools, and, most \nnotable, in my opinion, is space explorations' contribution to medical \nscience. CAT scans and MRIs are revolutionizing our ability to detect \ntumors early enough so we can save lives.\n  Our quality of life has significantly improved since Neil Armstrong \ntook the giant leap for mankind. It was to that moment that all of us \nrelated what America had accomplished. That happened 30 years ago \ntoday.\n  I congratulate Neil Armstrong, the Apollo 11 crew, and all those at \nJohnson Space Center in Houston, TX, who contributed to the giant leap \nfor mankind and the quality of life that all of us live, because those \nbrave astronauts were willing to take the risk and the chance.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8842-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, is recognized to offer a motion to discharge the \nFinance Committee of S.J. Res. 27, on which there will be 1 hour of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974 and the rules of the \nSenate, I do make a privileged motion that the\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\nSenate Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration of \nS.J. Res. 27, a resolution disapproving the President's June 3, 1999 \nextension of normal trade relations with China.\n  It is my understanding that based on the parliamentary decisions made \nearlier, the 1 hour will be equally divided, a half hour under my \ncontrol and a half hour under the control of the other side, not by \nmajority/minority, but by the two sides, pro and con.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is also my understanding, for the \nbenefit of my colleagues, that there will be two consecutive rollcall \nvotes, the first one being on the China discharge and the second one on \nthe Vietnam discharge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, notice of my intention to \ndo these discharge motions was made to both the majority and minority \nleaders, the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, and \nseveral other Senators on July 7, so there would be ample time for the \nleaders to adjust the time so we could have a vote prior to the House \nvoting on this matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes out of my allotted time.\n  Despite President Clinton's 1992 campaign promise to link MFN \ncertification to China's human rights record, the administration has \nchosen annually to grant Beijing what had been known as most-favored-\nnation status and is now called normal trading relations. It is amazing \nto me that that certification could be granted, given the dismal record \nof China in so many ways that we have talked about on this floor for so \nmany weeks, especially in the area of human rights.\n  By offering this motion, I am asking the Senate to discharge S.J. \nRes. 27 from the Finance Committee. This legislation would disapprove \nthe President's recommendation of normal trade relations status for \nChina. Because of the rules of the Senate, it is in the Finance \nCommittee. If I don't discharge it out, then it doesn't come out, and \nwe don't get the opportunity to debate this issue.\n  This is a very important issue. Let me say, again, as I said earlier \nthis morning on the Vietnam issue, whether my colleagues agree or \ndisagree with me is not the issue. The issue is whether or not they \nwill let us debate this on the floor. That is the issue. If they vote \nagainst my discharge motion, then they have said they do not want the \nSenate to debate this issue at all. They don't want to hear about the \nhuman rights violations in China or Vietnam. I would find that \nregrettable if the Senate made that decision.\n  If they feel strongly that they are right and there are not any \nproblems in China which would justify holding up the NTR, normal \ntrading relations, then they ought to come down on the floor and defend \nthat.\n  I have a few things I could share with Senators that I think will \ngive them the opposite impression. I would want the opportunity to do \nthat on behalf of so many Americans who are fed up with the fact that \nwe keep giving MFN, or most-favored-nation trading status, to a country \nwho has been so abysmal on human rights violations, not to mention \nstealing our nuclear secrets.\n  I have come to expect the President to ignore China's total disregard \nfor human rights, its proliferation of nuclear weapons, and its piracy \nof U.S. technology by continuing Beijing's trading relationship with \nour country, but what I don't understand is why. Why are we doing this? \nWhy are we afraid to debate this? Are we afraid we are going to find \nout how much technology has been pirated? Are we going to find out how \nmuch proliferation of nuclear weapons has actually occurred, how many \nhuman rights violations have occurred in China?\n\n  The answer is, yes, of course, we are going to find out, because I am \ngoing to present this on the floor if I get the opportunity to do it. \nRegrettably, the opposition is going to try to deny me that opportunity \nand probably will win. They win; the American people lose.\n  I will point out a few facts--I only have 30 minutes; I don't get the \n10 hours I would have under the law, if, in fact, my discharge petition \nmotion is approved. Unfortunately, I have to assume I am not going to \nget it and make the point as fast as I can in 30 minutes.\n  Since 1949, Communist China has operated one of the most brutal and \nrepressive regimes the world has ever known. Indeed, the Beijing \ngovernment has committed large-scale genocide in Tibet. It has killed \nmillions of its own citizens, outlawed religion, obliterated freedom of \nthe press, and fought against the United States in Korea and Indochina.\n  In 1989, the Chinese Government authorized a crackdown on thousands \nof students who had the courage to stand up for human rights and \ndemocracy, and crack down they did. We all know the sad stories that \ncame out of that period of time in China's history. The actions of the \nBeijing government have also served to undermine international \nstability and U.S. national security interests. China continues to \nviolate the missile technology control regime, exporting to rogue \nstates like Iran, North Korea, and other nations. They export our most \nsensitive technology, which in some cases they stole and in other cases \nthey bought, believe it or not, from the United States.\n  Moreover, China has failed to assist the United States in fully \naccounting for American POWs held by the Chinese forces during the \nKorean war. Certainly, the theft of our nuclear secrets by Chinese \nagents has been on our minds in the past several months. The Cox report \nprovides extensive evidence on the damage done to our national security \nby Chinese espionage. But I am also very concerned about China's \nnotorious and seemingly blatant disregard for U.S. intellectual \nproperty laws.\n  Over the last decade, Chinese exports to the United States have \nincreased seven times in comparison to American exports to China, \ncreating a significant trade imbalance. During this time, some of the \nmost rapidly growing and most competitive U.S. industries have been \nadversely affected by China's failure to enforce intellectual property \nrights. These include computer software, pharmaceuticals, agricultural \nand chemical products, and trademarks.\n  American businesses are losing billions because of this persistent \nproblem. Yet the President marches forward saying normal trade \nrelations is perfectly acceptable. I don't understand it. How can the \nadministration justify their decision to reward the Communist Chinese \nGovernment NTR status when that government has such a deplorable record \nof protecting just one issue--U.S. intellectual property rights--not to \nmention many others which I will be getting into.\n  Peace and economic stability in Asia are in America's interest and \nrequire Chinese-American cooperation. Unfortunately, the President's \ndecision to reextend NTR status to Communist China effectively rewards \nBeijing for rejecting reasonable American demands for protection from \nthis intellectual property rights piracy, for cooperation on \ninternational nonproliferation efforts, and for a greater respect for \nbasic human rights.\n  Now we are hearing the ominous signs of the saber rattling around \nTaiwan. These threats of military acts of violence threaten the \nstability of the entire region in the Pacific rim. How can you justify \ngiving a nation that has done this, and is doing this, most-favored-\nnation trading status?\n  Perhaps the most egregious are the human rights violations which we \nappear to condone by granting this NTR status to China. It has a \nterrible human rights record. I have heard so many times from my \ncolleagues, some of whom are going to be denying me by a vote the \naccess to be able to debate this, how terrible the human rights \nviolations are in China. Their policies on the political dissidents, \nreligious freedom, and population control are abhorrent. The State \nDepartment report on China's human rights practices illustrates an \nappalling picture. It provides example after example of torture, forced \nconfessions, suppression of basic human rights, denial of due process, \nand, worse of all, forced abortion and sterilization. Is this a \ngovernment to which the United States of America should give most-\nfavored-nation status? I don't think so.\n  All I am asking for is the opportunity to go into these matters in \ndetail and debate this on the floor of the\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\nSenate. This is not a vote on whether you agree or disagree. It is very \ninteresting. I was thinking as I walked down to the floor from my \noffice a few moments ago that the President of the United States took \nthe U.S. military, put them in harm's way and bombed the sovereign \nnation of Yugoslavia to protect the human rights of the Albanian \nKosovars. I can't even get the Senate to give me the opportunity to \ndebate human rights violations in Vietnam and China. That is the bottom \nline. That is what we are talking about today.\n  The President--I will repeat this--went to war in Yugoslavia to \nprotect the human rights of the Albanians in Kosovo, and I am going to \nbe denied on this floor, by a vote, the opportunity to debate--just to \ndebate--human rights violations in China and Vietnam. They don't want \nto hear it. That is the bottom line. If you can live with that in your \nconscience, fine. It is a sad, sad situation.\n\n  All I am asking for is what is required under the law. Give me 10 \nhours and I will agree to reduce the 10 to 2. I will say to my \ncolleagues, wherever you are out there, it is 10 hours by requirement; \nbut I will agree to 2 hours on my side if you will support my motion. \nGive me the opportunity to show you on this floor what China and \nVietnam are doing by voting for both of these motions.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I yield the floor to give some time to \nthe other side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I appreciate the feelings and good \nintentions of the Senator from New Hampshire, but I respectfully oppose \nthis motion to discharge the Finance Committee from considering the \nresolution to disprove extension of the Jackson-Vanik waiver for China. \nWhy do I do so? First, I say to my good friend from New Hampshire, he \nhas lots of opportunities to debate human rights, or any similar \nissues, on the floor. He can offer an amendment to any bill. That is a \nstanding rule of the Senate. Any Senator can offer an amendment to \nvirtually any bill at any time. He has that right. The rules of the \nSenate provide for unlimited debate. So he can talk for as long as he \ncan physically stand on his own two feet. He has plenty of opportunity, \nas do all Senators, to raise issues that concern them.\n  I think it is inappropriate to discharge the Finance Committee from \nconsidering the resolution to disapprove an extension. Why? Very \nsimply, because the current process has worked pretty well.\n  I am somewhat bemused when I think back on how furious the debate was \non this issue--oh, gosh, it must be 4, 5, 6 years ago. In fact, I was \none of the few Members of the Senate on the Democratic side who voted \nto sustain the veto of President Bush on this very measure, as a \nconsequence of President Bush's intention to extend unconditional MFN--\nnow NTR--status for China, which prevailed. Ever since then, gradually, \nover the years, each President, each year, has reached the same \nconclusion after studying all the issues--that there should be a 1-year \nunconditional extension of most-favored-nation trading status. We have \nchanged the name now to normal trade relations status. That is more \naccurate--more normal than most favored. In fact, for all intents and \npurposes, it is least favored. That is because the United States has \ntrade agreements with many other countries which give them favorable \nterms of trade compared with the standard of MFN, or NTR.\n  Over the years, as more and more Americans have become more familiar \nwith this question, and as the Congress has become more familiar, it \nhas now come to the point where the vast majority of Members of \nCongress agree that annual unconditional extensions make sense, pure \nand simple. That is why we are here today. Several years ago, it was a \nhuge debate. Now, over the years, it has come to be virtually a \nnonissue. It is virtually a nonissue because the vast majority of \nMembers on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, and \nPresidents, Republicans and Democrats, know that to do otherwise would \ncause a tremendous upheaval of our relationships with a very important \ncountry--in this case, China.\n  I think it is important as we enter the next millennium that we deal \nwith other countries with tremendous respect, recognizing that \ncountries have interests. China has its own interests, and the United \nStates has its own interests. The real question is how do we get along \nbetter with each other, in a way that accommodates American points of \nview.\n  The basic policy, as announced by the Presidents over time, has been \nengagement. I say it is basically engagement without illusions; that \nis, we talk with countries, but we are realistic about what they do or \ndo not do. But we do not cut off something that is very basic, \nsomething that we grant to virtually every country in the world, \nincluding a lot of others that I can name that have foreign policies \nand internal policies that are inimical to the United States, but \nnevertheless we think to deal with those countries, it is best to \nmaintain the current trade relationship with them.\n  One of the huge adverse consequences that have been caused by this in \nthe past would be the clear setback of negotiations between the United \nStates and China over China's membership in the World Trade \nOrganization. That is a clear winner for the United States, as long as \nit is done on commercially acceptable principles. The last agreement \nthat Premier Zhu tabled for the United States when he was in Washington \nnot too long ago was clearly in the United States best interest. Why? \nBecause it was unilateral.\n\n  In every case, it was China that was making concessions. It was China \nopening up its markets to American products. It was China that changed \nits distribution system. It would be China that would agree to--a much \nmore fancy term is ``transparency''--much more openness, which \nundermines corruption, which undermines favoritism. It brings the \nChinese economy much more into the modern world.\n  If this resolution were to pass, I will bet my bottom dollar we would \nhave no WTO this year, and probably not for the next couple of years. \nThen the relationship with China, if you think they are risky now, \nwould make today's relationship look like a cake walk. We have China's \ndifficulties with Taiwan. They will be there for the indefinite future.\n  There are problems we have now with China over the tragic, mistaken \nbombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. We have very deep human \nrights concerns. We have concerns about China's--in the past, anyway--\ntransfers of missile technology, and perhaps nuclear weapons, to rogue \nnations.\n  But let's remember, China has taken a lot of actions which have been \nvery helpful to the United States. What is one?\n  China abstained at the U.N. Security Council when we wanted the \nSecurity Council resolution on Kosovo. China could have caused all \nkinds of problems and could have vetoed that Security Council \nresolution but did not.\n  China also signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. They have signed \nit. As far as we know, they have not violated it.\n  They helped us in the gulf war, particularly by their actions with \nthe Security Council. They helped with North Korea and the problems we \nhave with North Korea, and particularly the greater potential problems \nwe might have if North Korea starts sending missiles farther out into \nthe Pacific.\n  But if this resolution passes, all those problems I mentioned are \ngoing to be exacerbated and all the good points I mentioned will become \nirrelevant and not helpful in our relationship with that country.\n  It is a very important country to deal with in a very solid, \ncommonsense way. China is the largest country in the world. China has \nthe largest freestanding army in the world. China has the largest \npopulation in the world. China is a nuclear power. China is the fastest \ngrowing developing country in the world. It is a major power. We can't \nclose our eyes to China.\n  I am not saying we should accept what China is doing. I am not saying \nwe should accept what any country is doing that is adverse to American \ninterests. But I am saying that we have to, with eyes wide open, look \nat China and engage China without illusion. That is the policy.\n  If this resolution were to pass, believe me, we would be disengaging\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\nChina. China would be so upset--and they should be, if it were to \npass--and we would be dealing with China as an enemy and not as a \ncountry that is separate from us.\n  There is an old saying in life that if you stick your finger in \nsomebody's eye and you treat somebody like the enemy, guess what. They \nare going to be an enemy; they will react adversely. That is exactly \nhow this would be recognized if it were to pass.\n  There is another important point. It is procedural. Procedural \nmatters, I might add, are not unimportant. This measure has been \nreported out of the House Ways and Means Committee unfavorably. So it \nis highly likely that this resolution will not come over to the Senate. \nIf that is the case, why are we going through all of this? It doesn't \nmake any sense.\n\n  I suggest, with deep respect to the other body, and with deep respect \nto my friend from New Hampshire and to my fellow colleagues, that if it \ncomes up in the House, despite the recommendation of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, they pass the resolution, and it comes over here, then \nwe will take it up and we will debate it. But it is premature to take \nit up at this time when it is clear, because of the House vote, that it \nwill not pass the House and therefore will not be ripe as an issue over \nhere.\n  But the fundamental reason is that this resolution, if it were to \npass, would cause many more problems than the purported solutions that \nlie under the premise of this motion.\n  Again, all Presidents who have looked at this issue and all \nCongresses that have looked at this issue have reached the same \nconclusion--Republican and Democrat--that continuing the grant on an \nannual basis of unconditioned, normal trade relations with China will \ncreate the foundation and the condition for a much greater probability \nthat we are going to achieve the success we want with various other \nissues that we have with China.\n  I oppose this move to discharge the Finance Committee from \nconsidering the resolution to disapprove extension of Jackson-Vanik \nwaiver authority for China. It is an unnecessary attempt to alter a \nprocess that has worked well in providing for Congress' role in the \nannual NTR debate.\n  America's economic and trade relations with China have developed \nsignificantly over the past decade. I fervently hope that we will be \nable to resume WTO negotiations with China, complete a good commercial \nagreement, and extend permanent NTR quickly and in time for China to \njoin the WTO in November in Seattle.\n  This is important for our businesses, important for our workers, and \nimportant for our country. I have no illusions about the serious \nproblems we have with China, whether it is human rights, arms \nproliferation, espionage, Taiwan, or other areas. But using NTR, \nwhether it is the annual extension or the permanent granting of that \nstatus, is not an effective way to influence China and move them in a \ndirection we would like to see that society go. It holds our economic \ninterests with China hostage to other aspects of the relationship. We \nneed to regularize and normalize our trading relationship with China. \nWe need to put predictability and stability into that trading \nrelationship so that our industries can improve their ability to do \nbusiness with China.\n  This resolution to discharge, although seemingly procedural, has an \nintent that damages our businesses, our workers, our farmers, and our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to reject this effort.\n  I see my colleague. I guess he is going to yield time to one of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my \ndistinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise today in opposition to the President's decision to extend \nnormal trade relations status to China.\n  I especially thank the Senator from New Hampshire for bringing up the \nissue today.\n  I have objected to the President's policy on this issue since 1994, \nwhen he first de-linked the issue of human rights from our trading \npolicy in China. The argument made then was that trade privileges and \nhuman rights are not interrelated. At the same time, it was said, \nthrough ``constructive engagement'' on economic matters, and dialogue \non other issues, including human rights, the United States could better \ninfluence the behavior of the Chinese Government.\n  I have yet to see persuasive evidence that closer economic ties alone \nare going to transform China's authoritarian system into a democracy, \nor even reduce the current level of oppression borne by the Chinese \npeople. Unless we continue to press the case for improvement in China's \nhuman rights record, using the leverage of the Chinese Government's \ndesire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see \nhow U.S. policy can help conditions in China get much better.\n  Virtually every review of the behavior of China's Government \ndemonstrates that not only has there been little improvement in the \nhuman rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has worsened--\nparticularly in the weeks preceding the tenth anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre on June 4th. More generally, five years after \nthe President's decision to de-link trade from human rights, the State \nDepartment's most recent Human Rights Report on China describes once \nmore an abysmal situation.\n  In my view, it is impossible to come to any other conclusion except \nthat ``constructive engagement'' has failed to make any change in \nBeijing's human rights behavior. I would say that the evidence \njustifies the exact opposite conclusion: respect for human rights by \nthe Chinese government has deteriorated and the regime continues to act \nrecklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest.\n  This year--1999--is likely to be the most important year since 1989 \nwith respect to our relations with China. Not only does it represent a \nsignificant milestone for the victims of Tiananmen Square, but 1999 is \nalso the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic. \nThis year has also seen the emergence of new thorny issues between the \nUnited States and China, including the accidental embassy bombing, \nfaltering negotiations regarding accession to the World Trade \nOrganizations, and the recent release of the Cox report on Chinese \nespionage.\n\n  If moral outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is not reason \nenough for a tough stance with China--and I believe it is, as do the \nAmerican people--then let us do so on grounds of real political and \neconomic self-interest.\n  For example, China has failed to provide adequate protection of U.S. \nintellectual property rights; it has employed broad and pervasive trade \nand investment barriers to restrict our exports; it has made illegal \ntextile transshipments to the United States; it has exported products \nto the United States manufactured by prison labor; and it has engaged \nin questionable economic and political policies toward Hong Kong.\n  This does not present a picture of a nation with which we should have \nnormal trade relations. Alternatively, if the Administration accepts \nthese practices as normal, perhaps we need to redefine what normal \ntrade relations are. The current practices are certainly not any that I \nwish to accept as normal.\n  Nor, Mr. President, do I wish to accept as normal the practice in our \ncountry of using campaign money to influence policy decisions, but I'm \nafraid that the China/NTR decision is far from an exception to this \nrule.\n  No, Mr. President, U.S.-China trade policy epitomizes how our \ncampaign finance system can influence important decisions. The \ncorporations and associations lobbying in favor of China NTR, as well \nas on China's accession to the World Trade Organization, represent a \nvirtual who's who of major political donors. In an effort to inform my \ncolleagues and the public about who's who in the push for NTR for \nChina, I'd like to Call the Bankroll on some of the companies and \nassociations involved in this fight.\n  These big donors represent industries that run the gamut of American \ncommerce--from agribusiness to telecommunications and everything in \nbetween--but they all have in common a keen financial interest in China \nwinning normal trade relations status.\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\n  One of the major coalitions lobbying to boost China's trade status, \nUSA Engage, has a membership list brimming with top PAC money and soft \nmoney donors.\n  Let me name just a few examples of the political donations some of \nthese USA Engage members gave during the last election cycle:\n  Defense contractor TRW Inc. gave more than $195,000 in soft money and \n$236,000 in PAC money.\n  Financial services giant BankAmerica gave more than $347,000 in soft \nmoney and more than $430,000 in PAC money.\n  The powerful business coalition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave \nnearly $50,000 in soft money and $10,000 in PAC money\n  Exxon, one of the world's largest oil companies, gave $331,000 in \nsoft money and nearly half a million dollars in PAC money.\n  Communications giant Motorola gave more than $100,000 in both soft \nmoney and PAC money.\n  Mr. President, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes on \nand the money is piled high.\n  Over in the other body, junior members--who of course sit in the most \nremote offices in the far corners of the House office buildings--say \nthat the only reason corporate CEOs come visit their offices is to push \nfor NTR status for China.\n  So you see, Mr. President, on the one hand, some of the most powerful \ninterests in America come to our offices to call on us to grant NTR \nstatus to China. We hear them loud and clear, and more than that we \nknow too well the influence they wield as a result of their political \ndonations.\n  But Mr. President, what about the other side? What about the voices \nwe don't hear? The faces we don't see? I am talking about the human \nrights organizations who oppose de-linking trade from human rights, but \nare virtually nonexistent in the world of campaign contributions. I am \ntalking about the thousands, if not millions, of Chinese people living \nwithout basic human rights who don't have access to the Halls of \nCongress.\n  I fail to see anything normal about the United States extending \nfavorable trading status to a government that routinely denies basic \nfreedoms--of expression, of religion, and association--to its people.\n  I fail to see what is normal, what is acceptable, or what is just \nabout the United States tacitly condoning the actions of a country \nwhere our own State Department reports that the human rights situation \nis--quote--``abysmal.''\n  Mr. President, my main objective today is to push for the United \nStates to once again make the link between human rights and trading \nrelations with respect to our policy in China. As I have said before, I \nbelieve that trade--embodied by the peculiar exercise of NTR renewal--\nis one of the most powerful levers we have, and that it was a mistake \nfor the President to de-link this exercise from human rights \nconsiderations.\n  So, Mr. President, for those of us who care about human rights, those \nof us who long for freedom of religion for others, and those of us who \nbelieve America should demonstrate moral leadership in the world, I \nurge colleagues to join me in disapproving the President's decision to \nrenew normal-trade-relations status for China.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 8 minutes to my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee, I \nrise in strong opposition to the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 27. My \nobjections to the motion and the underlying resolution, and to bringing \nthem up at this point in time, are both procedural and substantive.\n  My first procedural objection is that while the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith] is within his rights to move to discharge the \njoint resolution pursuant to 19 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2192(c) and 2193, by \ndoing so he is effectively seeking to bring it to the floor by \ncompletely circumventing the committee process. S.J. Res. 27 was \nreferred to the Finance Committee on June 7 of this year. As my friend \nthe distinguished chairman of that committee [Mr. Roth] has noted \ntoday, the committee has had no opportunity to hold hearings on the \nrelative merits of the resolution, to amend it, or to prepare a report \non it to the full Senate. A piece of legislation this important, that \nwould--if passed--have a huge effect on what I believe will be our most \nimportant bilateral relationship in the next century, deserves to be \nconsidered fully by the committee of jurisdiction without having that \nprocess short-circuited by a single Senator--especially one that is not \na member of the committee in question.\n  Second, the Senate still has a number of vitally important \nappropriations bills to complete before Congress recesses for August. \nThere is no connection whatsoever between these legislative matters and \nthe joint resolution. There exists no time exigency which makes it \nimportant to lay aside debate on appropriations bills in order to \ndebate China NTR nor, for that matter, which makes it important to \ncircumvent the statutory process set out for the consideration of \nresolutions like S.J. Res. 27.\n  And that brings up my third procedural objection. Pursuant to the \nTrade Act of 1974, it is the practice of the Senate that a resolution \nof disapproval of a renewal of NTR status must originate in the House. \nPursuant to 19 U.S.C. Sec. 2192(f)(1)(A)(ii) and 2192(f)(1)(B), any \nresolution of disapproval which passes the Senate before receipt from \nthe House of a similar or identical joint resolution is required to be \nheld at the desk until the House acts and passes such a joint \nresolution. H.J. Res. 57, the companion resolution to S.J. Res. 27, was \nintroduced in the House on June 7, 1999, and referred to the Committee \non Ways and Means. On July 1, the committee considered the resolution, \nand ordered it to be reported adversely by voice vote. The full House \nhas yet to act on that report. So even if for some reason which escapes \nme the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] can justify his urgent \ndesire to bring his legislation to the floor, where is the logic in \nputting the procedural cart before the horse and acting before the \nHouse does?\n  Those are my procedural objections to the motion. But I also oppose \nthe resolution, and thus the motion to discharge it, on substantive \ngrounds. In my five years as subcommittee chairman, I have always fully \nsupported unconditional NTR status for China and done so for several \nreasons: some practical, some policy-based.\n  First, from a practicality standpoint, I firmly believe revoking NTR \nwould hurt us more than the Chinese--the economic equivalent of cutting \noff your nose to spite your face, or, as the Chinese say, ``lifting up \na rock only to drop it on your foot.'' In 1998, U.S. exports to China \ndirectly supported over 200,000 U.S. jobs. In 1995, China bought $1.2 \nbillion worth of civilian aircraft, $700 million of telecommunications \nequipment, $330 million of specialized machinery, and $270 million of \nheating and cooling equipment. Those figures have grown since then.\n  China is now the world's third largest economy, and will continue to \ngrow at an impressive pace well into the next century. The World Bank \nestimates that China will need almost $750 billion in new investments \nto fund industrial infrastructure projects alone in the next decade. \nCutting off NTR--and the Chinese retaliation that would surely follow--\nwould only serve to deprive us of a growing market. China is perfectly \ncapable of shopping elsewhere and our ``allies'' are more than happy to \nstep into any void we leave. We recently saw a prime example of that \nwillingness; in 1996 then-Premier Li Peng traveled to France where he \nsigned a $2 billion contract to buy 33 Airbuses--a contract that Boeing \nthought it was going to get.\n\n  Second, instead of using the NTR issue as a carrot-and-stick with the \nPRC, I believe the best way to influence the growth of democratic \nideals, human rights, and the rule of law in that country is through \ncontinued economic contacts. I think anybody who has been to China, \nespecially over the course of the last 15 years, has seen that for \nthemselves. One of the strongest impressions that I take away from \nevery trip I make to China in my capacity as subcommittee chairman is \nthe dramatic effect that economic reform has had on the population. As \nyou\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\ntravel south from Beijing to Guangzhou where the greatest economic \ndevelopment has taken place, it is clear that economic development and \ncontact with the West through trade has let a genie out of the bottle \nthat the regime in Beijing will never be able to put back.\n  Local government officials do not want to talk about the Taiwan \ndispute; they want to talk trade. Local businessmen do not want to talk \nabout political ideology; that want to talk about increasing their \nprofits and establishing a legal framework in China within which to do \nbusiness. Local citizens do not care about the latest pronouncements \nfrom the Central Committee; they care about increasing their incomes \nand bettering their living conditions. People of the hundreds of \nthousands of villages where local democratic elections have been held \nhave made it clear they would not quietly return to the old way of \ndoing things.\n  The development of a market economy is the best way to encourage \ndemocratic reform. We have seen it in South Korea, we have seen it in \nTaiwan, we have seen it in the former Soviet Union, and I believe that \nwe are beginning to see it now in China.\n  Third, revoking NTR would have a damaging effect on the economies of \nHong Kong and Taiwan--two of our closest friends in the region. A vast \nmajority of our China trade passes through Hong Kong and Taiwan; in \naddition, revoking NTR would have the greatest impact in the southern \nChina provinces of Guangdong and Fujian where Hong Kong and Taiwanese \nbusinessmen have made substantial investments. Just for the limited \nsanctions and countersanctions proposed during our dispute over Chinese \ninfringement of our intellectual property rights in 1996, the Hong Kong \ngovernment estimated that Hong Kong would loose 11,500 jobs, $13.4 \nbillion in reexport trade, and 0.4 of a percentage point from a 4.6% \nGDP. The effects would be much more pronounced were NTR to be involved.\n  Fourth, NTR is not some special treatment or favor that the United \nStates passes out rarely; it is the normal tariff status with our \ntrading partners. Only 8 countries are not accorded that status: \nAfghanistan, Zerbaijan, Cambodia, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Vietnam, and \nSerbia. To cast China into that grouping of pariah states would do \nirreparable damage to our bilateral relationship, and to the security \nand stability of East Asia as a whole.\n  With the demise of the cold war, and changing world realities, we \nwould do better to repeal Jackson-Vanik and the yearly theater that \nsurrounds the China NTR debate. It only serves: to make U.S. businesses \nnervous--they never know from one year to the next whether they will \nhave NTR, and their investments in China, yanked out from underneath \nthem; to complicate our relationship with the Chinese--the annual \ndebate always reminds them that we treat them differently than almost \nevery other country and some of the ensuing rhetoric in the debates is \nless than helpful to the relationship; and, to compromise our \ncredibility both with the Chinese and in Asia in general--threats to \nrevoke NTR have yet to be carried out and conditioning has never \nworked.\n  I am not an apologist for the PRC--far from it. My subcommittee has \nheld numerous hearings highlighting Chinese human rights abuses, \noppression in Tibet, saber rattling aimed at Taiwan, unfair trade \npractices including tariff and non-tariff barriers, and the recent \nallegations of espionage--all issues I have raised personally with \nChinese leaders from President Jiang on down. But no matter how \nmaddening or ill-advised Beijing's behavior, I do not believe that \nwithholding NTR is an effective instrument of foreign policy vis-a-vis \nChina. In fact, I believe that there is no more effective way to \ninfluence the PRC than engaging China and slowly drawing it into the \nfamily of nations. If there is a way, I have yet to be made aware of \nit; I just know that the revocation or conditioning of NTR is not it.\n  For all these reasons then, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \noppose the motion to discharge S. J. Res. 27.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to my very good friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from the State of Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \nopposition to the Smith resolution on normal trade relations for China. \nOnce again, the Senator is confronted with an effort to circumvent the \nlegislative process and radically change U.S. policy towards China. I \noppose this effort. But I also caution my Senate colleagues, that the \napproach advocated here today is very dangerous to U.S. foreign policy.\n  United States-China relations are at a very delicate stage now. The \nrelationship is very troubled at the moment. The accidental U.S. \nbombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and accusations of Chinese \nnuclear espionage have given policymakers in both countries numerous \nreasons to be cautious about this important relationship.\n  Today's debate will be a brief one. With my time, I want to make a \ncouple of points to articulate why we must once again defeat the effort \nto deny NTR or MFN status to China.\n  First, trade is the foundation of the United States-China \nrelationship. Certainly, there are problems on the trade front. We have \na troubling deficit, problems with issues like transshipment and \nintellectual property rights violations, and market access issues--to \nname just a few. Many of these issues are under consideration in the \ntalks led by the United States over China's accession to the World \nTrade Organization. I continue to support China's accession to the WTO \non commercially viable terms. I think we are very close to a WTO \nagreement that will be strongly supported by the Congress.\n  Yes, trade with China is very important. But, perhaps more important, \nis the fact that trade has opened China's doors to the world. Our \ngovernment is able to engage China on a number of issues from drug \nsmuggling to cooperation on issues like human rights, North Korea, \nnuclear expansion in South Asia, and global environmental problems. \nLike it or not, if we end our trade relationship with China as some \nsuggest, all of these beneficial openings to China will be curtailed or \nlost.\n  It is not just government-to-government contacts that we should be \nworried about. My personal opinion is the American people are having a \nfar greater impact on the Chinese people than any congressional debate \ncould ever have. Students and scholars, adoptive parents, business and \ntourist delegations, sister city delegations, and local government \nofficials from my state are actively engaged in China. These folks are \nmaking a difference that benefits both the American and Chinese people. \nI do not want to see these people-driven initiatives for change \njeopardized by passage of this resolution.\n  One in five people in Earth live in China. It is an immense \npopulation that impacts Us all in so many ways--the world's food \nsupply, pollution problems, and the use of natural resources, to name a \nfew. The United States has the ability to cooperatively assist in \nChina's development; we must not shy from this opportunity to aid both \nthe Chinese and American people.\n\n  My second point addresses reform in China. Within China today a \nfurious debate is raging. Leaders like President Jiang Zemin and \nPremier Zhu Rhongi are under attack by more conservative anti-Western \nforces. The Embassy bombing and other issues have emboldened the hard \nline forces within China's leadership. There are elements within the \nChinese Government that do not want to move forward with constructive \nties with the United States.\n  The resolution before the Senate today, in my estimation, sends a \nvery dangerous message to China. The message is the United States is \nrecoiling towards a more confrontational posture towards China. Passage \nof this resolution will strengthen those in China who argue that China \nshould treat the United States as an adversary. If that happens, the \nrelationship will certainly spiral in dangerous directions for both the \nChinese and American people.\n  If we undermine the reform forces in China, it will have dangerous \nimplications for this country. At the United\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\nNations, where China is a permanent member of the Security Council, the \nUnited States will have a very difficult time as the world's lone \nsuperpower. In Asia, where economic recovery is beginning to take place \nand where we have 100,000 military personnel, our efforts to preserve \ndecades of peace will be jeopardized. And, the United States will be \nalone in the world in seeking to isolate China economically, \npotentially causing problems with our allies in Europe and Asia.\n  Though I strongly oppose this resolution, I do not mean to imply that \nthe China relationship is easy or that the United States should make \nconcessions to the Chinese. That is simply not the case. The United \nStates-China relationship is very difficult for this country and will \nbe so for some time. I have many objections to Chinese actions. But, I \nbelieve, to change China, we must be an aggressive participant in the \nglobal effort to engage the Chinese Government and the Chinese people.\n  This resolution before us today would seriously threaten our ability \nto contribute to change in China. And that is clearly not in our \nnational interest. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Smith resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 55 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I cannot let go \nunchallenged on the floor the accusation that I am circumventing the \nlegislative process. I think my colleagues know that is not true. This \nis the act, the Trade Act of 1974. I have it in my hand. I would \nencourage my colleague to read it before making accusations that are \nsimply false.\n\n       In the committee of either House to which a resolution has \n     been referred, that has not been reported at the end of 30 \n     days after its introduction, and counting any day which is \n     excluded under section 154(b) it is in order to move either \n     to discharge the committee from further consideration of the \n     resolution or to discharge the committee from further \n     consideration of any other resolution associated with this.\n\n  The bottom line is, this went to the committee on June 3. It has \nremained there to this day. More than 30 days have passed. The bottom \nline is, which is perfectly legitimate under the rule, the Finance \nCommittee does not have to discharge it. If they do not discharge it, \nwhat happens is China gets its NTR status, and Jackson-Vanik is waived.\n  So I am exercising my right in doing what I am doing. And for \ncolleagues to come down here and say I am circumventing the legislative \nprocess simply is not true. I would like to go back and see how some of \nmy colleagues voted on some of these matters.\n  I have heard on the floor that it is inappropriate to debate this \nissue; it is inappropriate to talk about it. ``Take morning business \nand come down here,'' or ``speak at midnight when nobody is watching.''\n  There is a process here. It is written in the law that the Senate has \nan hour on the motion to determine whether or not to discharge, and \nthen if we pass these motions I am offering on China and Vietnam, we \nhave the opportunity to debate this.\n  So I am hearing that it is inappropriate for the Senate to debate \nsomething provided under the law. Why in the world is it inappropriate \nto debate anything on the floor? If you want to know what is wrong with \nthis place, this is a pretty good example. ``It is inappropriate to \ndebate what's going on in China and Vietnam on the Senate floor.''\n  Let me tell you what is inappropriate. With all due respect, what is \ninappropriate is the fact that the Communist Chinese are threatening \nTaiwan with missiles. What is inappropriate is what the Chinese \nCommunist Government did to the people of Tibet. What is inappropriate \nis the fact that the Chinese Government put hundreds of thousands, \nmaybe millions of dollars into U.S. elections. What is inappropriate is \nthat they have tried to take over the Long Beach shipyard. What is \ninappropriate is that the Chinese have gobbled up the port leases on \nboth sides of the Panama Canal. What is inappropriate is population \ncontrol. What is inappropriate is forced sterilization. What is \ninappropriate is killing unborn children, female children. That is what \nis inappropriate. What is also inappropriate is trying to run over \npeaceful protesters with tanks in Tiananmen Square.\n  So do not tell me it is inappropriate to debate something on the \nfloor. It is an outrage that this Senate will not approve this motion \nand allow the opportunity to do that.\n  Let me come to the floor and debate these issues. They do not want me \nto come to the floor, I say to the American people. That is why my \nresolutions are going to go down, because they do not want to hear \nabout it, because the administration has made a decision to grant most-\nfavored-nation status, normal trade relations--a decision to look the \nother way while China does these appalling things.\n\n  I say, with all due respect--I said it earlier, and I will say it \nagain--this President went to war and put American forces in harm's way \nto protect the human rights of the Albanians in Kosovo. And I can't get \na resolution passed to debate human rights violations in China or \nVietnam. What does that tell you? Is this America? Do you want to know \nwhat is wrong with politics? This is what is wrong with politics.\n  In China, they can do what they want. China is a sovereign nation. I \nguess, under the Clinton policy, we may be bombing them tomorrow. I do \nnot know if it is human rights violations. Apparently, we cannot talk \nabout them in the Senate. However, let me read you a little bit about \nwhat goes on in China from the 1998 State Department Human Rights \nReport.\n  Disciplinary measures against those who violate policies can include \nfines (sometimes a ``fee for an unplanned birth'' or a ``social \ncompensation fee''), withholding of social services, demotion, and \nother administrative punishments . . . intense pressure to meet family \nplanning targets set by the Government has resulted in documented \ninstances where family planning officials have used coercion, including \nforced abortion and sterilization, to meet government goals. During an \nunauthorized pregnancy, a woman often is paid multiple visits by family \nplanning workers and pressured to terminate the pregnancy.\n  It goes on and on and on.\n  Are we going to give most-favored-nation status to this country? This \nis the issue. We are going to give it to them without giving me and \nother Senators in this body the opportunity to debate it on the floor? \nWelcome to America, for goodness sakes.\n  I thought the Senate was the greatest deliberative body in the world \nwhere all of the great debates took place. I am standing at Daniel \nWebster's desk. He would probably turn over in his grave if he heard \nthat we would refuse to debate something as important as this. Daniel \nWebster stood on this floor, the strong advocate, year after year, \nagainst the outrage of slavery--and we cannot talk about China and \nVietnam because my colleagues will not allow me to bring these \nresolutions out.\n  It is outrageous. I just do not understand it. It is exactly \neverything that is bad and wrong and outrageous about politics and \nabout the process around here. I am sick of it. It is wrong.\n  Yes, bringing these motions is within the rules. Somebody put it in \nthere. But for goodness sakes, what is fair is fair. It is not a \nquestion of me coming to the floor and saying: Well, nothing is \nhappening in China; I'm just going to come down on the floor and create \nsome problems here and tell you about things I made up, or I'm going to \nsay nothing is going on in Vietnam.\n  I am not making this up. Right today, in the Washington Times:\n\n       Chinese companies transferred missile components to North \n     Korea last month in a sign Beijing is stepping up arms sales \n     in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in \n     Belgrade. ``We are concerned about Chinese entities providing \n     material for North Korea's missile program,'' a senior \n     administration official told the Times. ``In our judgment, \n     the Chinese government has no interest in seeing North Korea \n     develop its missile technology.'' The Pentagon believes that \n     some of the missile technology contains material of U.S.-\n     origin, and that the transfers violate Chinese promises not \n     to ignore international missile export controls barring such \n     sales to rogue states, said U.S. intelligence officials.\n\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\n\n  Apparently we are not upset enough, are we? We are going to give them \nnormal trade relations and look the other way. You steal our secrets; \nyou abort your children; you forcibly abort female children; you saber \nrattle in Taiwan; you threaten to run over peaceful demonstrators with \ntanks. A priest was murdered a couple of months ago on the streets of \nBeijing. You give contributions to one of the major political parties \nin America, and we are going to look the other way.\n\n  We are not even going to debate it. I say to the people out there in \nAmerica: Watch the vote. You will see it. One right after another, they \nwill come down here and Smith will lose on Vietnam and Smith will lose \non China. And the American people will lose the opportunity to debate \nit.\n  I cannot do this in 30 minutes. I would like to go into some of these \nmatters in detail, but I do not have the time. That is the rule. I have \n30 minutes, an hour equally divided. That is it.\n  So I just say to my colleagues, give me the opportunity to debate \nthese matters on the floor so I can point out to you the human rights \nabuses and the flagrant violations of both of these countries. Vietnam \ndoes not deserve the Jackson-Vanik waiver and China does not deserve to \nbe given normal trade relations.\n  Mr. President, I see my time has expired. I yield back the last \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my friend, the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I point out to my friend from New Hampshire that he did, indeed, have \nthe floor. The parliamentary process seems to be working. He has \nmentioned those aspects on which he disagrees with China five or six \ntimes apiece now since I have been on the floor in only the last 10 \nminutes. I don't think he should be that concerned about not being able \nto debate.\n\n  There were those of us on the other side of the aisle who were trying \nto debate something called the Patients' Bill of Rights for several \nweeks, and we were denied that. Well, this is a tough body. One does \nthe best they can.\n  I think terminating normal trade relations with China would be an \nenormous mistake. I have often said one of the greatest speeches I have \never heard on the floor was given by Senator Jack Danforth. It was the \nlast one he ever gave on the floor. It was a number of years ago when \nhe retired. He talked about the fact that every Senator wants to be a \nSecretary of State, and every Senator thinks that he or she is a \nSecretary of State. Every Senator thinks that he or she ought to act as \nSecretary of State, and that about half of us try to. There is an \nendless opportunity because you can bring up other countries and bring \nup all the things you don't like about them.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire doesn't approve of different of their \nsocial policies, so he brings them up. He has a chance to speak about \nthem. None of this, in my judgment, has to do with the self-interest of \nthe United States of America. What is foreign policy? What is trade \npolicy? It is meant to be the self-interest of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The Senator, as he concluded his argument, actually said that China \nwas taking over, implying that they had taken over the Panama Canal. \nThat came as a surprise to me because I read the news fairly diligently \nand haven't heard that. What I do know is this: China has been through \n5,000 years of history, and I have studied it quite carefully. They \nhave never had a single day of stability that they could count on. In \nfact, even under Confucian philosophy, the people always have, in the \nso-called five relationships, the right to overthrow the emperor any \ntime they want, and they frequently have.\n  They are, as the Senator from Washington indicated, one-fifth of the \nworld's population. They are an absolute key. The very worst thing I \ncan imagine us doing at this time would be to terminate normal trade \nrelations.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire, as he says, believes that the \nChinese are not treating the Taiwanese well, if you want the Taiwanese-\nChinese relationship, the PRC-Taiwanese relationship, it is not a zero-\nsum game. The best relationship between the PRC and Taiwan is always \ngoing to be under those conditions wherein the United States and the \nPRC have the most normal, natural, and efficient relationship. That \nmeans we will disagree on many things, but we will also do a number of \nthings, which we have been doing for years: For example, trading, \nexchanging students, learning more about each other. Americans have \nalways had a kind of love/hate relationship with China. It is part of \nthe mysticism, the mystery of our intangible history of the past \ncenturies with them.\n  We have never really understood China very well. We don't understand \nChina very well today. But one thing I know, if we terminate normal \ntrade relations, it is going to give the upper hand to the very people \nin the People's Liberation Army, some of the younger turks there who \nare the people that, in fact, in 1996 led the move to point missiles at \nTaiwan and who are probably right now doing everything they can to \ndestabilize Zhu Rhongi and President Jiang Xemin, who are trying to \nreform China, to stabilize China, to deregulate China, to make China \ninto a more modern economy with, all the time, 120 or 140 million \npeople that are completely homeless wandering around the country.\n  I strongly advise my colleagues to vote against what is quite an \noutrageous resolution, which has no place whatsoever on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I also rise to urge my colleagues to \nvote against the motion to discharge the Committee on Finance from \nfurther consideration of the resolution disapproving the extension of \nthe Jackson-Vanik waiver authority for normal trade relations with \nChina.\n  Beyond the procedural problems my colleagues outlined regarding \ntaking up this measure today, there are clear and crucial reasons to \noppose this motion because the underlying disapproval resolution should \nalso be opposed on its merits.\n  Let me state that I agree with my colleague on the goals he seeks to \nachieve by pursuing this motion, but I disagree with his methods.\n  I too am concerned about the recent espionage reports and the \nimplications for our national security.\n  I too am concerned about China's destabilizing weapons sales.\n  I too want China to resolve peacefully her territorial disagreements \nin the South China Sea.\n  I too want China to lower barriers to U.S. exports and to reduce her \ntrade surplus with the United States.\n  I too want China to end her military threats against Taiwan and to \nresolve peacefully her differences with Taipei.\n  And I too want China to respect the basic human rights of its \ncitizens.\n  But I do not believe that withdrawing normal trade relations status \nwill force China to satisfy any of our objectives. Indeed, sanctioning \nChina by withdrawing NTR runs the risk of making that country more \nbelligerent and less cooperative on these and other issues.\n  Moreover, revoking NTR would be contrary to American interests and \nthe interests of the American people.\n  Experience shows that unilateral trade sanctions generally don't \nwork. The chances of success only improve when sanctions are applied in \ncooperation with our major allies. However, not one of these allies is \neven debating whether to withdraw NTR status from China.\n  Let's be clear on this point. If we revoke NTR status for China, \nBeijing would certainly be hurt, but so too would the United States.\n  As a result of withdrawing NTR, U.S. duties on goods imported from \nChina would immediately rise to the tariff rates established under the \nhighly protectionist, depression-era Smoot-Hawley tariff law.\n  Because NTR is provided on a reciprocal basis, China would respond to \nhigher tariffs on her goods by slapping higher tariffs on U.S. goods. \nSuch a move will slam the door shut on U.S. exports to the Chinese \nmarket--the fastest-growing market in the world for the highly \ncompetitive American aircraft, telecommunications, and automotive \nequipment industries.\n  These export opportunities will go instead to the Europeans, the \nJapanese,\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nthe Canadians and firms from all the other countries in the world which \ncontinue normal commercial relations with China.\n  In addition to severely damaging U.S. exporters, the small and large \nAmerican firms that have invested billions of dollars to penetrate the \nChinese market would see their efforts and investments jeopardized.\n  The economic fallout from withdrawing China's NTR status is not only \ngoing to hit American companies, but also American consumers. Our \nlowest income citizens, in particular, would suffer from the \ndramatically higher prices they will have to pay for a variety of basic \ngoods as a direct result of the imposition of substantially higher \nduties on Chinese imports.\n  There are those who claim that pricing Chinese goods out of our \nmarket through higher duties would be beneficial because the products \nwe now import from China would be produced in the United States. But \nany business person will tell you the truth is that in almost all cases \nimports from China will be replaced not by American products but rather \nimports from other developing countries.\n  We must also recognize that cutting ourselves off from China by \nwithdrawing NTR will severely limit our ability influence developments \nin China, including how China treat its citizens and whether it permits \nthe development of a freer society.\n  Mr. President, it is also important to recognize that the United \nStates already has specific, measured and targeted tools at our \ndisposal that allow us to address problems with China without resorting \nto the indiscriminate and destructive approach of revoking NTR.\n  For example, we can adopt the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to \nreorganize the Department of Energy to prevent further losses at our \nnational weapons laboratories.\n  We can involve targeted Section 301 sanctions for discrete \ndiscriminatory and unreasonable Chinese trade practices.\n  We can continue to expose and condemn China's repressive human rights \nrecord in this Chamber and in organizations around the world.\n  We can counter China's threats to Taiwan by considering sales of \nupgraded defensive weaponry to Taipei, as well as by reaffirming our \nunwavering commitment to a peaceful resolution of the dispute between \nTaiwan and China in the context of our one China policy.\n  We can rely on international law and the shared interests of the \ncountries of Southeast Asia to counter aggressive Chinese territorial \nclaims.\n  I want to note here, moreover, that neither the Taiwanese--who are \nnever shy about voicing their opinions to Members of Congress--nor the \ncountries of ASEAN which have territorial disputes with China, support \nthe United States revoking NTR for China.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that revoking NTR would not \nadvance the goals for China which I share with my colleague, and will \nlikely worsen our problems with China. And it would put at risk \nhundreds of thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars worth of \nAmerican exports and investments.\n  With so much to lose and nothing gained, I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this motion.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nmotion to discharge the Finance Committee from further consideration of \nS.J. Res. 28. I oppose the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire \nbecause I believe passage of S.J. Res. 28 would be a step backward and \nwould jeopardize our efforts to encourage political and economic change \nin Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I am confident my colleagues on both sides of this \ndebate share the same goal: helping to create a democratic Vietnam. We \nall want to see a Vietnam that respects the rights of all of its \ncitizens. A Vietnam whose society is based on the rule of law. A \nVietnam that protects private enterprise and abides by international \ncommercial standards. A Vietnam that cooperates with the United States \nin seeking to end the pain and the lingering questions of the thousands \nof American POW/MIA families.\n  While we share the same goal, we fundamentally disagree on how best \nto achieve a democratic Vietnam. Those who support S.J. Res. 28 believe \nwe are more likely to promote democratic reforms and the human rights \nof the Vietnamese people by discontinuing our dialogue with the \nGovernment of Vietnam. They believe we can encourage the transition to \nfree market economics by putting U.S. businesses in Vietnam at a \ndisadvantage relative to their global competitors and making it more \ndifficult for them to operate. Finally, they believe we can improve \nVietnamese cooperation in solving outstanding POW/MIA cases by \njeopardizing successful, joint investigative and recovery programs.\n  Proponents of this legislation will argue passage of S.J. Res. 28 \nwould only have the minimal effect of denying the President's waiver of \nthe provisions of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The truth is, this vote \nis a referendum on our entire policy of engaging Vietnam. Those who \nsupport this Resolution have opposed every effort to normalize U.S.-\nVietnamese relations. With this Resolution, they are trying to take us \nback to the policy of the 1980s that sought to isolate Vietnam from the \nUnited States both diplomatically and economically. This policy failed \nin the 1980s, and will undoubtedly fail again.\n  Mr. President, proof of the failure of disengagement is found in the \nfact that since renewing our diplomatic relations with Vietnam we have \nseen progress on the issues we care about. I attribute most of this \nimprovement on the ability of our government to communicate with \nVietnam through normal, diplomatic channels. This progress will \ncontinue if we allow people like Ambassador Pete Peterson to continue \nto impress upon the Government of Vietnam the seriousness with which we \nattach to issues such as democratization, human rights, and POW/MIAs. \nPassage of this Resolution will undermine Ambassador Peterson's \nefforts, will force us to step back from our policy of engagement, and \nwill endanger the progress we have already achieved.\n\n  This is not to say that we do not continue to have issues with which \nwe disagree with the Vietnamese government. Economic and social reforms \nare not progressing quickly enough. We continue to hear of cases where \nthe rights of political dissidents are not respected. And until every \nPOW/MIA is accounted for, we will continue to press the Vietnamese \ngovernment for answers. However, the authors of S.J. Res. 28--those who \noppose continued normalization of our relations with Vietnam--have \nfailed to explain how disengaging from Vietnam will encourage their \ngovernment to take positive action on any of these issues.\n  Mr. President, those who prefer isolation simply fail to fully \nunderstand the power of the United States to act as a catalyst for \nsocietal and economic change. We cannot be this catalyst for the \nVietnamese people if we are not fully engaged in Vietnam. I would argue \nwe need to be more engaged than we are today. Where we disagree with \nVietnamese government, we should forcefully challenge them. And where \nwe see the budding signs of reform, we should foster its growth. We \ncannot do this if--as those on the other side propose--we do not \ncontinue to move forward in our relationship with Vietnam.\n  Passage of S.J. Res. 28 is a step backward. Rather than going back, I \nbelieve we should look forward. We should look for ways to fully \nunleash the power of our people, our ideals, and our system of \ngovernment to help the Vietnamese achieve the goal of democracy. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 28.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I believe we have worked out some consent \nagreements now that will allow the Senate to go forward in a \nconstructive way. One has to do with the campaign finance reform issue, \nand the other one has to do with how we will handle the intelligence \nauthorization bill this afternoon.\n  I see Senator McCain here. I know Senator Feingold is here.\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, but no \nlater than Tuesday, October 12, 1999, the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of a bill to be introduced by Senators McCain \nand Feingold regarding campaign reform, and that the bill be introduced \nand placed on the calendar by the close of business on Wednesday, \nSeptember 14, 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that debate on the bill prior to a cloture \nvote be limited to 3 hours to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that only amendments related to campaign \nreform be in order, with time on all amendments, first and second \ndegree, to be limited to 4 hours each, equally divided in the usual \nform, and that if an amendment is not tabled, it be in order to lay \naside such amendment for 2 calendar days.\n  I further ask consent that no sooner than the third day after the \nbill is brought to the floor, a cloture motion be filed on the McCain-\nFeingold bill, and if cloture is not invoked, the bill immediately be \nplaced back on the calendar.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order at any time \nprior to the pendency, or during the remainder of the first session of \nthe 106th Congress, for the Senate to consider issues relative to \ncampaign reform, except as the issues pertain to the appointment of \nconferees and any conference report to accompany the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I yield to \nthe Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, I haven't quite \nfinished reviewing this. If the majority leader will give me about 2 \nminutes, I think I will be ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there other reservations of objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask, does \nthis mean that the majority leader will not fill up the tree with \nfirst- and second-degree amendments? In other words, the intent is to \nmove forward with the amending process, up-or-down votes on the \namendments and move forward? That is the intent of the majority leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. The intent is to have amendments and that they be voted on, \non this bill.\n  My purpose in trying to get this worked out is so we can go ahead and \ncomplete our appropriations bills process but also recognizing the \nSenator's desire to have this issue considered, finding a time which \nwas most satisfactory to all involved on both sides of the aisle to \nhave it considered. And it is our intent to have ample time for debate \nand for amendments to be offered and voted on.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  This is a time now where we will be able to have a legitimate \namending process. Amendments to perfect the legislation will be placed \non the calendar by the close of business on September 14 so that we can \nimprove or not improve. However, the legislative process will move \nforward, as we normally do on pieces of legislation before the body, \nwith the exception, of course, that respecting the fact that the Senate \ndoes act with 60 votes to cut off debate, if Senator Feingold and I \nfail to get 60 votes, then there is no sense in prolonging the debate \nor the discussion, including that we would not raise the issue again \nduring the 106th Congress. We would have debates and amendments and \nvotes on those amendments.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Ordinarily, the way we do these unanimous consent \nagreements, I would have required the bill to be filed immediately \nafter this unanimous consent agreement. But as the Senator indicated, \nthat is over 2 months away\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\nand changes might be necessary. But I think it is also important for \nthose who might not agree with the content of this bill to have ample \ntime to see what the bill is going to be and to prepare amendments on \nthe other side. I thought the September 14 day was a reasonable time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the majority leader will agree, for the remainder of \nthe first session, we would not bring it up.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly hope not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not object. I ask the majority \nleader if he will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say to the Senator from Arizona and the \nmajority leader that I think this is a fair compromise. It would give \nthe Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, as well as \nothers who historically have been on the other side of this issue, an \nopportunity to offer amendments. It also will give us an opportunity, \nas the Senator from Arizona has indicated, to know what bill will be \ncalled up for debate on September 14. So I think this is a reasonable \nway to dispose of this issue that is fair to everyone, and it gives us \nan opportunity to proceed with the Senate's much more important \nbusiness between now and the August recess.\n  I thank the majority leader for his good work on this, and I look \nforward to the debate later this year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank \nthe majority leader for his cooperation on this. I will ask a brief \nquestion. I want it to be absolutely clear in the record that the \nagreement as it reads involves a limitation with regard to the first \nsession of the 106th Congress, but that we are not precluded in any way \nfrom raising this issue again in the second session of the 106th \nCongress.\n  Mr. LOTT. You are not. I am sure you would prefer to have this matter \nconcluded in the first session.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, absolutely, and there are other things on which I \nwould like to be working.\n  That is a good lead-in for my comments on this issue. Again, I thank \nthe majority leader and the Senator from Kentucky for their remarks. I \nespecially thank the Senator from Arizona for his tremendous \npersistence on this issue and especially in working out this agreement \nin the middle of a very busy legislative schedule that I know we have \nfor the rest of the year.\n  This agreement involves a debate to come up by October 12. It is \nlater than I would have wanted. I understand we have had a few other \nthings going on, including an impeachment trial, the war in Kosovo, and \nso on, but it is essential that this matter be seriously considered. I \nhope it is resolved and that we pass legislation before the end of this \nyear. In any event, we have to bring it up.\n  The word ``amendments'' is critical in this agreement. We have to \nhave a real amending process. We have not had that yet on campaign \nfinance reform. At no point, since I have been working on the McCain-\nFeingold bill, have we ever had a time when Senators could offer their \namendments about what they care about. Somehow, the process has always \nbeen truncated, and you can blame either side. Obviously, I have my \nview of it. But to me this agreement means that we will not again have \na one-cloture-vote-and-we-are-done process. We are going to have real \namendments, real debate, and a real discussion. If that transpires, I \nhave a feeling we will have an outcome that, in my view, can lead to 60 \nor 70 votes, something on which Members on both sides can agree. That \nis my goal, and I think that is the goal of my colleague from Arizona.\n\n  I think it is very important to stay in touch with what happened in \nthe other body. They have passed this legislation. A majority of \nMembers of both Houses of the Congress are for this, and the President \nis ready to sign it.\n  I think it is important to make those points. Although it has its \nlimitations, this can be the beginning of truly reaching some kind of \nan agreement in this House to do something about the incredible \nexplosion of soft money that has tainted our democracy.\n  So, again, I thank the majority leader, and I am looking forward to \nthis process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to \nsay to my friends, you are terrific on this issue, and I appreciate \nwhat you have done. We got word from Senator Levin that he wants to see \nthis agreement. He has asked if we would object at this point. He \nhasn't yet seen it. So I will be asking that this be put aside, or I \nwill have to object on his behalf until he sees this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am so grateful to the majority leader. \nThis morning there was, I thought, a very good presentation by several \ncolleagues concerning S. 25, the Murkowski-Landrieu bill. This \nlegislation, which is supported by a number of my colleagues, is called \nthe Conservation and Reinvestment Act.\n  I want to say that is a wonderful title because it implies that we \nare going to conserve something and that we are going to reinvest money \nto make our environment better.\n  It is very tempting when you first look at the bill to say this is an \nexcellent bill. But as you get into the bill, and as you listen to the \nremarks of my colleagues who are for it, you basically realize that it \ndoes basically one thing and one thing only; that is, it encourages \nmore offshore oil drilling on Federal lands because it makes the \nrevenues States receive dependent upon how much offshore oil drilling \nthey engage in off their coast.\n  What it means for States such as California that protect its \ncoastline by restricting offshore oil drilling, is that there will be \nless funding for conservation, and States that encourage offshore oil \ndrilling, which I believe despoils the environment, will be rewarded by \nfar more funds. States that have absolutely no offshore drilling and \nthose that are landlocked also do not benefit from this bill.\n  While purporting to simply provide guaranteed funding for the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, S. 25 distorts the fundamental principle \nbehind the establishment of the Act.\n  The original idea behind it is to purchase beautiful lands for future \ngenerations.\n  When I ask colleagues if, in fact, S. 25 encourages offshore oil \ndrilling--they say, no; we don't. But yet if you listened to Senator \nMurkowski's comments on the floor today, you will hear something \ndifferent. This is what he said about the bill, S. 25:\n\n       In order to have a successful Conservation and Reinvestment \n     act, we've got to have a continuation of OCS revenues \n     occurring off the shores of some of our States.''\n\n  He went on to say:\n  Support for this legislation is related, to some extent, by those \nStates that see an opportunity to generate a source of revenue.\n  And continued to say:\n\n       In order for it to be successful, we have to have and \n     encourage offshore revenue sharing.\n\n  Clearly, what Senator Murkowski is saying about S. 25 is the truth. \nThat is, if a State wants to receive more funds, they should allow and \npromote more offshore oil drilling off their coasts.\n  I come from a State that treasures its coastline and knows that the \nimpact of offshore oil drilling is devastating. I don't think we should \nbe punished because we stand strong in our State in a very bipartisan \nway, to say we don't want this impact.\n  I don't believe S. 25 is a conservation bill. I believe the principal \ngoal is to encourage more offshore oil drilling, and thereby bring \nabout more destruction to the environment--not less destruction.\n  States that have active drilling programs will be the primary \nbenefactors. There is no question about it. Alaska, Texas, and \nLouisiana get 50 percent of the money while the entire Nation will lose \nas we deplete a beautiful federal publicly-owned natural resource; \nnamely, our ocean.\n  This doesn't seem fair. This is a national resources owned by the \nAmerican people. As such revenue from this resource must be shared \nthroughout our nation.\n  States that are protecting their resource and don't have offshore oil \ndrilling, as well as States that are landlocked, will lose under S. 25.\n\n  I introduced a bill that really does fulfill our commitment to the \npreservation of our natural resources. Congressman George Miller \nintroduced the companion bill in the House. The bill we introduced, the \nResources 2000 Act, has a number of fine cosponsors. In fact, 37 states \nwould benefit more from the funding distribution under Resources 2000 \nthan in S. 25.\n  I hope colleagues will look at the Resources 2000 bill, which has the \nsupport of over 200 environmental organizations.\n  Those on my bill include Senators Dianne Feinstein, Paul Sarbanes, \nChuck Schumer, Frank Lautenberg, Paul Wellstone, Ted Kennedy, Joe \nBiden, Barbara Mikulski, Bob Torricelli, and John Kerry. We have more \ncoming.\n  We have a national resource--our oceans. We destroy that resource \nwhen we drill for oil.\n  Frankly, the amount of oil that is there isn't worth all the \ndestruction that follows. However, if a State wants to do this, that is \ntheir option.\n  But I don't think they should get rewarded more because they do not \nmind destroying their coast. States that care about their coast and \nprotect and defend it with laws and coastal zone management plans are \npenalized under S. 25.\n  In 1965, Congress established the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \nCongress decided that as we deplete one of our nation's natural non-\nresources, we should invest that money into protecting and preserving \nour nation's renewable resources. The Act required that we take the \nrevenue from offshore oil drilling and put that money into purchasing \ncritical lands.\n  They take the money and they repair. They repair, and they buy \nbeautiful tracts of land to save it in perpetuity. Part of that money \nis supposed to be for historic preservation, which we haven't fully \nfunded either.\n  S. 25 flies in the face of the principal purpose of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. Money distributed through S. 25 does not have \nto go for environmental purposes. S. 25 says to the States: You don't \nhave to use the funds you are getting for the environment. In fact, \nmoney could be used to fund environmentally destructive activities, \nsuch as road building.\n  Many of my colleagues have stated that revenue generated from the \nOuter Continental Shelf should be treated similar to revenue from on-\nshore drilling. Lets be clear: the OCS land is unique. It is federal \nland, and federal land only. It is not within the boundaries of any \nstate, unlike on-shore areas.\n  I think any expansion of the uses of OCS revenue should stick to the \nframework of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act that Congress in \nits wisdom passed in 1964. And we must uphold that original commitment \nby fully funding the trust fund. That is what we ought to do--fully \nfund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, on the State side as well as \nthe Federal side, and fully fund the historic preservation fund.\n  Many of us in our beautiful States, whether it is Mississippi, \nCalifornia, or anywhere in this country, have beautiful old buildings \nthat are falling apart, and we don't have the funds to preserve them.\n  We should fully fund protection of our marine resources. In our bill, \nwe provide $350 million for States to conserve and protect the marine \nenvironment.\n  We protect ranchland, farmland, and forestland through purchasing \nconservation easements.\n  I think it is a very exciting alternative to S. 25. It is, in fact, \nendorsed by over 200 conservation organizations. It is also the only \nlegislation that provides funding to restore degraded Federal lands and \ntribal lands.\n  The majority leader made some good remarks this morning. He said we \nmust maintain the lands we currently own. I agree with that. That is \nwhy Resources 2000 takes care of that by providing $250 million for the \nmaintenance of our degraded federal and tribal lands.\n  I would like to inform you at this time of some of the organizations \nthat support Resources 2000: Sierra Club; National Audubon Society; \nEnvironmental Defense Fund; The Wilderness Society; the California \nPolice Activities League; Defenders of Wildlife; and Earth Island \nInstitute.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Organizations Supporting Resources 2000\n\n       American Oceans Campaign.\n       Bay Area Open Space Council.\n       Bay Area Trail Council.\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\n       Bay Institute.\n       California Police Activities League.\n       Carquinez Strait Preservation Trust.\n       Defenders of Wildlife.\n       Earth Island Institute.\n       East Bay Regional Park District.\n       Environmental Defense Fund.\n       Friends of the Earth.\n       Friends of the River.\n       Golden Gate Audubon Society.\n       Greater Vallejo Recreation District.\n       Izaak Walton League.\n       Land Trust Alliance.\n       Marin Conservation League.\n       Martinez Regional Land Trust.\n       National Conference of State Historic Preservation \n     Officers.\n       National Audubon Society.\n       National Environmental Trust.\n       National Parks and Conservation Association.\n       National Association of Police Athletic Leagues.\n       National Wildlife Federation.\n       Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n       Preservation Action.\n       Save San Francisco Bay Association.\n       Save the Redwoods.\n       Scenic America.\n       Sierra Club.\n       Society for American Archaeology.\n       Trust for Public Land.\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n       Wilderness Society.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I hope we will get the entire agreement \nworked out.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1555) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2000 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \njunior Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, is to be recognized to offer an \namendment after the general statements.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized to make \nan opening statement on the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on May 5 of this year the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence unanimously reported out of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. It subsequently referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services, where it was reported out on June 8.\n  Senator Kerrey and I have once again worked very closely together to \naddress our critical need for high-quality intelligence by allocating \nresources in a manner designed to ensure that this need is met.\n  In preparing this legislation, the committee conducted a detailed \nreview of the administration's three major intelligence budget requests \nfor fiscal year 2000. They are the National Foreign Intelligence \nProgram, the Joint Military Intelligence Program, and the Tactical \nIntelligence and Related Activities of the Military Services.\n  The committee held briefings and hearings with senior intelligence \nofficials, reviewed budget justification materials, and considered \nresponses to specific questions posed by the committee.\n  As in the past, the committee also impaneled a group of outside \nexperts composed of distinguished scientists, industry leaders, and \nretired general and flag officers to review specific technical issues \nwithin the intelligence community.\n  The panel is known as the Technical Advisory Group and is similar to \nthe Defense Department's Defense Science Board in some ways.\n  This group brings an invaluable level of expertise to the committee's \nwork, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service.\n  Many of their recommendations have been incorporated into this bill \nbefore the Senate this evening.\n  Once again the committee has focused on what we refer to as the \n``five C's''. They are: counterproliferation, counterterrorism, \ncounternarcotics, covert action, and counterintelligence.\n  The last of the five, counterintelligence, has received a great deal \nof congressional and media attention in recent months in light of \nrevelations of espionage activities by the People's Republic of China.\n  I am proud to say that the Intelligence Committee has been attempting \nto address the shortcomings of the Department of Energy's \ncounterintelligence program for nearly 10 years, often to no avail.\n  In fact, it was the Intelligence Committee that directed the study \nthat finally led to the drafting and signing of Presidential Decision \nDirective 61.\n  Before I turn to the legislative provisions in this bill, I feel \ncompelled to share with our colleagues some comments about the current \nstate of our defense and intelligence preparedness.\n  In the immediate aftermath of the cold war, optimistic appraisals of \nour\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\nintelligence and security requirements generated calls for dramatic \ncuts in defense and intelligence spending.\n  The first national security decision made by President Clinton on \ntaking office in 1993 was to cut more than $120 billion from the \ndefense budget. Substantial cuts were also made to classified \nintelligence programs.\n  Unfortunately, such optimistic estimates have proved sadly wrong.\n  Today we face a series of transnational threats spanning the spectrum \nof conflict from terrorist acts committed on U.S. territory to the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery \nby Third World countries.\n  I recently traveled to the Balkans and reviewed some of our \nintelligence activities in Europe. Military and civilian personnel were \nroutinely working in excess of 80 hours a week, and that pace was \nnonstop throughout the Kosovo conflict.\n  Regretfully, the problems the military and the intelligence community \nare experiencing are partly our fault. Congress accepted ``defense on \nthe cheap,'' and we have gotten exactly what we paid for as we always \ndo--an intelligence community and military force stretched to its \nlimits.\n  I believe the result is clear: We are not prepared to meet the \nchallenges of a complex and dangerous world.\n  National security cannot be had on the cheap, and we have attempted \nto address some of the shortfalls in this year's bill.\n  The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex--I remind \nevery Senator--are available for review just off the Senate floor. I \nrepeat: The bill's classified schedule of authorizations and annex are \navailable to every Senator in this body for review just off the Senate \nfloor.\n  I will now discuss the significant unclassified legislative \nprovisions contained in the bill.\n  First, section 304 directs the President to require an employee who \nrequires access to classified information to provide written consent \nthat permits an authorized investigative agency to access information \nstored in computers used in the performance of Government duties.\n  This provision is intended to avoid the problems we have seen with \nthe FBI's reluctance to access ``Government'' computers without a \nwarrant in the course of an espionage investigation.\n  There should be no question--yes, there should be no question--that \ninvestigative agencies may search the computer of an individual with \naccess to classified information. This provision makes that perfectly \nclear.\n  Second, sections 501 through 505 comprise the Department of Energy \nSensitive Country Foreign Visitors Moratorium Act of 1999.\n  What is that? Section 502 establishes a moratorium on foreign \nvisitors to classified facilities at Department of Energy National \nLaboratories.\n  The moratorium applies only to citizens of nations on the Department \nof Energy ``sensitive countries list.''\n  Section 502 also provides for a waiver of the moratorium on a case-\nby-case basis if the Secretary of Energy justifies the waiver and \ncertifies that the visit is necessary for the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  Section 503 requires that the Secretary of Energy perform background \nchecks on all foreign visitors to the National Laboratories. The term \n``background checks'' means the consultation of all available, \nappropriate, and relevant intelligence community and law enforcement \ndatabases.\n  Section 504 requires an interim report to Congress on the \ncounterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories and a net \nassessment of the Foreign Visitors Program at the National Laboratories \nto be produced by a panel of experts.\n  Most importantly, the report must include a recommendation as to \nwhether the moratorium should be continued or repealed.\n  The Senate Intelligence Committee has been critical of the Department \nof Energy's counterintelligence program for nearly 10 years. Beginning \nin 1990, we identified serious shortfalls in funding and personnel \ndedicated to protecting our Nation's nuclear secrets.\n  Yet year after year--and this year as well--the committee has \nprovided funds and directed many reviews and studies in an effort to \npersuade the Department of Energy to take action.\n  Unfortunately, this and prior administrations failed to heed our \nwarnings.\n  Consequently, a serious espionage threat at our National Labs has \ngone virtually unabated and it appears that our nuclear weapons program \nmay have suffered extremely grave damage.\n  I believe we must take steps to ensure the integrity of our National \nLabs. We understand that a moratorium on the Foreign Visitors Program \nmay be perceived by some as a draconian measure, but until the \nDepartment of Energy fully implements a comprehensive and sustained \ncounterintelligence program, we believe that we must err on the side of \ncaution. The stakes are too high.\n  The moratorium requires a net assessment to be conducted by a panel \nof experts; this is an integral part of a comprehensive report by the \nDirector of Central Intelligence and the Director of the FBI on the \ncounterintelligence activities at the National Laboratories.\n  Only then should we decide whether to lift the moratorium in favor of \na comprehensive plan. I believe this is a very important point.\n  During our preliminary look in the committee into the problems at the \nDOE labs, we were convinced that the FBI could and should be required \nto inform an agency or department that they are investigating an \nemployee of that particular agency.\n  Accordingly, section 602 of the bill requires the FBI to establish \nmeaningful liaison with the relevant agency at the beginning stages of \na counterintelligence investigation.\n  This section also amends the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nfiscal year 1995 to make clear that the FBI's obligation to consult \nwith departments and agencies concerned begins when the FBI has \nknowledge of espionage activities from other sources or as a result of \nits own information or investigation.\n  In closing, I must remind the Members of this body, my colleagues, of \nan unfortunate fact. This is the last time that Senator Kerrey, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Nebraska, will bring an intelligence \nauthorization bill to the floor of the Senate as the vice chairman of \nthe committee.\n  Senator Kerrey's tenure on the committee will conclude at the end of \nthis year.\n  This past March 14, as some of you will recall, marked the 30th \nanniversary of the day that Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Bob Kerrey, \nleading his SEAL team on an operation on an island in the bay of Nha \nTrang earned our Nation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor.\n  No one who knows Bob Kerrey's military record would question his \nphysical courage, but I would like to talk for just a few minutes about \nanother type of courage he has, and that is moral courage.\n  In a town like Washington that rewards neither, he is the rare man \nwho has both, I believe. The wartime history of the United States Navy \nhas documented his physical courage, but I want to recognize his moral \ncourage. And I want to tell you why.\n  Senator Kerrey has taken stands that many of us would consider \npolitically unwise.\n  He took a stand on entitlements reform here in the Senate long before \nit was politically wise to do so. It can be said he laid his bare hand \non the ``third rail of American politics'' and took the heat--something \nfew in this body were willing to attempt.\n  As vice chairman of this committee, Senator Kerrey has often taken \nissue with his own administration when he believed it was in the \nnational interest to do so. Indeed, he always puts the interests of the \nNation ahead of politics.\n  Also, Senator Kerrey's knowledge of our intelligence needs is \nunparalleled in the Senate. And I will miss his service, as others \nwill, on the Intelligence Committee.\n  Senator Kerrey has set a very high standard for his successor, and I \nthank him for his dedication and integrity, and also for his personal \nfriendship. It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with Nebraska's \nsenior Senator.\n  I look forward to joining him on the floor one last time when the \nconference report for this bill reaches the floor later this year.\n  Until that time, though, we will continue to work closely to conduct \nvigorous oversight of the intelligence activities of the United States \nin the\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\nnonpartisan spirit that created this important and unique committee.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 1009 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n     S. 1009--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000\n       Summary: S. 1009 would authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2000 for intelligence activities of the United States \n     government, the Intelligence Community Management Account, \n     and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability \n     System (CIARDS).\n       This estimate addresses only the unclassified portion of \n     the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting \n     the bill would result in additional spending of $172 million \n     over the 2000-2004 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill \n     would affect direct spending; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply. However, CBO cannot give a precise estimate of \n     the direct spending effects because the data necessary to \n     support a cost estimate are classified.\n       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from \n     application of that all legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that \n     the unclassified provisions of this bill either fit within \n     that exclusion or do not cover intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the unclassified portions of S. 1009 is \n     shown in the following table. CBO cannot obtain the necessary \n     information to estimate the costs for the entire bill because \n     parts are classified at a level above clearances held by CBO \n     employees. For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that \n     the bill will be enacted by October 1, 1999, and that the \n     authorized amounts will be appropriated for fiscal year 2000.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     By fiscal years in millions of dollars--\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n                                                                   1999    2000    2001    2002    2003    2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law for Intelligence Community\n Management:\n  Budget Authority \\1\\..........................................     102       0       0       0       0  ......\n  Estimated Outlays.............................................     104      39       9       2       0  ......\nProposed Changes:\n  Authorization Level...........................................       0     172       0       0       0  ......\n  Estimated Outlays.............................................       0     106      52      10       3  ......\nSpending Under S. 1009 for Intelligence Community Management:\n  Authorization Level\\1\\........................................     102     172       0       0       0       0\n  Estimated Outlays.............................................     104     145      61      12       3       0\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority......................................       0   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)\nEstimated Outlays...............................................       0   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)   (\\2\\)  (\\2\\)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1999 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\n\\2\\ CBO cannot give a precise estimate of direct spending effects because the data necessary to support a cost\n  estimate are classified.\n\n       Outlays are estimated according to historical spending \n     patterns. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 050 (national defense).\n       The bill would authorize appropriations of $172 million for \n     the Intelligence Community Management Account, which funds \n     the coordination of programs, budget oversight, and \n     management of the intelligence agencies. In addition, the \n     bill would authorize $209 million for CIARDS to cover \n     retirement costs attributable to military service and various \n     unfunded liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered \n     mandatory, and the authorization under this bill would be the \n     same as assumed in the CBO baseline.\n       Section 305 would allow an individual who is or has been \n     affiliated with a Communist or similar political party to \n     become a naturalized citizen, if the individual has made a \n     contribution to the national security or national \n     intelligence mission of the United States. Under current law, \n     such individuals are not allowed to become naturalized \n     citizens, unless the affiliation was involuntary. Enacting \n     this provision could effect certain federal assistance \n     programs and the amount of fees collected by the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service. Because the number of affected \n     individuals is expected to be very small, however, CBO \n     estimates that any effects on direct spending would not be \n     significant.\n       Section 402 of the bill would extend the authority of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency to offer incentive payments to \n     employees who voluntarily retire or resign. This * * * which \n     is currently scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year \n     1999, would be * * * through fiscal year 2000. Section 402 \n     would also require the CIA to make a deposit to the Civil \n     Service Retirement and Disability Fund equal to 15 percent of \n     final pay for each employee who accepts an incentive payment. \n     CBO estimates that these payments would amount to less than \n     $3 million. We believe that these deposits would be \n     sufficient to cover the cost of any long-term increase in \n     benefits that would result from induced retirements, although \n     the timing of agency payments and the additional benefit \n     payments would not match on a yearly basis. CBO cannot \n     provide a precise estimate of the direct spending effects \n     because the data necessary for an estimate are classified.\n       Section 501 of the bill would require a background \n     investigation of citizens of a foreign nation before they \n     could enter a national laboratory of the Department of \n     Energy. Based on information from two of the three national \n     laboratories, CBO expects the laboratories to host about \n     10,000 foreign visitors a year. The cost to conduct an \n     investigation would depend on the type of background check. \n     According to the Defense Department, the cost for a minimum \n     national agency check is about $70, and the cost can increase \n     to $300 with additional credit bureau or local police agency \n     checks. Because some of these costs would be incurred under \n     current law, CBO estimates that the additional costs of \n     section 501 would be minimal.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Sections 305 and 402 of the \n     bill would affect direct spending, and therefore the bill \n     would be subject to pay-as-you-go procedures. CBO estimates \n     that the direct spending costs of section 305 would be very \n     small. CBO cannot estimate the precise direct spending \n     effects of section 402 because the necessary data are \n     classified.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act excludes from application of the act \n     legislative provisions that are necessary for the national \n     security. CBO has determined that the unclassified provisions \n     of this bill either fit within that exclusion or do * * * \n     intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined by \n     UMRA.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On May 5, 1999, CBO prepared a cost \n     estimate for the unclassified portion of H.R. 1555, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, as \n     ordered reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, The House version authorizes * * * Intelligence \n     Community Management, and the estimated costs of H.R. 155 are \n     * * * higher.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Estimate for \n     Naturalization Provision: Valerie Baxter.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nmembers of the committee staff be granted floor privileges during the \npendency of this bill: Dan Gallington, Jim Barnett, Al Cumming, Pete \nDorn, Peter Flory, Lorenzo Goco, Ken Johnson, Ken Myers, Linda Taylor, \nJim Wolfe; and also Dr. Michael Cieslak on Senator Bingaman's staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join my chairman, Senator Shelby \nof Alabama, with whom I have had the pleasure to work now for several \nyears. This is my last year on this select committee. It has been an \nopportunity, for the last 8 years, to acquire an understanding of what \nit takes to collect intelligence, to analyze that intelligence, to \nprocess it, produce it, and disseminate it.\n  It is nowhere near as easy as it used to be. In the old days, you \nbasically sent human beings out there to try to figure out what was \ngoing on. You hoped they spoke the language and were smart enough to \nfigure things out. They would come back and bring you the best stuff \nthey could. Oftentimes it would be too late to act upon it.\n  I had a small piece of that some 30 years ago in the service, where \nwe used to collect intelligence as well. So I have at least some \nindependent understanding of the difficulty, especially on the human \nside. But the importance of what intelligence can bring to an operation \ncannot be overstated-- the recent operation in Kosovo, the Dayton peace \nagreement, incident after incident that cannot be disclosed to the \npublic because most of it occurs in a secret environment where \nwarfighters and policymakers get information in a timely fashion and, \nas a consequence, lives are saved, success is achieved, and national \nsecurity is improved.\n  This bill is a result of a bipartisan effort to make the year 2000 a \nwatershed year for intelligence. This bill sets the intelligence \ncommunity on a course to respond to the very complex world we are \nfacing. The era of downsizing has ended. Intelligence must be \npositioned to collect, analyze, and inform policymakers on the complex \nthreats we face.\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\n  As my colleagues are no doubt aware, most of the bill is classified. \nAs always, Chairman Shelby and I have made the classified sections \navailable to our colleagues for their review. Further, committee staff \nis readily available to brief on any aspect of this bill. I believe \nMembers have found the bill to be the result of a completely bipartisan \neffort to fund intelligence activities in fiscal year 2000.\n  Chairman Shelby and I have tried, and I think on most occasions have \nconsistently applied a single test, to determine whether or not a \nfunding level or a provision or an oversight hearing or a letter or \nsome other action is required. And that test is, will this make the \npeople of the United States of America and our interests more secure as \na consequence? If the answer is yes, we have done it. If the answer is \nno, we have not.\n  We do not, in these committees, check with our leadership to \ndetermine whether or not there is a Democratic position or a Republican \nposition. What we do is check to determine whether or not the action \nwill be in the best interest of the United States of America and keep \nthe United States as secure as our best judgments can make it. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with Senator Shelby, and it has been an honor \nfor me to have the opportunity to watch him participate and to \nexperience his leadership on this committee.\n  As I said, I believe the year 2000 must be a watershed year for \nintelligence. That is because the intelligence community has been \nsignificantly downsized in the decade of the 1990s. Again, in \nclassified briefings, we are pleased to provide Members with the \ninformation on that. I think most Members will be shocked to see the \nbudget and the number of people, especially the number of people we \nhave today, who are doing the collection, doing the analysis, doing the \nwork of trying to figure out, with new technologies, how to produce and \nthen how to disseminate this intelligence as quickly and accurately as \npossible. The number of people doing that has gone down.\n\n  This is not a simple task, such as we sometimes see in crime reports, \nwhere somebody will go into a 7-Eleven store, and they will have a \ncamera that shows who they are. It is not that simple. These are, on \nthe imaging side, complicated images; on the signal side, complicated \nsignals; and always, on the human side, a very complicated set of \ncircumstances out there that have to be first observed and then \ninterpreted by men and women who have the requisite skills to get the \njob done.\n  Furthermore, we are making decisions today that don't just affect \nthis year. We are making decisions today that will affect intelligence \ncollectors and intelligence efforts 10 years from now.\n  In the area of technology, one has to try to anticipate where the \nworld is going to go. The chairman and I put together what is called a \ntechnical advisory group, a group of not only highly skilled but highly \nmotivated men and women, who love their country and are concerned about \nwhat we need to do to keep our country safe. We were able to basically \ntake very complicated subjects; in my case--I am sure it is not true \nfor the chairman --they had to convert sophisticated subject matter \ninto very unsophisticated phrases so I would be able to understand what \nit was they were saying and make better judgments as well about what we \nneed to do. Their contributions have been enormously important and have \nadded significant value to our ability to make these kinds of \ndecisions.\n  I pay them a very high compliment and urge my colleagues to consider \nthat it is not just the highly professional and skilled staff--a couple \nyears ago, we went away from a system where Republicans got so many \nstaff members, Democrats got so many staff members or an individual got \nstaff as well, to a professional staff--we have enjoyed the benefit of \ntremendous input coming from our private sector technical advisory \ngroup.\n  The cold war has ended.\n  And it is quite appropriate for us to have downsized our intelligence \ncollection. As I said, in my strong and considered judgment, we have \nreached the point of no return. We have reached the point now where we \nare beginning to drawdown, as we say in farm country, our seed corn. We \nare drawing down our basic stockpile of resources to the point where we \nare doing great damage to our ability to answer the call of \nwarfighters.\n  Though nobody knew the direction the world was going to take, or the \nsize and seriousness of the threats the United States was going to face \nafter the cold war, during the transition I believe it was quite \ncorrect to restructure many national priorities and get our economy \nback on sound footing. However, this transition must be considered to \nbe open especially now that we have a better understanding of where the \nrest of the world is heading and we have a much more precise \nunderstanding of the kinds of threats the people of the United States \nface in that world.\n  Unfortunately, in some areas in the world, the world is heading in \nthe wrong direction. Rogue states are trying to acquire chemical, \nnuclear, and biological weapons for the purpose of threatening us and \nour friends. Many countries are actively pursuing long-range missile \nprograms, which also threaten international peace.\n  A potential strategic partner, Russia, is in the midst of economic \nchaos and under extreme political difficulties. In recent war game \nexercises involving 50,000 conventional forces in Russia, the defense \nminister said those conventional forces did not have the capability \nthey had 7 or 8 years ago when it was the Soviet Union. They have now \nmade a decision to use nuclear weapons much more quickly than under \nprevious battlefield instructions. That increases the threat to the \npeople of the United States and signals the kind of decisionmaking that \nother powers out there that do not have conventional parity with the \nUnited States and other powers with bad intent might do in order to \ncompensate for their lack of conventional strength.\n  Even more problematic, Russia's nuclear stockpile is aging. It is \nsubject to the vagaries of the political and economic problems that \nconfront its national leaders and too large to serve its essential \ndefense requirements. Moreover, other nations are either at war or on \nthe brink of war.\n  Prior to the Fourth of July recess, I spoke on the floor about the \nescalating military confrontation building between India and Pakistan. \nThat conflict appears to have been resolved and a stand-down has \noccurred, but that conflict could flash up in an instant and put the \ninterests of the people of the United States at considerable risk. \nElsewhere, in Kosovo and Bosnia, and with Serbia, as well, our \nrelations are extremely unsettled and are the focus of very close \nattention.\n  The list goes on and on. We have 37,000 Americans forward deployed in \nSouth Korea. Americans are forward deployed in many other regions in \nthis world for the purpose of stabilizing those parts of the world. We \nbelieve--and I think quite correctly--that forward deployment increases \nstability in the world and adds to the chances of success to the \nstruggling democratic nations--struggling to make the transition from \ncommand economies to market. It is very important for the United States \nto deploy our forces. It tends to act as a deterrent against potential \nbad actors. We have a mission in Iraq we are flying on a daily basis, \nand we are trying to watch literally the entire planet simultaneously \nso as to prepare our policymakers for something that could happen which \ncould put American lives and interests at risk.\n\n  I am not trying to turn this statement into an international tour de \nforce over foreign or defense policy. Instead, I want to remind my \ncolleagues and the citizens whom they represent, that in many regions \nthe world order is very disordered, and the Intelligence Community is \nthe edge our policymakers must have in order to stay ahead of what has \nhappened.\n  Without timely intelligence support, we cannot respond effectively. \nThis means the era of downsizing intelligence has to end or we will \nfind ourselves at a point where Congress discovers there are things we \ncan't do. There is a tendency to take our intelligence efforts for \ngranted and see it as sort of an invisible force. We see an image that \nis presented to us, such as a bomb damage assessment, and we don't \nunderstand what went into that. We didn't merely pull it off of a \nshelf. Or we see a report of an analysis that\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nis done, where decisions are made and troops are deployed, and we don't \nask ourselves as often as we should what was the intelligence \ncollection fraction that went into that effort.\n  Was it possible to just pick up the forces and go into an area? The \nanswer is no. A significant amount of analysis is done, and that \nanalysis has given us an edge. It gives us battlefield superiority and \nthe capability of doing things that, in previous wars, we were simply \nunable to do.\n  Our enemies know that. Our intelligence capability, all by itself, \nacts as a considerable deterrent. Because people know we have the \ncapabilities, they are much less likely to take an action that would be \nhostile to us, dangerous to us and at the end of the day dangerous for \nthem as well.\n  As colleagues may recall, last year when introducing the Fiscal Year \n1999 Intelligence Authorization Act, I referred, as I mentioned, to \nthis technical advisory group that Chairman Shelby had the foresight to \ncreate. This highly qualified group of Americans evaluated some of the \nmost esoteric and technical subjects the committee had to confront in \norder to position intelligence for future challenges. We used their \nservices this year. They provided us with extremely valuable advice and \nsaved taxpayers, my guess is--it would not be out of line to say they \nhave saved hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  They have identified the areas where we might be able to use \ntechnology to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Because \nof the enormous contributions these men and women on the technical \nadvisory group have made to the intelligence oversight effort, we had \nthe ability not to just write a bill but, as I have said, write a bill \nthat will keep Americans more safe.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't mention a subject that held a lot of \nmedia attention over the past 3 or 4 months, and that is \ncounterintelligence. This bill contains provisions intended to help \nintelligence and law enforcement meet the espionage challenges we face. \nI am sure it is obvious that because of who we are, many nations want \nto know what we do. Espionage is a fact of life. We should act \ndecisively when we detect it and prosecute fully those who engage in \nit. But it will not go away. Thus, we need to strengthen \ncounterintelligence to meet the challenges. The bill contains important \nprovisions to help us attack this very real and present danger.\n\n  As my colleagues are no doubt also aware, there will be an important \namendment on the bill concerning a reorganization of parts of the \nDepartment of Energy. Most of the amendment is not about intelligence \nor counterintelligence; it is about nuclear weapons security. The \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board's report entitled \n``Science At Its Best, Security At Its Worst'' reminds us it is also \nabout accountability.\n  I look forward to a full debate on the amendment of which I am a \ncosponsor and to our discussion on the intelligence and \ncounterintelligence provisions.\n  Again, I thank Senator Shelby, the chairman of the committee, for his \nbipartisan and patriotic approach to developing this bill. I thank the \nentire staff for their work to present the committee a bill they could \nfully support. Because of the spirit of working together, the bill was \nreported out of committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, under the previous order, is it in order to \nproceed to the Kyl-Domenici amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Is the amendment already at the desk or does it need to be \ncalled up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not at the desk.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1258\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Specter, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bunning, \n     Mr. Helms, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1258.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me first compliment Senator Shelby and \nSenator Kerrey, the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, for their work in presenting the intelligence authorization \nbill to the floor. This amendment to the Intelligence Authorization \nbill deals with the all-important question of how the Department of \nEnergy will be reorganized to ensure the theft of our nuclear secrets, \nas has occurred in the past, will be a question of the past and will \nnot occur in the future.\n  As we heard earlier today, over the past several months, there have \nbeen a lot of sobering stories about how our Nation's security has been \ndamaged by China's theft of America's most sensitive secrets--literally \nthe crown jewels of our nuclear arsenal. In searching for a solution to \nthis problem and examining how best to safeguard our Nation and its \nnuclear secrets, it has become clear the only way this can be \naccomplished is through a complete overhaul of how the Department of \nEnergy is organized and how it is managed.\n  I think everyone can agree the system is broken. As the bipartisan \nCox committee report pointed out, security and counterintelligence at \nU.S. nuclear facilities has been grossly deficient for many years, \nenabling China to steal classified information on all of the nuclear \nwarheads currently deployed by the United States, as well as the \nneutron bomb, and a variety of other military know-how, including \nmissile guidance and reentry vehicle technology.\n  This is incredibly important when a nation has been able to steal the \nsecrets on how to build the most sophisticated weapons ever devised by \nmankind, those most sophisticated nuclear weapons in our arsenal.\n  When reports of the Chinese espionage at our nuclear labs became \npublic earlier this year, President Clinton asked his Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board, led by former Senator Warren Rudman, to \ninvestigate the cause of these terrible security breaches. Over the \ncourse of several weeks, the Presidential panel reviewed more than 700 \nreports and studies, thousands of pages of classified and unclassified \ndocuments, conducted interviews with scores of senior Federal \nofficials, and visited the Department of Energy sites at the heart of \nthe inquiry.\n  At the end of this exhaustive investigation, the panel concluded that \nthe root cause of the Energy Department's dismal security and \ncounterintelligence report was ``organizational disarray, managerial \nneglect, and a culture of arrogance . . . [which] conspired to create \nan espionage scandal waiting to happen.''\n  The Presidential board went on to note that the Department of Energy \n(DOE) ``represents the best of America's scientific talent and \nachievement, but it has also been responsible for the worst security \nrecord on secrecy that the members of this panel have ever \nencountered.''\n  Senator Rudman and his colleagues pulled no punches in describing the \nproblems that exist at DOE or in prescribing bold solutions stating,\n\n       Reorganization [of DOE] is clearly warranted to resolve the \n     many specific problems with security and counterintelligence \n     in the weapons laboratories, but also to address the lack of \n     accountability that has become endemic throughout the entire \n     Department.\n\n  The Rudman report noted that,\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable to reforming itself. \n     Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and \n     erratically that it is now almost impossible to find. The \n     long traditional and effective method of entrenched DOE and \n     lab bureaucrats is to defeat security reform initiatives by \n     waiting them out.\n\n  That is from the Rudman report.\n  I ask that our colleagues keep that in mind when they consider \namendments that may be offered a little bit later to this amendment--\namendments that people at the Department of Energy\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\nwould very much like to see passed because it would leave them in \ncontrol, the very situation that the Rudman report notes is \nunacceptable and must be changed.\n  Furthermore, the authors of the Rudman report go on to say,\n\n       We are stunned by the huge numbers of DOE employees \n     involved in overseeing a weapons lab contract. We repeatedly \n     heard from officials at various levels of DOE and the weapons \n     labs how this convoluted and bloated management structure has \n     constantly transmitted confusing and often contradictory \n     mandates to the labs.\n\n  Although Energy Secretary Richardson has announced several new \ninitiatives to change management and procedures at DOE, the \nPresidential panel's report states, ``we seriously doubt that his \ninitiatives will achieve lasting success,'' and notes, ``moreover, the \nRichardson initiatives simply do not go far enough.''\n  In their report, the Presidential board also described the record of \nproblems with implementing organizational changes ordered by previous \nEnergy Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries, since the entrenched \nbureaucracy has often reverted to its old tricks once these people \nleft. For example, the report notes that in 1990, then-Secretary \nWatkins ordered a new series of initiatives on safeguards and security \nto be implemented. According to the Rudman panel, once Secretary \nWatkins left two years later, ``the initiatives all but evaporated.'' \nAnd furthermore, the panel's report notes, ``Deputy Secretary Charles \nCurtis in late 1996 investigated clear indications of serious security \nand counterintelligence problems and drew up a list of initiatives in \nresponse. Those initiatives were also dropped after he left office.''\n  It is because of these problems that the Presidential panel \nrecommended that Congress act to reorganize the Department by statute, \nso that the bureaucracy could not simple wait out another Secretary of \nEnergy. Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, and I have written \nlegislation to implement the group's recommendations. Our proposal \nwould gather all of the parts of our nation's nuclear weapons research, \ndevelopment, and production programs under one semi-autonomous agency \nwithin the Energy Department.\n  We need to create a specific separate organizational structure for \nthe weapons programs at DOE, managed by one person who reports only to \nthe Secretary of Energy. And furthermore, we need to separate the \nnuclear weapons programs at DOE from the rest of the Department that is \nresponsible for energy conservation and environmental management \nissues. As the Rudman report concluded, semi-autonomous agency, created \nby statute, is the only way we are going to solve the problems with \nDOE's management of the nuclear weapons complex.\n  Before explaining the details of this amendment, let me first mention \nthat while the Cox Committee and the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board, led by Senator Rudman, have done a great service to the \nnation by producing high quality reports with excellent \nrecommendations, they are by no means the first people to recommend \nsuch changes. Over the past 20 years, at least 29 GAO reports, 61 \ninternal DOE studies, and more than a dozen reports by outside \ncommissions have called for restructuring how the Department is \nmanaged. Let us not wait until another forest is consumed to print more \nstudies before we act to correct the serious management problems at \nDOE.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I interrupt to make a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Robert Perret, a fellow \nin my office, be entitled to floor privileges during the pendency of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend.\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to comply.\n  Mr. President, the point of referring to these 29 GAO reports, 61 \ninternal DOE studies, and more than a dozen reports by outside \ncommissions over the past 20 years is to make the point that now is the \ntime for us to move forward and not to await important studies, and not \nto await more discussions about how this ought to be done. We have \nenough evidence of what needs to be done. It is now time to get on with \nthe serious subject of fixing this broken management structure at DOE.\n  Here is the summary of the amendment.\n  This amendment would create a semi-autonomous agency within DOE \ncalled the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship.\n  The Agency will be headed by an Under Secretary who ``shall report \nsolely and directly to the Secretary and shall be subject to the \nsupervision and direction of the Secretary.''\n  Let me digress for a moment to make this point.\n  There are some who would put additional layers of bureaucracy between \nthe Secretary and this Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. That would be a \ngrave mistake. As the Rudman report itself notes, the point is to \nstreamline this agency's responsibility, starting with the Secretary at \nthe top and everyone else reporting to the Deputy Secretary who reports \nstrictly to the Secretary of Energy. If you insert other management \nlayers, you are only getting back to the same kind of problem that the \nRudman report has criticized in the past.\n   The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have authority over \nall programs at DOE related to ``nuclear weapons, non-proliferation and \nfissile material disposition.''\n   The agency's semi-autonomy (as recommended by the Rudman report) is \ncreated by making all employees of the agency accountable to the \nSecretary and Under Secretary of Energy but not to other officials at \nDOE outside the Agency.\n  The language reads:\n\n       All personnel of the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship, in \n     carrying out any function of the Agency, shall be responsible \n     to, and subject to the supervision and direction of, the \n     Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship or \n     his designee within the Agency, and shall not be responsible \n     to, or subject to the supervision or direction of, any other \n     officer, employee, or agent of any other part of the \n     Department.\n\n   The Secretary, however, ``may direct other officials of the \nDepartment who are not within the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship to \nreview the Agency's programs and to make recommendations to the \nSecretary regarding the administration of such programs, including \nconsistency with other similar programs and activities in the \nDepartment.''\n  There is another proposed amendment which we will get to later which \nsuggests that all of the programs and activities of this special new \nautonomous agency are to act in ways consistent with all other \ndepartmental rules and regulations promulgated for all of the other \ndepartments within the Department of Energy.\n  That would be a big mistake and get right back to the problem that \nthe Rudman commission noted; that is, that this is a special, unique \nentity, and that you cannot have everybody else within the Department \nof Energy controlling what goes on within this particular group.\n  The Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship will have 3 Deputy \nDirectors, who will manage programs in the following areas:\n  No. 1. Defense Programs. The national lab directors and heads of \nweapons production and test sites will report directly to this person, \nwho will be responsible for managing the programs necessary to maintain \nthe safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile.\n  No. 2. Nonproliferation and fissile materials disposition. This \nperson would manage the Energy Department's efforts to help Russia and \nother states of the former Soviet Union secure their nuclear weapons \nand fissile material, as well as plan for how to dispose of dozens of \ntons of excess plutonium in the United States and Russia; and\n  No. 3. Naval Reactors. This highly successful program which designs, \nconstructs, operates, and disposes of the nuclear reactors used in the \nU.S. Navy's fleet will continue to operate as it does today, except the \nAdmiral in charge will now report to the Under Secretary for Nuclear \nStewardship as well as the Secretary of Energy.\n  As recommended by the Rudman panel, under our amendment, the Under \nSecretary for Nuclear Stewardship will appoint Chiefs of \nCounterintelligence, Security, and Intelligence.\n  The Chief of Counterintelligence will develop and implement the \nAgency's\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\nprograms to prevent the disclosure of loss of classified information \nand be responsible for personnel assurance programs, like background \nchecks.\n  The Chief of Security will be responsible for the development and \nimplementation of programs for the protection, control, and accounting \nof fissile material, and for the physical and cyber-security of all \nsites in the Agency.\n  And the Chief of Intelligence will manage the Agency's programs for \nthe analysis of foreign nuclear weapons programs.\n  These 3 chiefs will report to the Under Secretary and shall have \nstatutorily provided ``direct access to the Secretary and all other \nsenior officials of the Department and its contractors'' concerning \nthese matters.\n  The amendment calls on the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship to \nreport annually through the Secretary to Congress regarding:\n  No. 1. The adequacy of DOE procedures and policies for protecting \nnational security information.\n  No. 2. Whether each DOE national laboratory and nuclear weapons \nproduction and test site is in full compliance with all Departmental \nsecurity requirements, and if not what measures are being taken to \nbring a lab into compliance; and\n  No. 3. A description of the number and type of violations of security \nand counterintelligence laws and requirements at DOE nuclear weapons \nfacilities.\n  Furthermore, the amendment calls for the Under Secretary to keep the \nSecretary and the Congress fully and currently informed about any \npotentially significant threat to, or loss of, national security \ninformation.\n  The amendment would require every employee of DOE, the national labs, \nor associated contractors to alert the Under Secretary whenever they \nbelieve there is a problem, abuse or violation of the law relating to \nthe management of national security information.\n  And, in order to address concerns that DOE officials were blocked \nfrom notifying Congress of security and counterintelligence breaches, \nthe amendment contains a provision stating that ``no officer or \nemployee of the Department of Energy or any other Federal agency or \ndepartment may delay, deny, obstruct, or otherwise interfere with the \npreparation'' of these reports to Congress.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should act with urgency to correct the \nserious problems that exist at our nuclear facilities to halt the flow \nof our precious nuclear secrets to countries like China.\n  Our amendment is a sound approach to rectifying the systematic \nproblems that have been identified and that exist today, and I am \ndisappointed that Secretary Richardson has not yet embraced the \nproposal we have submitted. Since as recently as April of 1999, the \nSecretary of Energy's own Management Review Report stated:\n\n       Significant problems exist [in DOE] in that roles and \n     responsibilities are unclear; lines of authority and \n     accountability are not well understood or followed; the \n     distinction between headquarters, line and staff functions is \n     unclear, and each is operating with autonomy.\n\n  Statistics support this view. According to the GAO, from 1980 to \n1996, DOE terminated 9 of 18 major defense program projects after \nspending $1.9 billion and completed only two projects: One behind \nschedule and overbudget, with the other behind schedule and \nunderbudget. Schedule slippages and cost overruns occurred on many of \nthe remaining seven projects ongoing in 1996.\n  Finally, I note that management problems cannot be divorced from \nsecurity concerns. As the GAO noted in testimony to the House, \ncontinuing management problems at DOE were ``key factors contributing \nto security problems at the laboratories'' and a ``major reason why DOE \nhas been unable to develop long-term solutions to recurring problems \nreported by the advisory groups.''\n  The amendment we offer enjoys broad bipartisan support. In addition \nto Senator Domenici who chairs the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and Senator Murkowski who chairs the Energy Committee, it \nis cosponsored by the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senators Shelby and Kerrey; the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and its Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, Senators \nWarner and Smith; chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nSenator Thompson; chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms; former chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Specter; \nas well as Senator Feinstein, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Gregg, \nSenator Bunning, Senator Fitzgerald, and the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Lott.\n  We cannot delay the implementation of important security and \ncounterintelligence upgrades at our nuclear labs and facilities. Great \nharm to our Nation's security has already been done, and if we want to \nprevent further damage, we must act to reform the way we manage our \nnuclear weapons programs and facilities to create accountability and \nresponsibility. Our most fundamental duty as Senators is to protect the \nsecurity and the safety of the American people. They deserve no less \nthan our best in this regard. I urge my colleagues to act now to halt \nthe hemorrhage of America's nuclear secrets and to support the adoption \nof this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona. He is persistent with this legislation. I appreciate very much \nhis interest in the beginning in trying to do something about, as he \nknows, what many people have previously said needs to be done.\n  The distinguished Senator from Virginia finally succeeded in getting \na provision accepted by the administration in the national defense \nauthorization bill having to do with an oversight committee appointed \nby the leadership, which I think will add a lot of value to our effort \nto make these labs produce good science and the best security as well.\n\n  I was asked the question, I say to my friend from Arizona, not long \nafter our caucuses, which the Senator from Arizona might be interested \nin: Do you think the Republicans want an issue or do they want to get \nsomething done?\n  My view is, Senator Kyl of Arizona, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, and \nSenator Domenici of New Mexico want to get something done. It has been \nprobably 20 years people have been calling to our attention the need to \nchange the structure of this organization. It is basically a hodgepodge \nof various agencies that were combined in, I believe, 1978 or 1979--in \nthe 1970's. Various agencies were combined into the Department of \nEnergy. It is very important we seize this opportunity.\n  Senator Rudman said he did not know what happened exactly, but all of \na sudden the focus is on it. A series of things have occurred that \npresent us with an opportunity to change this law. The law needs to be \nchanged. The law needs to be changed to restructure this agency to make \nit more likely that the United States of America and our interests are \ngoing to be safe and secure, and that we will continue to produce the \nhigh-quality science these laboratories are known throughout the world \nfor producing.\n  I have very high praise for the Senator from Arizona. I appreciate \nvery much his perseverance in this matter and his willingness to change \nhis own bill to accommodate former Senator Rudman, the PFIAB's \nrecommendations, and accommodate some of the concerns I had as well.\n  We are trying to write a law. I know Senator Levin and Senator \nBingaman, Senator Reid, and others, are going to offer some amendments. \nI say to my colleagues on the Democratic side, I believe, and I believe \nso strongly, that the Republicans do not desire an issue. They want to \nmake real change.\n  It would have been real easy, in fact, to say: OK, we got 10 or 11 \nthings on the defense authorization bill. You can say that is a \nsuccess; why fight that battle. We have encryption to do. We have lots \nof other issues--all of us do--to take care of.\n  I am very impressed with the fact there is a determination to get a \ngood piece of legislation that will improve the security of the United \nStates of America and will enable us to stay in the high-quality \nscience direction these laboratories produce. I hope the debate, which \nI am not sure is going to occur tonight--I understand we may not have \nany amendments offered to this bill until tomorrow. I hope I am wrong. \nIt will be nice to have people\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\noffer these amendments and get them out of the way so we can move on to \nother business.\n  I hope the debate is engaged in the same high-level manner that we \nhave negotiated the changes in this legislation. By high level, I mean, \nas I referenced earlier in praise of Chairman Shelby, the only test \nthat is important is: Does it make the United States of America more \nsecure?\n  I believe the amendment of the Senator from Arizona does. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of it. I intend to vote for it, and I hope \nsome of the changes being suggested can be accommodated, but most \nimportant, I hope we end this year changing the law and are able to \nlook into the future 10 years from now and say the laboratories are \nproducing the finest science and the highest level of security as well.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the indulgence of the chairman for just a moment. I \nknow he wants to proceed and make a brief comment or two. I want to \ncomment on a couple of things the Senator from Nebraska just said.\n\n  First of all, I compliment him. He is vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee and probably one of the most productive members \nof the committee in doing the hard work of protecting our Nation's \nsecurity, which most people will never know about.\n  For his constituents and others in America who are concerned about \nthese things, they need to know it is the day-in-and-day-out work of \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Shelby, and Senator Kerrey from \nNebraska who make this effort work.\n  Second, I compliment Senator Kerrey for working on this legislation \nand agreeing to support it at a time when his party's administration \nwas not yet supportive. Secretary Richardson did not agree to the \nconcept of a semiautonomous agency until relatively recently. But \nSenator Kerrey agreed this was the best approach to take, I think even \nbefore Senator Rudman came out with his report.\n  Coming out early and saying it is important to reorganize and to pay \nattention to the national security concerns at the Department of Energy \nwas something he was willing to do early on in a bipartisan way. His \nconduct throughout this whole matter is exemplary and should offer \nguidance to all of us on any issue we face. Party aside, when there is \na problem to be addressed, we get in and try to address it.\n  I assure Senator Kerrey and others on the Democratic side this is not \nsomething the Republicans look to as an issue but rather as something \nto get done. I hope before we finish with the amendments, we can \ncontinue to work on them and try to get as much of a bipartisan \ncoalition in support of the legislation as is possible because there is \nnothing partisan about national security and there is nothing partisan \nwhen it comes to espionage at our National Laboratories.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for the comments he made, and I \ncompliment both Senator Kerrey and Senator Shelby for the great job \nthey have done.\n  Senator Warner is on the floor. He has been stalwart in his support \nof our efforts, each day asking: What is new; we will stick with you; \nwe know this has to be done. That kind of support is encouraging.\n  We can get this done. If we get it done quickly, it is good for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \ncomments. I have worked along with the team, the principals. They were \ngoing to put the amendment on the armed services authorization bill. I \nthought at that point in time that an insufficient number of Senators \nhad had an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the seriousness of \nthis issue and that we should wait for the bill of our distinguished \ncolleagues from Alabama and Nebraska. A number of Senators have now \nacquainted themselves with those provisions. We have an impressive \nnumber of cosponsors, and I am privileged to be one.\n  I don't view this as any retribution against the President or the \nSecretary of Energy. It is something that simply has to be done with \nthese institutions that are enormously valuable to the Nation and our \nnational security. I use the word ``enormously'' because I can't think \nof another word that connotes a greater degree of importance to our \ncountry.\n  I went out a week ago yesterday and spent several hours at Los Alamos \nand then went on to the other laboratory. I must say, the impression I \ngained from talking with a fairly significant number of individuals, \nboth at Sandia and Los Alamos, was that they are willing to work with \nthis proposition as laid out in the Senator's amendment and make it \nwork.\n  I have listened to those who have some questions. As a matter of \nfact, I made myself available to work with Senator Levin. We worked \ntogether on the Armed Services Committee. It is still not clear in my \nmind exactly what he hopes to achieve. It is my expectation we will \naddress it tomorrow when the amendments come forward.\n  I know it is the right thing to be done in the interests of the \ncountry. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Indeed, his committee has held 11 hearings. The Senate Armed \nServices Committee also has had several. One broke a record; it was 7 \ncontinuous hours of hearing. It convinced our membership we are behind \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I also support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski \namendment that is the pending business in the Senate.\n  I take just a minute to commend the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nKyl, and Senator Domenici and Senator Murkowski for working together on \nthis very important amendment. It is important for the restructuring of \nour labs following the Rudman recommendation and others.\n  Most Members know the horror stories that have been going on for \nyears and years. This won't solve everything, but it will be a positive \nstep in the right direction.\n  I also note my colleague from Nebraska, the vice chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Kerrey, and I both support this. That is unusual. We \nbelieve this is not a partisan issue. This is important for the Nation \nas far as national security is concerned. It is a step in the right \ndirection. It is above politics, above party.\n  I mention again, as I did yesterday, the Rudman report, which was \nrequested by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, \nconcluded that purely administrative reorganizational changes at the \nDepartment of Energy labs are inadequate, totally inadequate to the \nchallenge at hand. He said:\n\n       To ensure its long-term success, this new agency must be \n     established by statute.\n\n  That is exactly what the amendment of Senators Kyl, Domenici, and \nMurkowski does.\n  As an indication of how badly the Department of Energy is broken, I \nonly have to remind my colleagues it took over 100 studies of \ncounterintelligence, security and management practices by the FBI, \nother intelligence agencies, the General Accounting Office, the \nDepartment of Energy itself and others, plus one enormous espionage \nscandal to create the impetus for change that is before the Senate this \nevening.\n  I think it is time for the Senate to act. I believe this is a good \namendment. It is positive. It has been worked. I believe we will pass \nit.\n  Mr. President, I support the Kyl-Domenici-Murkowski amendment to \nrestructure the Department of Energy.\n  I am a cosponsor of that amendment, as is the distinguished vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Kerrey.\n  By now, my colleagues are familiar with the findings of the Rudman \nreport, entitled ``Science at its Best; Security at its Worst: A Report \non Security Problems at the U.S. Department of Energy.'' But I think \ncertain key conclusions are worth restating, because they underline the \nneed for action.\n  The Rudman report found that:\n\n       At the birth of DOE, the brilliant scientific breakthroughs \n     of the nuclear weapons laboratories came with a troubling \n     record of security administration. Twenty years later, \n     virtually every one of its original problems persists. . . . \n     Multiple chains of command and standards of performance \n     negated accountability, resulting in pervasive inefficiency, \n     confusion, and mistrust. . . .\n       In response to these problems, the Department has been the \n     subject of a nearly unbroken history of dire warnings and \n     attempted but aborted reforms.\n\n  Building on the conclusions of the 1997 Institute for Defense \nAnalyses report and the 1999 Chiles Commission, the Rudman panel \nconcluded that:\n\n\n[[Page S8862]]\n\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. . . . \n     Reorganization is clearly warranted to resolve the many \n     specific problems . . . in the weapons laboratories, but also \n     to address the lack of accountability that has become endemic \n     throughout the entire Department.\n       The panel is convinced that real and lasting security and \n     counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply \n     unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. . . . \n     To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs \n     must have, they and their functions must have their own \n     autonomous operational structure free of all the other \n     obligations imposed by DOE management.\n\n  To provide ``deep and lasting structural change that will give the \nweapons laboratories the accountability, clear lines of authority, and \npriority they deserve,'' the Rudman Report endorsed two possible \nsolutions:\n  Creation of a wholly independent agency such as NASA to perform \nweapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions; or\n  Placing weapons research and nuclear stockpile management functions \nin a ``new semi-autonomous agency within DOE that has a clear mission, \nstreamlined bureaucracy, and drastically simplified lines of authority \nand accountability.''\n  The latter option is the approach contained in the Kyl-Domenici-\nMurkowski amendment. The new semi-autonomous agency, the Agency for \nNuclear Stewardship, will be a single agency, within the DOE, with \nresponsibility for all activities of our nuclear weapons complex, \nincluding the National Laboratories--nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, \nand disposition of fissile materials.\n  This agency will be led by an Undersecretary. The Undersecretary will \nbe in charge of and responsible for all aspects of the agency's work, \nwill report--directly and solely--to the Secretary of Energy, and will \nbe subject to the supervision and direction of the Secretary. The \nSecretary of Energy will retail full authority over all activities of \nthis agency. Thus, for the first time, this critical function of our \nnational government will have the clear chain of command that it \nrequires.\n  As recommended by the Rudman report, the new agency will have its own \nsenior officials responsible for counterintelligence and security \nmatters within the agency. These officials will carry out the \ncounterintelligence and security policies established by the Secretary \nand will report to the Undersecretary and have direct access to the \nSecretary. The Agency will have a Senior official responsible for the \nanalysis and assessment of intelligence, who will also report to the \nUndersecretary and have direct access to the Secretary.\n  The Rudman report concluded that purely administrative re-\norganizational changes are inadequate to the challenge at hand: ``To \nensure its long-term success, this new agency must be established by \nstatute.''\n  For if the history of attempts to reform DOE underscores one thing, \nit is the ability of the DOE and the labs to hunker down and outwait \nand outlast Secretaries and other would-be agents of change--even \nPresidents.\n  For example, as documented by Senator Rudman and his colleagues, \n``even after President Clinton issued Presidential Decision Directive \n61 ordering that the Department make fundamental changes in security \nprocedures, compliance by Department bureaucrats was grudging and \nbelated.''\n  At the same time, we in the Senate should recognize that our work \nwill not be done even after this amendment is adopted and enacted into \nlaw. As the Rudman report warned,\n\n       DOE cannot be fixed by a single legislative act: management \n     must follow mandate. . . . Thus, both Congress and the \n     Executive branch . . . should be prepared to monitor the \n     progress of the Department's reforms for years to come.\n\n  Mr. President, it is an indication of how badly the Department of \nEnergy is broken that it took over one hundred studies of \ncounterintelligence, security and management practices--by the FBI and \nother intelligence agencies, the GAO, the DOE itself, and others, plus \none enormous espionage scandal--to create the impetus for change.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use some leader time allocated to me today to \ntalk about another matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8862-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8862-S8864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REFLECTIONS ON THE DEATH OF JOHN F.

Like so many of us, I listened all weekend long to the \nnews reports, and held onto hope long past the point when it was \nreasonable to do so.\n  I wanted so much for there to be a different ending--for John F. \nKennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren to somehow, \nmiraculously, have survived. So like people all across our Nation, all \nacross the world, I kept a vigil.\n  Then, Sunday night, the Coast Guard announced that the rescue mission \nhad become a recovery mission.\n  Today, our thoughts and prayers are with the Kennedy and Bessette \nfamilies. We pray that God will comfort them and help them bear this \ngrief that must seem unbearable now. We offer our sympathies, as well, \nto the many friends of John Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and \nLauren Bessette. They, too, have suffered a great loss.\n  I want my friend, Senator Edward Kennedy, John's uncle, to know, as I \nhave told him personally, we are praying for him.\n  Just last week, Senator Kennedy stood on this floor and spoke about \npeople who had died too young, and the heartbroken families they had \nleft behind. He urged us to pass real patient protections so other \nfamilies would not have to experience that same pain.\n  Today, once again, it is Senator Kennedy's family, along with the \nBessette family, who are experiencing the pain of death that comes far \ntoo soon.\n  More than a century ago, the great New England poet, Emily Dickinson, \nsent a letter to a friend who had lost someone very dear. ``When not \ninconvenient to your heart,'' she wrote, ``please remember us, and let \nus help you carry [your grief], if you grow tired.''\n  I know I speak for many of us when I say to Senator Kennedy: Please--\nif there is any way--let us help you carry your grief, if you grow \ntired. You and your family have given our Nation so much. Let us--if we \ncan--give something back to you.\n  All weekend, I watched the news. Over and over again, I saw that \nheartbreaking image of the little boy saluting his father's coffin. \nThen came the announcement that the little boy was gone, too. And just \nwhen I thought I finally understood the magnitude of the loss, I \nlistened to the news again this morning, and I heard friends of John F. \nKennedy, Jr. say they felt certain he would have run for public office \none day--probably for a seat in the United States Senate.\n  I don't know if that is true. I do know that John F. Kennedy, Jr. \nbelieved deeply in public service. He believed what his father had \nsaid: ``to those whom much is given, much is required.'' If he had \nchosen to run for the Senate, I have no doubt he would have succeeded, \nand he would have been a great Senator.\n  I suspect we will regret for a long, long time what John Kennedy did \nnot have time to give us. I hope we will also remember, and treasure, \nwhat he did have time to give us. Those moments of joy when he was a \nlittle boy playing in the Oval Office with his sister and father; his \nstunning example of courage when he said good-bye to his father.\n  I hope we will remember:\n  His kindness and surprising humility; his inventiveness, and his \nprofessional success; the good humor and amazing grace with which he \naccepted celebrity; the dignity with which he bore his sorrows; and the \nhappiness he found in his life, particularly in his marriage.\n\n  Some years ago, another young man died too young. Alex Coffin, the \nson of Reverend William Sloane Coffin, was driving in a terrible storm \nwhen his car plunged into Boston Harbor and he drowned. He was 24 years \nold. Ten days later, William Sloane Coffin spoke about Alex's death to \nhis parishioners\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\nat Riverside Church in New York City. I want to read a short section of \nhis sermon, because I think it bears repeating today.\n  The one thing no one should ever say about Alex's death--or the death \nof any young person--is that it is God's will. ``No one,'' Reverend \nCoffin said, ``knows enough to say that . . . . God doesn't go around \nthis world with his finger on triggers, his fist around knives, his \nhands on steering wheels. God is dead set against all unnatural deaths \n. . . . My own consolation lies in knowing that . . . when the waves \nclosed over the sinking car, God's heart was the first of all our \nhearts to break.''\n  None of us knows why John Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and \nLauren Bessette were taken from us in the prime of their lives. We \ndon't know why the Kennedy family has had to endure so much sorrow over \nso many years. Nor do we know why the Bessette family has to suffer \nsuch an incomprehensibly huge loss all at once. What we do know is that \nthe hearts of the Kennedys and the Bessettes were not the only hearts \nthat broke when the waves closed over that sinking plane last Friday \nnight. We are all heartbroken by the deaths of three such remarkable \nyoung people.\n  Not long ago, I came across a book of poems by another man who also \nlost a young son. The man's name is David Ray. His son's name was Sam. \nSam also died, at 19, also in a car accident. After Sam's death, his \nfather wrote a whole series of poems to him, and about him. I'd like to \nread a very short one; it's called ``Another Trick of the Mind.''\n\n     Out of a book, a little trick--\n     Instead of the picture and much longing\n     for that lost face,\n     place yourself within the frame.\n     You are back together again, if only\n     in the past, or in the dream,\n     or this gilded picture in mind.\n     But it is no longer a dream, or a picture\n     of loss. And then you go on,\n     down the road you have to go, together.\n\n  In our memories, we all have a scrapbook full of images of John \nKennedy, Jr. Perhaps in the days ahead, when the sadness creeps up on \nus, we can imagine--just for a moment--that John and Carolyn and Lauren \nare still with us. And we can go down the road we have to go, together. \nAnd maybe when we play that trick on ourselves, and our sadness lifts \nfor that moment, we can remember how fortunate we were to have had them \nwith us as long as we did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak for just a moment to express \nmy profound sympathy and condolences to our colleague and friend, \nSenator Ted Kennedy, and the members of the Kennedy family, and for the \nBessette family, as well.\n  Although I know the pain of losing a loved one, I have little \nconception of the pain which Senator Kennedy and his family are feeling \nwith the multiple losses of family members at such early stages in \ntheir lives, and under such tragic conditions.\n  My heart is heavy with grief for the family, and my thoughts and \nprayers are with them. I can only pray that they realize and are \ncomforted in some small manner by the love, affection, and support of \nthe Members of this body, as well as people all across this nation, for \nwhom the Kennedy family is a symbol of courage, achievement, and \nservice to mankind.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to speak with regard to the \nfeelings in my heart and in the hearts of my daughter Mary, my daughter \nVirginia, and my son John on behalf of the Kennedy family.\n  My daughter Mary was a member of the play group at the White House \nformed by the President and his lovely wife Jacqueline Kennedy for \ntheir daughter Caroline and, my recollection is, three or four others \nof the same age. They were perhaps among the most photographed young \npeople in America at that time. Our family cherishes the pictures with \nCaroline and in some John-John was there. It was just a warm experience \nfor these youngsters to start their life.\n  Jacqueline Kennedy was so gracious to all of us in our family. I had \nknown Mrs. Kennedy when I was, my recollection is, in my early \ntwenties, and we were in the same group of young people who mingled \ntogether at various events in those days. I remember the absolute \nstartling beauty of that magnificent woman. We remained friends \nthroughout her life. She and the President briefly had a farm in \nVirginia which abutted on the farm that my then-wife Catherine and I \nhad, and I frequently saw her at sporting events.\n  The families were intertwined at a very young age. Previously, at the \nUniversity of Virginia Law School, while my period at that school was \ninterrupted by service in the Marines during the Korean war, Bobby \nKennedy was there, and we overlapped for a period of time. I remember \nparticipating in some of the touch football games and getting my first \ninsight into that extraordinary family.\n  My daughter Virginia knew John-John quite well. In past years, prior \nto marriage, they were in the same group that often attended events \ntogether.\n  This has left a very deep and sad feeling in the hearts of my \nchildren, and I know they would want their deepest sympathy conveyed to \nthe members of the family. I do that tonight, being privileged to be on \nthe floor of the Senate and talking about this most distinguished \nfamily.\n  I met President Kennedy on several occasions. I knew him, as a matter \nof fact, when he was a Senator. I remember very well one night going to \na television studio with him and some other people. I cannot recall \nexactly what the show was, but that night, for various reasons, is \ntucked away in my memory.\n  Then, of course, in the campaign of 1960, I was the advance man for \nPresident Nixon; and Bobby Kennedy was the advance man for his brother. \nWe had frequent but always pleasant and cordial meetings on the \ncampaign trail of 1960.\n  But the main purpose of my taking the floor is to express, on behalf \nof my children, our profound sorrow for this tragic event, and how we \nare all deprived of what I think in our hearts we believe would have \nbeen a great future for this young man, had the Lord seen fit to have \nhim remain with us. He was destined to go on to greatness, and we, as a \nnation, have been deprived. But we accept the Lord's will in this case.\n  All that could be done was done, primarily by the Coast Guard, the \nNavy, the National Transportation Safety Board, and others. I think \nthey are worthy of commendation for their services.\n  To our distinguished colleague, Senator Kennedy, I know, having \nspoken with him, he was looking forward to this wedding. So often this \nfamily has come together in hours of tragedy, but this wedding was to \nbe an hour of pure joy. He looked forward to it with expectation. But \nnow, of course, that has to be postponed, I hope for a brief period.\n  But I remember how hard the Senator worked on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I voted against him on every vote except one, and that has \noften been the case in my 21 years in the Senate serving with my \nfriend. And we have had many opportunities to work together on various \nthings. He is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which \nI am privileged to be chairman. When I was ranking member on the \nSeapower Subcommittee, he was chairman; and then for a brief period, \nwhen I was chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, he was ranking \nmember.\n  But I remember how hard he worked last week. His heart was in that \nbill regarding the health of the citizens of our Nation. It was just \nanother chapter in his long and distinguished career in the Senate.\n  I believe on both sides of the aisle he is regarded as one of the \nhardest working, most conscientious Members of the Senate. We have \nnothing but profound respect for him and the manner in which he, as one \nof the heads of this distinguished family, has worked to bring this \nfamily once again to the realization of a loss that they must accept.\n  Mr. President, we conclude today's proceedings by several of us \nspeaking on this. We do so from the heart and convey our prayers and \nsympathy to this family.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\n  I join in the expressions of my colleagues in expressing my profound \nsadness and regret at the fate that has befallen our colleague and \nmembers of his and the Bessette family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8864-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8864-S8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I will also make some comments about the \nreorganization of the Department of Energy with regard to its nuclear \nactivities.\n  I heard my colleagues speaking earlier on this subject. I think it is \none of those great times in the Senate where Members from both sides of \nthe aisle can come together and try to get something done for the \nbenefit of the country and for the benefit of our safety in a troubled \nworld. It is a historic opportunity.\n  Perhaps to lend a little bit of a different perspective or additional \nperspective, I should say, with regard to some of the work we do in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, it has to do generally with the \noperation of Government. We continually face instances where the \nGovernment is not performing the way it should. The taxpayers are not \ngetting their money's worth. We continually see instances of waste, \nfraud, and abuse. We have what is known as the high risk list; that is, \nthose Departments and agencies which are most prone to waste, fraud, \nand abuse. We see the same agencies year in and year out. We have \nreports year in and year out about these kinds of problems. It is \naffecting the way our people look at their own Government, which I \nthink is probably the most important underlying problem that we have in \nthis country. This lack of faith and trust in Government has become a \nrecurring theme in recent nonpartisan and bipartisan surveys of public \nopinion toward Government. This trend is definitely in the wrong \ndirection.\n\n  A poll released by the Counsel for Excellence in Government last week \nfound that just 29 percent of Americans say that they trust the \nGovernment in Washington to do what's right most of the time. This is \ndown even from last year's poll, which found only a 38 percent level of \ntrust. The National Academy of Public Administration recently released \na national election study poll this June that pegged the percentage of \nAmericans who trust Government at a meager 32 percent. According to the \nPew Research Center for the People and the Press, it is poor Government \nperformance that is the leading indicator, the leading factor, in \nAmericans' distrust of the Federal Government. An overwhelming majority \nof the public--74 percent--say that the Government does only a fair or \npoor job in managing its programs and providing services. The National \nAcademy of Public Administration reports that survey respondents \ncomplain about Government failures, stating that Government becomes \npart of the problem, is too big, serving others, doing nothing, and \nwasting money. So we have seen that over a period of years.\n  Time and time and again, we have had reports bringing this to our \nattention. All too often, we wind up talking about it and doing very \nlittle about it. But now we find that we are faced with a different \nkind of lack of performance as far as our Government is concerned. \nMaybe we can afford certain breakdowns. Maybe we can afford certain \nfraud, inefficiencies, and waste, but we are facing a different kind \nnow, and that has to do with our national security. Time and time \nagain, we see instances where the right hand within a department does \nnot know what the left hand is doing.\n  We recently received the inspector general's report from the \nDepartment of Justice which demonstrated that we on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee did not receive evidence and did not receive \nmaterials showing people with strong ties to the Chinese government at \nthe same time they were making political contributions in this country. \nSix inspectors general gave us a report recently regarding how our \nexport control system was working. We found out that it is not working \nvery well at all. We don't know very much, sometimes, about who is \ndoing the exporting. We don't know much about who the end users are and \nwhat they are doing with these dual-use technologies we are sending \nthem, some of which can be used for military purposes. The law requires \nthat we train our licensing officers. But we are not following that \nlaw. We have no training programs with regard to our licensing \nofficers. We are supposed to be checking up on our foreign visitors \nthere and making sure that when they visit the labs, they are not \ncoming away with information that they should not be having. We are not \ndoing a good job there.\n  The law requires that we keep up with the cumulative effect of the \nexports we are sending to these other countries, but we are not doing \nthat either. We found out recently that, with regard to trying to get \nmaterials regarding someone who is a suspect, actual espionage \nactivities broke down interdepartmentally between the Department of \nEnergy and the Department of Justice because of a lack of \ncommunication. We were trying to get a search warrant there; it never \ncame about. If we had the correct information and had been really \ntalking to each other and had a system whereby we could exchange \ninformation after asking the right questions, we would not even have \nneeded that search warrant. These are all instances where the \nGovernment is not performing in the way the Government should be \nperforming. And now we see a systematic breakdown with regard to the \nsecurity at our national laboratories.\n\n  This is bad enough in and of itself at any time. But I think it is \nespecially disturbing now that we understand more and more that we are \nliving in a different world than we have been living in in times past. \nI think that after the end of the Cold War, when we didn't have the big \nSoviet Union threat anymore, we let our guard down in this country. We \nthought that we could place less emphasis on preparedness, readiness, \nnational security, and things of that nature. The Chinese were in no \nposition to pose a direct threat to us, and we felt the Soviet Union \ncertainly was not. Yet as we look around the world, we see that new \nthreats are developing. We got the Rumsfeld report, and we understand \nnow that rogue nations around this world are rapidly developing \nbiological, nuclear, and chemical capabilities that pose a threat to \nthis country. Then we have the Cox report, which tells us what we have \nlost with regard to our own national laboratories, in terms of nuclear \ntechnology and perhaps even nuclear materials. The President's own \nFederal foreign intelligence advisory committee, led by Senator Rudman, \nnow points out the difficulties that we are having in that regard.\n  It is a different world. So we must ask ourselves: If not now, when? \nIf we can't, at long last, after all these reports--and Senator Rudman \npointed out that there had been over a hundred reports over the years \npointing out the problems that we were having at our national labs. Yet \nvery little was done. So it takes a tremendous amount. We have seen in \nthese nonmilitary matters, non-national security matters, how difficult \nit is. The Government has gotten too big and complex, with layer upon \nlayer of assistants and deputy assistants in these departments, and we \nare having less and less accountability and more and more complexity, \nmore and more of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is \ndoing.\n  So now, at long last, when we have someone, such as the President's \nown commission, report to us that within the Department of Energy there \nis no accountability, that it is dysfunctional, that it is saturated \nwith cynicism and disregard for authority, that it is incapable of \nreforming itself, that it will do whatever is necessary, apparently, to \ndelay reform, certainly this must get our attention.\n  I believe from listening to my colleagues and the way this thing is \ndeveloping, perhaps maybe at long last our attention has been gotten. \nAnd what is being proposed now in terms of reorganization is a very \nstraightforward approach. It is not nearly as radical as some people \nwould like to go. Many people would like to take matters of nuclear \nsafety, our laboratories and nuclear materials totally outside the \nDepartment of Energy and set up a totally different entity to deal with \nthem. This bill doesn't do that. It keeps it within the Department of \nEnergy. The Secretary of Energy continues to set the policy for the \ndepartment. And the newly created Under\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\nSecretary for Nuclear Stewardship reports to the Secretary and is under \nthe supervision of the Secretary. So you still have direct lines of \nreporting. You have more accountability. You have a simplified \nreporting system. You would not have any more of this Rube Goldberg-\ntype of organization chart that we see within the Department of Energy, \nunder which you could not tell who is responsible for what.\n\n  At long last, as difficult as it is to reform Government, as \ndifficult as it is to stop waste, fraud, and abuse, when we are told \nabout it every year, told about it all the time, now that we know we \nhave this significant problem with regard to the most significant \nmatter that can plague a country, dealing with national security, \nsurely we can take the necessary steps in order to turn this thing \naround.\n  I know there will be amendments proposed. I have never seen a piece \nof legislation that perhaps could not stand a bit of improvement. I do \nnot really know the thrust of the amendments that will be proposed. But \nI urge my colleagues that, as we go along in considering these \namendments, ask the question: Does this enhance or does this defuse \naccountability?\n  We need accountability more and more throughout Government. We can \nvery seldom place responsibility anywhere anymore for mishaps in \nGovernment. But here we must have it. We certainly must have it with \nregard to the Department of Energy and our nuclear stewardship. I am \ndelighted with the way this has progressed. The changes are not a \ndraconian, and it is a revolutionary approach. It is an approach that \nwill enhance accountability. It gives us an opportunity not only to do \nsomething with regard to national security in this country but perhaps \nto take some first steps toward restoring the American public's faith \nin their own Government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for 20 minutes to be equally \ndivided between myself and Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the amendment just sent to the desk, it \nis my understanding, has now been agreed to by both sides, which \nSenator Feinstein and I are most happy about.\n  This piece of legislation evolved earlier in the year. Senator \nFeinstein will speak for herself, but she and I have been engaged in \nthe issue of narcotics trafficking in our hemisphere and in the world \nand have become deeply worried about its effect on the United States \nand have envisioned this as a new tool for our Government.\n  To give you a bit of a background, the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act is a follow on to the former Trading With The Enemy \nAct. Its purpose is to stop all economic activity, commerce, trade, and \nfinance with rogue nations, such as Libya and North Korea, that are \nnational security threats to the United States.\n  In 1995, President Clinton expanded this act through an executive \norder to include specially designated narcotics traffickers. As issued, \nthe President's executive order applies to four drug traffickers \naffiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal was and remains to \ncompletely isolate the targeted drug traffickers. The executive order \nthat the President issued in 1995 blocks any financial, commercial and/\nor business dealings with any entity associated with the four named \ndrug traffickers, to include criminal associates, associated family \nmembers, related businesses and financial accounts.\n  What would this amendment accomplish? It takes the President's 1995 \nExecutive order and codifies it in the law and expands it to include \nother foreign narcotic traffickers deemed as a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  It freezes the assets of drug traffickers under U.S. jurisdiction and \ncuts off their ability to do business in the United States.\n  There is the arrow pointed at the problem. It begins to isolate these \nnefarious forces and their effect on the United States.\n  As under the President's Executive order, the Treasury Department's \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control would develop a list of specially \ndesignated narcotics traffickers in consultation with the Department of \nJustice and the Department of State. Anyone who appears on the list is \nprohibited from conducting any economic activity with the United \nStates.\n  American firms or individuals who violate this prohibition will be \nsubject to significant financial penalty and potential prison terms. \nThe Treasury Office of Foreign Assets would enforce the sanctions, \nwhich carry criminal penalties of up to $500,000 per violation for \ncorporations, and $250,000 for individuals, as well as up to 10 years \nin prison.\n  The goal is to provide another weapon in the war on drugs by \ncompletely isolating targeted drug traffickers.\n  Taking legitimate U.S. dollars out of drug dealers' pockets is a \nvital step in destroying their ability to traffic narcotics across our \nborders. This is a bold but necessary tool to fight the war on drugs.\n  Let me say before I turn to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, as early as 1 hour ago I was in communication \nwith representatives of the Treasury Department and the administration \nof a willingness to continue as this legislation works its way through \nthe Congress to work with them to perfect the legislation. It is an \nimportant new tool. It is premised on an action this President has \nalready emboldened and taken and simply expands it.\n\n  We must confront the growing strength of impunity of drug cartels. \nSeveral months ago former DEA Administrator, Tom Constantine, testified \nabout Mexican drug cartels. He said:\n\n       Organized crime groups from Mexico continue to pose a grave \n     threat to the citizens of the United States. In my lifetime, \n     I have never witnessed any group of criminals who have had \n     such a terrible impact on so many individuals and communities \n     in our Nation.\n\n  Of course, this is not Mexico-specific. This is a broad tool to deal \nwith narcotics and their activities anywhere in the world. With drugs \ncontinuing to pour across our border, there is no other way to think \nabout drug trafficking than as a fundamental threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  Several years ago, in a meeting with the President of Mexico, \nPresident Zedillo, he said--and he has said such publicly since--that \nthere is no threat as dangerous to the security of the Republic of \nMexico as the narcotics traffickers.\n  We must use every weapon in our arsenal to strike at the heart of \nthis scourge--those who traffic these drugs. By expanding the use of \nthe President's international emergency economic powers to target drug \nkingpins and their empires, we can work year-round to help drive these \ntraffickers out of business--no matter where they exist.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from California, not only for her \nwork in perfecting this amendment but for her ongoing work and concern \nabout the effects of narcotics on the stability of the democracies in \nthis hemisphere, and, of course, its effect--its dramatic effect--on \nthe citizens of the United States.\n  I am reminded--as we talked during several debates about things that \nare so critically important to us--and we might be reminded that 14,000 \npeople a year die of the narcotic impact, not to mention 100,000 crack \nbabies. The list goes on and on.\n  There is no segment of public policy that is any more important. \nThere are some that are as important but none any more important with \nregard to the safety of the people of the United States--and, for that \nmatter, this hemisphere--than our work on narcotics and the peripheral \nissues that deal with it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I want to begin by thanking the Senator from Georgia. We have been at \nthis for a few years now. I want him to know it has been a great \npleasure for me to work with him, and I thank him for the leadership \nand the spirit he has shown on this issue.\n  It has been very heartening for me to work across that center divide \nand hopefully see this amendment finally enacted today, and hopefully \nafter going to the House in conference, come back here, and then be \nsigned by the President.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the Senator from Georgia so well \nstated, this legislation is patterned after the President's Executive \norder that he issued in 1995 which targeted the assets of the powerful \nColombian drug kingpins.\n  That order expanded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \nto include ``specially designated narcotics traffickers.'' As issued, \nthe President's Executive order applied to four drug traffickers \naffiliated with the Colombian Cali cartel. The goal is to completely \nisolate those targeted drug traffickers.\n  The Executive order blocks any financial, commercial, and/or business \ndealings with any entity associated with those named traffickers--to \ninclude criminal associates, associated family members, related \nbusinesses, and financial accounts.\n  The way this amendment would work is the Treasury Department's Office \nof Foreign Assets Control would develop a list of specially designated \nnarcotics traffickers worldwide in consultation with the Department of \nJustice, the CIA, and the Department of State.\n  The President could amend the list, and he would officially sign off \non the list. Then that Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets \nControl would enforce sanctions with criminal penalties of up to \n$500,000 per violation for corporations, and $250,000 for individuals, \nas well as up to 10 years in prison.\n  It is a meaningful sanction.\n  By focusing on the financial relationship between drug cartels and \ntheir associated business relationships, the Executive order--and now \nthis amendment--is directed toward those entities that created the drug \nproblem in our country. And those entities can be located anywhere in \nthe world. They are major drug traffickers.\n  This order has proven successful in quelling the Colombian Cali \ncartel. This amendment expands it worldwide. Under this Executive \norder, more than 400 Colombian and other companies and individuals \naffiliated with drug trafficking have been targeted by the Treasury \nDepartment. These entities are denied access to banking services in the \nUnited States and Colombia. Existing bank accounts have actually been \nshut down. As a result, more than 400 Colombian accounts have been \nclosed. That has affected over 200 companies and individuals engaged in \ndrug trafficking.\n  By February 1998, through the President's Executive order, over 40 of \nthese companies with estimated combined annual sales of over $200 \nmillion have been forced out of business.\n  The Rodriguez Orejuela business of the Cali cartel has been \nparticularly damaged by their lack of access to banks in the United \nStates and Colombia. These companies have been forced to operate \nlargely on a cash basis because most banks now refuse to provide them \nservices.\n  One of the cartel's holdings, Laboratorios Kressfor, eventually went \nthrough liquidation because of blocking actions by the U.S. banks. \nOther business accounts were closed because of the sanctions it \nincurred as a result of doing business with drug traffickers. This \ncompany, too, is now in liquidation.\n  Drug cartels today are more powerful, more violent, and have a far \ngreater reach than traditional organized crime organizations ever had \nin the past, and they kill more people.\n  I believe they pose a most significant threat to the national \nsecurity of this country.\n  We have seen that destructive power over and over again. In Colombia, \nMexico, Burma, Cambodia, Nigeria, and elsewhere drug traffickers have \nused violent means to pursue their deadly trade. They are the common \nenemy of all civilized nations. We need to work together to meet this \ncommon threat.\n  The United States is not immune from the devastating effects of \nglobal drug trade. Measured in dollar values, at least four-fifths of \nall illicit drugs consumed in the United States are of foreign origin. \nFour-fifths of drugs consumed in the United States are of foreign \norigin, including virtually all of the cocaine and heroin.\n  These cartels have now made strong inroads in major cities including \nLos Angeles, Phoenix, Dallas, San Francisco, and San Diego. They are \nenlisting and have enlisted street gangs as distributors. They are \nspreading their operations throughout our Nation and arrests are taking \nplace in less likely places--Des Moines, IA; Greensboro, NC; Yakima, \nWA; New Rochelle, NY.\n  The President's 1995 Executive order targeting the Cali cartel in \nColombia was an effective means of isolating the cartel and its \naffiliated businesses. It choked off vital revenue streams and helped \nthe Colombian Government take down the cartel.\n  With the authority to reach countries beyond Colombia, the President \ncan now work, if this amendment is passed, to isolate other major \ncriminal drug syndicates around the world and impose upon them and \ntheir associates a similar fate to that of the Cali cartel. It is my \nhope that with a new emphasis on this expanded authority and with the \nconcerted intelligence effort to develop sufficient data about the \ncartels and their associates in this country and abroad, the United \nStates will be able to work with our allies to expose, isolate, and cut \noff the major drug-trafficking syndicates that pose a threat to all of \nour societies.\n  This crucial mission can only be accomplished together. We must work \ntogether to see that our governments are properly equipped to carry it \nout successfully. To that end, this amendment establishes clear \nprocedures through which the Treasury Department, the Justice \nDepartment, the CIA, and the Defense Department can gather information, \nshare that information with their counterparts, and make \nrecommendations to the President as to those cartels that represent the \ngreatest risk to our Nation.\n  Coordinated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control in the Department \nof Treasury, the expanded program will target new international drug \ncartels with the same successful financial choke holds that worked so \nwell in Colombia. This will not be an easy process. The results will \nnot be immediate. A great deal depends on intelligence and its \navailability. It also must be applied universally.\n  This legislation is a serious effort to hit the world's major \ntraffickers where they live and to put them and their associates out of \nbusiness.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell for working so tirelessly with me on this \nbill. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting \nour efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will take a minute this evening to thank \nSenator Coverdell and also Senator Feinstein for having the foresight \nand initiative to expand and to improve upon what is already a highly \nsuccessful weapon in our Nation's fight against international narcotics \ntrafficking.\n  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act was expanded 4 years \nago under Executive order to target specific drug trafficking kingpins \noperating from Colombia.\n  Our colleagues' legislation expands upon that Executive order by \nallowing similar actions to be taken against additional kingpins \nworldwide.\n  Any future designation of foreign narcotics traffickers under this \nact would still be made by the President, but recommendations to the \nPresident will now come from the entire U.S. counter-narcotics \ncommunity, to include law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory \nofficials.\n  Once designated, those foreign drug kingpins would soon see their \naccess to the U.S. economy completely disappear.\n  Without the ability to place illicitly derived proceeds into commerce \nand trade in the United States, these kingpins and their illicit \norganizations will wither and fade away.\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\n  Denying these foreign traffickers the opportunity to participate in \nthe vibrant and growing U.S. economy is truly a decisive weapon in the \nwar on drugs.\n  I again thank my colleagues for their fine work on this measure. I \nalso state for the Record that I fully support and approve \nincorporating their measure into the Legislation Authorization Act \nwhich is before the Senate. I also state that my colleague, the vice \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Kerrey, has asked I \nnote for the Senate that he also concurs in this amendment and extends \nhis congratulations.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1259) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8868-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, on July 16, the Robert J. Dole Institute for \nPublic Service and Public Policy at the University of Kansas hosted a \ndiscussion of civility and deliberation in the United States Senate.\n  Long subjects of interest to me, I was heartened to learn of this \nevent. In an age of media and money-driven politics, it is important to \nremember that what we Senators must truly strive to be about has little \nto do with either the media or money. Discussions such as this one \nremind us all of the essential nature of this body in which we are so \nprivileged to serve, and of the responsibility each of us bears to help \nthis great institution, the United States Senate, continue to reflect \nthe Framers' intent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of the Honorable Robert J. \nDole, and the remarks of Mr. Harry C. McPherson, former Special Counsel \nto President Lyndon B. Johnson, be inserted in the Record at this \npoint.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Remarks of Senator Bob Dole--Introduction of Harry McPherson, the \n                         Capitol, July 16, 1999\n\n       Thanks very much for the kind introduction, and thanks to \n     all of today's participants, many of them friends.\n       Harry Truman once remarked that he felt anything but \n     comfortable as a newcomer to the Senate. Then, one day, a \n     grizzled veteran of the institution took him aside and \n     offered him the following sage advice: ``Harry,'' he said, \n     ``for the first six months you'll wonder how the hell you \n     ever got to be a United States Senator. After that, you'll \n     wonder how in Hell everyone else did.''\n       I guess I'm still in the early stages when it comes to \n     having my name on a school of public policy. A professor has \n     been defined as someone who takes more words than he needs to \n     tell more than he knows. Kind of reminds me of a \n     filibustering senator. President Johnson, Harry's former boss \n     and mentor, liked to tell of the long-winded Texas politician \n     who never began any address without extolling at great length \n     the beautiful piney woods of east Texas. Then he would move \n     on to the bluebonnets and the broad plains, and down through \n     the Hill Country to the White Beaches of the Gulf Coast.\n       At which point he went back to the piney woods and started \n     in all over again. On one occasion he had just completed a \n     second tour of the lone star state and he was about to launch \n     into a third when a fellow rose up in back of the room and \n     yelled out: ``The next time you pass Lubbock, how about \n     letting me off?''\n       Let me assure you all: I have no intention of making more \n     than one pass at Lubbock. As you know, it's customary to \n     insert the word honorable in front of the names of public \n     servants. Sometimes it's even appropriate. The next speaker \n     is just such a case. In fact, he is one of the most honorable \n     men I know. Harry and I came to Washington about the same \n     time. As he writes in his classic memoir, ``A Political \n     Education,'' it was the era of the one party South. Come to \n     think of it, it was the era of the one party Senate as well.\n       Still, even if Harry and I spent most of our careers on the \n     opposite sides of the political fence, there is much more \n     that unites us than divides us. To begin with, neither one of \n     us have ever confused personal civility with the surrender of \n     principle. One way or another, our generation has paid a \n     heavy price in resistance to all of this century's extremists \n     who didn't want to serve humanity as much as they wanted to \n     remake or oppress it. Life for us has been a series of tests: \n     whether growing up in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, or fighting \n     a war against Nazi tyranny, or waging a moral offensive \n     against Jim Crow and other hateful barriers to human \n     potential; whether sending a man to stroll on the surface of \n     the moon, or standing up for American values across four \n     decades of Cold War . . . all of these enterprises, vast as \n     they were, enlisted the common energies of a nation that is \n     never better than when tackling the impossible.\n       Along the way we discovered that there was no Republican or \n     Democratic way to fight polio or even invent the Internet. \n     Almost forty years have passed since I first arrived in this \n     town as the lowest ranking creature in the political food \n     chain--a freshman Congressman. My ideological credentials \n     were validated by a local political boss in west Kansas \n     who told a friend, ``Heck, I know he's a conservative--the \n     tires on his car are threadbare.'' I never claimed to be a \n     visionary. I came to Washington to do the decent thing by \n     people in need, without bankrupting the Treasury or \n     depriving entrepreneurs of the incentive or capital with \n     which to realize their dreams. I brought from Kansas the \n     conviction that most people are mostly good most of the \n     time. Something I also learned: that an adversary is not \n     the same thing as an enemy.\n       It may be hard to believe, but those days one politician \n     could challenge another's ideas without questioning his \n     motives or impugning his patriotism. As Harry will attest, we \n     may have had differences over the years, but they were \n     programmatic, not personal. In the words of the late great Ev \n     Dirksen, ``I live by my principles, and one of my principles \n     is flexibility.''\n       Of course, in the great defining struggle over civil \n     rights, it was Ev Dirksen's flexibility that enabled him to \n     put aside narrow questions of party advantage and remind \n     colleagues that it was another Illinois Republican, by the \n     name of Abraham Lincoln, who gave the GOP its moral charter \n     as a party dedicated to racial justice. Throughout this \n     century, no issue has done more to call forth the better \n     angels of our nature. Whether it was Teddy Roosevelt inviting \n     Booker T. Washington to dine with him at the White House, or \n     my hero Dwight Eisenhower, summoning federal troops to \n     integrate Central High School in Little Rock, or Harry Truman \n     desegregating the armed forces, or LBJ speaking at a Joint \n     Session in the House and shouting, ``we shall overcome,'' or \n     the bipartisan coalition that I was privileged to lead in \n     making Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday.\n       All this, I think, has relevance for today's discussion. \n     The topic is ``Civility and Deliberation in the United States \n     Senate.'' As any C-Span viewer can tell you, we have too \n     little of one and too much of the other. But why should that \n     come as any surprise? We are after all, a representative \n     democracy--a mirror held up to America. In this age when \n     celebrity trumps accomplishment, and notoriety is the surest \n     route to success in a 24 hour news cycle, voters are \n     understandably turned off by a political culture that \n     measures democracy in decibels.\n       Needless to say, it is pretty hard to listen when all \n     around you, people are screaming at the top of their lungs. \n     It's even harder to hear the voices of those who sent you to \n     Washington in the first place. In a democracy differences are \n     not only unavoidable--if pursued with civility as well as \n     conviction, they are downright healthy. Put another way, I'd \n     much rather deal with honest contention than creeping \n     cynicism. Yet that's exactly what afflicts our system today, \n     when millions of citizens regard all politicians as puppets \n     on a string, dancing to the music of spinmeisters.\n       Fortunately, there are still men and women in this town and \n     every town across America who disprove that view. They come \n     from diverse backgrounds. They vote for different candidates. \n     They speak various languages; they worship before many \n     alters. But this much they have in common; they are patriots \n     before they are partisans. At the same time they understand \n     the dangers that arise when any leader starts to calculate \n     his chances at the expense of his conscience.\n       One of the most inspiring stories I have ever read involves \n     the late Senator John Stennis of Mississippi, for over forty \n     years a lawmaker of towering integrity. In 1982 Senator \n     Stennis faced the toughest reelection fight of his career. At \n     one point early in the campaign, the Senator found himself \n     listening to a room full of experts who kept prefacing every \n     sentence with the phrase, ``to win, we will have to do \n     this.''\n       Courtly as ever, Stennis heard everyone out before \n     replying, ``there is one thing you\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\n     really need to understand before we go any further,'' he told \n     his political operatives. ``We don't have to win,'' John \n     Stennis understood that in a system such as ours, details can \n     be compromised, but principle never.\n       In the high stakes game of history, only those who are \n     willing to lose for principle deserve to win in the polls. \n     Only those whose principles do not blind them to the search \n     for common ground, can hope to rally a political system \n     intentionally designed to frustrate utopian reformers. As LBJ \n     like to say, ``I'd rather win a convert than a fight.''\n       In his memoir, Harry describes just such a confluence \n     involving Lyndon Johnson, in office less than two weeks, and \n     his onetime friend turned antagonist Jim Rowe. In the wake of \n     President Kennedy's assassination, the new President was \n     reaching out across personal and political gulfs, seeking \n     counsel and support wherever he could find them.\n       This led him to Jim Rowe, who protested at length that the \n     estrangement had been his fault, not Johnson's. They went \n     back and forth, until LBJ snapped, ``Damn it, can't you be \n     content to be the first man the thirty-sixth president of the \n     United States has apologized to?''\n       End of argument. And then Harry, on his own, reminds \n     readers how important it is under such circumstances to \n     swallow your feelings and smile even if it hurts. It's been \n     said that Washington lacks the fabled Wise Men of yesterday--\n     those vastly experienced sages whose instincts are even more \n     valuable than their Rolodexes. I disagree. Because I have a \n     friend and partner who is one of the wisest Men around. Both \n     his shrewdness and his generosity are as large as Texas. I \n     can't imagine anyone better qualified to address this \n     gathering than the civil and deliberate Harry McPherson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Remarks of Harry McPherson\n\n       Many years ago, after ``A Political Education'' was first \n     published, several senators and staff people told me I'd \n     gotten the place right. John Stennis burst into another \n     senator's office, waving a copy of the book, and asked, \n     ``Have you read Harry's book? He's got us clear as can be''. \n     I was tremendously proud when I heard about that.\n       But it wasn't long before other staffers, as well as a few \n     lobbyists and reporters, pointed out that I'd missed this or \n     that vital truth about the Senate; that I'd misunderstood why \n     Senator X did something that surprised me--a special \n     friendship between him and Senator Y had caused a certain \n     bill to be treated as it was; or that Senate rules and \n     precedents (which I thought I understood) required a result \n     that I had attributed to misbegotten ideology. Most of all, I \n     was told, with a pitying smile, I had completely failed to \n     take into account the importance of campaign contributions in \n     shaping what happened, or didn't happen, in the Senate.\n       I was embarrassed by these observations, which I \n     acknowledged to be true. When the book was republished, years \n     later, I asked to make changes in it, that would reflect what \n     I had learned in the intervening time. But publishing \n     economics being what they are, there could be no changes in \n     the body of the book. If I wanted to write an epilogue, \n     calling attention to these things, I could. And I did, \n     getting the politics a little straighter. Still later, a \n     third publisher offered the chance to write a prologue, where \n     I could disclose still further shortcomings in my earlier \n     understanding of the Senate. I chose instead to compare the \n     Democrats who ran the Senate in the early 90's with those of \n     the mid-50's, when I started to work here. I assumed, of \n     course, that those later Democrats would continue to run the \n     place ad infinitum. That version of ``A Political Education'' \n     saw the light in early 1995, just after Senator Lott assumed \n     the responsibilities of majority leader.\n       I relate these misadventures as a way of suggesting that \n     the Senate, small and visible and reported about as it is, \n     remains, at least for me, mysterious. This is not to say that \n     scholarly analyses of the Senate are inherently wrong. \n     Statistical summaries of the Senate's work can be valuable in \n     showing us how well the institution is performing. But there \n     are human factors at work in the place that aren't easily \n     captured by numbers. The Senate offers plenty of political \n     science material. But it's also a novel--simple enough, in \n     some respects, murky and ambiguous in others: like Joyce's \n     ``Ulysses,'' which is about a June day in Dublin, 1904, and a \n     Homeric saga, and God knows what else.\n       ``Civility and Deliberation'' are behavioral abstractions, \n     more natural to a novelist's view of the Senate than a \n     statistician's.\n       Indeed, it might seem that a statistical measure of the \n     Senate's productiveness--which would rate its ability to deal \n     effectively with major public concerns--needn't pay much \n     attention to quality-of-life considerations like ``civility'' \n     and ``deliberation''. If the Senate produces, it doesn't \n     matter--so this view would have it--whether the Chamber \n     resembles an abattoir when it does so. It isn't the public \n     concern whether Members of the Senate behave in a civil or \n     uncivil manner toward one another, or even whether they \n     gather together and deliberate before acting. What matters \n     are the results.\n       There is a degree of truth in this, of course. Voters \n     aren't usually focused on electing the politest candidate to \n     represent them in the Senate, nor the one who takes the \n     longest to make up his or her mind before acting on \n     legislation. Some of the great senators have been persons of \n     such force of personality, such power of will, such \n     intellectual arrogance, such irresistible energy, that they \n     were able to ram their work through the ranks of much more \n     polite, less wilful Members--and the nation benefitted from \n     that. The measure of the Senate's success as an institution \n     isn't whether it resembles a Victorian debating society, \n     tolerant, decorous, and patient, but whether it is able to \n     appreciate and deal with vital public needs.\n       On the other hand, I guess the reason we've met to discuss \n     ``Civility'' and ``Deliberation'' is that we suspect that \n     these conditions of Senate life may in fact be related to \n     Senate productivity. They aren't sufficient in themselves to \n     cause productivity, but they may be necessary to enhance it. \n     Put another way, what the Members feel about the quality of \n     their corporate lives may have something to say about how \n     well they perform as legislators. If it does, then the \n     conversations I've had with a dozen or so senators during the \n     past few days--from both parties--suggest that the modest \n     record of the Senate in recent times is the product, at least \n     in part, of inadequate civility in the Chamber, and a failure \n     to deliberate--by which I mean to discuss in a body, with the \n     possibility of changing opinions through argument--any number \n     of significant public issues.\n       Rather than list all the shortcomings of contemporary \n     Senate life that I heard about in these conversations, let me \n     draw the beleaguered, cartoon senator I saw emerging from \n     them, wishing I were Pat Oliphant and could do it with a \n     flick of the pen. For simplicity, I'll make him male.\n       He is obsessed by television, beginning with television \n     coverage of the Senate floor. Normally he doesn't go over to \n     the Floor except to deliver prepared remarks, and since he \n     can see what's happening on the Floor on the tube in his \n     office, he doesn't spend his time sitting there, taking in \n     the remarks of his colleagues. As a result there isn't much \n     debate, as we think of that term.\n       He is on a number of committees, so his attention is \n     fractured. Stuck in committee, meeting with lobbyists, or \n     working the phone to raise money for his next campaign, he is \n     unlikely to know much about issues on the Floor that one of \n     his staffers doesn't tell him on the way over to vote. If he \n     doesn't connect with the staffer, he simply relies on his \n     Floor leader's staffer to tell him what to do.\n       He doesn't bear down to learn much about any issue, with \n     exception for those indigenous and critical to his state. Why \n     should he? Why should be learn complicated arguments about \n     big issues, when a tidal wave of media talk has already \n     served to fashion public opinion? Why deliberate on \n     something, one Member asked, when everyone's already made \n     up his or her mind, thanks not to some eloquent senator, \n     but to the ubiquitous chattering classes outside the \n     Chamber?\n       He is partisan, either by nature or experience. He served \n     in the House, a Republican who backed Newt and the 1994 class \n     seeking revenge for years of mistreatment by the ancient \n     Democratic majority, or a Democrat, seeking revenge for \n     mistreatment by Newt, Armey, and DeLay.\n       Still, because he is, as a politician, naturally \n     gregarious, he would make friends, work, and trade with \n     senators on the other side of the aisle--except that his \n     brothers and sisters on his side tell him that those \n     senators' seats are up for grabs, and he should do nothing to \n     help them. Needing support from his own and unready to risk \n     it, he steps back. Though bipartisan support is necessary to \n     pass important legislation on tough issues, he's reluctant to \n     provide it.\n       He really doesn't know many other senators, on his side or \n     the other. Used to be, senators stayed in Washington until it \n     got really hot, and then went home. During their 7-day-a-week \n     residence in town, they got to know many of the others in the \n     Chamber. Now many Members go back home on the weekends. \n     Because of the righteous indignation of public interest \n     groups--the same ones who demanded more roll calls, to put \n     senators on record, and thereby made a lot of sound \n     negotiated compromises die aborning--because those groups \n     decried ``junkets'' abroad, there are few opportunities for \n     senators to get to know each other, and something about the \n     outer world at the same time. The constant pressure to raise \n     campaign funds further reduces time for socializing. For \n     reasons I cannot fathom, there doesn't even seem to be a \n     place where the tradition of having a drink with other \n     senators takes place regularly.\n       This senator isn't much of a ``deliberator,'' now, though \n     the pleasure of arguing political issues in college is one \n     reason he chose the career. Now he makes speeches written by \n     staff, attends hearings structured by the chairman and \n     interest groups to produce foreordained results, and engages \n     in few debates on the floor that might make him look bad at \n     home, or that might provide a potential opponent with a club \n     to beat him with. His every waking moment, he feels, is under \n     scrutiny. If he learns anything within the Senate, or \n     contributes to someone else's education there, it's likely to \n     be in a small group, behind closed doors.\n       Learning--even more, caring--about a big issue seems less \n     and less worthwhile. He'd have to devote a ton of time to it, \n     trying to persuade other distracted fellows to pay attention. \n     This is especially true in the case of those issues--like \n     improving the quality of elementary and secondary education, \n     reducing the incidence of violent crime in poor \n     neighborhoods, finding alternatives to imprisonment for drug \n     addicts--which don't attract large political contributions. A \n     friend\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\n     of mine, many years ago, reasoned that we could pass major \n     civil rights legislation if we could only find a way to \n     benefit builders, construction unions, and the oil and gas \n     industry by doing so.\n       The modalities of discourse--always addressing another \n     member through the Chair, for example, never saying ``you'', \n     never letting it hang entirely out--seem contrived and \n     unnatural to many Members, and it shows. But like manners in \n     society, these traditions make it possible for people to rise \n     above the harsh, wounding animosities of partisan conflict. \n     They mask the red fangs, and make communal life, particularly \n     in a spot-lighted commune like the Senate, more bearable.\n       This cartoon figure is not an attractive one, and there are \n     a number of senators who would not see themselves in it. Some \n     have friends across the aisle, with whom they work amiably, \n     and in complete, mutual trust; two partners of mine, Bob Dole \n     and George Mitchell, had such a relationship when they were \n     party leaders. Some Members long for a more thorough \n     deliberation of major issues; many of them wish for the means \n     of developing friendships--more especially, building trust--\n     with other Members. Several senators spoke appreciably of the \n     prayer breakfast meetings, in which senators have been known \n     to remove their togas for formal respectability, and reveal \n     the needy human beings within. I recalled a meeting with a \n     midwestern Democrat years ago, in which he told me that the \n     members of his smaller prayer group--six senators, evenly \n     divided by party--meant more to him than any other \n     association he had; he said the others often voted with him, \n     and he with them, because of that bond. It would have been \n     hard to find the cause of that voting pattern in the usual \n     statistical models. The ties that bond other senators to one \n     another are easier to discover: combat service in World War \n     II, for example, is a shared and unforgettable experience for \n     Dan Inouye, Bob Dole, and Ted Stevens, and it has always \n     shown.\n       The most interesting model of what the Senate could be, the \n     wished-for example most frequently referred to in my \n     conversations, was the experience of meeting, speaking, and \n     listening to one another in the Old Senate chamber, the Old \n     Supreme Court. There was no TV coverage; no reporters at all. \n     And the subjects--in one case national security, in another, \n     the impeachment of a President--were grave indeed, worthy of \n     the fixed attention of any man or woman.\n       It's too late to undo television coverage of the Senate. \n     The prayer group is not for everybody. Big government is \n     over, the President said, so there aren't many big mountains \n     of governmental effort to conceive, or to seek to tear down. \n     Campaign finance, the country's annoyance, continues to \n     depress the system with its demands on Members, would-be \n     Members, and contributors alike. The Old Senate chamber won't \n     do for daily meetings, and besides, TV and the press would \n     crowd out the Members if it were tried. Hard-edged \n     partisanship will continue for a while, even with Newt gone \n     from the House to the talk shows.\n       It's a quite legitimate question, to ask whether these \n     conditions have been better in the past. I think they were, \n     prior to TV coverage of the Senate, prior to the \n     geometrically escalating demands of fundraising. And perhaps \n     in some past eras the quality of the Members was higher: not \n     necessarily measured in intellectual fire-power, but in \n     dedication to the central task of the legislator: to \n     legislate. The Democratic Policy Committee for which I \n     worked, forty years ago, included Lyndon Johnson, Richard \n     Russell, Mike Mansfield, Hubert Humphrey, Lister Hill, Warren \n     Magnuson, Robert Kerr, Carl Hayden, and John Pastore. These \n     were true legislators, attentive to the task, prepared to \n     learn about that was before them and then to join battle in \n     the Chamber. Their superior qualities of attention and grasp \n     were what made the Senate of those days--at least in my \n     recollection--more serious than it often appears to be today. \n     And it is those individual qualities of senators that \n     ultimately determine the quality of the Body itself. Given \n     the nature of today's media- and money-driven politics, our \n     best hope is that our current Members, and those to come, \n     will be inspired by the best of the past to raise the level \n     of civility, and deepen the level of deliberations, in the \n     Senate they've been chosen to serve in their own day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8870-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8870-S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INVASION OF CYPRUS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, twenty-five years ago on this day, \nTurkish troops began their brutal assault on the people of Cyprus, \nforcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes and villages. Less \nthan a month later, after a cease-fire had been accepted and \nnegotiations toward peaceful resolution of the conflict were proceeding \nunder United Nations auspices, Turkey sent another, even larger \noccupation force of 40,000 troops and 200 tanks, seizing more than a \nthird of the island. For the last quarter of a century, Turkish \nmilitary forces have illegally occupied the northern part of the \nisland, forcibly dividing it. Communities have been splintered, lives \nshattered, a nation deprived of its cultural heritage and the \nopportunity to live in peace.\n  The events of 1974 took a harsh toll on the people of Cyprus that \nremains with us to this day. Hundreds of thousands of Cypriots who fled \nadvancing troops remain refugees in their own land, unable to return to \nthe homes and the communities they inhabited for generations. Others \nhave been stranded in tiny enclaves, deprived of the most basic human \nrights, forbidden to travel or worship freely. The beautiful coastal \nresort of Famagusta lies emply, bearing silent witness to what once was \nan economic and cultural center of the island. The Green Line runs like \na jagged scar across the face of Cyprus. An entire generation has grown \nup in the shadow of military occupation, knowing only division and \ndespair.\n  It is time for the world to recognize, however, that the Cyprus \nproblem is more than just a humanitarian tragedy. As we have seen in \nBosnia and Kosovo, when the suffering of a people puts peace and \nstability at risk, we also have a strategic interest in facilitating a \nnegotiated settlement. And as long as the Cyprus problem divides not \nonly a country, but two of our key NATO allies, the United States must \nwork to help find a solution. The success of the UN peacekeepers should \nnot for a minute obscure the real threat of conflict in the region. \nCyprus can be either a spark to confrontation or the starting point for \nreconciliation, and we have a hard-headed security interest in seeing \nit resolved.\n  In one of the tragic ironies of this situation, the man who ordered \nthe invasion is once again Prime Minister of Turkey. On this sad \nanniversary, we ask the President to call upon Mr. Ecevit to assume the \nmantle of statesmanship and acknowledge that the status quo is not \nacceptable. The Turkish government must demonstrate its willingness to \nhelp rectify this continuing injustice and to participate in good faith \nin U.S. and U.N.-mediated efforts to resolve it. The current situation \nhurts not only Greek and Turkish Cypriots but Turkey itself, and its \nrelations with the United States and the international community.\n  I am pleased to say that the Clinton administration has kept the \nCyprus issue high on the international agenda, raising it at every \nappropriate opportunity and assigning some of their most capable \ndiplomats to work toward a settlement. I would particularly like to \nrecognize the work of Dick Holbrooke and Tom Miller in this regard. \nAlthough Tom has just been sworn in as our new Ambassador to Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and Dick, I hope, will soon be confirmed as our Permanent \nRepresentative to the United Nations, they have played an invaluable \nrole in demonstrating the seriousness of this administration in \nbringing peace and justice to this troubled island.\n  In recent weeks there has been increased international attention \nfocused on the Cyprus problem, and a greater sense of urgency in \nbringing the two sides together. The G-8 for the first time has dealt \nwith the Cyprus problem in a direct and substantive way, urging the UN \nSecretary General, in accordance with relevent Security Council \nresolutions, to invite the leaders of the two sides to comprehensive \nnegotiations without preconditions in the fall of 1999. Unfortunately, \nthus far, Mr. Denktash, the leader of the Turkish-Cypriot community, \nhas sent a negative message on his participation in such talks.\n  Less than a month ago the UN Security Council endorsed the G-8 \nleaders' appeal and reaffirmed its position that ``a Cyprus settlement \nmust be based on a State of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and \ninternational personality and a single citizenship, with its \nindependence and territorial integrity safeguarded, and comprising two \npolitically equal communities as described in the relevant Security \nCouncil resolutions, in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation, and that \nsuch a settlement must exclude union in whole or in part with any other \ncountry or any form of partition or secession.'' Such a resolution, \naccording to the G-8, ``would not only benefit all the people of \nCyprus, but would also have a positive impact on peace and stability in \nthe region.''\n  Mr. President, the division of Cyprus has gone on far too long. I \nwant to take this opportunity to commend the thousands of friends and \nsupporters of a free\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\nand unified Cyprus who joined hands around the Capitol today. As we \ncommemorate this tragic anniversary, let us salute their courage and \nredouble our own efforts to help bring an end to this terrible and \ncontinuing injustice.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, twenty five years ago today, Turkish \ntroops invaded and divided the nation of Cyprus. This illegal and \nimmoral division of Cyprus continues today--dividing a country and \ncreating instability in the Mediterranean.\n  During the early days of the Turkish occupation, six thousand Greek-\nCypriots were killed. Over two hundred thousand were driven from their \nhomes. Many of the missing, including some Americans, have never been \naccounted for.\n  Little has changed in the past quarter century. Today, forty thousand \nTurkish troops remain in Cyprus. The Greek-Cypriots who remain in the \nnorthern part of the island are denied basic human rights such as the \nright to a free press, freedom to travel, and access to religious \nsites.\n  I am disappointed that we have made no progress in ending the \noccupation of Cyprus.\n  This year, as we mark this somber anniversary, I urge my colleagues \nto join me in recommitting ourselves to bring peace to Cyprus.\n  First of all, we must continue to make the resolution of the Cyprus \nproblem a priority. President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright \nhave focused more attention on this region that any other \nAdministration. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and Ambassador Tom Miller \nhave done an excellent job trying to bring both sides together. As \nAmbassador Holbrooke assumes his new responsibilities at the United \nNations, we must encourage the Administration to replace him with an \nemissary of equal stature.\n  The second priority is that we must continue to provide humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Cyprus. Each year, Congress provides \nfifteen million dollars to foster bicommunal cooperation in Cyprus. \nThese funds are used for education, health care, and to help both \ncommunities to solve regional problems--such as to improve water and \nenergy supplies.\n  These funds are an investment in stability in a strategically \nimportant region of the world. I'm pleased that the Senate Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill includes this funding. As a member of \nthe Subcommittee, I will continue to fight to ensure that the final \nlegislation includes this funding.\n  The third priority is that Congress should pass the Enclaved People \nof Cyprus Act. Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced this legislation \nto call for improved human rights for the Greek Cypriots living under \nTurkish control. I urge my colleagues to join us by cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the crisis in Cyprus has brought two NATO allies to \nthe brink of war. The occupation is also a human tragedy that should \nenrage all of us who care about human rights. We must continue to work \ntoward a peaceful and unified Cyprus.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate one of the \nmost tragic events of the 20th century. 25 years ago today, Turkey \ninvaded Cyprus, and it has occupied part of the island ever since. In \nfact, 35,000 Turkish troops continue to occupy almost 40 percent of \nCyprus' territory. Turkey's invasion forced the relocation of thousands \nof Greek Cypriots, it has led to the brutal treatment of the enclaved \npeople in the Karpas, and it has resulted in greater instability in the \nregion.\n  When Turkey occupied a portion of Cyprus in 1974, almost 200,000 \nGreek Cypriots were evicted from their homes and became refugees in \ntheir own country. 1,618 Greek Cypriots, including four Americans, have \nbeen missing ever since. After 25 years, the refugees have never been \nallowed to return to their homes in occupied Cyprus, and the missing \nare still unaccounted for. At the same time, Turkey has brought in over \n80,000 settlers to the occupied part of the island. These settlers were \ngiven the lands and homes belonging to Greek Cypriots, in violation of \ninternational law.\n  For the few Greek Cypriots that were allowed to remain in the \noccupied Karpas Peninsula, the situation has been equally grim. A 1975 \nhumanitarian agreement allowed 20,000 Greek Cypriots to stay in this \narea, but only 500 live in the Karpas today. These people have been \nsubjected to harassment and intimidation despite the terms of the 1975 \nagreement. Land travel in the north is heavily restricted, as is \nsecondary schooling and access to religious institutions. The United \nNations itself has observed that the terms of the agreement have not \nbeen honored.\n  As we reflect on the past 25 years, it is clear that the rights of \nthe Greek Cypriot population continue to be violated, that tensions \nhave not lessened, and that instability has become a greater threat. \nRather than lose hope, we must make a concerted effort to encourage \ndialogue and discussion among the parties. I have long advocated a just \nand peaceful resolution to the Cyprus conflict, and I hope that we will \nmake progress toward a solution before the next anniversary comes to \npass. Ending this impasse is in the best interests of the Greek Cypriot \npopulation, the region, and the international community as a whole. I \nurge this Congress and the Administration, as we mark the 25th \nanniversary of the Cyprus occupation, to evaluate the current situation \nand increase our efforts to ensure that a peaceful solution becomes a \nreality for Cyprus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8871-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     does hereby memorialize Congress of the United States to \n     adopt the Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999 or \n     other similar legislation which would eliminate the current \n     prohibition against the sale of food and medicine to the \n     people of Cuba; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-256.

Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to proclaim the first \n     week in August of each year as ``National Week of Prayer for \n     Schools''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-257. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the ``Comprehensive \n     Hurricane Protection Plan for Coastal Louisiana''; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 30\n\n       Whereas, Louisiana citizens living and working in southeast \n     Louisiana have been and continue to be vulnerable to the \n     devastating effects of hurricanes and tropical storms; and\n       Whereas, federal, state, and local governments have \n     attempted to provide hurricane protection to the residents of \n     the region by implementing construction projects designed to \n     protect specific areas; and\n       Whereas, a comprehensive plan is in need of being developed \n     to provide protection for the areas outside of existing \n     project boundaries which are subject to catastrophic damages \n     due to hurricanes and other storm events; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is analyzing a \n     plan, entitled the ``Comprehensive Hurricane Protection Plan \n     for Coastal Louisiana'', to provide continuous hurricane \n     protection from the vicinity of Morgan City, Louisiana to the \n     Louisiana-Mississippi border; and\n       Whereas, the plan will seek to expedite the ongoing \n     construction of several hurricane protection projects, seek \n     immediate congressional authorization for projects being \n     planned, initiate and expedite hurricane protection and flood \n     control studies in the region, initiate a study of flood \n     proofing major hurricane evacuation routes, and initiate a \n     reevaluation of existing hurricane protection projects to \n     provide for category 4 or 5 hurricanes; and\n       Whereas, the development of the plan will necessitate a \n     major cooperative effort of federal, state, and local \n     governments requiring a considerable amount of funds for \n     planning, implementation, and construction; and\n       Whereas, the association of Levee Boards of Louisiana fully \n     supports and endorses the concepts of the comprehensive \n     hurricane protection plan. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to authorize and urge the \n     governor of the state of Louisiana to support the development \n     of the ``Comprehensive Hurricane Protection Plan for Coastal \n     Louisiana'' by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide \n     continuous hurricane protection from Morgan City to the \n     Mississippi border; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, to each member of \n     the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress, and \n     to the governor of the state of Louisiana.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-258.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of the U.S.S. New Jersey, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              U.S.S. ``NEW JERSEY'' COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will assist with the financial costs of relocating the \nBattleship U.S.S. New Jersey to a place of honored retirement in her \nnamesake state. After fifty-six years of service to our Nation, this \nproud ship is ready to serve America in a new and invaluable role as an \neducational museum and historic center.\n  The U.S.S. New Jersey is believed to be the most decorated warship in \nthe annals of the U.S. Navy, with sixteen battle stars and thirteen \nother ribbons and medals. She is one of the four battleships of the \n45,000 ton Iowa class, which are the largest, fastest and most powerful \nwe ever built. Beyond her imposing size and physical characteristics \nthough, the New Jersey has an unmatched record of service to her \ncountry.\n  With the easing of world tensions, the battleship was decommissioned \nin February of 1991 and she now lays in reserve, ready, but destined \nnever to sail again. In January 1995, the New Jersey was stricken by \nthe Navy, meaning that she was available to become a museum. For 24 \nyears, the people of New Jersey have been organizing at the grass roots \nlevel to prepare for the eventual return to the ship.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing will authorize the \nSecretary of the Treasury to mint silver coins commemorating the U.S.S. \nNew Jersey. Millions of dollars have already been raised through the \npurchase of Battleship License Plates, an annual Tax Check Off and \ncontributions by many of New Jersey's leading civic and business \norganizations. The issuance of a U.S.S. New Jersey coin will add to \nthese efforts and help commemorate this national treasure.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``U.S.S. New Jersey \n     Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The U.S.S. New Jersey was launched December 7, 1942, \n     the start of nearly 50 years of dedicated service to our \n     Nation prior to final decommissioning in 1991.\n       (2) After commissioning, the U.S.S. New Jersey was sent to \n     the Pacific, and played a key role in operations in the \n     Marshalls, Marianas, Carolines, Philippines, Iwo Jima, and \n     Okinawa, with a particular highlight being the U.S.S. New \n     Jersey's service as the flagship for Commander 3d Fleet, \n     Admiral William ``Bull'' Halsey, during the Battle of Leyte \n     Gulf in October 1944.\n       (3) After the Allied victory in World War II, the U.S.S. \n     New Jersey was deactivated in 1948 until being called to \n     service for the second time, in November 1950.\n       (4) The U.S.S. New Jersey served two tours in the Western \n     Pacific during the Korean War, serving as flagship for \n     Commander 7th Fleet.\n       (5) After her valiant service during the Korean War, the \n     U.S.S. New Jersey was again mothballed in 1957, only to be \n     re-activated again in 1968 to serve as the only active-duty \n     Navy battleship.\n       (6) The U.S.S. New Jersey served a successful tour during \n     the Vietnam conflict, providing critical major-caliber fire \n     support for friendly troops, before again being \n     decommissioned in December 1969.\n       (7) The U.S.S. New Jersey's service to our country did not \n     end with the Vietnam conflict, as she was again called to \n     active duty status in December 1982 and provided a show of \n     strength off the coast of Nicaragua, in Central America in \n     1983.\n       (8) The Navy again called upon the U.S.S. New Jersey to \n     provide critical support by sending her to the Mediterranean \n     in 1983 to provide critical fire support to Marines in \n     embattled Beirut, Lebanon.\n       (9) The U.S.S. New Jersey continued to serve the Navy in a \n     variety of roles, including regular deployments in the \n     Western Pacific.\n       (10) The U.S.S. New Jersey was decommissioned for the \n     fourth and final time in February 1991.\n       (11) In 1998 Congress passed legislation to decommission \n     the U.S.S. New Jersey and permanently berth her in the State \n     of New Jersey.\n       (12) The State has strongly endorsed bringing the U.S.S. \n     New Jersey home, and has issued commemorative license plates \n     and taken other steps to raise funds for the costs of \n     relocating the U.S.S.

A bill to require the United States Trade Representative to \nappear before certain congressional committees to present the annual \nNation Trade Estimate; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                presentation of national trade estimate\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today requires \nthat the United States Trade Representative, the USTR, appear before \nthe Finance Committee in the Senate and the Ways and Means Committee in \nthe House, on the day that the National Trade Estimates Report is \nreleased.\n  USTR must deliver the NTE Report to the Committees. He or she must \nprovide an analysis of the contents of the NTE Report. And they must \noutline the major actions that will result from the NTE findings or \ngive the reasons for not taking action.\n  The NTE is an important document. It is the major opportunity each \nyear for the Administration to set out the key trade barriers we \nconfront with our major trade partners.\n  At present, our trade law requires merely that USTR report the NTE to \nthe President, the Finance Committee and the appropriate committees in \nthe House. The change I am proposing means that the NTE will be made \npublic on Capitol Hill rather than at USTR. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative will present both its analysis of the trade barriers and \nits plan of action to deal with those barriers. That presentation will \nbe made directly and immediately to the Congress. USTR should also \nexplain what they have done over the past year to address trade \nbarriers listed in the prior year's report.\n  This is a small change, but an important symbolic one.\n  The NTE should be the plan of action the Administration will pursue \nto dismantle foreign trade barriers. And USTR and the Administration \nmust be accountable to the Congress for the results of this plan.\n  During twenty-nine years of service in the United States Congress, I \nhave watched a continuing transfer of authority and responsibility for \ntrade policy from the Congress to the executive branch. The trend has \nbeen subtle, but clear and constant.\n  I want to see this trend reversed. We in the Congress have a clear \nconstitutional responsibility for trade. Article I of the Constitution \nreads: ``The Congress shall have power . . . To regulate commerce with \nforeign nations.'' I want to use this constitutional authority to \nprovide more effective and active congressional oversight of trade \npolicy. And I would like to see more congressional direction for the \nexecutive branch in the area of trade policy.\n  Again, this bill is a very small step in that direction. In the \ncoming weeks and months, I will introduce further measures to ensure \nthat the Congress implements fully its constitutional prerogatives on \ntrade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 1396. A bill to amend section 4532 of title 10, United States \nCode, to provide for the coverage and treatment of overhead costs of \nUnited States factories and arsenals when not making supplies for the \nArmy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  legislation to provide coverage and treatment of overhead costs of \n united states factories and arsenals when not making supplies for the \n                                  army\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my \ncolleagues, Senators Durbin, Grassley, and Harkin, to introduce a bill \nto preserve the integrity of our arsenals and the vital role they play \nin our national security and defense.\n  There are three arsenals remaining in this country charged with the \nresponsibility of maintaining a military production capability in case \nof war. The Rock Island Arsenal in my home State of Illinois is one of \nthose three national arsenals.\n  The U.S. Government acquired Rock Island, which lies in the \nMississippi River between Illinois and Iowa, in 1804. The first U.S. \nArmy establishment on the island was Fort Armstrong in 1816. Neither \nIllinois nor Iowa had established statehood at that time, but Fort \nArmstrong served as a refuge for pioneers living on the frontier. In \n1862, Congress passed a law that established Rock Island Arsenal. \nConstruction of the first manufacturing buildings began in 1866 and \nfinished with the last stone shop in 1893.\n  Today, Rock Island Arsenal is a leader in high-technology weapons \nproduction, engineering, and logistics and plays an integral role in \nour national defense, providing manufacturing, supply, and support \nservices for our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  I recently visited Rock Island Arsenal and was truly impressed with \nits facility and manufacturing capabilities and with its hard-working \npersonnel. Manufacturing production at Rock Island centers around \nrecoil mechanisms, gun mounts, artillery carriages, and the final \nassembly of Howitzers. Rock Island also serves as a ``job shop'' for \nthe U.S. military, producing small quantities of urgently needed \nspecialty items and performing work that is not profitable enough to be \ndone in the private sector.\n  Rock Island is the largest Government-owned manufacturing arsenal in \nthe Western World with state-of-the-art machining, welding, forging, \nplating, foundry, and assembly facilities.\n  Rock Island's specialty is artillery production, which it has done \nsince the late 19th century, resulting in a long and distinguished \nhistory of efficient production and effective products.\n  Rock Island has been very successful at producing towed artillery and \nhas also been responsible for the production work on all U.S. Howitzers \nfor the last 50 years. However, even with the state-of-the-art \nfacilities, expertise, and proven track record of the arsenals, there \nare those who would like to see them closed and transfer all military \nproduction to private firms.\n\n  Through those efforts, the arsenals have slowly but surely been \nmarginalized through the years. Currently, Rock Island Arsenal is \noperated only at about 20 percent of its capacity. This approach does \nnot save the Government money. It wastes it by making the Government \npay twice for any product an arsenal can manufacture.\n  Let me explain this point, because it is important to understand that \nour current policy does not save the taxpayers any money. Arsenals are \ncurrently kept open and on standby to gear up for production in the \nevent of a national military emergency. Therefore, the Army must pay \nthe overhead to keep them open whether or not the Army uses the \narsenals to procure equipment and supplies. When a contract is awarded \nto a private firm, the Army is still paying for unused capacity at the \narsenals, while at the same time paying the private contractor the cost \nof the contract. In effect, the taxpayers are paying twice for every \nproduct procured from a private contractor that could have been \nprocured from an arsenal.\n  The Army's procurement system hides these true costs from the public. \nThe Army's bidding procedures do not allow procurement officers to \nevaluate arsenal bids fairly. Current bidding procedures require \narsenals to include all of their full overhead costs, including the \ncost of unused capacity in the bid price for their products. This \napproach skews the true cost of the products produced by the arsenals. \nBy requiring that arsenal bids include the cost of unused plant \ncapacity--that is, those costs associated with the level of readiness \nthe arsenals are already required to maintain--the Army has rendered \narsenal bids inherently uncompetitive because the price of the product \nis artificially inflated beyond its true cost through the inclusion of \noverhead costs unrelated to the specific bid.\n  This bookkeeping fiction makes the bid price for arsenal products \nuncompetitive, even if the actual price of an arsenal product can be \nacquired at the\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\nlowest cost to the Government. Thus, not only must the taxpayers pay \ntwice for a product when it is not manufactured at an arsenal, but the \ntaxpayer may not be buying the lowest priced product.\n  The legislation I am interested in introducing today, Mr. President, \nwith my colleagues from Illinois and Iowa, would require the Secretary \nof the Army to include in his annual budget request a line item to pay \nfor the unutilized and underutilized plant capacity of the arsenals, \nthus recognizing the important role played by the arsenals in \nmaintaining our defense preparedness. By requiring the Army to account \nfor the overhead cost of unused arsenal capacity, the arsenals will no \nlonger have to artificially inflate the cost of their bids to account \nfor this overhead. Arsenals will be able to make competitive bids by \nvirtue of not having to abide by the fiction of including as overhead \nfor a bid the total cost of maintaining the arsenals. Instead, arsenals \nwill be placed on a fairer footing with private firms by including in \ntheir bid price only the overhead cost associated with the particular \nproduct on which they are bidding.\n  In the end, this approach will allow the Army to procure those \nproducts which arsenals are capable of manufacturing in the most cost-\neffective way.\n  Products manufactured by our national arsenals are among the best in \nthe world, and the arsenals deserve fair treatment and consideration in \nthe marketplace. In short, adoption of this legislation will enhance \nour national defense, save taxpayer dollars, and ensure the economic \nviability of the communities that surround our national arsenals, such \nas that in Rock Island, IL.\n  Mr. President, I ask for favorable consideration of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the text of our bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1396\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. OVERHEAD COSTS OF UNITED STATES FACTORIES AND \n                   ARSENALS WHEN NOT MAKING SUPPLIES FOR THE ARMY.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Factories and arsenals owned by the United States play \n     a vital role in the national defense by ensuring the making \n     of supplies for the Department of the Army.\n       (2) The vital role of such factories and arsenals in the \n     national defense is not diminished by their unutilization or \n     underutilization in peacetime.\n       (b) Overhead Costs of Factories and Arsenals When \n     Unutilized or Underutilized.--Section 4532 of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Overhead Costs When Unutilized or Underutilized.--(1) \n     The Secretary shall submit to Congress each year, together \n     with the President's budget for the fiscal year beginning in \n     such year under section 1105(a) of title 31, an estimate of \n     the funds to be required in the fiscal year in order to cover \n     any overhead costs at factories and arsenals referred to in \n     subsection (a) that result from the unutilization or \n     underutilization of such factories and arsenals in the fiscal \n     year due to low production requirements of the Department of \n     the Army.\n       ``(2) Funds appropriated to the Secretary for a fiscal year \n     for costs described in paragraph (1) shall be available to \n     the Secretary in such fiscal year to cover such costs.\n       ``(3) In determining the cost of making a supply or other \n     good, other than a supply for the Department of the Army, at \n     a factory or arsenal referred to in subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall not take into account any overhead cost \n     covered with funds available to the Secretary under paragraph \n     (2).''.\n       (c) Stylistic Amendments.--That section is further \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``Authority To Make \n     Supplies.--'' before ``The Secretary of the Army''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by inserting ``Abolition.--'' before \n     ``The Secretary''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 1397. A bill to provide for the retention of the name of the \ngeologic formation known as ``Devils Tower'' at the Devils Tower \nNational Monument in the State of Wyoming; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n            devils tower national park name preservation act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill which will enable \nDevils Tower National Monument to retain its historic and traditional \nname.\n  Wyoming is a state rich with heritage. We have cities and communities \nnamed after great explorers like John Charles Fremont, John Wessley \nPowell, and mountain man Jim Bridger. We have cities named after \nWilliam F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody, Civil War Hero General Philip \nSheridan and Army Fort Commander Caspar Collins. The state is also rich \nwith names that recognize the contributions by Native Americans. Our \nstate capital, Cheyenne, is joined with other areas named Shoshoni, \nWashakie, Arapahoe, Ten Sleep, Sundance and Shawnee. Wyoming also \nadopted many names that represent the unique geography that makes up \nour diverse state. For example, we have the Yellowstone, Riverton, Big \nPiney, Green River, Mountain View, Lonetree, and the Wind River Canyon.\n  One such place, Devils Tower, was named in 1875 by a military survey \nteam. You can imagine the impact on the group as it rode up to the \ntower more than 120 years ago. The gray volcanic tower sits on the \nplains of Northeastern Wyoming and shoots up, straight into the sky, \nfor approximately one-quarter of a mile. Its rugged walls and round \nshape make it look something like a giant petrified tree stump. I live \nin the area and have visited the tower many times. I can attest that \nthe name Devils Tower is clearly applicable.\n  Along with Yellowstone National Park's Old Faithful, Devils Tower has \nbecome an icon of Wyoming and the West. This unique structure is known \ninternationally as one of the premiere climbing locations in the world \nand therefore plays a vital role in the state's billion dollar tourism \nindustry.\n  I am, however, sensitive to the feelings of those Native Americans \nwho would prefer to see the name of this natural wonder changed to \nsomething more acceptable to their cultural traditions. Many tribal \nmembers think of the monument as sacred. However, I believe little \nwould be gained and much would be lost should Devils Tower be renamed. \nAny name change for Devils Tower would dredge up age-old conflicts and \ndivisions between descendants of European settlers and the descendants \nof Native Americans and would place a heavy burden on the region's \neconomic stability.\n  My legislation will prevent such an impact and will embrace the least \noffensive option offered so far--the preservation of the traditional \nname of Devils Tower. I urge my colleagues to support this measure. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, \n     notwithstanding any other authority of law, the mountain \n     located 44 deg.42'58'' N., by 104 deg.35'32'' W., shall \n     continue to be named and referred to for all purposes as \n     Devils Tower.\n      By Mr. HELMS:\n  S. 1398. A bill to clarify certain boundaries on maps relating to the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n              coastal barrier resources system corrections\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to \ncorrect errors in the Coastal Barrier Resource System maps which have \nresulted in the denial of federal flood insurance to a large number of \ncoastal North Carolinians in Dare County, insurance for which they \nunquestionably should have been eligible.\n  I've received many complaints from property owners about this \nsituation, and last year I and members of North Carolina's House \ndelegation asked the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether the \nmap of the ``otherwise protected area' overlaying the Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore was in fact accurate.'' (Property owners outside of \nthe seashore were being denied flood insurance on the grounds that they \nwere within the boundary of the ``otherwise protected area.'')\n  Mr. President, the background regarding this Senate bill that I'm \nintroducing today will explain the necessity of this bill's being \noffered:\n  Congress enacted the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990 (P.L. \n101-591; 104 Stat. 2931); within that act it established a \nclassification in the System\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nknown as ``otherwise protected areas'' which consist of publicly or \nprivately-owned lands on coastal barriers which were held for \nconservation purposes. While they were not made part of the Coastal \nBarrier Resources System, the Congress forbade the issuance of new \nflood insurance for structures within these areas. (Lands within the \nCoastal Barrier Resources System--undeveloped coastal barriers and \nassociated areas--are denied any Federal development-related \nassistance.)\n  All of the ``otherwise protected areas'' are depicted on maps adopted \nby the Congress in the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act. As needed, the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers these maps, works \nwith the Federal Emergency Management Agency, (FEMA) to determine \nprecisely where the boundary of otherwise protected areas are located, \nso that FEMA may determine whether specific locations are eligible for \nflood insurance.\n  After consulting extensively for more than a year with FEMA and the \nNational Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service has now advised us \nthat the maps of the ``otherwise protected area,'' known as NC03P, are \nindeed inaccurate. The errors in the maps deny flood insurance to \nproperty owners adjacent to the Cape Hatteras National Seashore in Dare \nCounty.\n  The errors result from inaccurate depictions of the Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore boundary on the standardized maps upon which Congress \ndesignated this area, and in part because of the problems inherent in \ntranslating lines drawn on the large-scale maps used for designations \ninto precise, on-the--ground property lines-a problem which neither the \nCongress nor the Interior Department appears to have considered when \nthis was enacted in 1990.\n  The fact that Congress designated the boundaries of coastal barrier \nunits and ``otherwise protected areas'' by maps, the detection of an \nerror in a depicted feature of the underlying map, or disparities \nbetween clear Congressional intent and the actual map, does not alter \nthe enacted boundary of the unit or area. Only any act of Congress may \nrevise such a boundary; the statute does not provide authority for an \nadministrative correction of such an error.\n  Although there is no statutory definition of, and little legislative \nhistory for, ``otherwise protected areas'', the areas so designated by \nCongress in 1990 were almost without exception depicted on maps \ntransmitted by the Secretary in his January 1989 report to Congress \npursuant to section 10 of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act of 1982. In \ndeveloping the recommendations and maps for that Report, the Department \nutilized the following definition, which was published in the Federal \nRegister (50 FR 8700):\n\n       A coastal barrier or portion thereof is defined as \n     ``otherwise protected'' if it has been withdrawn from the \n     normal cycle of private development and dedicated for \n     conservation, wildlife management, public recreation or \n     scientific purposes. . . .\n\n  This definition indicates that ``otherwise protected areas'' included \nonly the conservation areas upon which they were based. In addition, \nthe Administration has supported and Congress has enacted legislation \nin several instances where the stated purpose was to remove private \nproperty from the mapped outer boundary of an otherwise protected area.\n  I am grateful for the cooperation of the Administration in this \nmatter, I do regret that it look so long in this case.\n  The fact remains that the mistakes which led to more than 230 \nproperties in Dare County being placed within the outer boundary of the \n``otherwise protected area'' was clearly not intended by Congress when \nthe ``otherwise protected area'' was created.\n  The bill I'm introducing today will correct these errors, Mr. \nPresident, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation promptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPLACEMENT OF COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES SYSTEM \n                   MAPS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The 7 maps described in subsection (b) are \n     replaced by 31 maps entitled ``Coastal Barrier Resources \n     System, NC-03P'', designated as Cape Hatteras 5A through 5G, \n     and dated May 26, 1999.\n       (b) Maps Described.--The maps described in this subsection \n     are the 7 maps that--\n       (1) relate to the unit of the Coastal Barrier Resources \n     System entitled ``Cape Hatteras NC-03P'';\n       (2) are designated as Cape Hatteras 5A through 5G; and\n       (3) are included in a set of maps entitled ``Coastal \n     Barrier Resources System'', dated October 24, 1990, and \n     referred to in section 4(a) of the Coastal Barrier Resources \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 3503(a)).\n       (c) Availability.--The Secretary of the Interior shall keep \n     the maps that replace the maps described in subsection (b) on \n     file and available for inspection in accordance with section \n     4(b) of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. \n     3503(b)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kennedy, \n        and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1399. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nthat pay adjustments for nurses and certain other health-care \nprofessionals employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall be \nmade in the manner applicable to Federal employees generally and to \nrevise the authority for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to make \nfurther locality pay adjustments for those professionals; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                   va nurse appreciation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress a little known but very important issue within the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. The legislation would correct an injustice \nsuffered throughout this decade by a workforce of 39,000 dedicated \nnurses who devote their careers toward the caring of our nation's \nveterans. Due to an unintentional use of federal law, the VA has \nallowed nurses to go up to five years in a row without a single raise. \nIn some cases, VA nurses have received pay cuts by as much as eight \npercent in a single year, or received a token raise of one-tenth of one \npercent. I am today, along with Senators Dodd, Snowe, Landrieu, Reid, \nBoxer, Inouye, Sarbanes and Kennedy, calling on Congress to put an end \nto this practice by passing the VA Nurse Appreciation Act.\n  We find ourselves in this situation because of unintended \nconsequences. In 1990, Congress passed the Nurse Pay Act, which allowed \nVA medical center directors to give VA nurses higher annual pay raises \nthan other federal employees on the General Schedule (GS). At the time, \nthis well intentioned bill was needed to address a national nursing \nshortage in VA hospitals. However, after the shortage eased, many \nmedical center directors used the discretion given to them by the law \nto provide minimal raises and even pay cuts. In my own state of Ohio, \nfrom 1996 to 1998, VA nurses in Columbus took a 2.8% pay cut, while \nfederal employees in the same area received pay raises ranging from \n2.4% to 3%. This clearly was not what Congress had in mind when it \npassed the 1990 Nurse Pay Act.\n  Unfortunately, the problem is widespread and knows no geographic \nboundaries. From 1996-1999, nurses at sixteen different VA medical \ncenters had their pay rate cut by as much as eight percent, while other \nfederal employees received annual GS increases ranging from 2.4% to \n3.6% or more. In addition, from 1996-1999, no raises were given to \nGrade I, II or III nurses at approximately 80 VA medical centers around \nthe country.\n  To address this wrong, the VA Nurse Appreciation Act. This bill would \nensure that Title 38 nurses would be eligible to receive the same \nannual GS increase plus locality pay provided to all other federal \nemployees in their area. The bill would preserve the essential purpose \nof the 1990 Nurse Pay Act by giving the VA Secretary the discretion to \nincrease pay, or delegate this authority to VA medial center directors \nif they have trouble recruiting or retaining quality nurses.\n  Mr. President, what message are we sending to our veterans when we \nare not willing to pay the nurses that provide their daily care the \nsame pay increases that every federal employee now receives. Congress \nshould be dedicated to providing our veterans the\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\nbest possible health services, and putting an emphasis on top quality \nnursing care is a right step in that direction. This bill would end the \npractice of discriminatory pay cuts by directors of VA medical \nfacilities and provide the assurance of at least the GS raise received \nby all other federal employees. This bill is really about fairness. It \nwould help those dedicated workers who have not been receiving regular \npay raises for years. If we can pass this bill quickly, we can insure \nall VA nurses will receive a much-deserved pay raise in January 2000.\n  This bill is companion legislation to H.R. 1216, introduced by my \ncolleague and friend from Ohio, Congressman LaTourette. It has the \nsupport of the American Nurses Association (ANA), the American \nFederation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Federation \nof Federal Employees (NFFE) along with various veterans groups, \nincluding the Disabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica. The LaTourette bill has bipartisan support from more than 70 \nHouse members, including 11 members of the House committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Congress now has the chance to right a wrong and show VA nurses that \ntheir compassion and dedication are appreciated. I urge my colleagues \nto support and cosponsor the VA Nurse Appreciation Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the VA Nurse Appreciation \nAct and letters in support of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1399\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bipartisan bill will be \n     introduced by Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH) and Senator Chris \n     Dodd (D-CT).\n       The bill corrects an incongruity in the pay system for \n     workers at the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) which has \n     hurt nurses and other health care workers. For the last \n     decade, the roughly 39,000 DVA nurses who care for our ailing \n     veterans have been part of a unique, locality-based pay \n     system that gives hospital directors discretion over nurses \n     salaries. Unfortunately, this atypical discretion has been \n     used to freeze nurse pay, provide minuscule annual raises and \n     even cut pay rates by as much as 8% in a single year.\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs Nurses Appreciation Act, \n     which is being introduced at the request of AFGE, will \n     rectify the longstanding abuse of DVA nurses. It will put a \n     permanent stop to wage freezes and negative pay adjustments. \n     It will guarantee that DVA nurses and other health care \n     employees receive the same general schedule (GS) increase \n     plus locality pay given to virtually all other federal \n     workers, including federal workers who work alongside our DVA \n     nurses. Should the DVA have problems recruiting or retaining \n     quality nurses in the future, the Secretary will have the \n     flexibility to increase pay if necessary.\n       The primary purpose of this bill is to ensure that DVA \n     employees who have been denied annual pay increases will \n     start to be put on equal footing with their GS co-workers.\n       Veterans service organizations such as the Disabled \n     American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans of America, and the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America support passage of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Nurses Appreciation Act of \n     1999.\n       Year after year, DVA nurses have lagged behind in pay \n     increases, as compared to their GS co-workers. For example, \n     in 1996, the average pay raise for nurses was 1.2 percent; \n     compared to the 2.4 percent average increase received by \n     their GS co-workers. In 1997, the average pay raise for \n     nurses was again 1.2 percent, compared to the 3.0 percent \n     average increase received by their GS co-workers. In 1998, \n     the average pay raise for nurses was 2.2 percent, compared to \n     the 2.9 percent average increase received by their GS co-\n     workers. In 1999, the average pay raise for nurses was 3.0 \n     percent, compared to the 3.6 percent average increase \n     received by their GS co-workers. From 1996 through 1999, DVA \n     nurses on average were denied a pay raise equal to 4.5 \n     percent because of the current pay system for nurses.\n       DVA nurses, like their co-workers, deserve praise and \n     respect for standing by our nation's veterans. As you may \n     recall during the government shutdown DVA nurses and their \n     co-workers took care of veterans without even knowing whether \n     they would get paid.\n       Many DVA nurses could have pursued higher paying jobs in \n     the private sector. Instead, most have chosen to stay with \n     the DVA because they care deeply for our aging and ailing \n     veterans and are earnestly committed to\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\n     their specialized and patriotic work. In fact, most DVA \n     nurses have dedicated their entire careers to caring for \n     veterans. The average DVA nurse is a 47 year old female with \n     11 years of tenure.\n       DVA nurses, like their co-workers, provide not only a vital \n     service for our nation's veterans, but honor veterans with \n     compassion, respect and professional care. I urge you to \n     demonstrate to these dedicated workers that their work is \n     valued and appreciated by becoming an original co-sponsor of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs Nurse Appreciation Act. If \n     you have any questions about this bill, please contact Mike \n     Hall in Senator DeWine's office at 224-2315 or Dominic \n     DelPozzo in Senator Dodd's office at 224-2823 or Linda \n     Bennett in AFGE's Legislative Department at (202) 639-6413.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Bobby L. Harnage, Sr.,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Steven C. LaTourette,\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative LaTourette: The American Nurses \n     Association (ANA) is pleased to support H.R. 1216, the VA \n     Nurse Appreciation Act of 1999. While the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA) has made some effort to address the \n     implementation problems of the VA Nurse Locality Pay System, \n     more significant and immediate action must be taken to ensure \n     that VA registered nurses are appropriately paid for their \n     expert work.\n       H.R. 1216 would allow for all Title 38 registered nurses, \n     employed within the VHA, to receive the same pay adjustment \n     provided all federal employees covered by the Federal \n     Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA). This pay adjustment \n     would include both the nationwide component and a locality \n     pay component. Passage of H.R. 1216 provides for this \n     adjustment without requiring that VA registered nurses be \n     placed on the General Schedule levels of one to fifteen.\n       ANA strongly supports the provision that provides \n     additional authority, starting in 2002, to the Secretary of \n     the Veterans Administration to adjust the rates of basic pay. \n     This provision is necessary to ensure that the VA can \n     continue to adequately recruit and retain registered nurses. \n     The VA's inability to recruit and retain registered nurses \n     was one of the primary reasons for passage of the original VA \n     nurse locality pay bill. In the near future, nursing will \n     again be facing a tightening labor market and the VA must be \n     able to compete.\n       ANA applauds your efforts to address this significant \n     problem and we stand ready to assist in anyway possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Marjorie Vanderbilt,\n                           Director, Federal Government Relations.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, \nSenator DeWine, in introducing the Nurse Appreciation Act of 1999. It \nwill alter the Department of Veterans Affairs' regulations regarding \ncompensation rates for nurses. Unfortunately, the current regulations \nhave led to hardship for many of our nation's VA nurses.\n  For example, from 1996 through 1999, nurses at 16 VA hospitals have \nseen their pay slashed by up to eight percent. Also, during those same \nyears, nurses at 80 VA hospitals have not received a single raise. \nMeanwhile, other federal employees at all VA hospitals received the \nannual General Schedule increases of 2.4 percent to 3.6 percent. This \nnation cannot continue a policy of turning a blind eye to those who \ncare for its sick and wounded veterans.\n  The Nurse Appreciation Act of 1999 will correct this injustice which \nseems to be an unintended consequence of the Nurses Pay Act of 1990. \nThat law was written when VA hospitals faced a shortage of qualified \nnurses, and it gave hospital directors wide discretion in setting pay \nrates for nurses in their hospitals. The law partially served its \npurpose because it allowed directors to increase nurses' pay rates if \nthey were having difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified nurses. \nThose who wrote the law, however, could not have anticipated that the \nVA would take advantage of the fact that the law did not mandate any \nminimum annual increase each year. They could not have anticipated that \nthe law would be used to freeze or even reduce nurses' pay rates.\n  Over the past several years, a few factors emerged to create the \ninequity in VA nurses' compensation. First, the nurse shortage of a \ndecade ago has subsided. Second, VA hospital directors and network \ndirectors have been granted more responsibility for their budgets. In \nother words, if hospital directors can save money by not providing an \nannual increase to nurses, then the directors can use that money for \nother purposes. Finally, to make matters worse, the funding that goes \nto these hospitals has been, in many cases, steady or decreasing over \nthe past few years. I know, for example, that the two VA hospitals in \nConnecticut have not received a real funding increase in about three \nyears. So the hospitals in Newington, West Haven, and in many other \ncities throughout the country must tighten their belts each year to \nabsorb costs due to inflation.\n  The pressure to save money has caused many hospital directors to \nforgo providing even the slightest annual increase to nurses. Yet, \nhospital budget pressures have absolutely no bearing on whether other \nfederal employees--including other veterans hospital employees--receive \ntheir annual salary increases. Those increases are prescribed by the \nfederal government. This legislation just says that nurses should be \ntreated the same as the others. It says that nurses should not bear a \ndisproportionate share of the burden caused by stagnant budgets at our \nVA hospitals.\n  Apparently the VA believes that, in the absence of a nurse shortage, \nannual increases for nurses are unnecessary. But I do not subscribe to \nthat reasoning. We should not wait for a crisis before we take action. \nIf we get to the point where some VA hospitals are unable to retain \nwell-qualified nurses as a result of unbearably inadequate pay, we will \nhave waited far too long and will have badly degraded services at our \nVA hospitals.\n  Furthermore, this nation has benefitted from a robust economy over \nthe last several years. That economy has given a boost to nearly every \nsegment of society. Clearly, though, despite the immense value of their \nwork, many VA nurses have been left behind. Valuable work on behalf of \nthis nation deserves, at a minimum, adequate compensation. This bill \nwill provide that compensation and enable us to do right by our VA \nhospital nurses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1400. A bill to protect women's reproductive health and \nconstitutional right to choice, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           family planning and choice protection act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I entered the United States Senate in \n1993, women's rights were strong and secure. That year alone, we passed \nthe Violence Against Women Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and \nthe Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. We lifted the gag rule, \nwhich freed up doctors to tell their patients that abortion is a legal \noption.\n  Things are quite different now. Since 1994, the tide has turned \nagainst women's rights, as there have been nearly 100 votes to restrict \nchoice, and pro-choice forces have lost most of these votes.\n  Congress recently blocked women in the military and military \ndependents from using their own funds to obtain an abortion at military \nfacilities. The House of Representatives voted to make it a crime for \nany adult to help a teenager travel to another state to avoid her home \nstate's restrictive parental consent laws, and the Senate voted to \nprohibit women who work for the federal government from accessing \nhealth plans that offer abortion services.\n  At the same time, violence against clinics and health care workers is \nincreasing. Last year, the Feminist Majority reported that nearly one \nout of four clinics faced severe anti-abortion violence including death \nthreats, stalking, bomb threats, bombings, arson threats, arson, \nblockades, invasions, and chemical attacks.\n  In my own state of California, there have been 29 recorded incidents \nof violence against clinics since 1984. The firebombing of a women's \nhealth care clinic on July 2 in Sacramento serves as a grim reminder \nthat this violence continues.\n  While there are many in the community and in Congress who have helped \nfight off assaults on women's health rights, playing defense is not \nenough. We need a positive agenda for women's health, choice and family \nplanning if we hope to move the pendulum back the other way.\n  The Family Planning and Choice Protection Act of 1999 sets out such \nan agenda. This comprehensive bill is pro-choice, pro-family planning, \nand pro-\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\nwomen's health. It will improve family planning programs and services; \nstrengthen women's right to choose; expand access to contraceptive \ncoverage; protect patients and employees at reproductive health care \nfacilities; and give law enforcement the resources needed to protect \nwomen's legal rights.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nto stand up for the women in their respective states who deserve to \nhave their rights and health protected. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Reproductive rights are central to the ability of women \n     to exercise full enjoyment of rights secured to women by \n     Federal and State law.\n       (2) Abortion has been a legal and constitutionally \n     protected medical procedure throughout the United States \n     since 1973 and has become part of mainstream medical practice \n     as is evidenced by the positions of medical institutions \n     including the American Medical Association, the American \n     College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \n     Medical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, \n     and the American Public Health Association.\n       (3) The availability of abortion services is diminishing \n     throughout the United States, as evidenced by--\n       (A) the fact that 86 percent of counties in the United \n     States have no abortion provider; and\n       (B) the fact that, between 1992 and 1996, the number of \n     abortion providers decreased by 14 percent.\n       (4)(A) The Department of Health and Human Services and the \n     Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences \n     have contributed to the development of a report entitled \n     ``Healthy People 2000'', which urges that the rate of \n     unintended pregnancy in the United States be reduced by \n     nearly 50 percent by the year 2000.\n       (B) Nearly 50 percent, or approximately 3,050,000, of all \n     pregnancies in the United States each year are unintended, \n     resulting in 1,370,000 abortions in the United States each \n     year.\n       (C) The provision of family planning services, including \n     emergency contraception, is a cost-effective way of reducing \n     the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the \n     United States.\n\n                          TITLE I--PREVENTION\n\n                      Subtitle A--Family Planning\n\n     SEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Equity in Prescription \n     Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 112. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, or one half of all \n     pregnancies, in this country are unintended;\n       (2) contraceptive services are part of basic health care, \n     allowing families to both adequately space desired \n     pregnancies and avoid unintended pregnancy;\n       (3) studies show that contraceptives are cost effective: \n     for every $1 of public funds invested in family planning, $4 \n     to $14 of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-\n     related costs;\n       (4) by reducing rates of unintended pregnancy, \n     contraceptives help reduce the need for abortion;\n       (5) unintended pregnancies lead to higher rates of infant \n     mortality, low-birth weight, and maternal morbidity, and \n     threaten the economic viability of families;\n       (6) the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \n     determined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 \n     percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used \n     contraception'';\n       (7) most women in the United States, including three-\n     quarters of women of childbearing age, rely on some form of \n     private insurance (through their own employer, a family \n     member's employer, or the individual market) to defray their \n     medical expenses;\n       (8) the vast majority of private insurers cover \n     prescription drugs, but many exclude coverage for \n     prescription contraceptives;\n       (9) private insurance provides extremely limited coverage \n     of contraceptives: half of traditional indemnity plans and \n     preferred provider organizations, 20 percent of point-of-\n     service networks, and 7 percent of health maintenance \n     organizations cover no contraceptive methods other than \n     sterilization;\n       (10) women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than \n     men on out-of-pocket health care costs, with contraceptives \n     and reproductive health care services accounting for much of \n     the difference;\n       (11) the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance \n     places many effective forms of contraceptives beyond the \n     financial reach of many women, leading to unintended \n     pregnancies;\n       (12) the Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended \n     Pregnancy recommended that ``financial barriers to \n     contraception be reduced by increasing the proportion of all \n     health insurance policies that cover contraceptive services \n     and supplies'';\n       (13) in 1998, Congress agreed to provide contraceptive \n     coverage to the 2,000,000 women of reproductive age who are \n     participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program, the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan \n     in the world; and\n       (14) eight in 10 privately insured adults support \n     contraceptive coverage.\n\n     SEC. 113.

FREEDOM OF CHOICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 \n     U.S. 113 (1973) established constitutionally based limits on \n     the power of States to restrict the right of a woman to \n     choose to terminate a pregnancy. Under the strict scrutiny \n     standard enunciated in the Roe v. Wade decision, States were \n     required to demonstrate that laws restricting the right of a \n     woman to choose to terminate a pregnancy were the least \n     restrictive means available to achieve a compelling State \n     interest. Since 1992, the Supreme Court has no longer applied \n     the strict scrutiny standard in reviewing challenges to the \n     constitutionality of State laws restricting such rights.\n       (2) As a result of modifications made by the Supreme Court \n     of the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in the Roe v. Wade \n     decision, certain States have restricted the right of women \n     to choose to terminate a pregnancy or to utilize some forms \n     of contraception, and the restrictions operate cumulatively \n     to--\n       (A)(i) increase the number of illegal or medically less \n     safe abortions, often resulting in physical impairment, loss \n     of reproductive capacity, or death to the women involved;\n       (ii) burden interstate and international commerce by \n     forcing women to travel from States in which legal barriers \n     render contraception or abortion unavailable or unsafe to \n     other States or foreign nations;\n       (iii) interfere with freedom of travel between and among \n     the various States;\n       (iv) burden the medical and economic resources of States \n     that continue to provide women with access to safe and legal \n     abortion; and\n       (v) interfere with the ability of medical professionals to \n     provide health services;\n       (B) obstruct access to and use of contraceptive and other \n     medical techniques that are part of interstate and \n     international commerce;\n       (C) discriminate between women who are able to afford \n     interstate and international\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\n     travel and women who are not, a disproportionate number of \n     whom belong to racial or ethnic minorities; and\n       (D) infringe on the ability of women to exercise full \n     enjoyment of rights secured to women by Federal and State \n     law, both statutory and constitutional.\n       (3) Although Congress may not by legislation create \n     constitutional rights, Congress may, where authorized by a \n     constitutional provision enumerating the powers of Congress \n     and not prohibited by a constitutional provision, enact \n     legislation to create and secure statutory rights in areas of \n     legitimate national concern.\n       (4) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of \n     article I of the Constitution and under section 5 of the 14th \n     amendment to the Constitution to enact legislation to \n     prohibit State interference with interstate commerce, \n     liberty, or equal protection of the laws.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish, \n     as a statutory matter, limitations on the power of a State to \n     restrict the freedom of a woman to terminate a pregnancy in \n     order to achieve the same limitations on State action as were \n     provided, as a constitutional matter, under the strict \n     scrutiny standard of review enunciated in the Roe v. Wade \n     decision.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``State'' includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and each other territory or possession of the \n     United States.\n       (d) General Authority.--A State--\n       (1) may not restrict the freedom of a woman to choose \n     whether or not to terminate a pregnancy before fetal \n     viability;\n       (2) may restrict the freedom of a woman to choose whether \n     or not to terminate a pregnancy after fetal viability unless \n     such a termination is necessary to preserve the life or \n     health of the woman; and\n       (3) may impose requirements on the performance of abortion \n     procedures if such requirements are medically necessary to \n     protect the health of women undergoing such procedures.\n       (e) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed to--\n       (1) prevent a State from promulgating regulations to \n     protect unwilling individuals or private health care \n     institutions from being required to participate in the \n     performance of abortions to which the individuals or \n     institutions are conscientiously opposed;\n       (2) prevent a State from promulgating regulations to permit \n     the State to decline to pay for the performance of abortions; \n     or\n       (3) prevent a State from promulgating regulations to \n     require a minor to involve a parent, guardian, or other \n     responsible adult before terminating a pregnancy;\n\n     so long as such regulations meet constitutional standards.\n\n     SEC. 205. FAIRNESS IN INSURANCE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal law \n     shall be construed to prohibit a health plan from offering \n     coverage for the full range of reproductive health care \n     services, including abortion services.\n\n     SEC. 206. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THE MILITARY.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by inserting before the period the \n     following: ``or in a case in which the pregnancy involved is \n     the result of an act of rape or incest or the abortion \n     involved is medically necessary or appropriate'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Abortions in Facilities Overseas.--Subsection (a) \n     does not limit the performing of an abortion in a facility of \n     the uniformed services located outside the 48 contiguous \n     States of the United States if--\n       ``(1) the cost of performing the abortion is fully paid \n     from a source or sources other than funds available to the \n     Department of Defense;\n       ``(2) abortions are not prohibited by the laws of the \n     jurisdiction where the facility is located; and\n       ``(3) the abortion would otherwise be permitted under the \n     laws applicable to the provision of health care to members \n     and former members of the uniformed services and their \n     dependents in such facility.''.\n\n     SEC. 207.

A bill to amend the Federal Crop Insurance Act to promote \nthe development and use of affordable crop insurance policies designed \nto meet the specific needs of producers of specialty crops, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                      Specialty Crop Insurance Act\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for \nthe legislation being introduced today. I am proud to be a co-sponsor \nof the Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 1999 with my colleagues, \nSenators Graham, Mack, Boxer and Feinstein. The outcome of this \nlegislative effort will have a profound effect on the economic health \nand well-being of specialty crop producers in my state of New Mexico, \nas well as for farmers across the country.\n  Today's crop insurance program does not provide sufficient risk \nmanagement protection to many specialty crop producers, leaving the \ngrowers vulnerable to risk. Specialty crops in New Mexico include \nchiles, pecans, lettuce, and pistachios. In fact, Dona Ana County ranks \nas the number one pecan-producing county in the nation according to a \nrecent USDA census. And we produce 50% of the chiles used in the United \nStates. However, at present, viable crop insurance policies which offer \nvalid risk management protection are available for only a limited \nnumber of specialty crops. Many policies which are available fall short \nof reflecting the needs of producers. This means that the great \nmajority of specialty crops farmers in this nation are without \nappropriate, adequate and affordable risk management protection. This \nlegislation addresses the needs of those farmers who produce our fruits \nand vegetables, nuts, and greenhouse and nursery plants for affordable \ncrop insurance policies.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bryan, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1403. A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, \nto modify en banc procedures for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     ninth circuit court of appeals en banc procedures act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce the ``Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals En Banc Procedures Act of 1999.''\n\n  As the largest circuit in the country, the Ninth Circuit faces unique \ndifficulties. While this size has certain advantages, including \ncreating a uniform body of federal law along the Pacific Coast of the \nUnited States, it also creates organizational and procedural challenges \nwhich must be addressed for the court to do its job effectively. The \nbill I am introducing today requires organizational and procedural \nreforms which will help the court to meet these challenges.\n  The United States Department of Justice, which is the most frequent \nlitigant before the Ninth Circuit--participating in 40% of its cases--\nhas specifically identified reform of the en banc review process as \ncritical to resolving the existing problems on the Ninth Circuit.\n  ``From our perspective as litigants, the Ninth Circuit's shortcoming \nis traceable not principally to its large number of judges or \ngeographical size, but rather to its failure effectively to address \nerroneous panel decisions in important cases . . . .''\n  The ``Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals En Banc Procedure Act'' will \ninstitute three major changes to Ninth Circuit court procedures: (1) it \nreduces the number of judges required to call for an en banc hearing; \n(2) it increases the size of en banc panels from 11 to a majority of \nthe Circuit; and (3) it requires the establishment of a system of \nregional calendaring.\n  First, this legislation would grant the Ninth Circuit a dispensation \nto lower the statutory requirement that a majority of the Circuit's \nactive-service judges must vote affirmatively to rehear a case en banc. \nInstead, 40 percent\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nof the judges sitting on the Ninth Circuit would be sufficient to \nrequest an en banc hearing.\n  In recent years, too many en banc requests at the Ninth Circuit have \nbeen disregarded by the Court. In 1996, the Ninth Circuit voted on 25 \nen banc requests by its judges, but only agreed to 12 en banc hearings. \nIn 1997, the Ninth Circuit considered 39 en banc requests, but only \nheld 19 hearings. In 1998, the Ninth Circuit entertained 45 en banc \nrequests, but the Circuit only agreed to hold 16 en banc panels.\n  The Supreme Court, our nation's highest and most venerated court, \nrequires less than a majority of its members to consider a case. It is \nsimply common sense that the Ninth Circuit should not have a higher \nburden for hearing a case en banc than the Supreme Court uses to grant \ncertiorari.\n  Lowering the bar to en banc hearings will enable the Ninth Circuit to \nresolve a greater percentage of conflicts before they reach the Supreme \nCourt.\n  A second provision of this legislation will increase the size of \nNinth Circuit en banc panels from the current 11 judges to a majority \nof the Ninth Circuit. Except for the Ninth, the Fifth, and the Sixth \ncircuits, all en banc panels sit as an entire court. Eleven judges \nselected from a 28 judge circuit are insufficient to give litigants or \nthe general public confidence that an en banc decision reflects the \nviews of the entire circuit. By increasing the size of the panels, the \nNinth Circuit will have more judges to raise, identify, and resolve \npotential conflicts in controversial cases.\n  Critics have also objected to the Ninth Circuit because of its \ngeographical expanse, as it ranges from Hawaii to Alaska to Arizona. It \nis charged that judges unfamiliar with the history of a particular \nregion often sit on panels that decide regional issues.\n  The Federal courts are a national court, with a responsibility to \napply a single, coherent Federal law across the states. The states of \nthe Ninth Circuit have benefitted from this harmonizing influence. For \nexample, the Ninth Circuit has created a consistent body of maritime \nlaw on the West Coast.\n  At the same time, to address both the appearance of regional bias and \nany actual regional bias that does exist, this bill would require the \nNinth Circuit to have geographical representation on its panels.\n  The Ninth Circuit presently has three administrative units--a \nNorthern, a Southern, and a Central unit. Under this legislation, at \nleast one judge from the particular geographic unit would be assigned \nto cases arising in that unit. Thus, if an appeal was filed in Alaska, \na judge from the Northern region would sit on the case. Similarly, if \nan appeal was filed in San Francisco, a Central region judge would sit \non the case.\n  To the degree that the Ninth Circuit has stepped outside the \nmainstream of jurisprudence, this legislation enacts reforms that will \nhelp corral stray decisions. I look forward to working with my fellow \nSenate and House colleagues in enacting this reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge Authority \nAct of 1995 to provide an authorization of contract authority for \nfiscal years 2004 through 2007, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  woodrow wilson bridge financing act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce legislation today \nto provide additional federal funding for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. \nThe legislation, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Funding Act, has been \ncosponsored by the other three Senators from this region, Senators \nWarner, Sarbanes and Mikulski. We have worked well as a team. And I \nthank Senator Warner, who will introduce corresponding legislation that \nauthorizes the funding to go to the bridge project, which I am also \npleased to cosponsor.\n  These two bills complete the job that was started in the TEA-21 \nlegislation we passed last year. In that bill, the Administration \nagreed to support $900 million for the bridge. I commend my senior \ncolleague for his tireless efforts to secure those funds. But even with \nthe funding provided by TEA-21, the amount of funding available for the \nbridge fell $1 billion short of what is needed to build it.\n  Since the passage of the highway bill, I have been pressing the \nAdministration to recognize the federal obligation which is owed to \nthis federally-owned bridge. During the past few months of fits and \nstarts on this project, I have focused on funding as the most serious \nlong-term threat to rebuilding the bridge. I've spoken to Secretary \nSlater, written letters to the Secretary and OMB Director Jack Lew, and \nmy office has been in constant contact with the Department of \nTransportation urging a solution to our funding shortfall.\n  So I was gratified when the Administration proposed a solution \nreflected in the bills we are introducing today. After receiving the \nAdministration's proposed legislation and consulting with the entire \nregional delegation, from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nPotomac River, we decided to divide the legislation into two bills, \nwhich will be referred separately to the two committees with primary \ninterest in the legislation. The bill I'm introducing allows direct \npayments from the Highway Trust Fund to be used to finish this project. \nIt will be referred to the Finance Committee, on which I sit, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on that committee to move \nthis legislation forward. Senator Warner's bill will be referred to the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, on which he sits.\n  Together, these two bills will solve the remaining financing problem \nfacing the Woodrow Wilson bridge. By securing Administration support in \nadvance, we have already travelled a significant distance toward \ngetting a bill that can be signed into law. And it is my hope we can \nmove quickly in the Congress to fill this fiscal pothole.\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two bills be printed \nconsectutively in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce today legislation to \ncomplete the commitment to finance the federal share of the cost of \nconstructing the new Woodrow Wilson bridge.\n  As my colleagues are aware, this 40-year-old bridge which links \nInterstate 495 between Maryland and Virginia, is owned by the federal \ngovernment. For over a decade, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, \nthe District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and affected local \ngovernments have conducted an extensive public process to select a \ndesign for a replacement facility for the Wilson bridge.\n  The Record of Decision on the Environmental Impact Statement selected \nan alternative for a 12-lane bridge, of which 10 lanes are for all \ntraffic and 2 lanes are dedicated for HOV.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, provides \n$900 million for planning, engineering, design and construction from \n1998 through 2003 for this design. This funding level represents \napproximately half of the estimated total project cost of $1.9 billion.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with my Senate \ncolleagues, Senator Robb, Senator Sarbanes and Senator Mikulski, \nprovides the final installment of federal funds for the project. Also, \nthis legislation has been reviewed by the Administration and it \ncompliments the legislation requested by the Administration earlier \nthis month.\n  Specifically, the bill provides a total of $600 million from the \nHighway Trust Fund in fiscal years 2004 through 2007, at an annual \nfunding level of $150 million. Our bill adds a requirement not present \nin the Administration's bill that Maryland, Virginia and the District \nof Columbia must provide $400 million before any of the funds can be \nobligated.\n  The requirement for matching funds from the capital region \njurisdictions ensures that the total project cost of $1.9 billion is \nfully financed. Also, this matching provision responds to a major issue \nthat came before a federal court earlier this year. In that litigation, \nthe court ruled that the project had not fully met the transportation \nconformity requirements of the Clean Air Act. Conformity requires that \nsources of funding for transportation projects be identified and that \nstate transportation plans for building transportation projects \n``conform'' with state implementation plans designed to meet air \nquality standards.\n  Mr. President, the funding provided in this legislation also ensures \nthat this project will receive the same financial treatment as other \nhighway construction projects around the nation. Under TEA-21 and prior \nfederal transportation laws, 20 percent of state funds are required to \nmatch 80 percent of federal dollars used on any highway construction \nproject on the federal-aid system. This 80 percent federal/20 percent \nstate requirement will now be applied to the Wilson bridge project when \nthis legislation is enacted.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to act on this legislation. The \nproject is at a critical juncture as we work to meet the construction \nschedule. While the funds authorized in this bill will not be available \nuntil 2004 through 2007, full funding must be identified and committed \nnow before any construction can begin. The current schedule is for \nconstruction to begin by the fall of 2000.\n  Let me be clear to my colleagues that this legislation continues all \nof the requirements set for the capital region jurisdictions \nestablished in TEA-21. Specifically, Virginia, Maryland and the \nDistrict of Columbia must develop a financial plan and enter into an \nagreement with the federal government to determine which jurisdiction \nwill take title to the new bridge.\n  Also, this legislation does not waive any federal environmental laws. \nThose issues are before federal court and efforts to resolve them are \nongoing between the Federal Highway Administration and the plaintiffs.\n  As it has been stated previously, the useful life of the current \nbridge is nearly expired. Daily traffic of over 175,000 vehicles per \nday is causing irreparable damage to the bridge structure. It is \nprohibitively expensive to continue spending scarce transportation \ndollars to repair the bridge when its projected lifespan is rapidly \nexpiring. The Federal Highway Administration has confirmed that we can \nkeep the bridge open to all traffic until about the year 2004, but \nthose estimates can change overnight as monthly safety inspections \nreveal continuing damage.\n  Today, we are introducing two bills in the Senate to accomplish this \nfunding initiative because of the committee jurisdictional issues. As a \nmember of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am sponsoring \nthe bill to provide $600 million from the Highway Trust Fund beginning \nin 2004. My colleague, Senator Robb, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, will be introducing legislation to permit these Highway \nTrust Fund dollars to be obligated in 2004 and beyond. Current tax law \nlimits the obligation of new Highway Trust Fund dollars beyond the \ncurrent TEA-21 authorization period of 2003.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Woodrow \nWilson Bridge Financing Act of 1999.\n  The Woodrow Wilson bridge is the only federal bridge in the country. \nThis bridge used to be a bridge over troubled water. Now it is a \ntroubled bridge over the Potomac River. We need a new bridge--not only \nbecause of the significant increase in the volume of commuters, \ninterstate travelers and trucks that use the bridge, but also for \npublic safety. The construction of this bridge must be completed in a \ntimely way.\n  I support this legislation for two reasons. First, it provides the \nfunding that we need to finish constructing the Woodrow Wilson bridge. \nSecond, it makes the project compliant with the\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\nClean Air Act as required by the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia.\n  Specifically, this legislation provides the authorization for an \nadditional $600 million for the bridge. This $600 million is in \naddition to the $900 million that has already been committed by the \nfederal government. It will provide $150 million per year from 2004 to \n2007.\n  The legislation also commits the surrounding states to contribute \ntheir fair share to the construction of the bridge. Since federal \nfunding makes up 80% of the cost of the bridge, the Capitol Region \njurisdictions are committed to providing the remaining 20%. In fact, \nthe states have to provide at least $0.67 for every $1 provided from \nthe Highway Trust fund. Together, the federal and state governments \nwill be able to provide what we need to build the bridge.\n  The Woodrow Wilson Bridge Financing Act of 1999 is an innovative, \ncreative and resourceful response to what was once a big problem for \nthe entire metropolitan area. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Robb, Warner and Mikulski, as an original co-sponsor of these \ntwo measures providing the additional financing necessary for the \nreplacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The proposed $600 million in \nnew funding authorized in these measures, combined with the $900 \nmillion already made available under the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century (TEA-21), will enable us to move ahead with \nconstructing this vital link in our region's and nation's \ntransportation system.\n  Mr. President, everyone who commutes to work in the Washington \nMetropolitan area or who travels on Interstate 95 knows what a serious \ntraffic and safety problem we have in the area of the Woodrow Wilson \nBridge. The bridge is one of the worst bottlenecks on the interstate \nsystem. It is carrying traffic volumes far in excess of its designed \ncapacity. Originally constructed in 1961 to carry 70,000 vehicles per \nday, the bridge now averages 176,000 vehicles daily. It is rapidly \napproaching the end of its service life. In fact in 1994, the Federal \nHighway Administration determined that due to the age of the facility, \nthe structural deterioration and traffic demand, the existing bridge \nwould not last much beyond 2004 even with additional repairs. The \nsubstandard condition of the bridge and resulting congestion means \naccidents-- at a rate of twice that for other segments of the Capital \nBeltway--and significant delays for commuters, interstate truckers, \ntourists, businesses and employers alike. With traffic volumes in the \narea projected to nearly double in the next 20 years, there has been a \nclear need to address this problem.\n  In 1996, after many years of intensive study, the Wilson Bridge \nCoordination Committee, comprised of federal, state and local \nofficials, recommended a 12-lane drawbridge and reconstructing \napproaches and adjacent interchanges as the preferred alternative for \nthe replacement structure, at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion. Since \nthen, there has been much discussion and debate about the size and cost \nof the facility as well as how the new bridge would be paid for and I \nwould like to make several points:\n  First, the project is a federal responsibility. The bridge is owned \nby the Federal government. In fact, it is the only federally-owned \nbridge on the interstate system. Funding provided for it should be \ncommensurate with the federal ownership of the bridge.\n  Second, the replacement bridge must be built in accordance with the \nsame standards as applied to bridges owned by state jurisdictions. Just \nreplacing the existing structure is not an acceptable option because it \nwould continue the current bottleneck at the bridge and because it \nwould not meet the Federal Highway Administration's own guidelines \nwhich require states in building new structures to meet projected \nfuture carrying capacity needs. This means the replacement structure \nmust be able to accommodate current as well as projected future traffic \ngrowth and that the related interchanges and approaches to the bridge \nshould match the new bridge. It should also provide for pedestrian and \nbicycle access as well as accommodate future transit useage. What is \nneeded is not a quick fix that we will have to revisit in several \nyears, but a long term solution that will carry us well into the next \ncentury.\n  Third, we should not lose sight of the fact that if a replacement is \nnot undertaken in the very near future, it will be necessary to impose \nsignificant restrictions on the use of the existing bridge and this \nwill have enormous economic and transportation related consequences \nthroughout the entire region.\n  Last year we took a significant step forward in replacing the Woodrow \nWilson Bridge by authorizing $900 million in new contract authority in \nTEA-21. The legislation which we are introducing today, when enacted, \nwill help ensure that the federal responsibility to this bridge is met, \nand that it will meet the region's needs as we move into the next \ncentury.\n  I want to commend Secretary Slater and his staff at the Department of \nTransportation for their support and assistance in developing this \nlegislation and I urge my collegues to join me in supporting this \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url":

Mr. President, we will soon be debating the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. The State Department title of the bill includes no \nfunding for the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) which I hope \nwill be reversed by the Senate when we debate this appropriations bill.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I ask that a letter from \nNational Security Advisor Samuel R. Berger to Senator Bob Graham be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: Thank you for writing concerning the Commerce-\n     Justice-State Appropriations Bill and the lack of funding for \n     the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). I share your \n     concern over the inadequacies of the bill.\n       The Senate appropriations bill as reported from Committee \n     is fraught with a range of serious problems. And, the \n     decision to eliminate funding for the NED is one of many \n     factors which render the legislation unacceptable. For this \n     reason,the President's senior advisors would recommend that \n     the legislation be vetoed if it were enacted in its current \n     form.\n       Our position on the NED is clear. The NED is at the core of \n     the vision we share for a world that is more free and more \n     democratic. Indeed, it was President Reagan's initiative to \n     establish the NED, a decision and a vision that has had a \n     powerful impact on our nation's efforts to expand democracy \n     and human rights. And to its credit, the NED conducts its \n     critically important activities with annual funding that \n     amounts to only a small fraction of our nation's \n     international affairs budget. From supporting election \n     monitoring in Indonesia, to promoting independent media in \n     the Balkans, the NED represents and promotes the most \n     fundamental of American values throughout the world.\n       Thank you again for your letter on this important matter. \n     Please know that the President remains one of the strongest \n     champions of the Endowment, and appreciates your continuing \n     support of the NED.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R.

The letter states the Administration's unequivocal support \nfor the National Endowment for Democracy and articulates the strong \npositive contribution the NED makes to our national interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8893-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAX SOLIS--1999 CONNECTICUT SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, once again this year, the Small \nBusiness Administration held its annual Small Business Week. The SBA \nhosts this event to recognize the many accomplishments of this \ncountry's small businessmen-women. Today, I am pleased to pay a special \ntribute to the achievements of Max Solis, Chairman and CEO of BST \nSystems, Inc., who was named Connecticut's 1999 Small Business Person \nof the Year.\n  Having received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical \nEngineering from the City College of New York and a Masters of Business \nAdministration from New York University, Max Solis went on to found BST \nSystems, Inc. in 1983. BST Systems, Inc., located in Plainfield, \nConnecticut, is a small minority-owned business that employs \napproximately 68 people. BST focuses on engineering-oriented, high-\ntechnology business and specializes in manufacturing and testing high-\nenergy silver zinc cells, specialty cells and complete batteries, as \nwell as electronic support equipment for NASA, the Department of \nDefense, and various commercial applications.\n  In addition to this most recent honor, BST Systems also received \nNASA's 1994 Minority Subcontractor of the Year Award and NASA's \nCommitment to Excellence Award in both 1995 and 1997. Just this past \nMay, BST Systems was the recipient of the George M. Low Award, NASA's \nhighest honor for excellence and quality and recognition of its \nsignificant contributions to the advancement of our nation's space \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I am so very pleased to have the opportunity to \nhighlight the success of Max Solis and BST Systems, Inc. Small business \nentrepreneurs like Max Solis and his employees keep this country on the \ncutting edge of innovation and advanced technology. And as we enter a \nnew century, small businesses like BST will be integral to ensuring \ncontinued American leadership in these critical areas.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Alex \n``Ray'' Lackey for his recent appointment as the Eighth Command \nSergeant Major of the Army Reserve.\n  Ray has been serving as supervisor of customer services at the \nBowling Green post office for almost 20 years, and now embarks on a \nthree-year tour of duty at the Pentagon. Ray has served in numerous \ncapacities in the U.S. military for more than 28 years, with his most \nrecent assignment as Command Sergeant Major for the 100th Division in \nLouisville. Ray's supervisors have commended him for his ability to \nmaintain a professional balance between his demanding positions in both \nthe U.S. Postal Service and the Department of the Army.\n  Ray's experience in military service is broad, including service as \nSquad Leader with the 82nd Airborne Division, Drill Sergeant at Fort \nKnox, Platoon Sergeant with the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, \nBattalion Operations Sergeant, First Sergeant, and Commandant of the \n100th Division Drill Sergeant School. In 1982, he received the \ndistinction of U.S. Army Reserve Drill Sergeant of the year.\n  Ray has been decorated with an impressive number of awards and honors \nover the years, including being awarded the Meritorious Service Medal \nfive times, the Army Commendation Medal two times, the Good Conduct \nMedal twice, the Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal five times, \nand the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal with \nBronze Star, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal with ``M'' device, the \nNoncommissioned Officers Professional Development Ribbon with numeral \nfour, the Army Service Ribbon and the Overseas Service Ribbon. He has \nalso earned the Expert Infantryman Badge and the Parachutist Badge.\n  As is evidenced by the lengthy list of Ray's achievements and honors, \nhe has served his State and his country well. It is also clear that the \nDepartment of the Army has great confidence in Ray's experience, and it \nseems only fitting that someone with his expertise and seasoned skills \nwill be working in such a significant capacity at the Pentagon. My \ncolleagues and I extend our gratitude for Ray's willingness to continue \nserving the country in this new post, and wish him the best in his next \nstage of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8893-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8893-S8894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TELEHEALTH\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this past month, Major General \nNancy Adams, Commander of the Tripler Army Medical Center, Honolulu, HI \nparticipated in the Congressional Ad Hoc Steering Committee on \nTelehealth Demonstration and Briefing. I have been pleased to work \nclosely with General Adams for a number of years, including during her \nearlier tenure as Chief, United States Army Nurse Corps.\n  I am extraordinarily pleased to have her selected to command Tripler. \nShe is the first female commander of our facility and the first two-\nstar nurse in the history of the United States Army.\n  Mr. President, I ask that her opening remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n      Remarks of MG Nancy R. Adams, Department of Defense at the \nCongressional Ad Hoc Steering Committee on Telehealth Demonstration and \n  Briefing on ``Information Technologies for Healthcare: Government, \n         Industry and Academia Working Together'', 23 June 1999\n\n       Good Morning and aloha from Hawaii. I am Major General \n     Nancy Adams. I am privileged to offer the opening remarks on \n     the accomplishments and challenges the Department of Defense \n     (DOD) is addressing in information technologies for \n     healthcare.\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\n       In my current assignment as the Commanding General, Tripler \n     Army Medical Center, Hawaii, and the United States Army \n     Pacific Command Surgeon, I am somewhat in awe at being \n     designated as the DOD spokesman. However, I am very pleased \n     to have the opportunity because telemedicine and telehealth \n     initiatives are vital to the mission of my medical center. To \n     say that I am the DOD spokesperson does exaggerate my \n     accountability with the Department. So to be safe, I should \n     at this point go with the standard disclaimer, which says my \n     information does not necessarily reflect the views of the \n     Department or the Secretary of Defense.\n       I am most pleased to be participating in the congressional \n     Ad Hoc Committee on Telehealth forum. This event acknowledges \n     the vision and support congressional representatives have \n     offered to enhance the applications of information technology \n     to healthcare in general with special emphasis on clinical \n     practice.\n       Within the Department of Defense, and most particularly in \n     the Pacific, there are significant distances, time zone \n     disparities, and geographic boundaries that present \n     challenges to the delivery of patient care. In the Pacific, a \n     variety of both public and private sector agencies are \n     involved in health care services, with the overall goal to \n     transcend time, distance, and structural barriers to provide \n     quality healthcare to Department of Defense beneficiaries. \n     Because of our global role, it is incumbent that the \n     Department of Defense work collaboratively to afford \n     responsive health care services, and this challenge can only \n     be addressed with innovative technology and telecommunication \n     solutions. Hence, I would like to illustrate a few examples \n     from my Hawaii experience, on how the linkage between \n     information, knowledge, and technologies have enhanced access \n     to health care services and improved the quality of care \n     rendered.\n       Tripler Army Medical Center is the only Department of \n     Defense tertiary care medical treatment facility in the \n     Pacific. Tripler serves the health care needs of more than \n     750,000 active-duty military, their families, military \n     retirees, retiree families and other Pacific island \n     beneficiaries. Using the systems developed through Department \n     of Defense, such as the Composite Health Care System II, or \n     CHCSII, Corporate Executive Information System or CEIS, \n     AKAMAI, and the Pacific Medical Network or PACMEDNET, have \n     enabled us to improve the quality of care and access to \n     health services for our beneficiaries.\n       Healthcare information systems and telehealth applications \n     within the Department of Defense strive to accomplish the \n     following 5 goals: Keep Active Duty forces on the job; Reduce \n     the Military Health System skill mix and size in staffing \n     model; Increase productivity of the direct care component; \n     Enhance and measure health and fitness of beneficiaries, and \n     lastly, Promote and measure customer satisfaction with \n     Information Technology.\n       The healthcare information management initiatives within \n     the Department of Defense focus on research and the value of \n     information and telehealth applications along with \n     implementation of automation support to enhance patient care \n     delivery. I can attest that information management support \n     provided by systems such as the CHCSII, CEIS, and the \n     telehealth support from Akamai and PACMEDNET, have provided \n     significant readiness and humanitarian implications for \n     regional care in the Pacific. Being responsible for delivery \n     of healthcare to a region as big as the Pacific--which \n     encompasses 70 countries and 14 time zones--requires me to \n     use and support the development of technology tools. These \n     technology tools and clinical capability offer tremendous \n     opportunities for reuse by other federal agencies, as well as \n     transferability to private sector agencies.\n       As stated earlier, healthcare information technologies are \n     an essential element of health care services within the \n     Department of Defense because of the need to overcome the \n     dispersion of beneficiaries over great distances. The \n     telehealth possibilities are highly opportunistic and provide \n     a window on the future. Our technology is a means of \n     demonstrating US engagement in other nations by providing a \n     telepresence in other than US military medical treatment \n     facilities. Specific benefits healthcare technology has \n     offered Tripler Army Medical Center and the Pacific include:\n       Ability to provide a health profile for a person that will \n     facilitate decision making by a provider who doesn't have \n     access to a complete medical record.\n       We can integrate patient administrative and clinical data \n     between multiple and diverse healthcare systems.\n       The same network and technology that provides information \n     for diagnosing and treating patients can also be utilized for \n     teaching via distance learning techniques.\n       Use of the Internet and web-enabled solutions has fostered \n     a sense of community amongst clinicians and consumers by \n     enabling information sharing, education, and collegial \n     relationships.\n       From my perspective as a military medical center commander \n     and the Command Surgeon, healthcare information technologies \n     contribute to the readiness and health care delivery mission. \n     I mention this as a single mission because the role of \n     military medicine is to stay trained and ready for \n     contingency operations that directly support the US \n     military. The business of health care in and of itself is \n     not our focus. It is the link between readiness and health \n     care delivery that makes military medicine vital to our \n     nation. The linkage between readiness and health care is \n     good business for the military.\n       Through the application of information systems and \n     telehealth technologies, the quality of care and utilization \n     of scarce medical resources are positively effected thereby \n     improving both military readiness and health care delivery. \n     Utilization of information systems and telehealth \n     applications provides immediate access even when specialists \n     are not on site. For example, Tripler will be interpreting \n     echocardiograms from Yokoto, Japan and Guam. This can be life \n     saving information if you are talking about the patient's \n     need for surgery or the functioning of the heart after a \n     heart attack. These technologies also project medical \n     specialty expertise without deploying them from the medical \n     center. This saves significant dollars by not taking the \n     medical specialist away for a minimum of two days travel to \n     do a day's work. In addition, for those clinicians who are \n     forward deployed, this access to specialists decreases their \n     professional isolation and improves their decision-making \n     ability. In some cases there is the added benefit of \n     eliminating the need to air-evac patients for definitive care \n     and continuity of care is maintained at their home station.\n       Healthcare information technologies are good new stories \n     for the Department of Defense but the potential is in its \n     infancy. Only by working with our partners in other \n     government agencies, industry, and academia, will we be able \n     to maximize the investment in technology by increasing its \n     utility and clinical efficacy. In closing, my goals for \n     attending the congressional Ad Hoc Steering Committee on \n     Telehealth Demonstration and Briefing are twofold:\n       To communicate the reality of the technological solutions \n     currently available within the Department of Defense to \n     provide quality health care and improve access;\n       And second, to encourage networking among the congressional \n     supporters, speakers, attendees, and exhibit presenters to \n     further maximize our capabilities. As we share information \n     and establish relationships with one anther I am sure our \n     collective efforts will produce more and better applications \n     of the technology than what is already here. Ideas for future \n     integration and information management technologies should be \n     the most valuable outcome of today's activities. I hope most \n     of you will be staying through the day and spending time in \n     the exhibit area. Many of the leading edge health care \n     technology companies have displays, as well as Department of \n     Defense, Veterans Administration, and Indian Health Service \n     enterprises. Individually as well as together we are all \n     involved in re-engineering health care processes to \n     incorporate emerging technologies!\n       I am very pleased to be sharing the podium with \n     distinguished leaders from Congress, the military, government \n     service, and industry. Those of us in the military know that \n     it is only through the vision and support of Congressional \n     representatives that the Department of Defense has progressed \n     to our current level of sophistication in healthcare \n     information technologies and telehealth. Ladies and \n     Gentlemen, I challenge you to continue to exploit the \n     capabilities in healthcare information technologies; to \n     capitalize on the improvements it can offer the business \n     practice of patient care, and to nurture the positive and \n     sustained impact of technology on enterprise value. I \n     encourage you to take advantage of the sense of community the \n     Internet enables by sharing your ideas and solutions with \n     fellow government, industry and academic colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/20/senate-section/article/S8894-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8894-S8895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR.

Dr. Dupuis received \nthis honor due to his outstanding civic involvements coupled with his \nexemplary leadership in the business world.\n  Dr. Dupuis took the position of Executive Director in April of 1996. \nHis philosophy of personalization--solving problems with an interview \nrather than a phone call or a memo--has given him and his law firm an \nexcellent reputation. Under his capable and inspiring leadership, the \nfirm grew from fifty lawyers to eighty. Dr. Dupuis will retire from the \nMcLane Law Firm in June of 1999 but will continue to have an active \nrole in community affairs.

He has been widely \ninvolved in areas ranging from health care to the arts. He is the \nformer President and CEO of Catholic Medical Center, the former \nCommissioner of the Department of Insurance\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nfor New Hampshire, the former President of New England College of \nOptometry and he has served with distinction, as the Mayor of \nManchester, New Hampshire.\n  I commend Dr. Dupuis for his outstanding leadership and shining \nexample.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 46, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Shelby and Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 46) expressing the \n     sense of Congress that the July 20, 1999, 30th anniversary of \n     the first lunar landing should be a day of celebration and \n     reflection on the Apollo-11 mission to the Moon and the \n     accomplishments of the Apollo program throughout the 1960's \n     and 1970's.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few thoughts \nabout space, the vision that is needed to take us there, and to say a \nfew words of appreciation on the anniversary of one of the greatest \naccomplishments in world history. First, I recognize and thank all the \npeople--scientists, flight operations experts, administrators, \nmaintenance experts, astronauts, and every other member of the NASA \nteam and Apollo program--who worked so hard to make the successful \nlaunch and mission of Saturn V to the moon a reality and victory for \nAmerica.\n  When President Kennedy announced his intentions to devote the \nresources and support to NASA that would be necessary to accomplish the \nmonumental task of landing men on the surface of the moon, our space \nprogram was born. Up until that magnificent moment when Neil Armstrong \nlet everyone watching and listening know that the ``Eagle had Landed'' \nand for many years afterward, our space program flourished and steamed \nahead making great strides in nearly every area of space exploration. \nUnfortunately, in recent years, while marked by continuing and \nimportant scientific medical research and several noteworthy events, \nour space program has become stagnant in comparison to the growing and \nvibrant NASA of the past. I am one member of Congress who feels very \nstrongly that too much remains to be learned and explored for our space \nprogram to remain in neutral any longer.\n  Mr. President, on the anniversary of one of our greatest \naccomplishments, we have slipped dangerously close to the edge. If we \ndo not act, we may lose one or more of the most historically \nsignificant pieces of our space program in existence. I am proud to say \nthat one of the last three of these great artifacts remaining from the \nApollo Project--the Saturn V rocket--stands on the grounds of the U.S. \nSpace and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Alabama. But the fact remains \nthat this rocket is in need of restoration and protection. I join my \ncolleague and fellow Alabamian, Senator Shelby, as an original \ncosponsor of the resolution that has been introduced which calls upon \nthe Congress to provide federal assistance to fund the much-needed \nrestoration and protection projects for the Saturn V rocket at the U.S. \nSpace and Rocket Center. This funding will enable this great monument \nto our space program to live on as an enduring symbol of America's \ngreatness both here on earth and beyond. I call on my colleagues in \nCongress to lend the assistance that is needed to protect the great \nhistory of our space program.\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, I am one member of Congress who \nbelieves that NASA embodies many of the most important qualities of our \nnation. We are a nation of explorers and inventors--proud, hardworking \nand brave. Our legacy as a nation is one of unmatched proportion. We \nmust do our part to continue to build upon the past for the benefit of \nour future generations.\n  Mr. President, safe, reliable, low-cost transportation has been the \nkey to the development of frontiers from the dawn of time. Ocean-going \nvessels enabled the discovery of the New World and initiated global \ncommerce. The stagecoach transported early settlers and cargo across \nthe untamed American West, and the transcontinental railway opened up \nthis new frontier to vast numbers of settlers. Today, modern airways \nare a critical element of international commerce.\n  Transportation has made it possible to explore and develop the \nfrontiers that emerged throughout history. Thirty years ago it was a \nSaturn V rocket carrying three men to the moon. And now, transportation \nis again the driver as we boldly prepare to explore deeper and develop \nthe largest frontier of all - the frontier of space.\n  As a nation of explorers, I would like to think that we see the \nopportunities for scientific research and new space industries as \nlimitless in scope and benefit to mankind.\n  Consider the possibilities:\n  Manufacturing medicines that are far superior to drugs made on Earth.\n  Even today the work that is being lead by NASA and its Marshall Space \nFlight Center, in particular, in Microgravity Research is paying \ntremendous dividends. Already this research is saving lives. The \nresearch that will be conducted on the International Space Station will \ntake us even farther.\n  Consider the possibility of Mining resources from orbiting bodies, or \nservicing large communications and remote sensing platforms in low \nearth orbit without bringing them back to Earth.\n  Consider: Generating cheap, clean power from the Sun, or exploring \nnew worlds and safely, routinely and affordably transporting passengers \nto and from space.\n  It all sounds like science fiction today and it is because the \ncurrent high cost of space transportation has locked the door to these \nopportunities. I believe that NASA is ready to start turning science \nfiction into science reality--to unlock the door to a new frontier of \nopportunity.\n  The problem is this, space launch is not fully and completely \nreliable as we want it to be and its costs have been very expensive. \nCurrent launch costs consume valuable NASA resources and limit the \nability to achieve its science and exploration goals. Only the highest \npriority science payloads are being launched and human exploration is \non hold until we can solve this problem of launch costs.\n  Launch costs have also slowed the commercial development of space. \nWhile the U.S. space program faces new challenges to its decades long, \nglobal leadership position, the U.S. commercial space launch industry \nhas dwindled from complete market dominance in the mid-1970's to only \n30% on a greatly expanded worldwide market today. The United States has \nlost 70% of market share to the Russians, to the French, and to the \nChinese. Several factors including foreign government subsidization and \nthe constant optimization of 30 year old technology by foreign firms \nare at the heart of a problem this Congress ought to solve--now!\n  While improvement and evolution of existing systems and technologies \nare necessary in the face of ever increasing competition abroad, it \nwill take a revolution to open the space frontier and enable the \ndevelopment of space. Our investments in launch technology have been \nsporadic over the years, resulting in high costs and small, incremental \nimprovements in launch safety and capability. Today, many entrepreneurs \nrealize the significance of the expanding commercial space marketplace, \nbut are left to solve the hard problem of access to low Earth orbit \nwith just their innovative spirit and today's technology.\n  We have had a rash of failures of expendable launch vehicles \nrecently; 6 of the last 8 launches have been failures. Still, NASA \ncontinues to fly the Space Shuttle safely. But that safety record comes \nat a high cost to the people at United Space Alliance, NASA Kennedy, \nMarshall, and Johnson Space Flight Center (JSC).\n  Space launch is expensive because of complex systems that require \nextensive checkout and human intervention. Small margins result in \nhigh maintenance and replacement. Flight hardware reuse is limited. \nLaunch facilities\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\nand range safety operations are out of date.\n\n  Achieving simplicity and robust performance has never been achieved \nin space launch. NASA has taken the brute force approach to beating \nEarth's gravity by expending hardware during ascent; or they have \nshaved weight and squeezed the last fraction of a percent of \nperformance from the propulsion systems--gaining performance at the \nexpense of simplicity and robustness.\n  I have talked to the people at NASA Marshall. They have lived with \nthe Shuttle propulsion systems and they have a lot of ideas that will \nmake the next generation 100 times safer and 10 times cheaper than \ntoday; and their ideas don't stop there! They believe that, in 25 \nyears, they can develop the technology that will improve safety over \n10,000 times and reduce cost by 100 times that of the current Shuttles. \nI believe that the people at Marshall Space Flight Center, in \ncooperation with Stennis Space Center and the Glenn Research Center as \nwell as other NASA scientists, can revolutionize space propulsion in \nthe next 25 years. NASA administrator Dan Goldin shares this same view.\n  They believe that they can combine simplicity and with a robust \ncapability that will increase reliability 100 fold while multiple abort \noptions and safe crew escape systems will provide passenger safety \nequivalent to today's aircraft. They believe that they can develop the \ntechnology that will result in what they are calling ``a beautiful \nmachine,'' safe and reliable first, then affordable. This marriage of \nsimplicity and performance can only be obtained through major \nbreakthroughs in space transportation technology at the basic component \nand system level.\n  Mr. President, it is a top priority of NASA to develop innovative \nspace transportation technologies for commerce, civil space travel and \nthe defense of the nation. This is not a might do task, but a must do \ntask if this nation is to once again lead the way in space exploration.\n  Unlike the prior generation, our generation has not invested in a \nfuture of space exploration. Let's step back in time about 50 years. \nAmerica and Russia were on separate paths to launch a satellite into \norbit around the Earth. The Space Age had begun. In a laboratory at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania stood the world's first general purpose \ncomputer--the ENIAC. Spanning 150 feet and weighing 30 tons, ENIAC's \ntwenty banks of flashing lights indicated the results of fourteen ten-\ndigit multiplication processes in one second. It was one hundred times \nfaster than a mechanical calculator, enabled by 18,000 water-cooled \nvacuum tubes. Tubes blew and were replaced several times an hour, but \nthey ushered in the electronic age.\n  Only 7 years after the invention of the transistor, the first \nsilicon-based transistorized computer was developed. Four years later a \npractical integrated circuit was the genesis for printing conducting \nchannels directly on silicon surfaces. Less than twenty-five years \nafter the development of ENIAC, Intel introduced the first \nmicroprocessor, using 2,300 transistors on a 108 Kilo Hertz silicon \nchip. The U.S., at that time, was just beginning the development of the \nSpace Shuttle.\n\n  In the 28 years since, the number of transistors on a single chip has \nincreased from 2,300 to 7.5 million and the number of instructions per \nsecond has increased more than 3,000 times. The processor capacity has \nincreased at a rate of a factor of two every 18 to 24 months and the \ncost per kilobyte of computer memory has decreased by a factor of \n640,000. Today over 44% of U.S. homes have a personal computer. The \nSpace Shuttle is still the workhorse for human space flight and remains \nthe only reusable launch system.\n  Today it is impossible to think of a world without computers or to \nimagine that the ideas we developed and that we take for granted might \nhave been strenuously resisted in the past. And while it seems barely \ncredible today that scientists, engineers, and businessmen five decades \nago didn't initially grasp the implication of this new technology--this \nhas been the case more often than not throughout history.\n  Now let's look forward in time. Imagine a world where traveling to an \norbiting space production facility is as common as making a business \ntrip on a commercial airliner? Does this seem plausible? How probable \ndid personal palmtop computers seem fifty years ago? Technology was the \nengine that enabled these breakthroughs--technology will enable safe, \nreliable, affordable access to space over the next twenty-five years. I \nbelieve that we will see major steps toward this goal in the next 5 to \n10 years if we invest now.\n  Over the next decade, NASA intends to increase safety by a hundred \nfold while reducing cost tenfold. Safety will be defined as the \nprobability of a catastrophic failure once out of every 1,000,000 \nflights. This dramatic leap will come by departing from a past emphasis \non cost and performance to a focused new paradigm of safety and \nreliability, which in turn, will drive down costs. Improvements in \nsafety will require future space transportation systems to assure crew \nsafety from pre-launch to landing. To accomplish this, launch systems \nmust be inherently reliable, functionally redundant wherever practical \nand designed to minimize or eliminate catastrophic failure modes. Next \ngeneration systems will have the ability to complete their missions \nwith at least one engine failure from liftoff. Designs will minimize \nthe opportunity for human error in test, checkout and operations. By \nincorporating a crew escape capability for all flights and reducing the \nnumber of launch elements, NASA will be able to meet their safety \ngoals.\n  In this time-frame, launch costs will fall from current levels of \n$10,000 to $1,000 per pound to low earth orbit. In order to achieve \nthis ambitious cost goal, today's multi-stage, partial and fully \nexpendable rockets must be replaced by single stage, fully reusable \nsystems. A single stage to orbit Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) can \neliminate assembly and checkout costs currently associated with the \nlarge number of complex interfaces on today's Space Shuttle. Full \nreusability will eliminate the need to throw away expensive hardware \nand reduce the need for ongoing production, but a key technology will \nbe the manufacturing technology to build large, very lightweight, \ncomposite propellant tanks and structures. The expertise that will make \nthese lightweight structures possible is the current Shuttle tank \nproduction facility at Michoud, Louisiana.\n  Systems in 10 years will have to accommodate hundreds of missions per \nyear and will be commercially certified for hundreds of flights.\n  This level of cost reduction has the potential to enable new, \nnontraditional uses of space. Taking this vital first step is \ncomparable to the first 25 years in the development of the \nmicroprocessor when computer processors went from millions of dollars \nto hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  Over the next 25 years more dramatic improvements will be enabled by \nan all flight crew escape system and horizontal takeoff, which allows \nthe vehicle to abort its takeoff after reaching maximum power--much \nlike an aircraft. Costs will fall to $100 per pound for low earth orbit \nmissions. This low price per flight will create a 15-fold increase in \nthe size of the current projected space launch market. This larger \nmarket will, in-turn, enable this system to be developed independent of \nU.S. Government financial support. The number of flights per year will \njump to over 2,000, which will require certification for thousands of \nflights.\n  Future generations of space travel will be almost as routine as \ncommercial air travel today. The passenger risk will be reduced to 1 \nfatality per 2,000,000 flights at a cost of $10 per pound to orbit. \nCrew escape will be eliminated as system reliability matures. In forty \nyears, true Spaceliners will be capable of satisfying a market demand \nover 10,000 missions per year--acheiving near airline-like life \ncertification.\n  Doubling and tripling the structural margin will require us to move \nbeyond traditional rocket engine cycles to a combined air-breathing \nrocket cycle. These new propulsion systems could allow space vehicles \nto takeoff horizontally like an airplane. These air-breathing vehicles \nwill provide greater opportunities to return to earth from orbit--a key \nrequirement for routine commercial package delivery and military \npriorities. The technologies required for these systems will truly \nmarry the best of the aeronautics and space communities.\n  The large increase in flights per year will demand that current \noperations\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\nand maintenance procedures be revolutionized. Unlike the current \nshuttle, which requires over 5 months to process with several thousand \npersonnel, the next generation of systems will be turned around in one \nweek with less than one hundred personnel. In contrast to the rigorous \ntear-downs and inspections required for the Space Shuttle's subsystems, \nthe next generation vehicle's on-board health monitoring systems will \ntell the ground crews which systems need replacement before landing. \nDue to modern computer and display technologies, the number of \npersonnel required on launch day will be reduced from 170 to about 10. \nAn automated mission planning system will enable changes in payload and \nweather to be factored in less than twenty-four hours. The payload will \nbe processed off-line and integrated into the vehicle the day prior to \nlaunch. Range safety will be accomplished using the Global Positioning \nSystem, reducing the number of personnel to a handful. Upon landing, \nthe vehicle will, various ways, automatically restore itself, requiring \nminimal human intervention.\n\n  In twenty-five years, vehicles will be re-flown within one day and in \nforty years, within several hours with crews numbering less than ten. \nFully automated ground processing systems will require only a handful \nof personnel to launch the vehicle. Due to the increased intelligence \nof on-board systems, only cursory walk-around inspections will be \nrequired between flights. Payloads will be fully containerized and \nloaded hours before flight. Range safety will be replaced by Aerospace \nTraffic Control Centers scattered around the globe, passively \nmonitoring the multiple flights using commercial broadcast towers.\n  Today we've imagined our boundless future of space exploration on \nsafe, affordable space transportation.\n  But, stop to think what our future will be if we don't develop the \nfundamental technological building blocks. To realize these ambitious \ngoals, we must provide consistent funding for our technology programs \nover the next several decades.\n  What will inspire the next generation of Americans? We must not kill \nthe spirit of the Lewis and Clark's among us. Our next great adventure \nis the exploration and development of space! If we continue to cut \ncorners on our financial commitment without conquering this tremendous \nchallenge of making space travel safe and affordable for ordinary \npeople, we will stunt the pioneer spirit that brands us all as \nAmericans.\n  NASA has accepted the responsibility for pushing technology because \nthis is vitally important for our nation. The nation must focus \nresources on accelerated technology development if we are to remain the \nworldwide technology leader. We will drive the technology breakthroughs \nnecessary to sustain and enhance U.S. military capabilities. Our \nNation's defense in very dynamic times must rely on cutting-edge space \nlaunch technologies to protect our borders.\n  But low-cost space transportation is not just about surviving. It is \nabout thriving economically. Our wildest dreams of doing business on \nthe space frontier surely don't even begin to skim the surface of the \nincredible economic opportunities waiting beyond the horizon.\n\n  Today, the X-33 and X-34 programs are making significant strides, \ntaking us towards these goals and will provide us with new benchmarks \nin how to develop and operate modern reusable launch systems. Today, I \nwant to salute NASA's goals and dreams. They are the same ones that \ntook Apollo 11 to the Moon 30 years ago. They should be ours as well; \nto develop and demonstrate in flight the required technologies to win \nthe promise of flights to low earth orbit for $100 per pound, with a \n10,000 times increase over today's safety levels.\n  Mr. President, I also want to endorse NASA's approach of ``build a \nlittle, test a little, fly a little'' by performing rigorous ground \ntesting. I believe it is imperative to move forward with our X-34 sized \nflight demonstrations within the next 5 years.\n  We are at a defining moment in the development of space. The key is \nmaking space transportation affordable for ordinary people. Through \ninnovative technology development, NASA will lead our nation as we \nunlock the door to the final frontier. I call on all my colleagues, and \nindeed the citizens of our great land, to give them our support. Let us \nreturn to a time when we made our dreams a reality--let us return to \nbeing a nation of explorers.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thirty years ago today human beings first \nset foot the surface of the Moon. The Apollo 11 landing was an \nunprecedented accomplishment, one that marked the culmination of a \nnational commitment to space exploration initiated by President \nKennedy.\n  As many of my colleagues will remember, our country's space program \nwas a child of the Cold War. In many ways, our rivalry with the Soviet \nUnion in space was the primary impetus for the Apollo Program. The \nSoviets launched the first artificial satellite. They put the first man \nin space. They achieved the first space walk. Thirty years ago, we were \nintent on responding to those milestones by putting the first man on \nthe Moon. As then Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson said, ``I, for \none, don't intend to go to sleep by the light of a Communist moon.''\n  Today there is no Cold War, no unifying theme around which to rally \nour space program. Yet our exploration of space remains as important \ntoday as it was three decades ago. History tells us that those nations \nwhich developed the frontier prospered. Space is the latest frontier.\n  Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, the Chinese character for \n``crisis'' is the same as that for ``opportunity.'' As our nation \nrecalls the triumph of Apollo, we face both crisis and opportunity in \nour space program.\n  On May 25th, the Cox Commission reported multiple instances of \nsensitive American nuclear and missile technology falling into the \nhands of the People's Republic of China. It identified the lack of a \nsufficient United States commercial space launch capacity--a problem \nthat has sent launch business to nations like China--as one of the \nreasons for this transfer of information.\n  The numbers tell an alarming story. Though nearly 70% of the world's \ncommercial satellites are assembled in the United States, less than 45 \npercent are launched from our shores. Because more than 60 U.S. \nsatellites have been approved for export to launch from Russia, the \nUkraine, and China since 1995, U.S. rocket manufacturers and their vast \nsupplier network have lost approximately $2.4 billion in direct \nrevenues--a figure that doesn't include American satellite launches by \nthe powerful European Arainespace Consortium.\n  Why are we losing out to other nations? One reason is cost. As \nscientist and author Gregg Easterbrook pointed out in the June 2, 1998 \nedition of the New York Times, companies that launch satellites aboard \nAmerican space vehicles can expect to pay between $10,000 and $12,000 \nper pound. Nations like China--where government partially subsidizes \nthe cost of satellite launches--can offer the same services for half \nthe cost.\n  A second reason for our nation's declining share of commercial space \nlaunches is the relatively small number of available launch vehicles in \nthe United States. From 1977 to 1986, the space shuttle was the only \nspacecraft authorized to carry satellites into orbit. That nearly ten-\nyear hiatus in American rocket development gave a huge advantage to \nnations that used that time to build and improve the Russian Proton, \nEuropean Ariane, and Chinese Long March rockets.\n  Last fall, I joined Senator Connie Mack (R-FL), U.S. Representative \nDave Weldon (R-FL), members of the House Science and Senate Commerce \nCommittees, and a broad, bipartisan coalition in tackling these \nproblems through the enactment of the Commercial Space Act. That \nlegislation took steps to create a stable business environment for the \nU.S. commercial space industry, while simultaneously making the \ngovernment's use of space technology more efficient and saving \ntaxpayers millions of dollars. Even better, it did not add new federal \nregulations or raise taxes by so much as a penny. President Clinton \nsigned it into law on October 28, 1998.\n  The Commercial Space Act will help to address the cost and capacity \nproblems that have plagued our nation's\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\ncommercial space industry. For example, it breaks the federal \ngovernment's monopoly on space travel and encourages launch options \nthat might lower costs. Until the passage of this legislation, the \nspace shuttle was the only American craft authorized to both leave and \nre-enter our planet's atmosphere. Commercial companies that have an \ninterest in providing repeat services to their customers might benefit \nfrom the same principle of reusability that powers Columbia, Discovery, \nAtlantis, and Endeavor.\n  In addition, our legislation helps to mitigate the United States' \ndearth of launch vehicles by allowing the conversion of excess \nballistic missiles into space transportation carriers. International \narms control agreements have rendered these missiles useless for \nnational defense, and the hundreds in storage eat up close to $10 \nmillion a year. Replacing their nuclear warheads with scientific and \neducational payloads will give the United States a practical, low-cost \nmethod for putting satellites into orbit.\n  But more and less expensive rockets will do little to erase other \nnations' competitive advantage if the United States does not have the \ninfrastructure needed to launch them. That's why a similar bipartisan \ncoalition recently introduced the Spaceport Investment Act. This \nlegislation would make the financing of spaceport construction and \nrenovation 100% tax-free--an innovation that could spur private \ninvestment in the important task of building and modernizing our \nnation's space launch facilities.\n  While airports, high speed rail, seaports, mass transit, and other \ntransportation projects can raise money through tax-exempt bonds, \nspaceports do not currently enjoy such favorable tax treatment. This \namounts to a glaring omission in federal policy. Airlines, cruise, and \nshipping lines could not exist without airports and seaports. In the \nsame fashion, state-administered spaceports provide vital incentives \nfor space-related economic growth by supplementing the launch \ninfrastructure already provided by the federal government.\n  My home state offers tangible proof of spaceports' value to the \ncommercial space industry. Since its creation in 1989, Spaceport \nFlorida has facilitated more than $100 million in space-related \nconstruction and investment projects. This includes the modification \nand conversion of Launch Complex 46 from a military to a commercial \nspace facility.\n  Virginia, Alaska, and California also host spaceports, and ten other \nstates--Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, \nNorth Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah--are considering their \nestablishment. We must take advantage of this opportunity to make the \npublic and private sectors partners in the effort to build badly needed \nlaunch sites around the nation.\n  The Commercial Space Act and Spaceport Investment Act will boost the \neffort to recapture space business in the United States. But these \nlegislative initiatives must be part of a larger solution. In the \ncoming months, I will be exploring the idea of a National Space Summit \nthat brings together lawmakers, federal and state space administrators, \nbusiness leaders, and academic representatives with the goal of \nlaunching a united effort to revitalize our commercial space industry \nand reverse our rapidly declining share of space launches.\n  Mr. President, while we recognize the historical significance of \ntoday's date, we must not let the accomplishments of the past dilute \nour focus on the future. My proposal is an innovative and efficient \nmethod for encouraging private and public cooperation in the important \ngoal of revitalizing our national reach for the stars.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this important \neffort to repave our pathways to outer space. This would be a fitting \ntribute to the brave pioneers who landed on the Moon thirty years ago \ntoday. Those early explorers sacrificed much for our nation's \ncommitment to space exploration. Just yesterday, one of these pioneers, \nApollo 12 Commander Pete Conrad, was buried in Arlington National \nCemetary. Let us produce a lasting memorial to these astronaut heroes \nby rededicating ourselves to their cause.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues in a \ntribute to the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. Thirty years \nago today, our nation was launched into the lead of a global space \nrace. Not only was this an important step for our nation, it was an \nimportant step for America in the Cold War--a war waged in \ntechnological and economic terms rather than on the front lines of the \nbattlefield. A war in which America later claimed victory during \nPresident Reagan's administration.\n  The Apollo 11 mission played a role in that victory. The famous \nwords, ``one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind'' was more \nthan appropriate. It was one of the highlights of NASA and during the \npinnacle of the agency's existence. On the morning of July 16, 1969, \nthe mission's Saturn V rocket was launched from the Kennedy Space \nCenter, landing on the moon four days later. On board with Neil \nArmstrong and Buzz Aldrin was Michael Collins, who piloted the command \nmodule while his comrades used a landing craft, the Eagle, to make that \nhistoric visit to the lunar surface.\n  The mission was a unifying event in an era when America was wracked \nby social protest and divided over the Vietnam War. People across the \ncountry, and around the world, sat glued to television sets as the \nApollo crew did what was once thought impossible. The important \nachievement of Apollo demonstrated that humanity is not forever chained \nto this planet.\n  Mr. President, I regret that the push for manned space flight has \nfaded in the years since Apollo. I find it ironic, that 30 years after \nfirst going to the moon that children today are learning about space \ntravel in history class, rather than science class.\n  May 13, 2004, will mark the launch of the Corps of Discovery \nbicentennial. It was during this adventure that Meriwether Lewis and \nWilliam Clark, along with a small band of men, set out on a voyage of \nexploration that was to earn them a place in America's history. Tasked \nwith exploring a new and largely unknown world, Lewis and Clark opened \nthe West and provided storytellers with a compelling, historic drama.\n  Today, NASA's role in space exploration parallels the role of the \nCorps of Discovery. No other federal agency is faced with such \nintriguing and limitless boundaries. No other federal agency captivates \nthe attention of school children around the nation.\n  But NASA's obstacle is not a technology barrier--rather it is a \nbarrier of financial abilities. Space activities require decades of \nplanning. Short-term constraints of a political agenda do not address \nthis necessity. It is not where we want to be next year, rather where \nwe want to be 20 years from now. That is a blindness many politicians \nare hampered with.\n  For the sixth year in a row, NASA's budget has declined while its \nproductivity improves. We know what NASA is able to do. In the 1960s, \nthe Saturn/Apollo program put a man on the moon. Only recently has the \ncommercial sector approached NASA's heavy-lift capacities.\n  Our nation's history is one of triumph and tragedy. We have rejoiced \nin NASA's success and mourned in its grief but the Apollo 11 mission \nwas one of the greatest moments in our nation's history.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, thirty years ago Neil Armstrong took his \nhistoric first steps on the surface of the moon, fulfilling the dreams \nof his fellow astronauts, his country, and the entire human race. His \n``small step'' has inspired the following generations in a quest to \nexplore the frontiers of space. Space travel has encouraged ingenuity \nthat permeates American society. National Aeronautic and Space \nAdministration (NASA) accomplishments have led to technological \nadvancements utilized in everyday life, as well as increased math and \nscience interest among school children, and the development of a multi-\nbillion dollar commercial space industry. While there are many benefits \nof space exploration, the United States still faces the challenge of \ndeveloping a cost effective strategy to manage existing space programs. \nWe should build on the legacy of Apollo II by forging ahead with both \nbasic R and advanced future technologies in a cost effective and \nwell-managed collaborative effort with private industry.\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\n  The accomplishment three decades ago of the seemingly impossible task \nof sending a man to the moon led to a newly found confidence in the \npower of science. President Kennedy challenged America in 1961 to send \na man to the moon, when many people believed it to be impossible. \nWithin a decade, America had risen to the challenge by demonstrating \ntheir technological superiority over the rest of the world with Apollo \n11. Such a powerful display of technology is a catalyst of a cycle \nresulting in an increased standard of living for many Americans. The \ncycle begins as many young people are motivated to pursue science as an \nacademic discipline. New scientific interest results in an increase in \nbasic research funding at universities and corporations. The cycle is \ncompleted when advancements ranging from more comfortable mattresses to \nbetter radiation treatment for cancer patients begin to make their way \ninto everyday life. Other emerging applications include agricultural \nremote sensing techniques, distance learning, and telemedicine. The \nincreased productivity attributable to these applications will serve as \na stimulus to the national economy.\n  Commercial space launch is an entire industry that has stemmed from \nthe application of technology in space. The broadcast, \ntelecommunications, and weather industries all increasingly rely on \nsatellites to provide the most effective services. The U.S. commercial \nlaunch industry had revenues totaling $2.4 billion dollars in 1997. \nThis industry is projected to grow exponentially over the coming years. \nThe Commerce Department estimates that over 1,700 satellites are \nexpected to be launched over the next ten years--70% of which will come \nfrom the commercial industry. It is clear that if the United States is \nto remain the world's leader in this domain, we must begin now to \nmodernize the Nation's space launch capacity. That means reviewing the \nstate of our outdated launch vehicle technology, our costly \ninfrastructure, and the financial insurance needs that are key to the \ngrowth of this industry.\n  The immediate future of NASA lies in the International Space Station, \nan international cooperative effort to build a research facility in \nspace. The International Space Station will provide a unique \nenvironment for research with the absence of gravity, allowing new \ninsights into human health and disease treatments. However, this \ninnovative research facility bears a price tax of approximately $100 \nbillion dollars to the American taxpayers. Although this program is a \nlong-term investment which will bring discoveries unimaginable to \ntoday's scientists, it is our duty to protect the American taxpayers \nfrom unsatisfactory performance of the participating foreign partners, \nprime contractor, and program management. Congress must insist on \nfurther accountability from NASA in order to most effectively support \nthis program. We should not allow delays in foreign components of the \nInternational Space Station to increase the burden on American \ncitizens.\n  On this day in 1969, Neil Armstrong knew that he was making an \nimportant first step. We have the responsibility of taking the next \nstep by determining the future path for NASA and the space industry. \nOur efforts to reach the moon required a creative approach to a \ndifficult challenge. In the spirit of the Apollo program, I call on \nNASA and policy makers to take a creative approach to ensuring fiscal \nresponsibility while fostering the innovation that benefits every \nAmerican.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the resolution \nsubmitted by Senator Shelby commemorating the 30th anniversary of the \nfirst lunar landing, an event that will be remembered as one of the \nmost important events of our country and century. Americans remember \nthe landing on the lunar surface not only with a sense of historical \nsignificance, but also with one of honor and pride in the \naccomplishment of the crew of Apollo 11 and the men and women of NASA \nwho made it possible.\n  This mission was conducted during a tumultuous time in our country's \nhistory. Sending a man to the moon forced us to marshal our country's \nvast talent and technological resources and to drive our creative \nenergies to the breaking point. Apollo proved that necessity is the \nmother of invention. The Apollo mission required us to make quantum \nleaps in propulsion systems, airframe materials, electronics, and other \nscientific areas in an impossible amount of time.\n  I congratulate Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, the late Michael Collins, \nand NASA for their courage to lead our country to the new world of \nspace. While our accomplishments in space have continued, space still \noffers us a vast and unexplored frontier. America has been, and should \nremain a world leader in space research, technology, and exploration. \nIt is on this 30th anniversary of the first lunar landing that America \nshould renew its support for our space program and challenge ourselves \nonce again as we begin a new century.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
