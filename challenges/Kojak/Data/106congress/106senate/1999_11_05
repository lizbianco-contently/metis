Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 625, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 625) to amend title 11, United States Code, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation on \ntime, or is there a time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair knows of no time limits.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. President, I see my good friend, the Senator from Iowa, on the \nfloor. I will speak in my capacity as ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I know Senator Hatch has spoken in his capacity as \nchairman of the committee. I know the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, \nis here as chairman of the appropriate subcommittee, and Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey will be here as ranking member of that \nsubcommittee.\n  This is an important issue. It is safe to say every American agrees \nwith the basic principle that debts should be repaid. It certainly is a \nprinciple I was brought up to believe and one my fellow Vermonters \nshare. In fact, this country is blessed with prosperity, and the vast \nmajority of Americans are able to meet their obligations. But for those \nwho fall on financial hard times, bankruptcy should be available in a \nfair and balanced way. In fact, our country's founders believed the \nprinciple was so important they enshrined it in the Constitution, one \nof the few such specific reliefs enshrined in the Constitution.\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress \npower to establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States.\n  We in Congress have a constitutional responsibility to oversee our \nNation's bankruptcy laws. Unfortunately, more and more Americans are \nfiling for bankruptcy. In fact, 1.4 million Americans filed for \nbankruptcy last year. That was an increase in the number of filings \nfrom 1997, and in 1997 there was an increase in the number of filings \nfrom 1996. I find this trend extremely disturbing because the economy \nis doing so well. Even this morning, we hear of unemployment at an all-\ntime low, inflation is steady, and the economy is booming. The \nunemployment rate keeps going down, inflation remains low, and the \nNation's personal bankruptcies keep going up.\n\n  Vermont has traditionally had one of the lowest rates of bankruptcy \nper capita in the Nation. But in my home State of Vermont, personal \nbankruptcies have increased in each of the last 4 years, with annual \npersonal bankruptcies more than doubling since 1994. I said this has \noccurred even though we have kept our low ranking compared to other \nStates in the number of personal bankruptcy filings per capita. We will \nbe able to keep that ranking because personal bankruptcy rates have \ngone up far more dramatically in other States.\n  If the rise in personal bankruptcy is caused in part by some \nAmericans abusing the bankruptcy system, then we in Congress should \nmove in a major, balanced way to correct our bankruptcy laws. Working \ntogether, we saw a way we could do this. We did last year. Democrats \nand Republicans molded a bill that corrected abuses by debtors and \ncreditors, and it preserved access to the bankruptcy system for honest \ndebtors.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, who \nworked with the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, did \nyeoman's work on last year's bill. They produced a bipartisan bill. As \nI recall--my colleague from Iowa can correct me if I am wrong--I \nbelieve it passed the Senate with something like 97 votes and only 1 or \n2 votes against it. It is pretty amazing to have that strong support \nwhen we have a piece of legislation that balances such contrasting, \nsometimes conflicting, interests around the country. It is a credit to \nthe two Senators who crafted it. They balanced the competing interests \nof debtors and creditors to put together a bill that is fair to all.\n  I am on the floor today because I have a concern that the bill before \nus strays from the blueprint of last year's balanced reforms in the \nSenate. For example, today's bill requires the means\n\n[[Page S14053]]\n\ntesting of debtors to complete chapter 7 filings based on expense \nstandards that are formulated by the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Last year, Congress was exposing the IRS as an agency out of control \nin its enforcement of the Internal Revenue Code, but now we say we will \ntrust the IRS with enforcement of the bankruptcy code. We were saying \nlast year they could not enforce the Internal Revenue Code, the area of \ntheir own expertise, but now we say we will let them help enforce the \nbankruptcy code, an area in which they have no expertise or \njurisdiction. In my State, we say that lacks common sense.\n  This means testing severely restricts a judge's discretion to take \ninto account individual debtors' circumstances. As a result, it has the \npotential to cause an unforgiving and inflexible result of denying \nhonest debtors access to a postbankruptcy fresh start and would go \nagainst basically the way the bankruptcy code has been followed since \nthe beginning of this country.\n  I believe most Americans, perhaps not all but most Americans, who \nfile for bankruptcy honestly need relief from their creditors to get \nback on their feet financially. We have recent research that shows \nstagnant wages and consumer credit card debt are the primary reasons \nfor the rise in bankruptcy filings. If there are abuses in the credit \nindustry, then we should move in a major and balanced way to correct \nthem.\n\n  I believe last year's Senate consumer bankruptcy reform bill, which, \nas I said, passed this Chamber by a near unanimous vote of 97-1, \nprovides us with a blueprint for balanced reforms.\n  Moreover, the latest study by the nonpartisan American Bankruptcy \nInstitute found that only 3 percent of chapter 7 filers could afford to \nrepay some portion of their debt. To force the other 97 percent of \nchapter 7 debtors to submit to this arbitrary means test in trying to \nreach 3 percent lacks common sense and poses an additional burden on \nthe 97 percent for something that does not apply to them. The Congress \nseems to be stepping on people it should not.\n  To the credit of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from New \nJersey, they are working to moderate the bill's arbitrary means testing \nprovisions, and I commend them for working together to improve the \nunderlying bill. I also commend the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nand the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, for their leadership on \nthis issue. I hope we can significantly improve the bill's means test \nprovisions in the coming days, and we can if we want to work at it.\n  I am also concerned that today's bill, at least as it is now, prior \nto any amendments, is missing a key ingredient from last year's \nbalanced reforms in the Senate: consumer credit information and \nprotection.\n  Last year's Senate-passed bill required the disclosure of information \non credit card fees and charges and also protection against unjustified \ncredit industry practices. As the Department of Justice stated in its \nwritten views on the bill:\n\n       The challenge posed by the unprecedented level of \n     bankruptcy filings requires us to ask for greater \n     responsibility from both debtors and creditors. Credit card \n     companies must give consumers more and better information so \n     they can understand and better manage their debt.\n\n  The administration has made it clear that for the President to sign \nbankruptcy reform legislation into law, it has to contain strong \nconsumer credit disclosure and protection provisions. I agree with \nthat. The credit card industry has to shoulder some responsibility for \nthe nationwide rise in personal bankruptcy filings.\n  Last year, credit card lenders sent out 3.4 billion solicitations--\n3.4 billion. There are only 260 million people in this country, from \nthe child born this morning on through. We are talking about 12 credit \ncard solicitations per year for every man, woman, and child in America.\n  I constantly hear from parents that their 10-year-old child may \nreceive a letter: You have been preapproved for credit; X number \nthousands of dollars. Here is your credit card.\n  I am not as concerned about the 10-year-old because usually the \nparent will grab that. I am a little bit concerned about the 16- or 17-\nyear-old who has been eyeing a stereo set, or whatever, and they get \nthe credit card preapproved. How about the college kids who get four or \nfive of those in the mail: You have been preapproved. Suddenly they \nsay: Wow, I'm worth $75,000. I have it right here in plastic. \nUnfortunately, when they spend it, they have to pay it back. We need a \nlittle more responsibility on this.\n  Do we want to send a 10-year-old down to the store with $3,000 worth \nof credit in their credit card? I would think not. But I also don't \nwant the credit card companies crying when they do this and then the \nbills do not get paid. A little bit of effort should be made first to \nmake sure you know who you are preapproving.\n  I add, there are times when somebody's pet has been preapproved. My \neldest son has two beautiful Labrador retrievers--nice dogs, friendly \ndogs but, as most labs, probably more friendly than bright. I am not \nsure I want to give them credit cards. And for all the Labrador \nretriever owners who might have heard that and will call my office, \nplease understand, I do like those dogs, but I am still not going to \ngive them a credit card.\n  Clearly, the billions of credit card solicitations that are sent to \nAmericans every year have contributed to an era of lax credit \npractices. That, in turn, contributes to the steep rise in personal \nbankruptcy filings. I am hopeful we can add credit industry reforms to \nthis bill in the coming days.\n  Senators Torricelli and Grassley have prepared a managers' amendment \nthat incorporates many credit industry reforms proposed by Senators \nSchumer, Reed, Dodd, and others. I commend these Senators for working \ntogether on these bipartisan credit card reforms. I am pleased, \nactually, to cosponsor the amendment I have just referred to because it \nadds more balance to the bill.\n  Another area where we can add needed balanced reform to this \nlegislation is in the homestead exemption. You have States--Florida and \nTexas, for example--where debtors are permitted to take an unlimited \nexemption from their creditors for the value of their home. We \nunderstand the policy reasons for protecting one's home. But I think \nthe policy was determined when you think of the average home. \nUnfortunately, this exemption has led to wealthy debtors abusing their \nState laws to protect multimillion-dollar mansions from their \ncreditors.\n  I do not think we intend somebody to be able to run up millions of \ndollars of debt, have a multi-multimillion-dollar mansion and say: Wait \na minute. I need my humble home.\n  Home may be where the heart is, but it is not necessarily where the \nbankruptcy protection should be. This is a real abuse of bankruptcy's \nfresh start protection.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, has been a leader \nin trying to end homestead bankruptcy abuses. He has, again, prepared a \nbipartisan amendment to cap any homestead exemption at $100,000. I hope \nthe full Senate will adopt the Kohl amendment to place reasonable \nlimits on homestead exemptions.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, plans to \noffer an amendment to increase the minimum wage over the next 2 years \nfrom $5.15 to $6.15 an hour. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \namendment, as I have been before.\n  It is more than appropriate to help working men and women earn a \nliving wage on a bill related to bankruptcy. These minimum-wage workers \nare some of the same Americans who are struggling to make a living \nevery day and might be forced into bankruptcy by job loss or divorce or \nother unexpected economic event.\n  More than 11 million workers will get a pay raise as a result of a $1 \nincrease in the minimum wage. We ought to agree to help millions of \nhard-working American families live in dignity.\n  I plan to offer an amendment that would save the taxpayers millions \nof dollars in wasteful spending and improve the bill by revising the \nrequirement for all debtors to file with the court copies of their tax \nreturns for the past 3 years. If the requirement was in effect last \nyear, the 1.4 million Americans who filed for bankruptcy would have \nproduced at least 4.2 million copies of their tax returns.\n  It might sound like a great idea, but the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates it will cost taxpayers about $34\n\n[[Page S14054]]\n\nmillion over the next 5 years for the courts to store and provide \naccess to more than 20 million tax returns. It is a pretty big expense \nfor very little benefit.\n  Every time we do something with one of these mandates, it may sound \ngreat, but we ought to ask ourselves, what does this cost? What do we \nget out of it? My amendment makes more sense. It does what the original \namendment wanted to do but without the cost. It would strike the \nrequirement. It would, instead, permit any party in interest--a \ncreditor, judge, trustee or whoever--to request copies of a debtor's \ntax returns once the bankruptcy is filed. It is a targeted approach, \ntargeted to verify a debtor's assets and income. I think it is workable \nand efficient because most bankruptcy cases involve debtors with no \nassets and little income, thus no need for the review of tax returns \nand no need for the taxpayers to spend $34 million to store paper \nnobody is ever going to look at.\n  So let's not pile up millions and millions and millions of these \npieces of paper, hire hundreds and hundreds of people to store them, \nand then have something nobody is ever going to look at anyway.\n  I have consulted with our bankruptcy judge and trustee in Vermont. I \nwill continue to do so. They caution that we remember the purpose \nbankruptcy serves: a safety net for many of our constituents. Those who \nare using it are usually the most vulnerable of America's middle class. \nThey are older Americans who have lost their jobs or are unable to pay \ntheir medical debts. They are women attempting to raise their families \nor to secure alimony or child support after divorce. They are \nindividuals struggling to recover from unemployment.\n  As we move forward with reforms that are appropriate to eliminate \nabuses in the system--and we should eliminate such abuses--we need to \nremember that people use the system, both the debtors and the \ncreditors. We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of \nmiddle-class Americans who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming \nfinancial burdens.\n  On a personal note, I welcome the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Torricelli, who is the new ranking member of the \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee, to the challenges \nthis matter presents. I know he and his staff have been working hard in \ngood faith to improve this bill.\n  As the last Congress proved, there are many competing interests in \nthe bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced \nand bipartisan bill into law. Unfortunately, overall, the Congress \nfailed to meet that challenge last year, even though I believe we met \nit here in the Senate, in the Grassley-Durbin bill, which passed 97 to \n1. I was pleased and proud to be a supporter of that. The mistake came \nin the conference. It broke down into a partisan fight, as though there \nis a difference between a Republican or a Democrat who is seeking \nbankruptcy relief or a difference between a Republican or a Democrat \ncreditor whose interests have to be protected in bankruptcy.\n\n  This is an American issue. We handled it as such in the Senate a year \nago. We should do it again. I hope we can set, again, the standard, \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate working together to pass and \nenact into law balanced legislation that will correct abuses by both \ndebtors and creditors in the bankruptcy system. We are going to be \nbetter off for it. I hope that is what we can do.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves \nthe floor, I want to thank him for his comments. He has expressed very \nwell some statements about parts of the bill on which he has questions. \nI want to assure him, most of those--in fact, the way the Senate works, \nprobably all of those--will have to be addressed in some way through \nthe various amendments which are likely to be adopted. We do have a \nvery close working relationship, even at this point, on some of those \nthings with people on the Senator's side of the aisle. We will try to \ndo that.\n  If I could also make the Senator from Vermont aware of a study he \nreferenced, the study done by the American Bankruptcy Institute on the \nutility of chapter 7 debtors to repay their debts--the Senator may not \nknow this, but we have had the General Accounting Office look at this \nstudy; in fact, all the studies on this question. The General \nAccounting Office has concluded that this specific study by the \nAmerican Bankruptcy Institute was flawed. In fact, it understated the \nrepayment ability in a very significant way.\n  I do not expect the Senator to accept that right now, just because I \nhave said it. I hope he will be able to take a look at that and see if \nthere are any remaining questions that he might have which we could \naddress, and if we can't do that and the Senator might be considering \nsome amendments that are a direct result of the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute study, that we would have an opportunity to talk about it \nbefore he might move in that direction.\n  Overall, his statement is very accurate, stating some disagreements, \nsome questions he has. Hopefully, we will be able to address those \nquestions.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the Senator from \nIowa. He and I have been here for a long time. We have worked on an \nawful lot of issues, from defense matters to agricultural matters. Over \nthose years, I have always enjoyed working with him. We will continue \non this. I realize there will not be votes today, but I think this \nwould be a good time for Senators who are trying to reach areas of \naccommodation and agreement to do so. Either I or my staff will be here \nto work with the staff of the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator \nfrom Iowa in any way we can be helpful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know Senator Torricelli is expected to \ncome to the floor to make a statement. While we are awaiting his \narrival, I will address the Senate on a small but very important part \nof this legislation. That is the one that deals with chapter 12, making \nit permanent, as part of the bankruptcy reform legislation, so we do \nnot have to, every 4 or 5 years or, as has been the case in the last 12 \nmonths, since it has sunsetted, had to reauthorize it two or three \ntimes on a short-term basis.\n  We are all in agreement it should be made permanent. People who have \nopposed making it permanent as a separate bill have thought it was \nnecessary to do it at the same time as we offer the overall bankruptcy \nreform legislation. Hopefully, with this bill, S. 625, being adopted, \nwe will never in the future have to deal with a separate \nreauthorization of a sunset chapter 12 because why should we have to \nsunset chapter 12, a provision that is made specifically for farming, \nwhen we don't do it for chapter 13, that is made specifically for \nindividuals or small businesses, or chapter 11 that works very well for \nmajor corporations in America.\n  I want to visit with my colleagues about some very important \nprovisions in the bill before us that are vital to family farmers in \nthe Midwest generally, in Iowa in particular, as well as the country as \na whole. Agriculture, wherever it is, is something unique and different \nfrom a lot of businesses in their situations, where sometimes they have \na decline not only in income that might make bankruptcy be considered \nbut also a decline in value of real estate that, previous to chapter \n12, made it very difficult to keep up with the needs of a chapter 11 \nbankruptcy procedure.\n  As we all know from the recent debate we had within the last month on \nthe emergency Ag appropriations bill, many of America's farmers are \nfacing financial ruin. We have some of the lowest commodity prices in \n30 years. Pork producers have lost billions of dollars in equity, not \njust in income but billions of dollars of equity, with the lowest \nprices of pork in 60 years that we had just 12 months ago. Pork \nproducers have not only lost, but the price of corn is currently well \nunder the cost of production. The cash market for soybeans has reached \na 23-year low. This is all in addition to poor weather conditions in \nparts of the United States, particularly the drought of the East Coast, \nthe drought of Texas, the fires in Florida, and flooding in various \nparts of the Midwest.\n\n[[Page S14055]]\n\n  These circumstances have sent many farming operations in a tailspin. \nClearly, we need to make sure family farmers continue to have \nbankruptcy protection available to them and a protection that satisfies \nthe uniqueness of farming, as we have had other sections of the code \ntry to be written to meet the uniqueness of other business arrangements \nwithin our society and our economy.\n  Particularly, chapter 12 is going to be needed in good times as well \nas bad times--maybe not used in good times, but it needs to be there to \nmeet the different arrangements of the different segments of the \ncountry and also the different drought and flooding conditions that \nhappen from time to time, as well as the unpredictability of the \neconomy, particularly the international economy, when the Southeast \nAsian financial crisis brought a downturn in our exports and squeezed \nthe farmers' income at this particular time.\n  Title X of S. 625 of this bill makes chapter 12 permanent and makes \nseveral changes to chapter 12 to make it more accessible for farmers \nand to give farmers new tools to assist in reorganizing their financial \naffairs.\n  Back in the mid-1980s when Iowa was in the midst of another \ndevastating farm crisis, I wrote chapter 12 to make sure family farmers \nwould receive a fair shake when dealing with the banks and the Federal \nGovernment. At that time, I didn't know if chapter 12 was going to work \nor not, so it was only enacted on a temporary basis.\n  Chapter 12 has been an unmitigated success. As a result of chapter \n12, many farmers in Iowa and across the country are still farming and \ncontributing to America's economy. With a new crisis in farm country \nnow, just 15 years from the last one, we need to make sure chapter 12 \nis a permanent part of Federal law, and this bankruptcy bill does \nexactly that.\n  As was the case with the dark days of the mid-1980s, some are \npredicting that family farms should consolidate and we should turn to \ncorporate farming to supply our food and agricultural products. As with \nthe 1980s, some people seem to think family farms are inefficient \nrelics that should be allowed to go out of business. This would mean \nthe end of an important part of our Nation's economy and a certain \nheritage that is connected with it. And it would put many hard-working \nAmerican families--those who farm and those whose jobs depend on a \nhealthy agricultural sector--out of work.\n  But the family farm didn't disappear in the 1980s, and that crisis \nwas very bad as well. It was not only an income crisis, as is the \nsituation now, but there was a tremendous drop in equity at that \nparticular time.\n  I believe chapter 12 is a major reason for the survival of many \nfinancially troubled family farms. We have an Iowa State University \nstudy prepared by the outstanding Professor Neil Harl. He found that 84 \npercent of the Iowa farmers who used chapter 12 were able to continue \nfarming. Those are real jobs for all sorts of Iowans in agriculture and \nin industries that depend upon agriculture. According to the same \nstudy, 63 percent of the farmers who used chapter 12 found it helpful \nin getting them back on their feet. In short, I think it is fair to say \nchapter 12 worked in the mid 1980s and it should be made permanent so \nfamily farmers in trouble today can get breathing room and a fresh \nstart if that is what they need to make it.\n  But the most obvious reason for having it is that chapter 11, written \nfor corporate America, does not fit the needs of agriculture or the \neconomics of agriculture.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act before us doesn't just make chapter 12 \npermanent. Instead, the bill makes improvements to chapter 12 so it \nwill be more accessible and helpful for those in the agricultural \ncommunity. First, the definition of the family farmer is widened so \nthat more farmers can qualify for chapter 12 bankruptcy protection. \nSecond, and perhaps most important, my bankruptcy bill reduces the \npriority of capital gains tax liabilities for farm assets sold as part \nof a reorganization plan. This will have the beneficial effect of \nallowing cash-strapped farmers to sell livestock, grain, and other farm \nassets to generate cash flow when liquidity is essential to maintaining \na family farm operation. These reforms will make chapter 12 even more \neffective in protecting America's family farms during this difficult \nperiod.\n  So it is really imperative that we keep chapter 12 alive. Before we \nhad chapter 12, banks held a veto over reorganization plans. They would \nnot negotiate with people in agriculture, and the farmer would be \nforced to auction off the farm, even if the farm had been in the family \nfor generations. Now, because of chapter 12, the banks are willing to \ncome to terms. We must pass S. 625 to make sure America's family farms \nhave a fighting chance to reorganize their financial affairs.\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I see my good friend and coworker on this \nlegislation, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, has come to \nthe floor to make some remarks. As I said last night and I want to say \ntoday, because he wasn't able to be here last night, I really \nappreciate that from day 1 of our even visiting about the possibility \nof putting together a bipartisan bill, as we had done in the previous \nCongress, because he was new to the committee and to this effort, not \nparticipating at the committee level in the efforts I had with Senator \nDurbin of Illinois during the previous Congress on a bill that just \nabout made it through--not knowing those things could work out, we sat \ndown and visited about that possibility.\n  That initial visit brought us to putting together the legislation \nthat is before us, legislation as introduced with the idea that he and \nI may not have agreed to everything down to the last jot and tittle \nwith that legislation, but that we would be able, through the ensuing \nmonths, to work out differences and come to an agreement and get a bill \nout of committee. He has kept his word, and he has worked with us.\n  I don't know whether people who don't participate in the legislative \nprocess know how much easier that is, such a better environment in \nwhich to write legislation and to make public policy. I don't see that \noften enough. I see it in this legislation through the cooperation of \nSenator Torricelli. Obviously, that sort of cooperation is two ways: He \ngives; I give. People who look to him for leadership--he has to carry \nsome water for colleagues of his who want him to work things out. I \nhave to do the same thing. But whether it is as a water carrier for our \ncolleagues or whether it is for the individual philosophy of Senator \nTorricelli or myself, we have been able to bring this together. I thank \nhim for that cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley for what has \nbeen a valuable partnership in crafting what I believe to be extremely \nimportant legislation. It would be fair to conclude that without the \ntenacity of Senator Grassley, this Senate would not be considering \nbankruptcy legislation. Without his reasonableness in reaching some of \nthese provisions, it would not be the kind of progressive legislation \nthat I believe is before us today.\n  I also note that I am a successor to Senator Durbin who, like Senator \nGrassley, has invested not months but more than a year in crafting this \nlegislation. Senator Durbin's contributions are on virtually every \npage. Working with Senator Durbin and, indeed, with Senator Grassley \nhas not only been a pleasure; it has been a productive exercise. For \nthat, I am very grateful.\n  These are unusual times in our country, such an extraordinary \ncombination of economic circumstances. Unemployment is low, home \nownership is at record levels, and, for the first time in years, the \nFederal Government is operating with a surplus. This would lead many to \nbelieve these are not only good economic times but perfect economic \ntimes. This, of course does bear closer scrutiny.\n  There are several troubling aspects with the modern American economy. \nThey are not unrelated. One is a rapidly declining rate of personal \nsavings--indeed, in the last quarter, the lowest savings rate by \nAmerican families in our history.\n  The second is the rapid, almost inexplicable rise in consumer \nbankruptcies. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy \nprotection. This represented a 20-percent increase since 1996 and a \nstaggering 350-percent increase since 1980.\n\n[[Page S14056]]\n\n  We can differ on the reasons. We can have our own theories. But \nsomething is wrong. That ``something'' is not only jeopardizing the \neconomic security of American families, it is providing a staggering \nfinancial burden on small businesses and American financial \ninstitutions.\n  It is estimated 70 percent of the these bankruptcy situations were \nfiled in chapter 7, which provides relief for most unsecured debt. Just \n30 percent of these petitions were filed under chapter 13, which \nrequires a repayment plan.\n  There are, obviously, disagreements about what has caused this \ndramatic increase. It is probable there is no one reason but a \nconfluence of problems. Some suggest that culturally the stigma of \nbankruptcy has been removed and people no longer feel any inhibition in \nadmitting their financial circumstances and seeking total relief from \npersonal obligations. Others believe it is simply abuse of a system in \nwhich it is too simple to avoid responsibility. Others argue that a \nreliance on debt and a decrease in personal savings has left record \nnumbers of Americans vulnerable to this change and leading to these \nextraordinary levels of bankruptcy.\n  Obviously, in the complexities of modern life--with low savings \nrates, high levels of debt, attentions of our current culture, \nunexpected events, divorce, a health crisis, given the enormous cost of \nhealth care in the Nation, the loss of a job or the loss of job skills \nbecause of changes of technology--any one of them, no less a \ncombination of them, can take an American family who believes it is \nliving with financial security and force them under a crushing debt \ninto bankruptcy.\n  The reality, of course, is a majority of these bankruptcies are hard-\nworking American people, low- or middle-class families, who largely, \nthrough no fault of their own, sometimes due to these circumstances \nthat I have outlined, find themselves with overwhelming financial \nproblems and they simply cannot deal with the crushing blow. For all \nthe abuses, the fact remains that accounts for most of these \nbankruptcies.\n  At the same time, in a recent study the Department of Justice has \nfound that 13 percent of all those debtors filing under chapter 7, or \nan incredible 182,000 people, can afford to repay a significant amount \nof this debt. This would mean to creditors, family-owned businesses, \nsmall retailers, and important financial institutions, an incredible $4 \nbillion that could be returned to creditors but is avoided through what \nI perceive to be a misuse of the bankruptcy system.\n  These are the factors, the statistics, and the concerns that led \nSenator Grassley and I to offer this comprehensive bankruptcy reform.\n  The bill before the Senate strikes a balance making it more difficult \nfor the unscrupulous to abuse the system, while ensuring that \nbankruptcy protection for families who need it will find it available.\n  These abuses which result in this $4 billion loss to creditors is not \npaid by some distant institution off our shores separated from the \nrealities of American life or our economy. This is money avoided \nthrough the unscrupulous use of the bankruptcy system that is added \nonto every piece of clothing you buy in the store, every automobile you \npurchase from a show room, every credit card you use, and every bank \nloan that you take.\n  Those hard-working Americans who pay their bills are forced, through \nbankruptcy, through no fault of their own, to share these costs. That \nis what brings us here today.\n\n  At its core, the Grassley-Torricelli bill is designed to assure that \nthose with the ability to repay a portion of their debts do so by \nestablishing clear and reasonable criteria to determine repayment \nobligations.\n  It provides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in \nneed of debt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh \nstart. Recognizing that a fresh start and an ability to have a new life \nhave been at the core in this country, that has been the reason for \nbankruptcy protection since the establishment of the Republic. We \nbelieve in second chances in life. We also don't believe in people \nescaping obligations they can meet or misusing the legal system.\n  It is because, however, of our concern that vulnerable people who \ngenuinely use the system for a new start in life would have their \nposition jeopardized by our legitimate efforts to find those who are \nabusing the system that we have designed a flexible means testing \nsystem in the bankruptcy bill for the first time. Under current law, \nvirtually anyone who files for complete debt relief under chapter 7 \nwill receive it.\n  The Grassley-Torricelli bill creates a needs-based system by \nestablishing a presumption that a chapter 7 filing should be either \ndismissed or converted to a chapter 13 when the debtor has sufficient \nincome to repay at least $15,000, or 25 percent of their outstanding \ndebt. That is the essence of the needs-based system. It is a simple \npresumption. You can pay $15,000, or 25 percent. It is not closed to \nyou. There is no prohibition. But there is a presumption that you can \npay. You need to meet that presumption only for those individuals.\n  I believe this is a flexible yet very efficient screen to move \ndebtors to the ability to repay a portion of their debt into a \nrepayment plan, while at the same time ensuring judicial discretion and \na fair review given the debtor's individual circumstances.\n  In addition, the bill contains several important consumer safeguards \nto prevent unfair harassment by creditors. It requires the Attorney \nGeneral and the FBI Director to designate one prosecutor and one agent \nin every district to investigate reaffirmation practices that violate \nFederal law.\n  This is an important element of this bill to ensure that individual \ncreditors do not seek their own remedy outside of the law, forcing \npeople who cannot repay or should not be repaying, given their \nindividual circumstances and income, to do so.\n  It penalizes creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable repayment \nschedules prior to bankruptcy.\n  The emphasis remains on settlement through negotiations--not \nlitigation and conflict.\n  Importantly, the bill also does everything possible to guarantee that \nchild support payments in bankruptcy are not jeopardized, are a \npriority, and continue.\n  This was the priority in the Judiciary Committee--that we would \nreform this system, we would provide new opportunities for debtors to \ncollect, new safeguards for people in bankruptcy, but that child \nsupport payments and family obligations will remain paramount.\n  I believe in the balance that is achieved in this legislation, and \nthat Senator Grassley and I have met that objective. It was critical to \ndo so because more than one-third of bankruptcies in the United States \ninvolve spousal or child support orders. This bill will not be a \nvehicle for people escaping their family obligations.\n  In half of these cases, women are creditors trying to collect court-\nordered support from their former husbands. These support orders are a \nlifeline for these families. I believe this legislation has protected \nit, recognizing the vulnerability of these families, and why this was a \npriority in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, 44 percent of single parent families with children \nunder the age of 18 had incomes below the poverty line in recent years. \nThe child support amounting to an average of nearly $3,000 is often the \nonly thing that keeps a single parent and a dependent child off public \nassistance. Senator Grassley and I have achieved this protection and I \nbelieve this fair provision of protecting these families by elevating \nchild support from its current place as seventh on the repayment \npriority list to first place. This is critical for Members of the \nSenate to understand. Currently, these child support payments are \nseventh on the list of priorities. Under the Grassley-Torricelli \nlegislation, it will now be first priority. No bank, no insurance \ncompany, no credit card company, no retailer--no one--will have higher \npriority than the children or the spouses involved in these cases.\n  There were other concerns in the Judiciary Committee which needed to \nbe addressed, other balances that have been achieved that the Senate \nshould recognize. First, the managers' amendment that will be offered \nincorporates the language offered by Senator Feingold to remedy a \nprovision in the bill carried over from the legislation of a previous \nyear which would have made\n\n[[Page S14057]]\n\ndebtors' attorneys responsible for costs and fees. That provision would \nhave made it impossible for many middle-income people, people of modest \nmeans, to ever get an attorney. In cases where there is any judgment to \nbe reached, any questions on the merits, it would have been impossible \nto get an attorney, disenfranchising many Americans from the entire \nbankruptcy system. A motion brought by the trustee to move the debtor \nfrom chapter 7 into chapter 13 and the original filing was, we found, \nnot substantially justified. Those costs would have been incurred by \nthe attorney. The managers' amendment will protect against this \nprovision.\n  Second, the managers' amendment will include a safe harbor, exempting \nevery debtor with income below the median income from the means test. \nThis provision will ensure low-income people with no hope of prepaying \ntheir debts are not swept into the means test.\n  A final point I raised that is resolved by the managers' amendment is \nthe use of IRS standards in the bill. Currently, the bill uses living \nexpense standards formulated by the IRS in determining what portion of \ntheir debts an individual has the ability to repay. These standards \nwere not formulated with bankruptcy in mind and provide virtually no \nflexibility to account for the debtor's actual expenses. They were, \ntherefore, not appropriate. The managers' amendment will clarify the \nJustice Department and Treasury have the authority to draft bankruptcy \nappropriate standards and not use the IRS standards previously used.\n  For each of these provisions and their incorporation in this \nlegislation, we are very indebted to members of the Judiciary \nCommittee: Senator Feingold, for his efforts in recognizing the \npossible abuses of putting these costs on to bankruptcy attorneys if \nthe cases were lost; and Senator Durbin, at his insistence and my own, \nwe provided for an appropriate means test; and for the Department of \nJustice coming up with its own means test standards. Senator Durbin, in \nparticular, was very helpful with these provisions. Senator Grassley, \nrecognizing their merits, has brought them into the legislation. It is, \ntherefore, far better legislation because of each of these provisions.\n\n  There is, however, one final area which also must be addressed to \nensure the bill is both balanced and bipartisan. It is critical the \nbill not only address the debtor's abuse of bankruptcy but also \noverreaching and sometimes abusive practices of the credit industry. \nAny American who gets their own mail understands some change is taking \nplace in the American economy--the extraordinary solicitation of \ncustomers, by the 3.5 billion individual efforts by the credit card \nindustry to get new customers. This represents 41 mailings for every \nAmerican household every year; 14 for every man, woman, and child in \nthe Nation. No one disputes both the right and the advisability of the \ncredit card industry seeking solicitation of new customers who are \ncreditworthy, have incomes and the need for available consumer credit. \nIt is right and an important part of our economy. That is not the \nobjective of this legislation.\n  Our concern in balancing provisions dealing with consumer abuse of \nthe bankruptcy laws with credit industry abuse of consumers focuses \ninstead on people of modest incomes who are offered credit they could \nnever afford, debt they will incur that they can never deal with, young \npeople and the elderly, in credit obligations they do not even \nunderstand. The situation, indeed, has become so serious with students \nthat 450 colleges nationwide have banned the marketing of credit cards \non their campuses. Low-income families are being targeted with the same \nfrequency as students--the endless solicitation of debt they cannot \nmeet and should not incur.\n  Since this decade began, Americans with incomes below the poverty \nline have doubled their credit usage. The result is entirely \npredictable. Mr. President, 27 percent of families earning less than \n$10,000 have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of their \nincome. Modest-income families, sometimes high school students, often \npeople on public assistance, receiving hundreds if not thousands of \ncredit solicitations by companies that should recognize with any due \ndiligence that is fully available to the industry that these debts can \nnever be paid. I have granted to the industry that unfortunate changes \nin our culture, abuses of the bankruptcy laws, and a host of other \nreasons have led to needed changes in the bankruptcy laws to avoid \nthese abuses. No one can credibly argue there is not some need of the \nindustry to do so as well.\n  In this legislation we offer the consumers must be given information \nabout the consequences of their debt: fair disclosure if only the \nminimum debt is paid as required by the credit card company or the \nbank; how long will it take for repayment to be made; and what will it \ncost, information that should be made available to every consumer, \npeople believing if they make the minimum payments they will actually \never be out of debt. We want them to recognize the years and the \nenormous costs of doing so.\n  Senator Grassley, working with Senator Schumer, Senator Durbin, and \nothers, has reached an accommodation that I think is fair to the \nindustry but will provide real consumer protection through disclosure. \nThe adoption of that amendment is as vital to a balanced bill as the \nprotection of child support, the moving of people into repayment \nschedules, and a means test.\n  This is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It is a challenge to \nall those who believe this Senate cannot operate on a bipartisan basis. \nThere will be opposition to bankruptcy reform. It may be 5, 10, 15 or \n20 votes, but it will be a small minority. This is genuinely bipartisan \nlegislation. It can be adopted without rancor after months, if not \nyears, of effort by Senators from both sides of the aisle. It is fair; \nit is balanced for the credit card industry and consumers.\n  I end as I began, expressing my gratitude to Senator Grassley and \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee, and I compliment the Senate on what \nI believe will be a worthwhile and informative debate as we adopt this \ncomprehensive bankruptcy reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there does not appear to be an effort on \nthe part of Members to consider this bill which is up for discussion. \nIt will take a few days to get through all the amendments. Given the \nlateness of the year as far as the total legislative session is \nconcerned and considering all the other work that needs to be done to \nwind up this legislative session, there may not be an appreciation of \nall the amendments we have to deal with on this bill. I encourage \nMembers who have amendments to come here on the floor to offer their \namendments. This bill is very complex. Some of the amendments are also \ngoing to be very complex. So please come here and offer your \namendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1730\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 11, United States Code, to provide for health \n          care and employee benefits, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1730 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mr. \n     Torricelli, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1730.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a situation now in which several \nnursing home chains, maybe even some independent nursing homes, are \ngoing into bankruptcy. When this happens, we do not have public policy \nin place to guarantee the economic and accounting decisions that the \nbankruptcy involves take into consideration the needs of the residents \nof these nursing homes.\n  If a hospital goes bankrupt, the basic question then is, What happens \nto the patients? The moving of elderly patients, particularly those who \nhave been in a single nursing home for a long period of time, is a very \ntraumatic experience. Many times, the trauma that results from that \nremoval leads to almost immediate death. I suppose a more accurate \nstatement would be that under any circumstance, patients' welfare \nvaries from case to case.\n\n[[Page S14058]]\n\n  If a bankruptcy trustee is thinking about patients, he may act to \nprotect them. If he is not thinking about the patients, they could end \nup on the street. This has happened before, and it could happen again. \nThe amendment I am offering today with Senator Torricelli and Senator \nLeahy would modify our bankruptcy laws to deal with the failures of \nhealth care businesses. Our intent is simply to protect patients in a \nsystem that is not designed to protect them.\n  The fate of patients caught in business failures does not always make \nheadlines. But when it does, the stories can be quite moving. The Los \nAngeles times on September 28, just 2 years ago, described the terrible \nconsequences of a sudden nursing home closing:\n\n       It could not be determined Saturday how many more elderly \n     and chronically ill patients may be affected by the health \n     care company's financial problems. Those at the Reseda Care \n     Center in the San Fernando Valley, including a 106-year-old \n     woman, were rolled into the street late Friday in wheelchairs \n     and on hospital beds, bundled in blankets, as relatives \n     scurried to gather up clothes and other personal belongings.\n\n  As horrifying as this example is, it could easily be repeated. What \nhappened at the Reseda Care Center, less than 2 years ago, could happen \nagain and again across the country.\n  The Nation's bankruptcy laws are geared towards creditors and \ndebtors. One purpose of the bankruptcy system is to ensure that \ncreditors receive what debtors owe them. To this end, bankruptcy \ntrustees concentrate narrowly on the bottom line. They try to maximize \nthe amount of money returned to creditors. In a system so focused on \nfinances, the human toll is often merely an ancillary concern.\n  Unfortunately, the poor financial conditions that led to the Reseda \nCare Center's collapse are increasing. Large portions of the health \ncare industry are financially ailing. Almost one-third of our hospitals \ncould face foreclosure. At least two of the Nation's largest nursing \nhome chains are in deep financial trouble and may file for bankruptcy. \nWe have had some chains already do that. Two large nursing home chains \nthat declared bankruptcy, before they declared bankruptcy, had already \ncut 10,000 jobs. An increasing number of home health agencies are \nshutting their doors. All in all, health care business failures were up \n15.5 percent between 1996 and 1997.\n  Thousands of patients tie their fate to health care providers. They \nhave no alternative. Yet Federal law shows absolutely no consideration \nfor patients' well-being during the process of bankruptcy. While the \nState of California has tried to prevent any more surprise nursing home \nevictions, each Federal bankruptcy judge decides whether any State law \napplies in an individual case. No Federal law protects patients in \nbankruptcy cases. With simple changes to the bankruptcy code, our \namendment will fill this very dangerous gap in patient protection.\n\n  Specifically, one section covers the disposal of patient records. It \nprovides clear and specific guidance to trustees who may not be aware \nof State or Federal requirements for maintaining these records, or \nconfidentiality issues associated with patient records. Another section \nof our amendment makes the cost of closing a health care business, such \nas transferring patients to another health care facility, a top \npriority debt. This ensures these expenses will actually be paid.\n  In the ideal situation, though, we want to even keep these patients \nfrom being moved if that is possible, and I think it is possible. In \nfact, we have had the assurances of some of these chains that have gone \ninto bankruptcy already that they are providing for the continuing care \nof their patients.\n  But perhaps the heart of this amendment, as I point to the third and \nmain part of it, is the requirement that the bankruptcy judge appoint \nan ombudsman to act as an advocate for patients of health care \nbusinesses in bankruptcy. This ensures judges are fully aware of all \nthe facts when they guide health care providers through bankruptcy. \nPrior to a chapter 11 filing, or immediately thereafter, the debtor may \nemploy a consultant to help in its reorganization effort. The first \nstep is usually cutting costs. Sometimes this step may result in a \nlower quality of patient care. An ombudsman, under our amendment, would \nprovide an institutional voice for the patients to help ensure an \nacceptable level of patient care.\n  Our amendment also requires a trustee to make the best effort to \ntransfer patients to another facility in the face of a health care \nbusiness closing. This is designed to prevent a trustee from putting \npatients out on the street.\n  Our amendment provides a tremendous benefit for patients with a \nminimal impact on creditors and debtors. As policymakers, we must \neliminate the possibility of midnight evictions at bankrupt nursing \nhomes and hospitals. We must ease the fear of abandonment in \nindividuals who are at a very vulnerable stage in their lives.\n  This is the amendment. We have had about 6 months pass since the \nfirst talk of bankruptcies by some major chains in the United States \ntook place. I happen to also be chairman of the Senate Aging Committee. \nIn that capacity, I consulted with HCFA when these first threats of \nbankruptcy came forth and we did not have the bankruptcy protection for \nthe patients that our amendment proposes. I asked HCFA about plans for \nthis, or what plans each of the States had for States that would have \nnursing homes in bankruptcy. We found a total vacuum of either Federal \nconcern or Federal policy and, also in most States, that to be the \nsituation.\n  Last spring, I asked the Health Care Financing Administration to \nstart instituting a process that the States will go through as they \nlicense nursing homes. They should be concerned with the quality of \ncare in nursing homes and have an interim plan for those nursing homes \nthat go into bankruptcy, pending adoption of our legislation.\n  HCFA has carried out that responsibility very well. We now have word \nthat each of the States have such a plan in place. We want to make sure \nthis is a permanent part of the consideration of bankruptcy courts and, \nhence, the necessity of our legislation which goes beyond what the \nFederal Government, through HCFA, and the States through their \nlicensing and quality control departments, has a responsibility to do. \nThey now have in place a plan to deal with nursing home bankruptcies.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Grassley on \noffering the amendment. I am proud to offer it with him.\n  We could not do comprehensive bankruptcy reform without dealing with \nthe crisis in the health care industry. Last year, bankruptcies by \nhealth care providers were up 15 percent. One nursing home company \nalone, which has 300 nursing homes, left an estimated 37,000 people \nwithout beds when it filed for bankruptcy. One, the Doctors Network in \nCalifornia, when it went into bankruptcy, left 1.3 million people \nwithout health care.\n  As the Senator pointed out in his remarks, the bankruptcy laws are \ndesigned for creditors and they are designed for people who are \ndebtors, but the customers, in this case the patients, are not provided \nfor.\n  One of the worst cases in the country was when the HIP health care \nplan in New Jersey went bankrupt leaving 194,000 subscribers without \nclear health care provisions. Indeed, it has left New Jersey hospitals, \nalmost all of them, in the red this year because their bills were not \nbeing paid.\n  I am very grateful we have been able to join together in offering \nthis amendment to ensure there is an ombudsman; that there is help in \ngetting people into new plans; that their records are protected in \nprivacy. I believe we made a real contribution to helping in these \ndifficult moments in the health care industry, and we will have a \nbetter bankruptcy reform bill because of it. I am very happy to work \nwith Senator Grassley and grateful for his leadership.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is one more example of the \nbipartisan cooperation we have had on this bill. I hope my colleagues \nwill look at this amendment and that it will not become controversial \nand we can adopt it. When the overall bankruptcy legislation becomes \nlaw, we will have appropriate protection, beyond the protection we give \nto creditors and debtors in this legislation, for the needs of patients \nas well.\n  We should not have these traumatic experiences that happened in \nReseda\n\n[[Page S14059]]\n\nNursing Home in San Fernando Valley and the over 100,000 patients who \nwere in jeopardy in the example of the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley and \nSenator Torricelli in offering the ``Nursing Home Patients Protection \nAct'' to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. Our amendment \nprotects nursing home patients in a business liquidation in three \nfundamental areas: patient privacy, patient rights and prompt transfers \nto new facilities.\n\n\n                            Patient privacy\n\n  First of all, our amendment ensures patient privacy when a hospital, \nnursing home, HMO or other institution holding medical records is \ninvolved in a bankruptcy proceeding that leads to liquidation. Medical \nprivacy is an issue very important to me, and ensuring that the \nconfidentiality of patients records is maintained should be of \nparamount importance.\n\n\n                       Defending Patients Rights\n\n  We have ensured that patients rights are defended as well. Cost \ncutting is always an issue in the health care system and that can \ntranslate into lower patient care quality--a fear to all health care \npatients. Our amendment establishes an ombudsman to provide a voice for \nall health care patients, making sure that judges are aware of all the \nfacts in balancing the interests between the creditor and the patients.\n\n\n                       New Nursing Home Transfer\n\n  Finally, our amendment requires that the bankruptcy trustee make all \nreasonable efforts to transfer all of the bankrupt nursing home's \npatients to a nearby health care business. The prompt transferring of \npatients to a new health care facility must be addressed properly \nduring a business liquidation under our legislation.\n  Mr. President, in my home State of Vermont, two nursing homes in \nBurlington recently made news due to a bankruptcy proceeding. Birchwood \nTerrace Healthcare and the Staff Farm Nursing Center are two very \nexcellent nursing home facilities. Each has a corporate connection to \nthe Vencor Corporation, a nationwide healthcare and nursing home \nprovider that recently filed for protection under Federal bankruptcy \nprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. While Vencor has \npledged these Vermont nursing homes will not be affected by its plans \nto reorganize while in bankruptcy, I am sure that many Vermonters are \nalarmed at the prospect of a nursing home with their loved ones filing \nfor bankruptcy. Our amendment should reassure Vermonters that even if a \nnursing home files for business liquidation under our bankruptcy laws, \ntheir loved ones will be protected.\n  I have been working on the overall issue of medical privacy for many \nyears and I am particularly pleased that our amendment adds new \nprotections for patient medical records for nursing homes in bankruptcy \nliquidation.\n  Of course, in the best case scenario any institution holding patient \nhealth care records would continue to follow applicable state or \nfederal law requiring proper storage and safeguards. The fact is, \nhowever, under current law during a business liquidation an individual \nwould have to wait until there has been a serious breach of their \nprivacy rights before anyone stepped in to ensure that patient privacy \nis protected. Under current law it is questionable what protection \nthese most sensitive personal records would have during a liquidation.\n  The reality of this situation and the practical questions of what \nrecourse an individual would have if their personal medical records \nwere not properly safeguarded against a business that is going out of \nbusiness makes this provision essential. Our legislation would set in \nlaw the procedure that an institution holding medical records would \nhave to follow during a liquidation proceeding.\n  The bottom line is that we do not want to have to wait until there \nhas been a breach of privacy before steps are taken to protect patient \nprivacy. Once privacy is breached--there is nothing one can really do \nto give that back to an individual.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to make sure that \nnursing home patients privacy and rights are protected during a \nbankruptcy proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am fortunate the remarks I am about to \nmake follow the remarks of my colleagues from Iowa and New Jersey in \ntalking about nursing homes because I want to take a few minutes to \ntalk about another aspect of how the elderly are getting ripped off in \nthis country and what has happened with HCFA, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, and what they have been trying to do to stop this. What \nthe Senate is doing and what the House has done recently is going to \nturn the clock back on our attempts to cut out waste, fraud, and abuse \nin Medicare.\n  I have been working for over a decade to identify and eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicare system. It is a big problem. \nThe Office of Inspector General estimates that last year, Medicare lost \nnearly $13 billion--that is with a B, billion dollars--to waste, fraud, \nand abuse in Medicare.\n  A few years ago, it was over $23 billion a year. So we have made some \nprogress. It is still a huge annual waste of our tax dollars. I call it \nthe Medicare waste tax, and we need to cut the Medicare waste tax.\n  Since 1989, I have held hearing after hearing, released report after \nreport documenting unnecessary losses to the Medicare program. I \ncommissioned the Office of Inspector General and the General Accounting \nOffice to research and review these unnecessary payments and to make \nrecommendations. On July 28 of this year, I introduced S. 1451, the \nMedicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1999 which incorporates many of \nthese GAO and IG recommendations. If enacted, it would save Medicare \nand our taxpayers billions of dollars every year.\n  Medicare fraud is what we hear the most about, some egregious cases \nwhere a scam artist has found yet another way to skim millions from the \nMedicare trust fund. Those are the cases that make the headlines. But \nmy years of investigation and review of this problem indicate that by \nfar the greatest losses to Medicare are not in fraud, but they are due \nsimply to waste and abusive practices. These losses are often directly \ndue to or are encouraged by wasteful Medicare payment policies and \npractices and a laxity in oversight, as well as weaknesses in the \nMedicare law that restrict the program's ability to get the best deal \npossible when purchasing goods and services.\n  To examine this further, in 1996, my staff and I undertook a study of \nMedicare payments for medical supplies. This followed a study by the \nGAO that I had requested earlier on the same topic. We compared \nMedicare's payment rates for 18 commonly used medical supply and \nequipment items with what the Veterans' Administration paid. Then we \ncompared it to the wholesale rate and the retail rate.\n  What we found was startling. This is a chart that depicts what we \nfound. For example, an irrigation syringe--a small syringe like this \nlittle one right here, these little plastic syringes--we found that \nMedicare is paying $2.93 for each one. The Veterans' Administration is \npaying $1.89. The wholesale price was $1.10. The retail price was \n$1.95. One can walk into a drugstore and buy one for $1.95. Medicare \nwas paying $2.93 for each one. The potential savings from that alone, \nif we base it on the wholesale price, is $4.4 million every year just \non little plastic syringes.\n  We had a walker. The Medicare purchase price was 75 bucks. The VA \nprice was $25 for the walker. The wholesale price was $39, and the \npotential savings was about $17 million a year.\n  Again, this is not an elaborate device. This is just a simple \naluminum holding walker. Medicare was paying $75 each. The wholesale \nprice was $39.\n  This is a commode chair. This is even more egregious. The commode \nchair was being paid for by Medicare at the rate of $99.35 each. The VA \nwas paying $24.12 each. The potential savings was $30.6 million a year. \nThis is a commode chair; we have all seen them. A lot of people use \nthem in hospitals and nursing homes.\n  Potential savings: If Medicare just paid the VA price, not the \nwholesale price, just what the Veterans' Administration is buying them \nfor, there would be a savings of $30 million a year just for the \ncommode chair.\n\n[[Page S14060]]\n\n  Those are some of the items we found were being grossly overpaid for \nby the Medicare system.\n  So, armed with this information, we began to work to cut this waste. \nFirst, I pushed an idea I have advocated for over a decade: Competitive \nbidding. Competitive bidding, that is how the Veterans' Administration \ngets the rates it does--good old-fashioned American free enterprise; \nput them out there for competitive bids.\n  While Medicare pays bloated prices based on historical charges, the \nVA, which has much less purchasing power than Medicare, puts out bids \nthat provide for both quality and cost control.\n  So I wanted to get through competitive bidding. But all we could get \nthrough the Congress was a demonstration on competitive bidding.\n  I do want to point out one of the items on which we were successful \nin reducing the price on this idea of competitive bidding. One of the \ndemonstration programs we did was oxygen. We found that for oxygen, \nMedicare was paying more than 50 percent more than the Veterans' \nAdministration. So we had a debate here about reducing the Medicare \nrate for oxygen. We had a compromise. We cut the rate by 30 percent. \nThat was in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. We said we were going to \nreduce the oxygen payments by 30 percent and put it out for competitive \nbids.\n  We just got the first bids in on the competitive bidding \ndemonstration for oxygen. Guess what. The suppliers bid to provide home \noxygen for about 25 percent less than the 30-percent cut we put in. On \ntop of the 30-percent cut, the bids came in at 25 percent less than \nthat. They are still making money. And they will still be providing \nregular servicing of equipment, doing it for that much less.\n  Let me get this straight. A lot of the oxygen suppliers said they \ncould not do this because they would lose money. We did not listen. We \nwent ahead and put through the 30-percent cut. Then we put it out for \ncompetitive bids. They then cut it 25 percent more than that.\n  So look at it this way. If the home oxygen people were making 50 \npercent more off Medicare than they were making off the Veterans' \nAdministration, and we cut it by 30 percent, put it out for competitive \nbids, and they came in 25 percent even lower than that, that means they \nare now 5 percent under the Veterans' Administration. They were making \nmoney off VA before, and now they are even less than what VA is on \ncompetitive bids. And you know darn well they are not going to bid that \nunless they are making money on it. They are not going to put a bid out \nthere to lose money.\n  That is just an indication of how much waste and abuse there is in \nthe Medicare system and why competitive bidding ought not to be a \ndemonstration project but it ought to be the norm, the standard for all \nof our purchases for Medicare.\n  We got the demonstration program. However, as a part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, we did succeed in giving Medicare a modest version \nof another waste-fighting weapon I have been pushing for a long time. \nWe provided HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administration, with \nenhanced ``inherent reasonableness'' authority to reduce Medicare \npayments when it is clear that current Medicare payment levels are \n``grossly excessive.'' In other words, Medicare, HCFA, has an \n``inherent reasonableness'' clause. We enhanced that to say they could \nreduce Medicare payments when they were clearly grossly excessive. I \nwould have liked to have done much more--obviously, put it out for \ncompetitive bids--but it is a step in the right direction.\n\n  Specifically, what this does is provide Medicare with the authority \nto reduce payments by up to 15 percent a year for items where Medicare \nbelieves there are gross overpayments. That was 2 years ago. After 2 \nyears of prodding, HCFA has finally begun the process of using its new \nauthority to make Medicare a more prudent purchaser. They published a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking on August 13 of this year. This followed \nan extensive investigation reviewing retail prices, wholesale prices \npaid by payers other than Medicare, and, of course, the payment amounts \nmade by the Veterans' Administration.\n  HCFA and their intermediaries then came up with an initial list of 12 \nitems of durable medical equipment and 1 prosthetic device for which \nMedicare currently pays a grossly excessive amount. HCFA recommended \nreducing these exorbitant rates, and they projected over a 5-year \nperiod, just making these modest adjustments, it would save Medicare \nand the taxpayers over $487 million--just in the next 5 years.\n  This chart will begin to show some of these items.\n  For example, the items here: Lancers, enteral nutrients, eyeglass \nframes, catheters, test strips, albuterol sulfate; the overpayments \nare: 36 percent, 16 percent, 21 percent, 24 percent, et cetera. This \nchart shows the 5-year savings we would get off them. Then this chart \nshows the overpayment for the folding walkers I just talked about, the \ncommode chairs, and others, for another $120 million. It is a total 5-\nyear savings of almost half a billion dollars just from these items \nalone.\n  Let me make it clear, we are only talking about the right of HCFA to \nreduce grossly excessive payments. Excessive pricing is not determined \nby comparing prices paid by Medicare to wholesale prices. That is not \nhow we determine excessive pricing. HCFA, in its proposed rule, takes \nthe Veterans' Administration price--what the VA is paying for these \nsame items--and then it adds 67 percent.\n  Keep this in mind. I will get my commode chair back out here again. \nFor an item such as this commode chair, what the HCFA has said is: We \nwill see what VA is paying for it, not what the wholesale price is. \nWhat is the Veterans' Administration paying for it? Then we will add 67 \npercent over that. That is what we will now pay for that commode chair.\n  Keep in mind, the companies making these commode chairs are not \nlosing money in the VA system. They would not be selling them to the VA \nif they were losing money. So you know they are making money off the \nVA.\n  Now HCFA says: OK, they were so grossly overpriced before, we are now \ngoing to cut it; we are only going to allow a 67-percent markup. \nWouldn't you like to have that guarantee in everything you sell the \nGovernment?\n  I see no reason we should pay more than the VA. Medicare is the \nlargest purchaser of medical supplies and equipment in the Nation. \nBecause of this purchasing power, it ought to be able to demand better \nprices than anyone else. Medicare should not pay any more than any \nother Federal program does, whether it is VA, CHAMPUS, the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, or others.\n  Now, guess what. Even with the 67-percent markup over the VA rate, \nMedicare is currently paying even more. It is hard to believe.\n\n  Now, here are the folding walkers. The VA payment on those is $30.24. \nThe proposed Medicare payment is $50.50. That is with a 67-percent \nmarkup. So if they are making money on VA, they are making a killing \noff of Medicare. Here is the commode chair. VA is paying $37.64; the \nMedicare payment is $62.85. What a deal. And this is a result of us \nsaying they shouldn't pay grossly exaggerated prices. Evidently paying \n$62.85 for a commode chair for which the VA is paying $37 is not \ngrossly exaggerated. I think it is. There are a lot of other things, \nfolding walkers and everything else. Here is a folding walker that has \na wheel on it. The VA is paying $45.94; the proposed Medicare payment, \n$75.88.\n  Even with that, HCFA is moving ahead, barely, to save Medicare and \ntaxpayers a lot of money. We need to do more, and we need to do more \nrapidly.\n  If my colleagues think that is bad news, get ready for the really bad \nnews. With almost no discussion, last week the House Ways and Means \nCommittee added a little special interest provision to the Medicare \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This provision would \nindefinitely delay cutting this wasteful spending. It would deny \nMedicare and the taxpayers $\\1/2\\ billion of savings. It does this \nsimply by stopping HCFA from moving ahead. It stops Medicare, its \nintermediaries and carriers from using this inherent reasonableness \nauthority until the Secretary has published a new rule and those rules \nare finalized.\n  Medicare says this would mean a delay of maybe 18, 22, 24 months, \nanother a couple years. If their track record is any indicator, the \ndelay would be a lot longer than that.\n\n[[Page S14061]]\n\n  I suppose a lot of people on that House Ways and Means Committee got \na lot of phone calls from the people who make walkers and commodes and \nthese syringes who said do something about this. It is in the House \nWays and Means Committee bill. It would block just these modest \nattempts to safeguard Medicare. We would still allow them to make 67 \npercent more than what they are making from VA. That is not enough for \nthem. So they got a little provision slipped in that House bill. Talk \nabout special interest legislation and a rip-off of our elderly and a \nrip-off of our taxpayers.\n  What did the Senate do? Well, they tried to do the same thing. The \nSenate counterpart to that bill, called the Medicare, Medicaid and \nSCHIP Adjustment Act of 1999, would prohibit use of this inherent \nreasonableness authority until 90 days after the Comptroller General of \nthe United States releases a report of its proposed impact. That would \ndelay this implementation probably for another year. So the House, if \nwe took the best case scenario, probably would delay it for 2 to 3 \nyears. The Senate bill would delay it for at least a year. I am sure a \ncompromise will be made leaning towards the House side, when this bill \ngoes to conference, by members of the Finance Committee. I want members \nof the Finance Committee to know we are watching. We want to know what \nthey are going to do to start reducing these exorbitant prices people \npay for medical equipment. It is not right to stop or further delay \nHCFA from implementing at least these modest savings.\n  We gave HCFA the authority in 1997; 2 years later, they just started \nto act on this. You can see how long it takes them to do something. \nJust when they are getting ready to make these cuts, to put more \nreasonableness in the amounts of money we pay, the Congress says, no, \nstop; put on the brakes. We can't do this. The Congress is standing \nby--let me rephrase that. The Congress is not standing by. The \nCongress, under the bills in the Senate Finance Committee and the House \nWays and Means Committee, is actively stopping the progress and the \nprocess by which we will save taxpayers billions of dollars, an added \ntax not only on our taxpayers but on our elderly.\n\n  We can do something about it. We have shown we can do something about \nit. We have shown how much we can reduce costs in oxygen and these \nother items. But now there are elements in this Congress who say, no, \nwe can't do that.\n  Well, we are going to watch. We will see what the Ways and Means \nCommittee and the Finance Committee do to stop this rip-off of our \ntaxpayers. We have grappled with ways to reduce Medicare expenditures. \nWe passed this limited provision 2 years ago, giving them the authority \njust so they wouldn't pay grossly exaggerated prices. HCFA said: OK, we \nare not going to pay grossly exaggerated prices; we will just pay 67 \npercent more than VA. That is grossly exaggerated. But even to that \nmodest amount of reduction, the House Ways and Means Committee says no.\n  We all remember the Pentagon and the $500 toilet seats the Pentagon \nwas buying some years ago. It is great news for all of us that the \nPentagon isn't buying them anymore. Unfortunately, Medicare is. \nTaxpayers don't deserve to be ripped off and to have all of their money \ngo for this gross waste and abuse in the Medicare system. Again, I know \nit is the waning hours of the Congress. We are all going to be getting \nout of here, I guess next week, they tell us. There is going to be a \nbalanced budget amendment fix. We are going to look to see whether or \nnot the special interests have gotten their way once again to rip off \nthe taxpayers of this country and the Medicare system.\n  I may not have the opportunity to take the floor after that is done. \nWe may be recessed or adjourned until next year. But we will be back, \nas will the taxpayers of this country and the elderly people and their \nfamilies who have been getting ripped off for far too long. We will be \nback to make sure we get competitive bidding once and for all to save \nour taxpayers a lot of money.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before us is S. 625, a bill relating to \nbankruptcy. It is a bill with which I have some knowledge and \nexperience because last year I was a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and a member of Senator Grassley's subcommittee. We spent a \ngreat deal of time preparing this bill for consideration on the floor \nof the Senate. I enjoyed very much working with Senator Grassley on the \nbill. He has become not only a trusted colleague but a good friend in \nthe process. We have had our disagreements, but we have tried to \nresolve them amicably and in the best interest of the legislation.\n  I also salute a number of staff people who have been at this task for \na long time: John McMickle, a member of Senator Grassley's staff; Kolan \nDavis; Jennifer Leach, who now works for Senator Torricelli on the \nDemocratic side; Darla Silva, a member of my staff who is with me today \non the floor; her predecessor, Victoria Bassetti, now legislative \ndirector for Senator John Edwards. All of these staff people have put \nin so many hours that we could not calculate it to consider this \nsignificant revision of the bankruptcy law in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  As this bill comes to the floor, I still have many concerns about it. \nI think most honest critics would suggest this was not a bill that came \nfrom the demands of our mailbag or the American people. I scarcely find \nany members of the bar living in the State of Illinois who are begging \nme for a big change in the bankruptcy law. No, this law was inspired \nand has been pushed for several years by the credit industry. The \ncredit industry was becoming increasingly concerned that more and more \npeople were filing for bankruptcy. As these people filed for bankruptcy \nand are discharged from their debts, their creditors and credit card \ncompanies receive less money. So they came to Congress and said: We \nwant to change the law and make it more difficult for people to file \nfor bankruptcy.\n  In other words, when you are down and out and cannot pay your bills, \nwhen your income is such that you cannot meet your obligations, when \nyou have tried everything and you have given up hope and you finally \nhave said, ``We have no choice but to declare bankruptcy and to try to \nstart over,'' this law is going to say, stop, we may not let you do it \nbecause there are two different kinds of bankruptcy at issue. One is \nthe so-called chapter 7 bankruptcy, where you walk in and, after a \ncourt proceeding and all the evidence is presented, the final act of \nthe court is to clear your debt and to say now you can start over. Of \ncourse, you start over with very few assets and with that specter of \nhaving filed for bankruptcy over your head.\n  The alternative is something called chapter 13. Chapter 13 says, \nstop, we won't let you declare bankruptcy, we won't clear off all of \nyour debts, and we are going to make you pay all or part of those debts \nover a lengthy period of time.\n  Those are two different outcomes. With one, the slate is wiped clean \nand the other the slate is still filled with many debts that have to be \npaid off. This bill attempts to define which people belong in which \ncategory, which Americans should be so down and out and up against it \nthat they are allowed to have their debts wiped out completely and \nthose who will continue to pay. It is no surprise that the credit \nindustry is determined to keep as many people as possible on the hook \nand paying off these debts for a lengthy period of time.\n\n  Now, in some cases this is warranted. In some cases, people file for \nbankruptcy when they have assets and they have the means by which they \ncan pay off at least a substantial portion of their debt. As this bill \naddresses that problem, I applaud it. I think they are right. People \nwho are gaming the bankruptcy system to avoid paying their honest debts \nare, frankly, a burden on all of us as consumers, as those who are \ndebtors as well. Those people should be excluded from the process. Life \nshould be difficult for them, no matter how good their attorney, if\n\n[[Page S14062]]\n\nthey try to walk away from a debt they can pay. But that represents an \nextraordinarily small minority of those in bankruptcy court. The vast \nmajority of those who walk through the doors of bankruptcy courts in \nAmerica are in big trouble; they need help and need it quickly.\n  Unfortunately, this lengthy bill will create a process where some \nfamilies who are absolutely out of options and have nowhere to turn \nhave to walk through a new process of proof before they will even be \nconsidered to be discharged in bankruptcy.\n  Bankruptcy is an interesting concept, not new to the United States. \nIt has been discussed at length throughout history. The history of the \nrelationship between those who borrow and those who loan goes back to \nancient times. Throughout history, those who borrow have not always \nbeen treated fairly. Under early Roman law, creditors who were unable \nto collect the debts owed to them were permitted to cut up the debtor's \nbody and divide the pieces, or leave the debtor alive and sell him into \nslavery.\n  Thank goodness things have improved. In America, the delegates of the \nConstitutional Convention gave Congress the power to establish uniform \nlaws on the subject of bankruptcy. Only one delegate to America's \nConstitutional Convention objected--Roger Sherman of Connecticut. It is \nsaid he was concerned that they didn't make it clear that if you file \nfor bankruptcy, you would not be subjected to the death penalty. That \nis how onerous debt and collection was in those days. Mr. Sherman \nobserved that bankruptcy was in some cases punishable by death under \nthe laws of England, and he did not choose to grant a power by which \nthat might be done in the United States. In response, Gouverneur Morris \nsaid he would agree to a bankruptcy clause because he saw no danger of \nabuse of power by the legislature of the Government of the U.S. I hope \nGouverneur Morris' trust was not misplaced.\n  I have a statement from a bankruptcy judge in Chicago by the name of \nJoan Lefkow. Judge Lefkow, when she was inducted to be a part of the \nbankruptcy judiciary, gave an extraordinary statement about the history \nof this subject. She talked about Charles Dickens and his Pickwick \nPapers, of the ``Old Man's Tale About the Queer Client.'' It is a story \nof a man who is cast into debtors prison by his father-in-law and left \nby his own father to languish in desperation, while his wife and child \nstarved. Dickens wrote: ``It was no figure of speech to say that \ndebtors rotted in prison.''\n  In a twist of fate, in this story, the debtor's father, although he \nhad ``the heart to leave his son a beggar,'' put off arranging it until \nit was too late. Thus, the man was freed from prison and provided a \nmeans by which he could exact revenge on the father-in-law who cast him \ninto prison. He hired a lawyer to drive his father-in-law into \nbankruptcy so he could suffer the same fate as the son-in-law. He \ndirected the lawyer, ``Put every engine of the law in force, every \ntrick that ingenuity can devise and rascality execute; aided by all the \ncraft of its most ingenious practitioners, ruin him! Seize and sell his \nlands and goods, drive him from house and home, and drag him forth a \nbeggar in his old age to die in a common jail!''\n\n  Those were the good old days when a debt led to a big problem when \npeople could end up literally rotting in prison.\n  We decided in the United States to take a different course of action \nand to establish a bankruptcy procedure so that American families and \nbusinesses faced with that awkward and painful and embarrassing moment \nmight have recourse. Our bankruptcy system is part of it.\n  But bankruptcy has become extremely technical and convoluted. During \nthe course of this debate, we talk about cram-downs and reaffirmations \nand panel trustees and automatic stays, nonchargeable debt, prior debt, \nsecured debt, and even something known as ``supper discharge.''\n  The bankruptcy code is a delicate balance. When you push in one area \nto create greater rights, or take rights away, it has an impact on \nanother area. That is because no matter how hard you try at bankruptcy \ncourt, there is a very limited pie. All we can do is increase the \nfighting over that small pie, and usually no one wins that fight.\n  Mr. President, I note that my colleague from Wisconsin is on the \nfloor. I believe he is prepared to offer an amendment. I ask permission \nof the Chair to yield the floor to my colleague from Wisconsin, and I \nask consent that after he has completed his statement, I reclaim my \ntime and continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank Senator Durbin very much.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with Senator Sessions to \neliminate one of the most flagrant abuses of the bankruptcy system--\nwhich is the unlimited homestead exemption. This bipartisan measure \nwill cap the homestead exemption at $100,000, which is more than \ngenerous. Last year, the full Senate unanimously went on record in \nfavor of the $100,000 cap and emphasized that ``meaningful bankruptcy \nreform cannot be achieved without capping the homestead exemption.'' I \nam proud that Senator Grassley--the underlying bill's lead sponsor--is \na cosponsor of this measure. Our proposal closes an inexcusable \nloophole that allows too many debtors to keep their luxury homes, while \ntheir legitimate creditors--like children owed child support, ex-\nspouses owed alimony, State governments, small businesses, and banks--\nget left out in the cold. Currently, a handful of States allow debtors \nto protect their homes no matter how high their value. And all too \noften, millionaire debtors take advantage of this loophole by moving to \nexpensive homes in states with unlimited exemptions like Florida and \nTexas, and declaring bankruptcy--and then continue to live in a style \nthat is no longer appropriate. Let me give you a few of the literally \ncountless examples:\n  The owner of a failed Ohio S, who was convicted of securities \nfraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still \nheld on the multimillion dollar ranch he bought in Florida. A convicted \nWall Street Financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least $50 million \nin debts and fines, but still he kept his $5 million Florida home--with \n11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. And just last year, movie star Burt \nReynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt through bankruptcy, but he \nstill held onto his $2.5 million Florida estate.\n  Sadly, those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. We asked the \nGAO to study this problem and, based on their estimates, 4 homeowners \nin Florida and Texas--all with over $100,000 in home equity--profit \nfrom this unlimited exemption and each every year. And while they \ncontinue to live in luxury, they write off annually an estimated $120 \nmillion in debt that is owned to honest creditors.\n  My favorite GAO example is a Texas bankruptcy attorney who boasts of \nrefusing representation to anyone who piles up credit card debt on the \neve of filing bankruptcy. For that stand against abuse, she deserves \ncredit. But when her own finances went sour, she took a dramatically \ndifferent view: she wrote off $1.2 million in debt, while holding onto \nher $400,000 home.\n  Mr. President, this is not only wrong, it is unacceptable. As you can \nsee, while the unlimited homestead exemption may not be the most common \nabuse of the bankruptcy system, it is clearly the most egregious. If we \nreally want to restore the stigma attached to bankruptcy--as this bill \npurports to do--then these high profile cases are the best place to \nstart. Mr. President, we need to stop this high living at the expense \nof legitimate creditors. But the pending bill falls short. Instead of a \ncap, it only imposes a 2 year residency requirement to qualify for a \nState exemption. And while that's a step, it will not deter a savvy \ndebtor who plans ahead for bankruptcy and it will not do anything about \nin-state abusers such as Burt Reynolds. This $100,000 cap will stop \nthese abuses, without affecting the great majority of States, two-\nthirds of which responsibly cap the exemption at $40,000 or less.\n  Let me make one additional point, and respond in advance to the most \nspurious--of the many spurious--arguments made by the other side: that \nthis issue is really about States rights. Mr. President, that is pure \nhokum. Anyone who files for bankruptcy is choosing to invoke Federal \nlaw in a Federal court to get a uniquely Federal benefit--a\n\n[[Page S14063]]\n\n``fresh start'' through a huge debt write-off. In these circumstances, \nit's only to impose Federal limits. And just because something is in a \nState ``constitution'' doesn't make it sacrosanct. A cap is not only \nthe best policy, it is sends the best message: That bankruptcy is a \ntool of last resort, not just a tool for financial planning. And it \ngives credibility to reform by going after the worst abusers, no matter \nhow wealthy they are. So honestly, this amendment should be a no-\nbrainer. Indeed, if we want to apply antiquated bankruptcy laws, maybe \nwe should resurrect ``the debtors' prison.'' At least then we would be \npunishing the worst offenders, rather than rewarding them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2516\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the value of certain real or personal property a \n          debtor may elect to exempt under State or local law)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl), for himself, Mr. \n     Sessions, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2516.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title III, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3  . LIMITATION.\n\n       Section 522 of title 11, United States Code, as amended by \n     sections 224 and 307 of this Act, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b)(3)(A), by inserting ``subject to \n     subsection (n),'' before ``any property''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(n)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), as a result \n     of electing under subsection (b)(3)(A) to exempt property \n     under State or local law, a debtor may not exempt any amount \n     of interest that exceeds in the aggregate $100,000 in value \n     in--\n       ``(A) real or personal property that the debtor or a \n     dependent of the debtor uses as a residence;\n       ``(B) a cooperative that owns property that the debtor or a \n     dependent of the debtor uses as a residence; or\n       ``(C) a burial plot for the debtor or a dependent of the \n     debtor.\n       ``(2) The limitation under paragraph (1) shall not apply to \n     an exemption claimed under subsection (b)(3)(A) by a family \n     farmer for the principal residence of that farmer.''.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois, under the previous \norder, is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I fully support the amendment offered by Senator Kohl and Senator \nSessions. This gets to the heart of it. This would be a real test as to \nwhether or not we are going to close one of the major loopholes in the \nbankruptcy law, a homestead exemption loophole where a person goes into \nthe bankruptcy court and says: I am broke. I can't pay my debts.\n  The court says: Well, I guess we will have to discharge these debts. \nYou can't pay them. But, of course, you keep your home.\n  Different States define how much value there could be in that home. \nWe have seen in case after case where some have received a lot of \npublicity and we have people who are holding back homes that are worth \nhundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars under this homestead \nexemption and keeping that out of court. This is a ruse. It is a fraud.\n  I thank Senator Kohl and Senator Sessions for their leadership in \nintroducing this amendment. I hope it passes.\n  Incidentally, this same amendment was defeated in the House of \nRepresentatives in the last session. I am not sure if they voted \ndirectly on it in this session. But it gives you an indication that \nsome in the House who pound the table for reform in bankruptcy are the \nlast in line when it is going to stop the fattest of cats from \nprotecting themselves from bankruptcy by buying these huge homes and \nranches.\n  I hope Senator Kohl is successful. I will be supporting him in every \nway I can.\n  Let me tell you one of the reasons I am here today to discuss this \nbankruptcy code. It is because of the increase in filings over the last \nseveral year. It is true that more people have gone into bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  It is an interesting thing that as our economy improves more people \nfile for bankruptcy. Logic would argue just the opposite. But \napparently people get into a frame of mind where they are so optimistic \nthat they get strung out with too much debt. They never think they are \ngoing to lose a job.\n  They never think they will face a divorce. They never anticipate the \npossibility of medical expenses for which they cannot pay.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask if I might offer briefly a second-degree \namendment to this and then return the floor to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator for that purpose, with \nconsent I reclaim the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2518 to Amendment No. 2516\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the value of certain real or personal property a \n          debtor may elect to exempt under State or local law)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \nKohl amendment to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 2518 \n     to amendment No. 2516.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n\n     3__.

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, there has been a \ndramatic increase in filings for bankruptcy over the last several \nyears--30 percent in some years.\n  People ask, How can this be? Of course, I think it is overoptimism. \nFolks in a good economy don't think anything will go bad; sometimes \nthey do, and people who thought they had the world by the tail end up \nin bankruptcy court.\n  There is another factor at work here, as well. As Senator Torricelli \nof New Jersey, the Democratic minority spokesman on this committee, \nnoted earlier, everyone who has a mailbox knows what is going on when \nit comes to credit cards. There is scarcely a day that goes by in my \nhome in Springfield, IL, that there is not another solicitation for \nanother credit card. In fact, some of the solicitations come in the \nname of my daughter who married years ago and hasn't been at that \naddress for a long time. Some group has captured her name and address \nand continues to offer her credit cards on a monthly basis.\n  I asked my staff how many of them had been solicited likewise. It \nturned out everybody has received these solicitations. In fact, one of \nmy staffers sent me a recent offer for a credit card that was sent to \nmy godson. He is about 6 years old. I don't think he is creditworthy \nyet, but obviously some\n\n[[Page S14064]]\n\ncompanies have taken a hard look at him and are considering whether or \nnot Neil Houlihan needs to have a MasterCard at the age of 6. I hope \nthat isn't an indication of what is happening across America.\n  I think we all know that part of the reason so many people end up in \nbankruptcy court is because we are flooded with easy credit. Easy \ncredit has a good side and a bad side. Easy credit says to a person who \ntraditionally could not qualify for credit that they now have a chance. \nI am told historically a waiter or waitress was unlikely to get a \ncredit card because they didn't have a steady and predictable income. \nThose days have changed, thank goodness. People in those professions \nand occupations are given that opportunity for credit.\n  The bad side is that it extends credit, easy credit, to people who \nare already in over their heads. It doesn't parse out those who deserve \ncredit and who can use it responsibly from those who are just going to \ndig a deeper hole and find themselves in short order facing a \nbankruptcy court judge. That, I think, is an indication of why so many \npeople are starting, or did start, to use the bankruptcy courts.\n  The latest statistics for filings in bankruptcy have started to trail \noff. What appeared to be a national growing trend has changed. This \nyear, second quarter filing reports show a drop in 42 States, including \ndouble-digit decreases in 14 States. We have to ferret out those people \nwho abuse the bankruptcy system, but not at the expense of those \nfamilies and businesses that need it.\n  The sad but obvious fact is that the people who declare bankruptcy \nare poor. The average income of a person who declares bankruptcy is \n$17,652. In 1981, the average income was $23,254. People in our \nbankruptcy system are just getting poorer. One would not believe that \nto be the case listening to the debate, the suggestion that so many \npeople are coming into the bankruptcy court who are loaded with money, \nwho, through crafty attorneys and their own ingenuity, are able to \navoid their responsibility.\n  However, statistics tell a different story. By and large, the people \nshowing up in bankruptcy court are poor people, with $17,652 as the \naverage income of a person filing bankruptcy. If memory serves me, \naverage indebtedness is roughly $25,000. These people have more than a \nyear's income in debt before they finally show up in bankruptcy court.\n\n  As distasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains: We need the \nsystem. We shouldn't change it radically. By and large, it works. Let \nme give a few examples of people who are filing.\n  The three major reasons for filing bankruptcy are employment, health \ncare costs, and divorce. Older Americans are less likely to end up in \nbankruptcy than their younger counterparts. But when they do file, a \nlarger fraction of senior citizens--nearly 40 percent--give medical \ndebt as the major reason for filing. Think about it: A catastrophic \nillness catching a family by surprise, particularly a senior with \nlimited income and fixed resources, ends up in bankruptcy court because \nthere is no place else to turn.\n  The second category is women raising families. Both men and women are \nlikely to declare bankruptcy following divorce. Collectively, the \nbankruptcy sample has 300 percent more divorced people than the \npopulation in general. Families already stuck with consumer debt cannot \ndivide their income to support two households and survive economically. \nDivorced women file bankruptcy in greater proportion than divorced men.\n  Before being elected to Congress, I was a practicing attorney in \nSpringfield, IL. I was an attorney in hundreds of divorce cases. Almost \nwithout fail, the woman at the end of the divorce case had less money \nto try to meet the needs of her children and herself. Sometimes they \nare pushed too far. Many times, they end up in bankruptcy court.\n  Keep in mind as we debate these bills and whether we are going to run \npeople through a means test with all sorts of questions to be answered \nand, if they miss an answer, thrown out of court, we are talking about \nolder Americans and divorced women who are struggling to keep their \nfamily together.\n  Unemployed workers: More than half the debtors who file for \nbankruptcy report a significant period of unemployment preceding their \nfilings. For single-parent households, a period of unemployment can be \ndevastating.\n  Let me comment on this current bill. I favor the bill we passed last \nyear. I think the Senate favored the bill we passed last year by a vote \nof 97-1. It is pretty odd in this Chamber to have 97 Senators agree on \na bankruptcy bill. I think it was a better bill, better than the bill \nnow before the Senate. I hope we make changes in this bill to bring it \ncloser to last year's bill.\n  The changes should center around three themes: First, ensure fairness \nto women and children while ensuring that wealthy debtors pay their \nfair share. This can be accomplished by Senator Kohl's amendment, which \nSenator Sessions has cosponsored, which establishes a cap on the \nhomestead exemption of $100,000 and ensures as well that women are not \ncompeting with credit card companies in collecting child support after \nthe bankruptcy is over. This is a critical point that has been raised \nby Elizabeth Warren of Harvard as well as some 82 different bankruptcy \nprofessors across the United States who have written to Members of the \nSenate and asked them to be very sensitive to the fact that what we do \nin this law could make life more difficult, if not impossible, for \nwomen trying to raise their children after a divorce.\n  Alimony and child support payments oftentimes are a major part of the \nincome on which they live. When we allow credit card companies and \nfinance companies to grab more in bankruptcy and hang on to more after \nbankruptcy, it lessens the likelihood that the divorced woman trying to \nraise a child is going to be able to have any pot of money to draw from \nfor help. It is just the bottom line. This is a pie of limited \nproportions after a bankruptcy. If the credit card companies can stay \nthere, taking the money away from that former husband who filed for \nbankruptcy, many times it will be at the expense of his children and \nhis former wife. That is a fact. It is a cruel fact. It is one that has \nnot been overcome to date by anything suggested in this bill or on the \nfloor.\n  Merely changing the priorities in the bankruptcy system, making the \nalimony and child support payments a higher priority, takes care of \nwhat happens in court, but after bankruptcy, then we have a problem. \nThe same mother of the children trying to draw money from what is left \nafter bankruptcy and income finds she is competing with credit card \ncompanies and others that have been given more rights under this bill \nto claim more money after the bankruptcy has been initiated.\n  Second, this bill needs to be more cost effective and less expensive \nfor taxpayers. This can be accomplished by providing a safe harbor for \nmeans testing for a below-median debtor and streamlining the tests for \ndebtors above the median income to eliminate needless paperwork.\n  A cliche I learned as a kid, as everybody learned, I am sure, over \nand over again: You can't draw blood from a turnip. In some cases, \npeople in bankruptcy court, no matter how hard we try or how hard we \nlook, are never going to have the money to pay off the debt. It is more \nsensible for us to step back and say, let's focus on those who are \nabusing the system rather than adding more paperwork requirements on \nthose who will never be able to pay off their debts.\n  Let me give an illustration from the same law school professors who \nwrote to every Member of Congress about a recently completed study. \nSince last year's debate on bankruptcy reform, a study was funded by \nthe independent, nonpartisan American Bankruptcy Institute. They found \nthat less than 4 percent of consumer debtors could repay even 25 \npercent of their unsecured nonpriority debts, even if they could \ndedicate every penny of income to a repayment plan for a full 5 years. \nIn short, for about 96 percent of consumer debtors, chapter 7 \nbankruptcy is an urgent necessity.\n  The fact that most debtors cannot pay more does not mean this means \ntest will not affect them, though. Mr. President, 96 percent of those \nwho file in bankruptcy court cannot pay more, according to the study. \nThey are really up against it. They need to file for bankruptcy. Yet we \nfind in this law the\n\n[[Page S14065]]\n\nrequirement that they still go through this rigorous standard of means \ntesting and examination to question whether or not they can file for \nbankruptcy. I hope we will adopt the House standard at least, which \nsays those at median income will be absolved from going through this \nlengthy test in bankruptcy court. People making median income in this \ncountry, filing for bankruptcy, are not likely to be able to pay off \nmany of their debts.\n  Further, we ought to require that those earning up to 150 percent of \nmedian income should be subject to a reasonable screening to determine \nif it is possible they could pay back some of these debts. But to make \nevery single person who walks into that court go through this process \nis unfair, it is burdensome, and it is not of any benefit to taxpayers \nor, ultimately, to creditors.\n  In addition, this bill needs to acknowledge the credit industry's \nrole in increasing the number of bankruptcy filings. In order for this \nbill to be balanced, we have to enact additional disclosures on credit \ncards to allow debtors to make an informed choice about their credit. I \nhad a lengthy list of disclosures included in last year's bill. Some \nhave survived; some have been changed; some will be offered again on \nthe floor. But is it unreasonable for us to say to these credit card \ncompanies that shove these credit cards at us faster than we can put \nthem in our wallets, that they at least have to give us an honest \nmonthly statement which tells us a few basic things? Isn't it \nreasonable to look at that statement, where it lists ``minimum monthly \npayment,'' and then say: If you make the minimum monthly payment, it \nwill take X months to pay off the balance, and when you pay off the \nbalance, you will have paid X dollars in interest and X dollars on \nprincipal?\n  That is not a tough calculation in the world of computers. The people \nwho send us the bills have all sorts of information they want us to \nread and absorb. Shouldn't we at least know the bottom line? We may be \ntoo deep in debt. Maybe another credit card is not a good idea. That is \nnot an outrageous suggestion where I live. But when we suggested that \nto the credit industry, they blanched and said: Oh, never can we do \nthat; we cannot make that kind of disclosure.\n\n  They certainly can. The question is whether they will. That question \nwill be answered by the Senate when it decides whether the consumers \ndeserve more information so they can make informed credit choices. This \nis not a question of rationing credit. It is a question of informing \ndebtors and informing those who are going to buy the credit cards as to \nwhat their obligations are going to be.\n  Let me give one example on a chart which is an illustration of the \ncredit card debt in America charted against bankruptcy cases. I think \nthis chart tells the story about why we have more bankruptcy cases in \nthe United States. If you will notice the blue line here, it represents \nbankruptcy cases from 1962 to 1995. The red line indicates debt-to-\nincome ratio.\n  Do you want to know why there are more cases being filed in \nbankruptcy court? People are getting deeper in debt; they have more \ncredit cards. That is what it is all about. When we had the first \nhearing on the subject, some of the people from the credit industry \ncame in and said:\n\n       American families just don't think there is a moral stigma \n     attached to bankruptcy any longer. They are filing for \n     bankruptcy without really feeling bad about it.\n\n  I take exception to that. I am sure there are some who are gaming the \nsystem and trying to figure out how to win, but the folks I have run \ninto, filing for bankruptcy was a sad day when they finally had to \nconcede they just hadn't handled things right, or faced a problem they \ncouldn't manage, and had to go to bankruptcy court. It wasn't a proud \nday for the family. You don't hold a party when you go into bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  When it comes to moral stigma, I said to the people in the credit \nindustry: You say folks are taking bankruptcy more lightly these days. \nLet me ask about the credit cards you are sending college kids and kids \nwho have virtually no income and no credit history, with no questions \nasked? And what about those ATM machines at the casinos. You are \ntalking about moral stigma. Is your industry sensitive to the mores of \nAmerica in the way you offer credit and money to people regardless of \nwhether it is a good idea or not?\n  I think there are two sides to the story. I think, unfortunately, \nthis bill only addresses one side of it. According to the Federal \nReserve Board, there are 429.2 million Visa and MasterCards in \ncirculation in the United States. The number of cards per cardholder \nincreased in 1998 to a total of 4.2 credit cards per person.\n  In addition to the solicitations we receive in the mail, telephone \ncalls are made. In fact, 1998 was a banner year for solicitations for \ncredit cards. The credit industry sent out 3.45 billion direct mail \nsolicitations during 1998, an increase of 15 percent from the 3 billion \nin the previous year, and 2.4 billion in 1996.\n  Interestingly enough, there are only 78 million creditworthy \nhouseholds in the United States. Yet, as you can see by the numbers, \nthere were 3.45 billion credit card solicitations. That is why your \nmailbox is full at home.\n  We even have proof the credit industry is targeting people in \nbankruptcy. Let me show you this. Talk about moral stigma. This is a \nsolicitation offered by FirstConsumers National Bank in Portland, OR, \nand Beaverton, OR. To whom do they send this solicitation? People who \nfile for bankruptcy. They want them back in debt. Let's get them back \ninto debt.\n\n  In case you think it is easy to file for bankruptcy and pick up a \ncredit card, they generously offer you an annual percentage of 20.5 \npercent, and if you stumble, it goes up to 25 percent interest. So the \ncredit card companies that talk about the morality of the situation are \nquick to jump on the folks coming out of bankruptcy court and give them \na very expensive credit card. That is not much of a fresh start as far \nas I am concerned.\n  Why is this occurring? We often debate these issues and don't get \ndown to the bottom line. Why is the credit card industry so intent on \nreducing the number of people in bankruptcy courts who can discharge \ntheir debts? Why do they want to keep people paying on the debts? There \nis money to be made.\n  Between 1980 and 1992, the rate at which banks borrowed money fell \nfrom 13.4 percent to 3.5 percent. During the same period, the average \ncredit card interest rate rose from 17.3 percent to 17.8 percent. \nNotice the spread. It used to be you had credit card interest rates of \n17.3 percent when the banks were borrowing money at 13.4 percent. Now \nthe credit card interest rate average goes up to 17.8 percent and the \nbanks are borrowing the money they give to you at 3.5 percent. This is \na big winner for these credit card companies. They want to keep people \ngetting credit cards as they walk out of the bankruptcy courts. There \nis money to be made. It is a profitable business. The aggressive \nmarketing campaign is going to continue as long as there is money to be \nmade.\n  Of course, it is going to mean people are going to get in over their \nheads. You basically cannot have it both ways. You cannot recklessly \noffer credit to financially vulnerable people without increasing the \nnumber of bankruptcies. The credit industry knows this and so do a lot \nof conservative magazines. The London-based Economist, in a recent \neditorial about the reckless marketing of credit cards, wrote:\n\n       Given its readiness to hand out money with almost no \n     questions asked, the credit card industry's demands that \n     Congress stop the rapid increases in filings for personal \n     bankruptcy ring hollow.\n       No doubt many people have benefited from the credit \n     revolution that gave them an ability to borrow they have been \n     denied in the past. And certainly, borrowers unable to meet \n     their obligations bear some responsibility for their woes.\n       Yet it is pure hypocrisy for credit card firms to complain \n     that personal bankruptcy has lost its traditional stigma. For \n     they have been deliberately directing their sales efforts at \n     people on the edge of financial distress.\n\n  The rise in bankruptcies tracks consumer debts, and that is a fact. \nSo in these times it is even more important for people to be fully \ninformed about and careful about the credit card debt they rack \nup. That is why this legislation, which gives the consumer as much \ninformation as possible, is more important than ever.\n\n  I am confident we can approve this bill on a bipartisan basis. I pray \nwe will\n\n[[Page S14066]]\n\nnot have the same experience as last year. We passed a bankruptcy bill \nin the Senate by a vote of 97-1. It went to the conference committee, \nand I was a part of and assigned to that conference committee. We had \nan introductory session where we smiled at one another, shook hands, \nand left the room. That was the only meeting of that conference \ncommittee.\n  Within a matter of hours, that same conference committee, with only \none political party represented--not my own--came back with a bill and \nsaid: Take it or leave it. Thank goodness the Senate said leave it. It \nwas a bad bill. If this bill is going to escape a similar fate, it \nneeds to be negotiated in good faith on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am offering an amendment designed to penalize a growing category of \nhigh-cost mortgage lenders who lead vulnerable borrowers down a rose \ngarden path to foreclosure and bankruptcy. These lenders prey with \nshame on low-income elderly and financially unsophisticated people, \njeopardizing their lifelong investments and hard work in home \nownership.\n  The number of older Americans who are so financially vulnerable that \nthey end up going to bankruptcy court to deal with overwhelming debt is \nconsiderable. In 1998, more than 280,000 Americans age 50 or older \nfiled for bankruptcy. The number of Americans age 55 and older filing \nhas grown by more than 120 percent since 1991. Those age 50 and 55 is \nthe fastest growing age group in bankruptcy.\n  Last year, during the Senate Judiciary's Committee debate on \nbankruptcy, I offered an amendment designed to curtail one terrible \npractice that plagues senior citizens: predatory high-cost mortgage \nloans targeted to the low-income elderly and financially \nunsophisticated. The amendment was part of the bill that passed 97-1. \nMy colleagues may already be aware of the problems that are cropping up \nin the home mortgage industry. Let me explain.\n  In recent years, there has been an explosion in subprime high-\ninterest loan markets. In the Chicago area, these lenders made 50,000 \nloans in 1997. This map shows foreclosures on subprime loans in Chicago \nin a 12-month period of time.\n  In the Chicago area, there were more than 50,000 loans in 1997, 15 \ntimes as many as in 1991, when they originated 3,137 loans. Even more \ndramatic than the increase in subprime loans has been the increase in \nforeclosures. Subprime lenders foreclosed on 30 loans in the Chicago \nregion in 1993, 2 percent of the foreclosures that year.\n  In June of 1998 to June 1999, the subprime lenders foreclosed on \n1,917 loans, 30 percent of the year's total foreclosures. Why is the \ngrowth of this industry of concern? Two reasons: First, these companies \nuse reprehensible tactics and predatory lending practices to conduct \ntheir business and, second, because of the vulnerable victims--senior \ncitizens and low-income people--whom they target.\n  I will tell a story that demonstrates the problem. In Decatur, GA, a \n70-year-old woman named Jeannie McNab, retired, living on Social \nSecurity benefits, in November 1996 with the help of a mortgage broker \nobtained a 15-year mortgage loan from a large national finance company \nin the amount of $54,300. Her annual percentage rate on this mortgage \nloan was 12.85 percent, and under the terms of the loan, she would pay \n$596.49 a month until the year 2011 when she then would be required to \nmake a total final payment of $47,599. Think about it: 15 years from \nnow, when this woman is 85 years old, she will be saddled with a \nballoon payment that she can never possibly make and face the loss of \nher home and her financial security, not to mention her dignity and her \nsense of well-being.\n\n  She paid a mortgage broker $700 to find and fund this unconscionable \nloan, a mortgage broker who, to add insult to injury, collected a \n$1,100 fee from the mortgage lender.\n  Unfortunately, Mrs. McNab is a typical target of high-cost mortgage \nlenders. She is an elderly person living alone on fixed income, just \nthe type of person who may suddenly encounter a financial obstacle and \nturn to this type of loan for assistance.\n  According to a former career employee of the subprime mortgage \nindustry who testified anonymously last year before Senator Grassley's \nSpecial Committee on Aging--this may sadden you:\n\n       My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is \n     living on a fixed income, hopefully from her deceased \n     husband's pension, and Social Security, who has her house \n     paid off, living off credit cards but having a difficult time \n     keeping up with credit card payments.\n\n  The perfect target, according to this anonymous witness before \nSenator Grassley's committee. This industry professional candidly \nacknowledged that unscrupulous lenders specifically market their loans \nto elderly widowed women, blue-collar workers, people with limited \neducation, people on fixed income, non-English speaking people, and \npeople who have significant equity in their homes. With lump sum \nballoon payments and terms that cannot be rationalized, they ensnare \nthese folks and take away the only asset they have left on Earth--their \nhome.\n  When that occurs, these people should not be able to go into court, \nonce that person has defaulted on this mortgage, and recover. They have \ndefrauded the individual who has borrowed the money. They are guilty of \npredatory loan practices and they should not receive the same treatment \nas an honest creditor who comes to court looking for compensation.\n  The amendment which I will offer will do several things. When a \nperson such as Jeannie McNab goes to bankruptcy court seeking help from \noverwhelming financial distress the lenders caused her, the claim of \nthe predatory home lender is not going to be allowed. If a lender has \nfailed to comply with the requirements of the Truth in Lending Act for \nhigh-cost second mortgages, the lender will have absolutely no claim \nagainst the bankruptcy estate. The unscrupulous high-cost mortgage \nlender will not recover the fruits of their ill-gotten gain.\n  This amendment has been opposed by a lot of mortgage companies and \nbanks that ought to know better. They are standing in defense of these \npredatory lenders who are taking advantage of vulnerable people and \nsaying: We cannot treat them any differently; we cannot treat them \nharshly even if they abuse the system.\n  That is a sad commentary on the credit industry and it is a sad \ncommentary on the mortgage industry that they will not join me and the \nMembers of the Senate in ferreting out those who are exploiting people \nacross America with these second mortgages and subprime mortgages which \nultimately are indefensible--absolutely indefensible--as we found time \nand again. If the credit industry wants to defend those loans, it casts \na real question and suspicion and doubt as to their sincerity in \ndealing with borrowers across America. I hope they will change their \npoint of view and support this amendment.\n\n  I made some changes in the amendment to accommodate the industry to \nmake it clear we are not going to deal with technical violations to \ndisqualify those who try to collect in bankruptcy court. We are going \nafter the bad guys.\n  I added a materiality requirement so the violations must be a \nmaterial violation in order for the claim to be invalid. The amendment \nwill apply to situations where a lender engages in the practice of \nlending based on home equity without regard to the borrower's ability \nto repay, or a lender makes direct payments to a home improvement \ncontractor instead of to the borrower, or when the lender imposes \nillegal fees, such as prepayment penalties or increased interest rates \nat default, or imposes a balloon payment due in less than 5 years.\n  These illegal practices are not technical violations. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort to protect the elderly by stopping \npredatory lending practices by adopting this amendment.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The amendment will be filed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nspeak generally on the bankruptcy legislation that is now before the \nSenate.\n  First, I praise my friend and colleague from Illinois who has, on all \nissues, been extremely dedicated, hard-working, and effective on this \nbankruptcy issue. This is an important\n\n[[Page S14067]]\n\nissue and a complex area of the law that has an impact on millions of \nAmericans and, of course, on businesses all across the country.\n  This is an important debate, and I expect we will be on the floor for \nsome time, because many of us have serious concerns about this bill and \nexpect to offer quite a number of amendments to try to improve it.\n  As I said, the issues raised by bankruptcy legislation are extremely \ncomplicated. The stakes are high. The different viewpoints are \npassionately expressed by all of the players involved, from the \ndifferent types of creditors to bankruptcy judges, trustees, and \npractitioners, to consumers and potential debtors.\n  We have a long legislative history to contend with here. We have been \nworking on bankruptcy reform legislation for some time now, beginning \nwith the appointment of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in \n1994, and the issuance of the commission's report in 1997. In the last \nCongress, the Senate passed reform legislation by an overwhelming \nmargin. That bill was itself a compromise among the various interests. \nBut a conference committee sent a much different, much more one-sided \nbill back to us, and I am happy to say, that bill died at the end of \nthe session.\n  My view is that the legislation before us is only slightly less \nobjectionable than the legislation that came out of conference last \nyear. S. 625 is not a balanced piece of legislation. It tilts the \nscales too far in favor of certain types of creditors, and denies \nreasonable protections of the law not just to those trying unfairly to \nevade financial obligations they really can afford to meet, but also to \nhonest hardworking families and single parents, who have come upon hard \ntimes and need the fresh start and breathing room that our bankruptcy \nsystem offers to give them a chance to survive. In too many cases, I am \nafraid, that will hinder families' ability to meet other obligations, \nparticularly their obligations to their own children and to local \ntaxing authorities.\n  In many ways, this is a bill at war with itself. Many of the \nprovisions are designed to shift more money into the hands of unsecured \ncreditors, while other provisions are designed to shift that same pot \nof money back to car lenders and different unsecured creditors. The \nbill is supposedly intended to move more debtors from the complete \ndischarge of debts available under chapter 7 of the code into chapter \n13 repayment plans. But chapter 13 trustees and others have testified \nthat many provisions in the bill will decrease the success of chapter \n13 repayment. The bill supposedly increases personal responsibility, \nand yet it would favor people who have two new cars over people who own \nolder cars or who take public transportation. And the bill is said to \nbe aimed at deadbeats and abusers of the system, not honest but \nfinancially troubled low-income people, and yet it penalizes renters, \nas opposed to homeowners. And whereas we often try to promote small \nbusiness entrepreneurship in legislation, in this bill we sometimes \nseem to impose stricter rules on small businesses than we do on large \nbusinesses.\n  So, does the Senate really want to endorse these policies? Is it \nreally our goal to send these mixed messages? I urge my colleagues to \npay close attention to this very important debate. We do a lot in this \nbody that in the end seems to just be symbolic. This bill is not \nsymbolism. We cannot simply pass this bill and say we have struck a \nblow for personal responsibility. Because this bill will have real \nconsequences in the real lives of real people. And I fear that in too \nmany cases those consequences will be very damaging.\n  I do want to comment for a moment on the process that has brought us \nhere. I mentioned before that the Senate considered bankruptcy \nlegislation in the last Congress. But in this Congress, we didn't have \na single hearing on this bill. Let me repeat that because it is so \ndisturbing for a bill of this magnitude and complexity. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee did not have a single hearing on bankruptcy reform \nor S. 625--not one.\n  Now, to be fair, there was one joint hearing that was held over at \nthe House with two subcommittees of jurisdiction--one hearing. And it \noccurred on a day that Senators happened to be involved in a very long \nseries of votes--I believe it was one of our so-called ``vote-arama'' \nsessions--which meant that none of the Senators on the subcommittee \ncould take advantage of the lone opportunity for public discussion of \nthis bill. Other than that one hearing, the Senate of the United States \nhad no hearings whatsoever on bankruptcy reform this year.\n  I did not understand the rush to report this bill from committee \nwithout hearings, and I still don't. Why didn't we hear from the \nbankruptcy judges, and the trustees, and the disinterested academics, \nand the practitioners about how and whether this bill will work? Why \ndidn't we get their views in a formal and considered way, and try to \naddress their concerns?\n  To say that this bill is just a repeat of last year's bankruptcy \ndebate is just not right. This legislation is far too complicated and \nfar too reaching to make that facile claim. This bill is actually \ndifferent from last year's Senate bill in more ways than it is similar. \nIn many ways, it is a brand new piece of legislation for this body. \nLast year's Senate bill was almost exclusively consumer bankruptcy \noriented. This bill not only takes a different approach to consumer \nbankruptcy, but it has dozens of provisions affecting a variety of tax \nissues, municipal bankruptcy cases, single asset real estate cases, \nsmall business cases, and health care cases, in addition to a host of \nchanges to general chapter 11 bankruptcy that may dramatically change \nthe rules governing the reorganization of our Nation's largest \nbusinesses. We never discussed most of these issues at the committee \nlevel. We have received many warning signs from those who understand \nthe bankruptcy system far better than any of us do. I am afraid to say, \nwhat is being done here is actually irresponsible.\n\n  Why has this happened? Well, the sad truth is that all of us know \nwhy. A very wealthy and powerful industry has pushed and pushed and \npushed for this bill, and so far the Congress has ignored the experts \nand done the industry's bidding. The credit card industry wants this \nreform because it wants protection from its own excesses. You see, the \nindustry has flooded the mailboxes, and the phones, and the e-mail in \nboxes of America with offers of easy credit. Americans received over \n3.45 billion credit card solicitations in 1998. Anyone can get a credit \ncared, even children, even people who have just filed for bankruptcy.\n  I favor empowering citizens and broadening their options using credit \nto bring more convenience to their lives as consumers. But the industry \nhas been irresponsible in extending credit to those who cannot handle \nit. And now the industry has come to Congress for help. Now the \nindustry wants the bankruptcy system to protect it. I say to you, Mr. \nPresident, that is not right.\n  The industry hasn't come to us hat in hand, however. It has come with \nan open checkbook. As you know, Mr. President, from time to time on the \nfloor in recent months, I have noted that contributions of different \nplayers in the legislative process that seek to influence our work here \nwith campaign contributions. This bill is a poster child for the \n``Calling of the Bankroll.''\n  Like so many issues, bankruptcy reform has been transformed from a \npolicy debate to a vehicle for a special interest agenda. The key \ningredient in that transformation is money, plain and simple.\n  In the last election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive \nPolitics, the members of the National Consumer Bankruptcy Coalition, an \nindustry lobbying group made up of the major credit card companies such \nas Visa and MasterCard and associations representing the Nation's big \nbanks and retailers, gave nearly $4.5 million in contributions to \nparties and candidates.\n  How can a single mother in West Allis, WI, for example, who faces \noverwhelming debt from medical bills and the loss of child support, \ncompete with the might and financial power of this industry? Her \nfamily, and her future will be affected by this bill every bit as much \nas the credit industry, yet she is not represented in the campaign \nfinance game. And I am afraid that this bill in its current form very \nmuch reflects her lack of power.\n  Some of the campaign contributions from these companies seem to be \ncarefully timed to have a maximum effect.\n\n[[Page S14068]]\n\n  It is very hard to argue that the financial largess of this industry \nhas nothing to do with its interest in our consideration of bankruptcy \nlegislation. For example, on the very day that the House passed the \nconference report last year and sent it to the Senate, MBNA Corporation \ngave a $200,000 soft money contribution to the National Republican \nSenatorial Committee.\n  In connection with the joint hearing that was held earlier this year, \nI submitted a written question to Bruce Hammond, the chief operating \nofficer of MBNA. I asked him about the $200,000 contribution to the \nNRSC in October 9, 1998, just days after the conference committee \nreached agreement on a version of this bill that everyone agreed was \nmore favorable to the credit card companies than the bill that the \nSenate had passed.\n  This is what I asked him:\n\n       (A) As CEO, are you involved generally in the decisions to \n     make soft money contributions to the political parties?\n       (B) Were you involved in the decision to make this \n     particular donation?\n       (C) How are decisions on soft money contributions made in \n     your company? Who participates in such decisions? What \n     criteria are followed in making such decisions?\n       (D) Why did MBNA make a $200,000 donation to the NRSC on \n     October 9, 1998?\n\n  Mr. Hammond's written response to the questions was very \nilluminating. Basically, he decided to ignore these direct and simple \nquestions about the soft money donations of his company, and instead \nwrote the following:\n\n       I find the premise for this question troubling, I hope \n     there is no intention to place bankruptcy reform in a \n     partisan political context. All of us who have worked in \n     support of these legislative reforms have been pleased by the \n     support, cooperation and encouragement we have received on \n     both sides of the political aisle. It has been particularly \n     pleasing to note that in this Congress both the House and \n     Senate bills have had as their original co-sponsors prominent \n     and respected Members of Congress from both political \n     parties.\n\n  With all due respect, Mr. Hammond has made my point for me. As I \nnoted, the soft money contributions of this industry have gone to both \nparties. Actually, MBNA Corp. has only given to the Republican party \ncommittees in the last few cycles. But other big lenders, such as Visa \nUSA, BankAmerica Corp., and Citigroup, are giving to both parties. That \nis what is so insidious about these contributions. They aren't about \npolitics, they are about policy. These companies don't just want to \ninfluence elections, they want to influence legislation directly.\n  So the premise of my questions to the chief operating officer of MBNA \nCorp. was not to suggest that this bankruptcy bill was partisan, it was \nto get at the bipartisan problem of soft money and its insidious \nrelationship to the legislative process. I'm sorry that Mr. Hammond \ndecided not to answer my questions directly. I suspect that one of the \nreasons that he didn't is that direct honest answers to these questions \nwould not be something he would want in the legislative history of this \nlegislation. So he chose to simply ignore the questions. That is \nunfortunate.\n\n  Mr. President, in the current Congress we are seeing another influx \nof campaign contributions from banks and lenders seeking to influence \nthis bill.\n  Incredibly, PAC contributions from National Consumer Bankruptcy \nCoalition members totaled $227,000 in March of this year alone. That's \na full 20 months before the next election. But guess what. March 1999 \nwas a month during which the Judiciary Committees of both the House and \nthe Senate were considering the bill. Members of the coalition gave \nnearly $1.2 million in PAC and soft money contributions in the first 6 \nmonths of 1999. During that time period, MBNA Corp. gave $85,000 in \nsoft money to the Republican Party committees, while Visa USA Inc. gave \n$30,000.\n  Now I want to be clear here once again. Republicans are not alone in \ntaking in hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks and lenders in \nthis election cycle: During the first 6 months of 1999, the Democratic \nparty committees took in more than four times the soft money from banks \nand lenders than they did during the first 6 months of the last \npresidential election cycle in 1995. Soft money contributions overall \nare up by about 80 percent, but the banks and credit card companies \nhave quadrupled their contributions to my party.\n  Mr. President, we need to keep in mind as we debate this bill, and \nthe many amendments that will be offered, the extent to which \nbankruptcy reform has come to be seen as a gift to special interests, \nparticularly the credit card companies. In light of that, we bear an \neven heavier burden to make sure that we are serving the public \ninterest with this kind of far reaching legislation.\n  We must open our minds to the recommendations of nonpartisan experts \nin this field. We haven't done that yet, although some progress \ncertainly has been made between the time this bill left the Judiciary \nCommittee and today. I am pleased, for example, that the requirement \nthat debtors attorneys bear personal financial responsibility for the \ntrustee's cost and fees if the debtor loses a motion to convert a \nchapter 7 filing to chapter 13 has been eliminated. That provision \nwould have had the result of denying many honest American families \nadequate legal representation, making them even more subject to abusive \nand predatory practices by creditors.\n  But we have a long way to go to make this a balanced bill, rather \nthan a wish list for credit card companies. If we don't do that, we \nwill have filed in our duty to the public and will come to regret our \nactions.\n  I sincerely hope that once again we can work together to develop a \nproduct that will win a near unanimous vote in the Senate as last \nyear's bill did. A bankruptcy reform bill should be the product of a \nconsidered and well-informed debate, not a political dance, where money \ncalls the tune.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2522\n\n        (Purpose: To provide for the expenses of long-term care)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President. In a moment I am going to offer an \namendment to address one of the many unfairnesses of the means test in \nthis bill. This amendment is focused particularly on expenses that a \nfamily might incur because it is paying for medical care for a non-\ndependent family member.\n  These kinds of expenses often are referred to in our discussions as \nexpenses for long term care. Long-term care, and particularly \nfundamental long-term care reform, has been a special focus of mine \nsince I was first elected to the Wisconsin State Senate in 1982.\n  As I discovered when I began working on this many years ago, long-\nterm care is greatly misunderstood. Even today, when people hear long-\nterm care many think of nursing homes and the elderly.\n  But that is not the whole story.\n  According to the Long-Term Care Campaign, while the majority of the \nover 11 million severely disabled Americans needing long-term care \nservices are elderly, nearly half are either working-age adults or \nchildren.\n  And while many do receive their long-term care services in a nursing \nhome, the vast majority of those needing long-term care receive that \ncare at home.\n  Long-term care touches many more than just those needing services.\n  Nearly 6 of every 10 Americans have already experienced a long-term \ncare problem in their own family or through a friend, and more than \nhalf of these have provided care to someone who needs services.\n  The National Family Caregivers Association estimates that between 80 \nand 90 percent of all long-term care is provided by families.\n  Caregiving can be an enormous burden on families--physically, \nemotionally, and financially.\n  As we found in Wisconsin two decades ago, that burden not only takes \nits toll on families, but on government budgets and taxpayers since all \ntoo often the reason an individual enters a nursing home is not due to \ntheir condition, but because the family member caregiver is simply no \nlonger able to care for them.\n  Though I will not speak at length today about the reforms we need to \nmake to our long-term care system, I do want to note this critical \npoint--we need to build on the informal long-term care that families \nalready provide, not only to allow those needing long-term care \nservices to remain where they prefer, at home with their family, but \nalso because the alternative places a huge burden on State and Federal \nbudgets.\n  Families that provide personal assistance and other forms of care to\n\n[[Page S14069]]\n\nloved ones not only help that loved one, they help the taxpayer.\n  Families provide an estimated $200 billion in long-term care services \nevery year--services that help keep loved ones at home, and out of \nexpensive institutional settings.\n  But when families are no longer able for physical, emotional, or \nfinancial reasons to care for that loved one, changes are that \nindividual will end up in a nursing home on the joint State-Federal \nprogram Medicaid.\n  When taxpayers pick up the Medicaid tab for nursing home care, it \nisn't cheap.\n  According to the Long-term Care Campaign, nursing homes cost an \naverage of $46,000 a year, and for those with severe disabilities or \ndementia, the costs can be even greater.\n  Mr. President, much as I might like to, we can't use this bankruptcy \nbill to reform our long-term care system. But at the very least, we \nshould not be making the current long-term care crisis worse than it \nalready is. And that, I fear, is exactly what the bill in its current \nform does.\n  In particular, we should not be discouraging families from caring for \na disabled or chronically ill loved one. If a family facing financial \ndifficulties can continue to care for a loved one at home, and keep \nthem out of more expensive taxpayer-funded settings, all of us will \nbenefit.\n\n  It is for that reason that I offer this amendment--to make sure that \na family's ongoing expenses to provide care for a loved one will be \nrecognized as reasonable and legitimate living expenses for purposes of \ncalculating how much a family is capable of contributing toward \nrepayment of debt.\n  The means test in the bill provides that a debtors are ineligible for \na Chapter 7 discharge if they can supposedly repay 25 percent of their \ndebts or $15,000, which ever is less, over a period of 5 years. \nBasically, the trustee has to analyze the ability of debtors to repay \ntheir debts, looking at their monthly income and their monthly \nexpenses. But the expenses are not actual expenses, they are the \nexpenses set out in IRS standards designed for a wholly different \npurpose. And these standards do not include as necessary expenses \namounts paid for the care of non-dependent family members.\n  So people who file for bankruptcy are presumed to have abused the \nsystem if they don't meet the means test using the IRS standards. And \nthey can rebut that presumption only by showing special circumstances \nthat justify additional expenses.\n  To do so, they have to provide documentation and ``a detailed \nexplanation of the circumstances that makes the expenses necessary and \nreasonable.'' So under this bill, debtors with significant long term \ncare expenses are deemed abusers of the system, and they may have to \nlitigate to prove that they are not spending too much to care for their \nfamily. The bankruptcy courts are going to be called on to pass \njudgment on whether the expenses for long term care are reasonable. \nSome people may be forced to forgo bankruptcy because they cannot \nafford to both hire a lawyer to fight the presumption of abuse and \ncontinue to care for their family members.\n  This is only one of many examples of how use of the IRS standards \nmakes the means test draconian and unfair. I hope as we debate and \namend this bill we will make major changes in how this means test \noperates. And we should start here, with long term care expenses. This \namendment simply provides that the monthly expenses to be analyzed \nunder the means test may include the continuation of actual expenses \npaid by the debtor for the care of household or immediate family \nmembers who are not dependent.\n  Let's think about the alternative for a moment. Imagine a scenario \nwhere someone is in the position of filing for bankruptcy and has \nsignificant long term care expenses of a aging parent that are for some \nreason deemed to be not reasonable. If that individual is prevented \nfrom filing for bankruptcy, the need for the long term care doesn't go \naway. It stays. It may be the reason that the person has to file for \nbankruptcy in the first place, because the additional burden of the \nlong term care expenses makes it impossible to make ends meet and keep \nup with payments on accumulated debt.\n  What choice does this person have if the protection of the bankruptcy \nlaws is unavailable? No choice at all. The care must stop, and the \nperson being cared for goes into a public institution with higher costs \nto the taxpayers and, more important, untold damage to the family.\n  I challenge my colleagues to tell us how the simple exception to the \nrigid IRS standards set out in this amendment will lead to abuse. Are \npeople going to go out and arrange for unreasonably extravagant care \nfor their family members in order to file for bankruptcy and get out of \ndebt? I don't think so. In fact, I think it is insulting.\n  No, the millions of Americans who selflessly care for their loved \nones make a sacrifice that we should honor and encourage. Passing this \namendment would be a small step toward recognizing that crucial service \nto our country that they provide. I urge my colleagues to step back \nfrom the misery that this bill might very well inflict and adopt this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so I may offer this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send my amendment No. 2522 to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his amendment \nand the remarks he made. There are some good questions. We do want to \nhelp those who are in nursing homes and so forth.\n  I am somewhat nervous and troubled by the breadth of the language \nbecause economics is a fairly crystal science in a lot of ways. This \njust says you want\n\n[[Page S14070]]\n\nto help a dependent. In effect, what he is saying by this amendment is \nthat a debtor who owes people who he has gotten benefits from and \npromised to pay them money, he won't pay them; he will be able to take \nmoney they should get and apply it to the family members to whom he \nwants to give it.\n  I don't know whether that is a good proposal for this bill or not. As \nhe said, maybe we can't fix health care in the bankruptcy bill. Maybe \nnot. We will be glad to review that, and I am sure Senator Grassley \nwill.\n  I wish to make a number of points about some of the issues that have \nbeen raised because I do so strongly believe this piece of legislation \nis good. I believe it is going to make a major step forward in \nimproving bankruptcy and having more fairness, eliminating these \ncomplaints that all of us are, in fact, hearing from people in our \nStates who have been abused by the process in bankruptcy. Many times \nthey blame the lawyers, and sometimes so do I. But the truth is, \nlawyers are using the laws we pass. It is our responsibility, if the \nlaw isn't working, to come to this floor and present legislation to fix \nit.\n  Over 70 percent of the people believe we need to reform bankruptcy \nlaw. This isn't a special interest piece of legislation. But I will say \nthis: There is no doubt that banks and others who regularly go to \nbankruptcy court see what is going on there on a daily basis. They have \nevery right to call to our attention what they see are problems and \ninjustices. We have a responsibility, if that is so, to fix it. That is \nfundamental. That is what American law is all about. What we are doing \nwith the bankruptcy bill is trying to reform and improve bankruptcy \nlaw, which has had no real analysis since 1978. We have had more than \ndouble the filings in bankruptcy since 1978. Indeed, we have had a \nvirtual doubling of bankruptcy filings since 1990, during that period \nof time.\n\n  Larry Summers, the present Secretary of the Treasury, stated that \nbankruptcy does, in fact, increase interest rates. Businesses have to \ncharge more when more people are bankrupting and not paying back their \ndebts. It raises the interest rates. The present Secretary of the \nTreasury understands that, and any economist would.\n  Senator Hatch, chairman of our Judiciary Committee, has pointed out \nthe average cost per family of the debts wiped out in bankruptcy per \nyear is $400. What that means is that somebody is not paying their debt \nand, in fact, is shifting the burden to other people to pay them for \nthem. Sure, bankruptcy is a historic part of American law. It is \nsomething we never want to eliminate. We want to protect that right. It \nis mentioned in the Constitution but not provided for in detail. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized we ought to have a bankruptcy system. It \nhas always been a part of the Federal court system, and we, as the \nCongress, have the responsibility to analyze it periodically to see \nwhat abuses and problems are occurring and, where there are problems, \nto fix them and see if we can't make the system work better.\n  Now they say we want to talk about credit cards. That is an issue we \nmay want to talk about.\n  But this piece of legislation was designed to deal with the \nbankruptcy court system. We have banking committees and others that are \ndealing with these credit disclosure acts and the kind of bank loans \nand interest rates credit cards ought to utilize.\n  In fact, the chairman of the Banking Committee is not happy we are \ndown here amending banking law on a bankruptcy bill that has nothing to \ndo with banking law. Rightly, he should be. I don't think we need to \ndistract ourselves on that. Frankly, I think we ought to just confront \nthis issue that is being raised.\n  Bankruptcy is the fault of all of the credit card companies, and they \nare giving too much money to people who are marginal credit risks. They \nare allowing them to have credit cards--horrible things they are doing, \nallowing a poor person to have a credit card. That is bad.\n  We just had a banking bill that almost went down over a debate among \nthose liberals in this body who wanted to ensure that the banks lend \nmore money to at-risk, high-risk borrowers. That is a good thing, not a \nbad thing. If they weren't lending money to poorer people, weren't \nallowing them to have credit cards, then they would be much condemned \nfor it, and rightly so. Ninety-nine percent of people who have credit \ncards pay their debt--99 percent. The banks are not lending substantial \nsums of money to people who can't pay their debt.\n  But I will tell you this. If you are living on a fixed income, you \nhave a $25,000-a-year income, you have a family, you are trying to do \nthings, and the tire blows out on your car, you are glad you have a \ncredit card so you can pay for it to be fixed, so you don't have to sit \nit on the blocks, or you can get your momma, or somebody, to lend you \nthe money to fix the tire. And it allows you to pay it back over a \nperiod of time.\n\n  It is an odd thing to me that people who think and claim they care \nabout the poor are going to be complaining because credit card \ncompanies allow them to have credit cards so they can borrow money when \nthey need to. It becomes a critical thing for them.\n  Then there is a complaint that somehow this legislation is unfair to \nwomen and children. That is a stunning event. From day 1, Senator Hatch \nand Senator Grassley made a commitment to make a historic change in the \nway bankruptcy treats child support and alimony. There is a list of \nthings that have to be paid first when you pay off your debts in \nbankruptcy. They call them priorities. Child support and alimony used \nto be seventh on that list. From day 1--this bankruptcy bill has \nproceeded for over 2 years now--we have raised child support and \nalimony to No. 1, ahead of lawyer fees. That is historic. They are \ncomplaining, too. But we made a commitment that nothing would take \npriority in bankruptcy court over child support and alimony.\n  It amazes me. I am astounded that those who want to kill this \nlegislation, for reasons I cannot fathom, come down here and complain \nthat the reason they are against it is that it hurts children. This is \na historic move to provide unprecedented protections and priorities for \nchildren.\n  I find that a stunning argument to make.\n  They argue that this is going to penalize a single woman with a child \nwho has financial troubles and needs to go into bankruptcy, and that \nsomehow that woman with that child would be required to pay back some \nof their debt when they wouldn't have been required to pay some of \ntheir debt under the old law, because fundamentally what this bill says \nis, if you can pay back some of your debts, you ought to. What is wrong \nwith that? If you can pay back some of your debts, you ought to pay \nsome of them back. That is fairness. That is one of the biggest abuses \nwe have. We have young yuppies making $100,000 a year in income, \nrunning up a bunch of debts, and then they just wipe them out and start \nall over again. That is not right. If they can pay back some of those \ndebts, they ought to pay them.\n  The question is, Won't this abuse women with children at home who \nhave financial difficulties? Let me explain this simply. If there is a \nmother and a child, a family of two, the median income in America is \n$40,000. If they make less than $40,000, they will be able to file \nbankruptcy just as they always have. If two of them are making $40,000 \na year--which is a pretty solid income--or below, they will not be \nsubject to these rules that require those who can pay to pay. If they \nmake over $40,000, the judge will have the responsibility to evaluate \ntheir debt, evaluate their expenses, and see if they can pay back some. \nIf they can pay back 25 percent, or 30 percent, or 50 percent, or maybe \n100 percent, if their income is $100,000 a year, what is wrong with \nthat?\n  Should a single woman be given preference over a single man with a \nchild?\n  We have to have simple rules that are fair and objective. All I am \nsaying is, it would take a family with a substantial income before the \nprinciples of law would apply that they would have to pay back any \nmoney.\n  There is a suggestion that somehow because a father is paying alimony \nand he might pay back some of his debt, he will not be able to pay his \nchild support. But as we know, he is required to pay his child support \nfirst. And no plan in bankruptcy can be approved by a bankruptcy judge \nunless this gives priority to repayment of past due child\n\n[[Page S14071]]\n\nsupport and paying current child support. That is a bogus argument.\n\n  This bill requires the judge, before he approves a bankruptcy payback \nplan, to give priority to the payback of child support and alimony. In \nfact, it will strengthen the ability of children to receive the alimony \npayment because instead of walking in and filing bankruptcy under \nchapter 7 and just wiping out all of his debt and starting fresh, the \ndeadbeat dad will be under the control of the bankruptcy court, under \nchapter 13, and will have to report his income on a regular basis. If \nhe is not paying that, he can be disciplined through the bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  That is not a good argument, I would suggest.\n  There is a study by a group of professors who said only 4 percent of \nthe people filing bankruptcy could pay even 25 percent of their debt. \nIn that instance, if that is true--and I doubt that; I think the figure \nis a good bit higher than that but not a lot higher. I am not saying it \nis a huge number. Maybe it is 15, 20, or 10 percent. But those 10 \npercent who can pay it, those 4 percent who can pay their debts, why \nshouldn't they pay them? That is what we are saying. The law will not \nmake them pay if they can't pay. If their income is below the median \nincome, they won't have to pay back the debts at all.\n  I think that is not an argument that is important to us today.\n  There is another complaint about mailing credit cards. I heard a lot \nof people say, I get credit cards in the mail. They are not getting \ncredit cards in the mail. If they are, they ought to call the Federal \nState law enforcement because it is illegal to send somebody a credit \ncard they haven't asked for. What they are receiving in the mail from \ncredit card companies are solicitations or offerings for credit cards.\n  I think that is probably good because I don't like those high \ninterest rates on credit cards. I shop around. I don't like paying 18 \npercent interest. I hope most people can avoid running up any \nsignificant debt because that is a high interest rate. But one of the \ngood things that has happened of late is, credit cards are getting \ncompetitive. They are offering us to join up: Convert to our credit \ncard, have no interest for so many months, and you are going to have a \nlower interest rate than you had before. They are getting some \ncompetition in the credit card industry.\n  We are going to come around now and pass a law in this Congress that \nsays a credit card company can't write you a letter and offer you 15-\npercent interest instead of your current 17-percent interest? What kind \nof idea is that? We have some poor economic thinking in this Congress.\n\n  By the way, as the Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton \nhas indicated, defaults on payments in bankruptcy drive up interest \nrates for everyone. It was suggested we have to make these reforms in \namendments because old people are not able to pay their debts. Old \npeople are not the ones filing bankruptcy. The figures cited were older \npeople over 55. Filers over 55 have gone up almost 120 percent since \n1990, but during that time all filings have gone up 100 percent. Always \nthe older citizens of the country are the least likely to file \nbankruptcy. They are the most responsible and keep up with their books \nand manage their debts well. That is not the biggest problem in \nbankruptcy. Check the ages and it won't be the people 65 years old and \nup filing bankruptcy in America today. They are responsible. They have \nlearned how to manage their money.\n  One amendment is to crack down on subprime lenders, banks that loan \nto poor people. We have legislation attacking banks for redlining areas \nand not loaning to poor people. We had a big fight over it on the \nbanking bill. The people receiving these loans were viewed as \nvulnerable and preyed upon. Sometimes they can be vulnerable and \nsometimes I guess they can be preyed upon. However, one doesn't have to \ntake a loan if they don't think it is better. If a person has $10,000 \ncredit card debt at 18-percent interest and they can get a loan at a \nbank at 12.5 percent to pay it off and they don't have a good credit \nrating, but 12.5 percent is better than 18 percent. People make those \nchoices daily. I don't know as part of bankruptcy court reform that we \nought to try to reform banking law. That ought to be thought through \nmore carefully.\n  This bill is essentially the bill that passed 97-1 in this body. It \nis essentially the bill that passed the House last year by a veto-proof \nmajority. It has already passed the House again this year by a veto-\nproof majority. There is bipartisan support for it. It is beyond me why \nwe can't have a final vote and get it passed. I have only been in this \nbody a little over 2\\1/2\\ years, and I don't see how we have a bill \nwith this kind of support. It is frustrating trying to get a final vote \nand do what the people of this country want done. We debated it. They \nsaid we have not had hearings. We had hearings for years on it. \nEverybody knows the issues. We have had staff meetings in excruciating \ndetail.\n  Senator Grassley has been more than generous in working with those \nwho have concerns about the bill. He has met with the staff, met with \nthe White House. My staff is meeting with a representative from the \nWhite House today trying to work out the language on one or two issues \nthat we think we can reach an agreement on. There have been great \nefforts to make some changes. Why some want to spin this as a bill that \nis unfair is beyond my comprehension. We had this year a joint House-\nSenate Committee on bankruptcy--the first time in history--to consider \nthose issues.\n  My vote is not for sale. I am not going to support a bankruptcy bill \nor any other bill because of any political contribution. I am offended \nby those who come on the floor and suggest that is what we are doing. I \nam prepared to debate any issue on this bill on the merits of what is \ngood for public policy in this country. I am getting sick and tired of \nsanctimonious Senators suggesting they are above all the rest of us and \neverybody is corrupt--because industry gives political contributions to \nboth parties. That is not right.\n\n  Let's talk about what is wrong with this bill. Let's talk about why \nsomething in here is unfair, if it is. If it is unfair, we will fix it. \nI am not happy with that. I think we need to do better.\n  Mr. President, 70 percent of the people are in favor of this \nlegislative reform. There is overwhelming popular support for a system \nthe reform of which is long overdue. We can do it. I don't blame the \npeople who are in the process of dealing with it every year for being \nangry. They have a right to be. There are multiple loopholes in this \nbankruptcy system that we have seen. We have seen how they work and we \ncan fix them.\n  One of the driving factors behind increased filings of bankruptcy is \nadvertising by attorneys. Watch their ads. They don't say: Come on down \nand we will file bankruptcy. It says: Got problems with your debts? \nCome talk to me.\n  You talk to them and the next thing you know a person who has never \nbeen given an opportunity for a different opinion has suggested they \ncan pay a certain fee and file bankruptcy and they will take care of \nhim; all their debts will be wiped out. And the debtor says: You mean \nthat, really? And the lawyer says: Absolutely; that is the law.\n  We passed that law. We talk about needs-based reform. What we are \nsaying is, if you can't pay your debts, you have an income below the \nmedian income in America, $50,000 for a family of four--that is what \nthe median income is--if you can't pay, you can have traditional \nbenefits of chapter 7 and wipe out your debts, if that is what you \nchoose. However, if you make above that, the judge can order you to pay \nsome of the money back. I think that is only fair. I believe that will \neliminate some of the abuses in the bankruptcy system.\n  Another amendment Senator Kohl and I have offered deals with what I \nconsider another abuse in bankruptcy. I have an example from the New \nYork Times article of last year about some people who used and abused \nthe bankruptcy system.\n       The First American Bank and Trust Company in Lake Worth, \n     Fla., closed in 1989, and its chief executive, Roy Talmo, \n     filed for personal bankruptcy in 1993. Despite owing $6.8 \n     million, Mr. Talmo was able to exempt a bounty of assets.\n       During much of the bankruptcy proceedings, Mr. Talmo drove \n     around Miami in a 1960 Rolls-Royce and tended the grounds of \n     his $800,000 tree farm in Boynton Beach. Never one to slum \n     it, Mr. Talmo had a 7,000-square-foot mansion with five \n     fireplaces, 16th-century European doors and a Spanish-\n\n[[Page S14072]]\n\n     style courtyard all on a 30-acre lot. Yet in Mr. Talmo's \n     estimation, this was chintzy. He also owned an adjacent 112 \n     acres, and he tried to add those acres to his homestead. The \n     court refused.\n       Mr. Talmo, though, now looks back as a more humbled man, \n     ``Bankruptcy is something I don't want to do again,'' Mr. \n     Talmo said. ``Mine is a sad story. I have my home, but \n     otherwise I was wiped out.''\n\n  This is the way it works: The former commissioner of baseball--lots \nof prominent people do this--runs up a big bunch of bills; the business \nfails; he owes a lot of people money. So you say: What can I do? I can \nmove to Florida; I can move to Texas; I can buy a big mansion, put all \nmy money there on the Atlantic coast or the gulf coast or the Texas \ncoast or wherever, and I will just put everything I have liquid right \nnow in that house. I will claim it as my homestead and they cannot take \nit.\n  Then, after I have wiped out all these people I legitimately and \nlawfully owe, I can sell my multimillion-dollar mansion and live high \nthe rest of my life. That is what this law allows. It is proper and \nlegal in the American bankruptcy system today, and we ought to put a \nstop to it.\n  People say it is States rights. Not so. Bankruptcy is totally a \nFederal court proceeding. It is referred to in the U.S. Constitution. \nIt is totally a Federal court proceeding and we have, as a Federal \nCongress, the right to set the standards as we choose them for a \nhomestead exemption. In my view, this is an abuse. It allows people to \nmove in interstate commerce and to defeat totally legitimate creditors \nand live like kings and not pay back people they owe.\n  I am going to mention one other example in the New York Times \narticle:\n\n       Even when residents of Texas and Florida sell their homes \n     and pay off their mortgages during bankruptcy, they can still \n     walk away rich.\n       Talmadge Wayne Tinsley, a Dallas developer, filed for \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 after he incurred $60 million in \n     debt, largely bank loans. Under Texas law, Mr. Tinsley could \n     keep only one acre of his 3.1-acre estate, a rule that did \n     not sit well with him. His $3.5 million, magnolia-lined \n     estate included a five-bedroom, six-and-a-half-bath mansion \n     with two studies, a pool and a guest house. All that fit \n     snugly onto one acre.\n       Yet when the court asked Mr. Tinsley to mark of two acres \n     to be sold to pay off his debts, his facetious offer was for \n     the trustee to come by and peel off two feet around his \n     entire property. The court refused, forcing a sale, but by \n     Mr. Tinsley still did rather well for himself.\n       He sold his house in October for $3.5 million using the \n     proceeds to write a $659,000 check to the Internal Revenue \n     Service and another for $1.8 million to pay off the mortgage. \n     That left $700,000 for Mr. Tinsley after closing costs and \n     other expenses were deducted from the proceeds, according to \n     court officials. About $58 million of his debts were left \n     unpaid.\n  I believe there are abuses there. I believe the Kohl-Sessions \namendment will deal with it. It is not a question of States rights. The \nFederal bankruptcy courts have allowed States to set the standard, but \nit has never been a problem, that the Federal court could set a \nnational standard if they chose.\n  We, by this amendment, say you could only have $100,000 in equity in \nyour home--not the value but in the equity of your home--and be able to \nkeep it; whereas, over two-thirds of the States limit it to $40,000. So \nwe are just moving down some of those States with extreme laws to a \nreasonable level. I believe that will eliminate one of the most glaring \nabuses in the bankruptcy system.\n  I am pleased to be joined now by the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, who has worked hard to bring this \nlegislation to fruition. I am proud to serve on his committee. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his excellent \npresentation and the work he has done on the Judiciary Committee on \nthis very important bill. It is a very important bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1729\n\n (Purpose: To provide for domestic support obligations, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I intend to make it even more important by calling up \namendment No. 1729 and asking for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], for himself and Mr. \n     Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 1729.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my commitment again \nthis year to reforming the bankruptcy laws in order to adequately \nprotect children and ex-spouses that are owed domestic support. I am \ngrateful that S. 625 includes the language I offered last year along \nwith Senators Grassley and Kyl, providing extensive reforms to the \nbankruptcy laws in the area of child support. Also, I introduced \nadditional enhancements to the bill's protection of domestic support \nobligations at the Judiciary Committee markup, and I accepted further \nchanges by Senator Torricelli, with the agreement that we would \ncontinue working on the development of even further enhancements to the \nbill in this important area. I would like to express my gratitude to \nSenator Torricelli for working with me on these important provisions.\n  I have continued to work with domestic support enforcement groups and \nSenator Torricelli to improve the bankruptcy laws, and I offer this \namendment, along with Senator Torricelli, to make a series of \nadditional enhancements to the bill so that we can be certain that this \nimportant legislation enables women and children to collect the support \nand alimony payments they are owed.\n  Current bankruptcy law simply is not adequate to protect women and \nchildren. I have been outraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat \nparents are manipulating and abusing the current bankruptcy system in \norder to get out of paying their domestic support obligations. I have \nin front of me a how-to book called ``Discharging Marital Obligations \nIn Bankruptcy.'' This is why we need to reform our bankruptcy laws.\n  I am proud of the improvements we are making over current law in \nterms of ensuring that parents meet their child support and other \ndomestic support obligations in bankruptcy.\n  This chart indicates:\n\n       The Support Provisions Of This Bill Certainly Justify The \n     Praise Given Them By The Most Significant National Public \n     Support Collection Organizations In This Country.\n\n  That is a statement made by Phillip Strauss, Legal Division of the \nFamily Support Bureau, the Office of the District Attorney of San \nFrancisco on March 18, 1999, in testimony before the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The bill's improvements over current law have the support of the \ncountry's premiere child support collection organizations. As you can \nsee, the bill's child support provisions are endorsed by the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, the National Child Support \nEnforcement Association, and all of them, and many others, support what \nwe are trying to do today. I would also like to point out that \nliterally dozens of ex-spouses who are owed domestic support \nobligations have expressed to me their support for these improvements \nto bankruptcy law.\n  We have all heard complaints by those who would attempt to politicize \nthis issue that the bankruptcy bill is somehow harmful to families. I \nhave worked tirelessly, provision by provision, both last year and this \nyear to make this a bill that dramatically improves the position of \nchildren and ex-spouses who are entitled to domestic support. No one \nwho actually looks at what the bill says can, in good conscience, say \nthat this bill is not a tremendous improvement for families over \ncurrent law. There may be those who do not want to see bankruptcy \nreform, but they cannot, with a straight face, argue that this bill is \nanything other than a huge positive step for our children. I believe \nthat criticizing this bill without regard for what is in it, and using \nour children as pawns in the process, is shameful.\n  I challenge critics of the bill to stop with the vague allegations \nand take a look at what the bill itself actually does.\n  First, here is what S. 625 does apart from the additional \nimprovements I have offered in the manager's amendment:\n\n[[Page S14073]]\n\n  The bill prevents the use of the automatic stay from being used to \navoid family support obligations: S. 625 stops deadbeat parents from \nusing bankruptcy to avoid family support obligations.\n  For example, the bill prevents the automatic stay from being used to \nput a hold on the interception of tax refunds to be used to pay a \ndomestic support obligation.\n  The bill enables revocation of driver's licenses and other privileges \nfrom deadbeats: The bill prevents the automatic stay from being used to \nprevent the withholding of driver's licenses when debtors default on \ndomestic support obligations. This is a particularly important \nprovision, given recent news reports about the effectiveness of \nsuspending driver's licenses of people who aren't paying their child \nsupport. A Maryland initiative has resulted in $103 million in child \nsupport collections just since 1996. We do not want our bankruptcy laws \nto work as an impediment to effective programs like the one in \nMaryland.\n  Without these changes, a person could use current bankruptcy law to \nstave off a driver's license suspension by using the automatic stay, \nand undermine the effectiveness of these programs at getting child \nsupport to the kids who need it.\n  The bill gives child support first priority status: Domestic support \nobligations are moved from seventh in line to first priority status in \nbankruptcy, meaning they will be paid ahead of lawyers and other \nspecial interests.\n  The bill makes debt discharge in bankruptcy conditional upon full \npayment of past due child support and alimony.\n  It requires payment of domestic support obligations for plan \nconfirmation:\n  And, S. 625 makes domestic support obligations automatically \nnondischargeable. This lets ex-spouses seeking to enforce domestic \nsupport obligations avoid the legal expenses of litigation that they \nincur under present law.\n  The bill provides single parents with new tools to help them collect \nfrom an ex-partner in the bankruptcy system.\n  The bill provides better notice and more information for easier child \nsupport collection.\n  The bill provides help in tracking deadbeats. For example, If there \nis non-payment of child support in a post-discharge situation, other \ncreditors with non-dischargeable debt are required to provide the last \nknown address of the debtor on request, a significant help in locating \npeople who have skipped out on their child support obligations.\n  And, the bill allows for claims against a deadbeat parent's property.\n  In addition to these improvements over current law that have been \npart of the bankruptcy reform bill for months, I have worked with \nSenator Torricelli, the National Women's Law Center, and the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General to further enhance the domestic \nsupport provisions of the bill. I thank each of them for their \ncommitment to further improving the bill, and I am proud of what we \nhave accomplished.\n  Our amendment has many enhancements over current law.\n  For example, the amendment allows for the payment of child support \nwith interest by those with means. The debtor can pay interest under \nthe plan if he has sufficient income after paying all other allowed \nclaims.\n  The amendment prevents bankruptcy from holding up child custody, \nvisitation, and domestic violence cases. Essentially, the amendment \nexempts proceedings not involving money from being subject to \nbankruptcy's automatic stay provisions. These include civil cases \nregarding child custody or visitation, divorce--unless it involves a \ndivision of property--and domestic violence.\n  The amendment facilitates wage withholding to collect child support \nfrom deadbeat parents. It accomplishes this by adding a requirement \nthat the trustee provide to the person owed support and the State child \nsupport collection agency the debtor's employer's last known name and \naddress. Also, the amendment simplifies the ability of the person owed \nsupport to get information on the debtor's whereabouts from other \ncreditors. These measures will assist greatly in the imposition of wage \nwithholding orders if they are not already in effect.\n\n  The amendment helps avoid administrative roadblocks to get kids the \nsupport they need. The amendment provides an expanded definition of \n``domestic support obligation'' to cover those who have not been \nofficially designated as a legal guardian, but who nonetheless are \nentitled to collect child support on a child's behalf.\n  Also, the amendment gives priority to parents over government. It \ndivided the new ``first priority'' status into two sub-parts, giving \nparents who are not receiving benefits the top priority--whether or not \nthe benefits have been formalistically ``assigned'' to the government \nfor collection purposes--and giving next priority to obligations \nassigned to and owed directly to the government in exchange for the \npayment of benefits--such as where parents are liable for the costs of \ntreating a child in a mental facility.\n  A key provision makes staying current on child support a condition of \ndischarge. The amendment allows for conversion or dismissal of chapter \n1, 12, and 13 cases where the debtor is not current on presently \naccruing domestic support obligations. Two checkpoints are imposed in \nthe case at which the debtor must be current with payments: \nconfirmation and prior to obtaining a discharge. This provides a new \nway of preventing debtors from not paying their domestic support \nobligations during the gap period between filing and confirmation.\n  Moreover, the amendment makes payment of child support arrears a \ncondition of plan confirmation. It provides that the Chapter 13 plan \nmust pay all 507(3) arrears claims (those owed to families not \nreceiving benefits) in full, unless the creditor--that is, spouse or \nchild--agrees otherwise.\n  The amendment puts responsible debtors over government. It permits \nthe cram down of arrears claims over the objection of a 507(a)(4) \ngovernment arrears claimant--that is, the government collecting in \nexchange for paying benefits, in Chapter 12 and 13 cases so long as the \ndebtor agrees to commit all disposable income for a five-year period.\n  This level of detail would ordinarily not be necessary in discussing \nprovisions in a bill on the Senate floor, but I have done so to put the \nissue to rest once and for all. Let me be clear: With my provisions in \nthe bill, bankruptcy will no longer be used by deadbeat parents to \navoid paying child support and alimony obligations.\n  If we take the time to look at the actual provisions in the bill, it \nis clear that the bankruptcy reform bill of 1999 provides enormous \nimprovements over current law. I have had a long history of advocating \nfor children and families in Congress, and I support a bill that moves \nthe obligation to pay child support and alimony to a first priority \nstatus under S. 625, as opposed to its current place at seventh in \nline, behind bankruptcy lawyers and other special interests. I support \na bill that requires debtors who owe child support to keep paying it \nwhen they file for bankruptcy. I support a bill that prevents debtors \nfrom obtaining a discharge from the court until they bring their child \nsupport and alimony obligations current. And, I support a bill that \nprovides that if a debtor pays child support right before filing for \nbankruptcy, the child support payment can't be taken away from the \nkids. Let's take a stand for our nation's kids and pass the Bankruptcy \nReform Act of 1999 out of the Senate.\n  Again I thank my colleagues for the work they have done, especially \nSenator Torricelli, who has done a remarkable job working with Senator \nGrassley on this bill as a whole, but in particular working with me on \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to Senator \nHatch for the drafting of the Hatch-Torricelli amendment that is before \nthe Senate. Senator Hatch has reinforced his reputation by a commitment \nto American families and American children that is almost without peer. \nThis is an extremely important amendment, and it strengthens the \nprovisions of the bankruptcy reform legislation as they deal with \nfamilies.\n  In drafting bankruptcy reform, Senator Grassley and I were aware that \nmany people were concerned that changes in the bankruptcy laws would\n\n[[Page S14074]]\n\nhave the unintended consequences of making spouses or children more \nvulnerable as people sought protection from their family obligations.\n  Any change in the bankruptcy code obviously and importantly raises \nquestions about family protection because, indeed, one-third of \nbankruptcies involve spousal and child support orders. In half those \ncases, women are creditors trying to collect court-ordered support from \ntheir husbands. Therefore, the sensitivity that Senator Grassley and I \nin the general legislation and Senator Hatch and I now offer in this \namendment is extremely important for Members of the Senate to have \nconfidence in this bankruptcy reform.\n  It should be remembered by the Senate that these support orders for \nsupport of children and spouses are lifelines for thousands of families \nstruggling to maintain self-sufficiency and remain off public \nassistance.\n  Forty-four percent of single-parent families with children under the \nage of 18 have incomes below the poverty line. With child support \namounting to an average of nearly $3,000 a year, it is too often the \nonly thing keeping families out of poverty and desperation.\n  With these facts in mind, Senator Grassley and I drafted legislation \nin the managers' amendment that has a very important provision \ninsisting that child support be elevated to first, rather than seventh, \nin the list of debts to repay by a debtor in bankruptcy.\n  Addressing the Senate this morning, I wanted to bring attention to \nthis provision more than any other. Under current law, a child or a \nspouse is seventh in the list of debts to be repaid. Under our \nlegislation, it will now be first, where it belongs.\n  The amendment Senator Hatch and I are now offering goes even further. \nWith the help of women's groups and Government enforcement agencies, we \nhave now been able to make several important new additions to this \nlegislation.\n  Hatch-Torricelli, first, prevents civil cases regarding child \ncustody, visitation, and divorce from being held up by an automatic \nstay. The automatic stay is designed to protect the debtor from \ncoercion by creditors, not to provide the debtor a tactic for delay in \ndealing with support issues regarding their own children.\n  Our amendment will ensure that child custody and visitation issues \nare not held hostage by the filing of a bankruptcy petition. Bankruptcy \npetitions are not designed to interfere with or delay child support or \nother related issues in family disputes regarding children and spouses. \nWe will not permit that to happen. Hatch-Torricelli reinforces the \nstrength of that provision.\n  Second, the Hatch-Torricelli amendment cracks down on those who seek \nto avoid payment of child support obligations by requiring the trustee \nto give the person to whom support is owed and State collection \norganizations information on the debtor's whereabouts. By this \nprovision, not only are we ensuring that bankruptcy reform not \ninterfere with child support, we are making bankruptcy reform a \nstrengthening provision in finding the whereabouts of those who are \nseeking to avoid family and child support.\n  It is a reflection of the reality that many people avoid child \nsupport by changing jurisdictions, by hiding from law enforcement. We \nwill use the information in bankruptcy to find those who are \nresponsible in avoiding obligations to their children.\n  Third, the Hatch-Torricelli amendment requires the debtor to pay all \nchild support arrears before the conclusion of a bankruptcy plan unless \nthe spouse agrees otherwise. Not only will bankruptcy reform not be \nused to complicate child support, people will meet that support, they \nwill deal with their arrears before their bankruptcy petition is acted \nupon and completed. This will ensure the child support is paid, and \npaid in full, before the debtor is released from the bankruptcy system.\n  Importantly, however, we do have a safety valve. If the offended \nspouse believes this is not in their interest, they can indeed waive \nthis provision. For example, if more money may be available for payment \nof support obligations after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan \nbecause other debts are discharged, then there can be a waiver.\n  I believe, though we already have good legislation that Senator \nGrassley and I have offered which would further protect children and \nspouses, it is now enhanced by the provisions offered by Senator Hatch. \nI am very proud to be his cosponsor on this important amendment. I \nbelieve we have a better bill because of it. I believe American \nchildren and families will be strengthened in the bankruptcy \nproceedings because of it. I am proud to offer it, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to commend, as I did earlier, \nSenators Grassley, Torricelli, Kohl, Sessions, Durbin, Feingold, and \nHatch for coming forward very promptly to offer amendments to improve \nthis bill.\n  In the 4 hours we have had today, I see six amendments have been \ncalled up. On first blush, I think I am probably going to be supportive \nof some of these amendments, if not all. I think if we can continue to \nimprove the bill at this rate, we may well end up getting the same kind \nof a vote--the 97-1 vote--we had last year on this bill.\n  I would note one thing. I hope Senators will look at this: We have \nbeen told of all the money the bill is going to save families in \nAmerica--$400 each--and that the credit card industry will save $5 or \n$10 billion by the reforms in this bill.\n  I have a simple question: If we are going to be giving the credit \ncard companies this $5 or $10 billion in savings from this bill, I am \njust wondering if they are going to do anything to change some of the \ncharges and interest rates they charge consumers--those in a different \nera we would consider usury, at best.\n  So my simple question is this: What language in the bill will \nguarantee that savings from the bill will be passed on to consumers? Is \nthere anything that says the credit card fees or consumer credit \ninterest rates will be reduced by the huge savings that some say will \ncome from the enactment of this bill?\n  If the consumer credit industry is going to keep several billions of \ndollars in savings from enactment of the bill, are those savings going \nto go to credit card consumers? Even some of the savings? I think that \nis a fundamental question supporters of the bill should ask themselves \nas we go forward. We know that more and more, many bankruptcies come \nabout following the enormous--enormous--fees and interest rates charged \nby credit card companies. They are going to get billions of dollars in \nsavings here. Will they pass any of those on?\n  Mr. President, I understand we have to file amendments by 5 p.m. \ntoday. I send an amendment to the desk and ask that it be appropriately \nfiled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is duly noted. The amendment is submitted.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am going to make a unanimous consent request in a \nmoment. I will wait until the distinguished chairman comes back on the \nfloor to do it.\n  This amendment is offered to protect victims of domestic violence in \nbankruptcy proceedings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Murray and Feinstein be added \nas cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. They will \nbe added.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to protect victims \nof domestic violence in a bankruptcy proceeding. I am pleased that \nSenators Murray and Feinstein are joining me as cosponsors.\n  Unfortunately, domestic violence pervades all areas of our country. \nLast year, the Department of Justice reported more than 960,000 \nincidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or \ngirlfriend occur each year, and about 85 percent of the victims are \nwomen.\n  As if those statistics were not disturbing enough, the report went on \nto say that only half of the incidents of intimate violence experienced \nby women are reported to the police. That leaves almost 1 million \nincidents that go unreported every year.\n  The pain and terror caused by these crimes of violence are all too \noften also shared by children, as the Justice Department found that \nmore than half of female victims of intimate violence live in \nhouseholds with children under the age of 12.\n\n[[Page S14075]]\n\n  As our government and community organizations grow more responsive to \nthe needs of victims of intimate and domestic abuse, more victims are \nleaving their abusive homes seeking safety and assistance. There are a \nnumber of programs, including the Rural Domestic Violence and Child \nVictimization Enforcement Grants, which I authored in the 1994 crime \nlaw, that make victim services more accessible to women and children \nescaping domestic violence.\n  For some victims, however, escaping domestic violence means starting \na whole new life away from danger. It sometimes means permanently \nleaving one's home to find safe housing. Safe housing could be across \ntown or in another state--and it often means having to purchase or rent \na new home.\n  Escape from domestic violence sometimes necessitates victims to leave \ntheir job, which could leave a woman and her children without an \nincome. Recovery from domestic violence could--and often does--also \ninvolve long-term medical and counseling services. These are all \nnecessary expenses which the victim must face.\n  The amendment that I am proposing today would ensure that victims are \nnot penalized for such expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  My amendment would ensure that additional expenses and income \nadjustments associated with the protection of a victim and the victim's \nfamily from domestic violence are included in their monthly expenses \nunder the bill's means test.\n  I believe that we must ensure that we protect the victims of domestic \nviolence if they are forced to file for bankruptcy. I urge my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2528\n\n    (Purpose: To ensure additional expenses and income adjustments \n associated with protection of the debtor and the debtor's family from \n    domestic violence are included in the debtor's monthly expenses)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am advised by the staff of the \ndistinguished chairman that he would have no objection. I now ask \nunanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment so I may offer the \nLeahy-Murray-Feinstein amendment on domestic violence and bankruptcy \nthat I just described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself, Mrs. \n     Murray, and Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2528.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 22, insert after the period the following:\n       ``In addition, the debtor's monthly expenses shall include \n     the debtor's reasonably necessary expenses incurred to \n     maintain the safety of the debtor and the family of the \n     debtor from family violence as identified under section 309 \n     of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. \n     10408), or other applicable Federal law. The expenses \n     included in the debtor's monthly expenses described in the \n     preceding sentence shall be kept confidential by the court.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2529\n\n (Purpose: To save United States taxpayers $24,000,000 by eliminating \n       the blanket mandate relating to the filing of tax returns)\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside my own \namendment in order to offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2529.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 115, line 23, strike all through page 117, line 20, \n     and insert the following:\n       ``(iv) copies of all payment advices or other evidence of \n     payment, if any, received by the debtor from any employer of \n     the debtor in the period 60 days before the filing of the \n     petition;\n       ``(v) a statement of the amount of projected monthly net \n     income, itemized to show how the amount is calculated; and\n       ``(vi) a statement disclosing any reasonably anticipated \n     increase in income or expenditures over the 12-month period \n     following the date of filing''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d)(1) At any time, a creditor, in the case of an \n     individual under chapter 7 or 13, may file with the court \n     notice that the creditor requests the petition, schedules, \n     and a statement of affairs filed by the debtor in the case \n     and the court shall make those documents available to the \n     creditor who request those documents.\n       ``(2)(A) At any time, a creditor in a case under chapter 13 \n     may file with the court notice that the creditor requests the \n     plan filed by the debtor in the case.\n       ``(B) The court shall make such plan available to the \n     creditor who request such plan--\n       ``(i) at a reasonable cost; and\n       ``(ii) not later than 5 days after such request.\n       ``(e) An individual debtor in a case under chapter 7 or 13 \n     shall file with the court at the request of any party in \n     interest--\n       ``(1) at the time filed with the taxing authority, all tax \n     returns required under applicable law, including any \n     schedules or attachments, with respect to the period from the \n     commencement of the case until such time as the case is \n     closed;\n       ``(2) at the time filed with the taxing authority, all tax \n     returns required under applicable law, including any \n     schedules or attachments, that were not filed with the taxing \n     authority when the schedules under subsection (a)(1) were \n     filed with respect to the period that is 3 years before the \n     order of relief;\n       ``(3) any amendments to any of the tax returns, including \n     schedules or attachments, described in paragraph (1) or (2); \n     and''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to make this \nbill more workable in the real world and to save the taxpayers of this \ncountry $24 million over the next five years.\n  This bankruptcy bill now requires filing of millions of copies of \npersonal income tax returns. Section 315(b) of the bill requires \ndebtors to file with the court copies of their tax returns for the \nthree years preceding their bankruptcy filings as well as tax returns \nfiled while the bankruptcy was pending.\n  If this requirement was in effect last year, the 1.4 million \nAmericans who filed for bankruptcy would have produced at least 4.2 \nmillion copies of their tax returns. More than 4 million copies of tax \nreturns would produce mountains of paperwork and clog the files of \nmost, if not all, bankruptcy courts across the country.\n  Where are the bankruptcy courts going to put these millions of copies \nof tax returns? And why do the courts need to keep them? Good questions \nthat the sponsors of this bill have not answered.\n  Most bankruptcy filers have no assets and little income so there is \nno reason to review their tax returns. These debtors have no ability to \nrepay their debts and their creditors know it. This blanket requirement \nto file tax returns for the last three years for all debtors, \nregardless of the debtor's assets or income, fails to make any common \nsense. It is simply silly.\n  Moreover, this blanket requirement to file tax returns ignores the \nreality that many debtors, just like other citizens, may not have \naccess to their tax returns for the past three years.\n  For example, a recently divorced mother of two children may not have \ncopies of her past tax returns if the couple's tax returns are kept by \nher former husband. Or a debtor, just like other citizens, may not have \ncopies of past records such as tax returns. In either case, the debtor \nwould have to contact the Internal Revenue Service to request copies of \npast tax returns before being able to seek bankruptcy relief.\n  Depending on the quick service of the IRS is not reassuring to an \nhonest debtor who may honestly need bankruptcy relief. This mandate to \nkeep copies of tax returns for the past three years is unnecessary and \nunrealistic.\n  Indeed, this burdensome and unworkable mandate is opposed by the \nConsumer Bankruptcy Legislative Group, Department of Justice, \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, Judicial Conference, and \nNational Bankruptcy Conference. Bankruptcy judges, creditor and debtor \nattorneys and other practitioners know this mandate will not work in \nthe real world.\n  The Leahy amendment strikes this section of S. 625 and replaces it \nwith the option that any party in interest may request and get a copy \nof a debtor's tax return after the bankruptcy filing.\n  Under the Leahy amendment, a creditor, judge or trustee may force a \ndebtor to file copies of tax returns if the facts of the case warrant \nit by simply asking for the returns. In most cases, a\n\n[[Page S14076]]\n\nparty in interest will not want to review tax returns if a debtor has \nno assets or little income. But if a creditor, judge or trustee does \nwant to copies of the tax returns then they simply request it under my \namendment and the debtor must furnish past and current tax returns.\n  This is a common sense approach to verifying debtor income and assets \nwhen a creditor, judge or trustee wants verification. The current \nblanket requirement for all debtors to file copies of their tax returns \nfor the past three years will waste millions of taxpayer dollars.\n  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost \n$34 million over the next five years to store and provide access to \nmore than 20 million tax returns. Some experts predict it will take up \n20 miles of shelf space to store all these tax returns.\n  The Leahy amendment saves $24 million over the next five years by \nstriking this mandatory tax return filing requirement, according to \nCBO.\n  There are better ways to verify debtor income and assets that are \nworkable, efficient and save taxpayer dollars. Under current law, U.S. \nTrustees and private trustees may review a debtor's tax returns if the \nfacts of the case warrant it.\n  In addition, the Leahy amendment permits any party in interest to \nrequest a debtor to file copies of his or her past and current tax \nreturns. The party in interest does not have to a hearing or even give \na reason for wanting the tax returns.\n  But in the real world, a creditor or trustee will only want to see \nthe tax returns of a debtor in a few cases--cases where there are \nactual questions about the debtor's assets or income. This targeted \napproach will save millions of taxpayer dollars and save the courts \nfrom filing millions of pages of unnecessary paperwork.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy amendment to save U.S. \ntaxpayers $24 million and make this bill far more workable in the real \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I understand we now have eight amendments pending. I \nnote the latest one is a Leahy amendment. I see my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama on the floor. If somebody else wants to bring up \nanother amendment, I have no objection to mine being set aside so they \ncould do it. I am just trying to get these on the calendar, as the \nSenator knows and as Senator Torricelli and Senator Hatch and others \nhave earlier today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member \nfor his comments. I have enjoyed working with him on moving this bill.\n  I thought I would mention a couple of things that are particularly \nvaluable in the bill that may not be that clearly understood by most \npeople.\n  I had the privilege of offering a credit counseling amendment early \non in this process a year and a half ago. I offered that after having \nspent almost an entire day at a nonprofit credit counseling agency in \nmy hometown of Mobile, AL. I was extraordinarily impressed with what \nthey do.\n  They have individuals who come to them in financial trouble. They \nhave a rule: They bring in the entire family. They sit down in a nice \nconference room, and they go over all the debts that are owed and the \nincome that is coming in. They sit down and see if they can't help that \nfamily work their way out of the debt in which they find themselves. \nThey have established over the years respect with financial \ninstitutions, such as credit card companies and banks. Those \ninstitutions will frequently reduce the amount of money they demand \nthat is owed. They will reduce the interest rate that may be paid, if \nthis person will make a good-faith effort to reorganize their finances \nand pay what they can pay on the debt.\n  This is working all over America. In fact, there are credit \ncounseling agencies in virtually every town and city in the Nation. \nThey are serving a valuable purpose. They sit down with individuals and \nfind out what is wrong with the family.\n  It may not be known to everyone, but it is well known in professional \ncircles that financial disputes are probably the most common cause of \ndivorce in America. We know many people are in financial trouble \nbecause of alcoholism. Many people are in financial trouble because of \ngambling. Gambling is driving an increase in bankruptcy in a number of \nareas in this country. Some people simply have an inability to \ndiscipline themselves. One member of the family feels as though the \nother one is getting an advantage on them in spending, so they spend \nmore and vice versa. They go on a downward spiral of financial \nmanagement. We have individuals who have mental health problems who are \nsimply not able to be disciplined about their money.\n  Credit counseling is a tremendous thing. They care about the families \nwith whom they are dealing. They help work with them to discover a way \nto work out their problems. It is a good thing.\n  What this bankruptcy bill requires is that someone, before they file \nbankruptcy, at least go and talk to a credit counseling agency, to meet \nwith them and see if that agency may have the ability to solve their \nproblem short of filing bankruptcy.\n  Most people do, in fact, want to pay their debts, and they work hard \nto try to pay their debts. If they are given this kind of option, where \na company will reduce their interest or reduce their debt, they work \nout a payment plan. The family signs onto it, the mother and father, \nson and daughter. They can restore pride and confidence. They can learn \nsomething about how to manage money. They may well receive marital \ncounseling, mental health treatment, Gamblers Anonymous references, or \nother help.\n\n  What happens in bankruptcy today is that somebody is sued for a debt \nthey haven't paid. They don't know what to do. They have seen on the \nTV, or in the newspaper: Call this lawyer if you have debt problems. So \nthey call the lawyer and he sits down and says: The thing for you to do \nis file bankruptcy. There will be a $1,000 fee, and you will wipe out \nall your debts. They will say something like: How am I going to pay \nyou? I don't have $1,000. He will say something like: You won't have to \npay any more payments on your credit card. In fact, go buy everything \nyou can with your credit card because we are going to wipe out all \nthose debts when we file, unless they are short-term debts concurrent \nwith the bankruptcy filing. The lawyer will say: You do that and pay \nme, and we will wipe out everything. That is what you ought to do.\n  The lawyer has a financial incentive there. He spends no time with \nthe family. Oftentimes, they tell me the paralegals and staff people \nfill out all the forms and the paperwork; the lawyer hardly even meets \nthe client. He goes down in court and calls out their name and they \ncome up to him, and he introduces them to the judge. They do the \nbankruptcy and they go home. And nothing has been done about the \nfundamental problem in that family, or the lack of discipline which is \noften the case that causes bankruptcy. Many bankruptcies--a substantial \npercentage --are due to very severe events. But a substantial portion \nare also caused by a gradual descent into debt, and a lack of \ndiscipline, or some sort of emotional or psychological problem.\n  I believe if we can give them the choice to go through credit \ncounseling and work out ways to deal with their debts as a family, we \nwill do something good for this country. How many would choose this? I \ndon't know. But most people who have been sued or are getting credit \ncalls over debts they owe from all kinds of debtors and creditors get \nnervous and don't know what to do. They are told file bankruptcy and \nthat is what they do. They think they have no choice. I believe we can \ndo better than that. This bill will lead us in that direction. I \nbelieve it will be a historic step for this system.\n  We also have people who are filing repeat bankruptcies, people who \nfile bankruptcy again and again. This bill will attempt to reduce that. \nMore than 10 percent of the people who file for bankruptcy have \npreviously filed. In some Federal court districts in America, 40 \npercent of the consumer bankruptcies are repeat filers. They learned \nthe first time it worked, so they do it\n\n[[Page S14077]]\n\nagain. They haven't learned the discipline and effort that it takes to \nmaintain an honest credit rating.\n  So one of the things this act requires is that before a person is \ndischarged from bankruptcy, they will have to have some counseling on \nhow to manage their debt, and perhaps they will not come back again. I \nthink that would be a good thing.\n  We are concerned about fraud in bankruptcy. The forms are basically \nself-proving. They are accepted by the court. Whatever a person says \ntheir income is and their ability to repay is, it is basically accepted \nand rarely verified. We find that is a problem. So they will have to \nfile documents with their bankruptcy file. It will include a Federal \ntax return, monthly income and expenses, their actual wage stubs, how \nmuch money they are actually making, so it will allow a judge to decide \nproperly what the right procedure is under the circumstances. It allows \nthat a person to whom a debt is owed gets notice--a small businessman, \ngarage owner, furniture store, or a doctors office gets a note from the \ncourt that Billy Jones is filing for bankruptcy, and you are notified \nas a creditor. This says you don't have to have a lawyer, but you can, \nin fact, go on your own and defend your interests in the bankruptcy \ncourt. You may need a lawyer, in which case you can hire a lawyer. But \nit will clearly make it known that creditors who have clearly proven \ndebt can go down to the bankruptcy court and establish that debt and \ndefend their interest, without having to spend more money on an \nattorney than perhaps the debt is worth. I think that would be good.\n\n  We are dealing with a huge increase in personal bankruptcies--1.4 \nmillion, a 94-percent increase, since 1990. In many States in this \ncountry, in many Federal bankruptcy districts, many people are filing \nunder chapter 13. When you file under chapter 13, what you do is you go \nto court and you say: I owe all this money, judge. I have this much \nincome and I would like to work my way out of it. These people are \nsuing me. I am getting phone calls at home. I want you to have a stay, \nto stop them all from suing me. Take my money and tell me who to pay \nand I will pay my money, every bit I can, to pay off these debts.\n  That is a preferable way, in my opinion, for a person to deal with \nfinancial difficulties, if they can't pay their bills. Some people are \nso far in debt that it will be hopeless; straight bankruptcy chapter 7 \nis for them.\n  Under the present state of the law, amazing though it might be, there \nis no standard on that. The debtor himself can choose whether to go \ninto chapter 13 or chapter 7. He can choose whether or not to pay off \nhis debts. In Alabama, I am proud to say, in the northern district of \nAlabama, over 60 percent of the individual filers choose to file \nchapter 13 and repay a large portion of their debt. That is something I \nthink reflects well on the people of the northern district of Alabama. \nThe numbers are high in the other districts in Alabama--over 50 \npercent, choose Chapter 13. But we know in certain other districts in \nthis country, the number of people filing chapter 13 is under 10 \npercent. Many of these people have high incomes and could, in fact, \neasily pay off all or part of their debt.\n  So that is why we have said in this legislation that if your income \nis above the median income, which for a family of two is $40,000, and \nfor a family of four, over $50,000--if you are making above the median \nincome, then you ought to be considered by the judge for repayment of \nas much of your debt as you can under the chapter 13 bankruptcy. So for \nthe first time we will have a realistic way for a judge to objectively \nanalyze these debtors, to see if they can pay back some of their debts.\n  That is why Senator Hatch says the average bankruptcy costs the \naverage family $400 per year. When people don't pay their debts, \nsomebody else has to pay them. It drives up the cost of business, the \ninterest rates at the bank, and it drives up the charges the furniture \nstore is going to make, or that the doctor office has to charge, to \ncome out ahead if people are not paying their debts. It is that simple.\n  Paying your debt is a big deal. If we ever get to the point in this \ncountry where people don't feel like they have to pay debts back and \nthey can wipe them out whenever they want to, we will have endangered \nthe economic strength and commercial vitality of our Nation. Make no \nmistake about it. Our legal system and our economic system is based on \nhonesty and integrity and responsibility. People pay their taxes based \non their own calculations. They add up the numbers and they write that \ncheck to the Federal Government. That is why taxes ought to be low \nbecause when we ask too much of people they start cheating; they feel \njustified in cheating. We have relatively low taxes compared to other \nnations, and we have the lowest amount of cheating in the world.\n  We are making some important progress with this legislation. It will \nhelp us economically because, as the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nSummers, has said, bankruptcy costs do add to interest rates. Everybody \nwill pay higher interest rates if the bankruptcy filings are up. If \nbankruptcies are down, interest rates can drop. It will be passed on to \nthe consumer. It ultimately always is.\n\n  I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Grassley, who has worked \nso hard on this legislation. He has listened to everybody concerned. He \nhas spent an extraordinary number of hours with the members of the \nDemocratic leadership and members of the committee on both sides of the \naisle. He has worked with them to achieve a bill that is responsive to \nvirtually every complaint that can be thought up.\n  Essentially this same bill passed this body 97 to 1 last year. It \npassed the House with over 300 votes. Why we couldn't get it finally \npassed last time is beyond my comprehension. It was nothing more than a \nbunch of obstructive tactics. I can't accept the complaint and refuse \nto accept the argument that women and children are somehow being abused \nunder this act when every objective analysis would indicate that we are \nmaking a historic move toward providing the greater protection that has \never been provided to alimony and child support payments. That is \nabsolutely false. Why people tend to want to attack this bill to delay \nits passage and frustrate us in this effort is beyond me.\n  I believe we are eliminating abuses in the system. For example, I \npoint out a landlord who leases an apartment to a tenant; that tenant's \nlease is for 1 year, that year is up, and he owes the landlord money. \nThe landlord seeks to move him out because he is going to rent the \napartment to somebody else. That tenant can file for bankruptcy and \nstay, or stop, any lawsuits for eviction. Months can go by. And the \nlandlord has to hire an attorney to go to bankruptcy court to try to \nget the ``stay'' lifted--that is what they call it--on filing the \neviction notice so they can go forward with it. This bill would say if \nyour lease is up, you can continue with your case. Eventually the \nlandlord always wins, but often it takes months to get a final hearing, \nand it will cost him a good deal of money and attorney's fees.\n  There are many abuses such as this in the system. Those kinds of \nthings ought to be eliminated.\n  We have had the experience of the existing system since 1978. We have \nnot given it the kind of overhaul it needs. We have completed that now. \nI am proud of this legislation. I know that Senator Hatch, who chairs \nthe Judiciary Committee and has worked extraordinarily hard on it, also \nshares that view.\n  I am also pleased to have the support and leadership of Senator \nTorricelli and the ranking member of the subcommittee. He has worked \nhard for this bill. He understands the economics behind it. He \nunderstands that this is going to help those who are in need and at the \nsame time is not going to allow abuses to occur in the system.\n  We are at a good point. I think we are going to have a vote next \nweek. I am confident that once again we will have an overwhelming vote \nfor this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14077-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14077-S14078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I have sent a letter to the majority \nleader requesting that I be consulted on certain nominations. I am \nasking to be consulted on the nominations of Anthony Harrington to be \nUnited States Ambassador to Brazil, Calendar No. 364, and for Charles \nManatt to be United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, \nCalendar No. 361. Further, I ask to be consulted on all the promotion \nlists for career State Department foreign service officers.\n  I take this step reluctantly but believe it is necessary. The \nadministration is required by law to submit to Congress on 1 November \nevery year the so-called Majors' List, the list of major drug producing \nand trafficking countries that the President intends to certify on 1 \nMarch of the following year. The administration has never met this \ndeadline, despite the fact that Congress extended it several years ago \nfrom 1 October to 1 November in order to give the administration more \ntime in which to meet the requirement. Last year the list was over a \nmonth late. Despite repeated messages that this deliberate flouting of \nthe law was not acceptable, the administration has again failed to \nsubmit the list or to offer any explanations. The list has yet to leave \nthe State Department and must still wait for the laborious interagency \nreview process. There is every likelihood that the list will be \nsignificantly late again this year.\n  With this as background, I have asked to be consulted on any \nunanimous-consent requests involving consideration of the nominations I \nhave indicated until such time as the administration complies with the \nlaw.

Mr. President, yesterday the Armed Services Committee \nreceived testimony from recently-retired German General Klaus Naumann, \nthe former Chairman of NATO's Military Committee. In that capacity, \nGeneral Naumann was NATO's highest ranking military officer and headed \nthe NATO organization which consists of the Chiefs of Defense, i.e. the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Hugh Shelton and his \ncounterparts, of all 19 NATO countries and to which NATO's Supreme \nAllied Commander, Europe, General Wesley Clark, and Supreme Allied \nCommander, Atlantic, Admiral Harold Gehman, report.\n  The topic for the hearing was lessons learned from NATO's Operation \nAllied Force, the air campaign against the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of General \nNaumann's opening statement be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. I hope that my colleagues will read General Naumann's \nthoughtful, straight-forward, and insightful statement. But, I want to \nhighlight a few of General Naumann's conclusions--conclusions with \nwhich I agree and whose implications I believe merit careful \nconsideration by us all.\n  First and most importantly, General Naumann concluded that ``it was \nthe cohesion of our 19 nations which brought about success.'' In the \ncourse of the hearing, he pointed out that this cohesion was maintained \ndespite the fact that, for example, polls indicated that some 95 \npercent of Greek citizens opposed the operation.\n  General Naumann also concluded that ``it will be virtually impossible \nto use the devastating power of modern military forces in coalition \noperations to the fullest extent'' but that this disadvantage ``is \npartly compensated by the much stronger political impact a coalition \noperation has as compared to the operation of a single nation.'' In \nthat regard, I asked General Naumann for his reaction to a lesson that, \nI believe, applies. The lesson is not that we ought to use less than \ndecisive force but that if that is not an option, then the judgment \nthat must be made is whether or not the risk in utilizing what I call \n``maximum achievable force,'' i.e. the maximum force that is \npolitically achievable and which is less than decisive force, whether \nthe risk involved outweighs the value of proceeding. General Naumann, \nas General Clark did in a prior hearing, agreed that it was a lesson \nlearned from NATO's air campaign and that the question or balancing \ntest that I posed was the proper one.\n  General Naumann had a number of other lessons and sage advice for us, \nsuch as that the United States should fully support the European \nSecurity and Defense Identity (ESDI) within the Alliance and that ESDI \ncan strengthen the transatlantic link. Once again, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to read General Naumann's statement.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nStatement of General (ret) Klaus Naumann, German Army, Former Chairman \n                                NATO, MC\n\n(Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Kosovo After-Action Review, \n                           November 3, 1999)\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Senator Levin, Distinguished Senators, it is \n     my honour and indeed a privilege to testify in the Senate \n     Armed Forces Committee on the lessons learnt from Kosovo. I \n     would like to congratulate you, Mr. Chairman, and your \n     colleagues on your effort to review the operation. I feel \n     this is wise and farsighted since the next crisis will come, \n     for sure, although I am unable to predict when and where.\n       I will discuss first the lessons learnt during the crisis \n     management phase, then the air campaign until the day on \n     which I left NATO, i.e., May 6, 1999 and end with a few \n     conclusions.\n       With your indulgence I would like to start with a brief \n     remark on the Military Committee (MC) which seems to be a \n     largely unknown animal in the United States of America.\n       The MC consists of the Chiefs of Defense (CHOD) of all NATO \n     countries and an Icelandic Representative of equivalent rank. \n     The Strategic Commanders (SC), i.e. SACEUR and SACLANT, \n     participate in the MC meetings. The meetings are chaired by \n     an elected chairman who has served as CHOD of a NATO country \n     and who is NATO's highest ranking military officer.\n       The MC meets three times a year and in its permanent \n     session in which the CHODs/Commanders are represented by a \n     permanent representative of three or two star rank once a \n     week as a minimum. SACEUR and SACLANT report to the MC and \n     through it to the Secretary General and the North Atlantic \n     Council (NAC).\n       The MC is the source of ultimate military advice for the \n     NAC and it has to translate the Council's guidance into \n     strategic directives for the two SCs.\n       The MC played a crucial role during the Kosovo Crisis in \n     keeping the NATO nations together. It was in the MC where the \n     OPLANs were discussed and finalized in such a way that a \n     smooth passage in the NAC was guaranteed and during the war \n     the MC acted as the filter which helped to stay clear of \n     micromanagement of military operations. It is my firm belief \n     that this helped to avoid potentially divisive debates and it \n     allowed SACEUR to concentrate on his superbly executed task \n     to conduct the operation.\n       The Kosovo War itself deserves careful analysis for a \n     couple of reasons.\n       It was after all the first coalition war fought in Europe \n     in the information age, fought and won by a coalition of 19 \n     democratic nations who did neither have a clearly defined \n     common interest in Kosovo nor did they perceive the events in \n     Kosovo as a clear and present danger to anyone of them. They \n     fought eventually for a principle that is dear to all of \n     them, the principles that Human Rights ought to be respected. \n     They thus demonstrated that this is more important for them \n     than the principle of territorial integrity which has \n     governed International Law since the Westphalian Peace of \n     1648. This coalition fought without a clear cut mandate by \n     the UNSC in a situation which was not a case of self defense \n     and it stayed together and on course throughout the 78 days \n     of the air campaign. It was the first war ever which at the \n     first glance was brought to an end by the use of airpower \n     alone. But it would be premature and indeed wrong to conclude \n     from that that future conflicts could be fought and won from \n     the distance by the use of airpower. One could say that \n     only if we had clear evidence that it were the results of \n     the campaign which made Milosevic eventually blink. That, \n     however cannot be said by anyone on our side.\n       In my view the war proved once again the seasoned \n     experience that we military will do best if we plan and fight \n     joint operations and that it would be a deadly illusion to \n     believe that the Revolution in Military Affairs will allow us \n     to fight a war without any casualties.\n       What lessons did we learn during the Crisis Management \n     Phase of the conflict?\n       Allow me to start with the rather straightforward statement \n     that we could have done better in crisis management since we \n     simply did not achieve what has to remain the ultimate \n     objective of crisis management, namely to avoid an armed \n     conflict. I do not know whether we ever had a fair chance to \n     achieve it since Milosevic wanted to solve the\n\n[[Page S14079]]\n\n     Kosovo problem once and for all in spring 1999. He saw \n     presumably no alternative but force and violence after the \n     Kosovars took advantage of the Serb withdrawal which General \n     Clark and I had negotiated on October 25, 1998. Nobody knows \n     when he took his decision but I have reasons to believe that \n     it was in November 1998 and it was most probably a decision \n     to not only annihilate the KLA but also to expell the bulk of \n     the Kosovars in order to restore an ethnic superiority of the \n     Serbs. One point has to be made with utmost clarity in order \n     to destroy one of the myths the Serbs are about to create: It \n     was not NATO's air campaign which started the expulsion of \n     the Kosovars. It began well before the first bomb was dropped \n     and it might have been the result of a carefully premeditated \n     plan.\n       NATO began to be seized with the situation in Kosovo in \n     early 1998. Again the background of the fighting in Kosovo in \n     spring 1998 NATO ministers expressed their concern at their \n     meetings in Luxembourg and Brussels and began to threaten the \n     use of force in an attempt to stop violence and to bring the \n     two sides to the negotiation table. NATO Defense Ministers \n     decided in June to underpin that threat by a demonstrative \n     air exercise although the NATO military had advised ministers \n     that NATO as such was not ready to act and that any use of \n     military instruments made only sense if there were the \n     preparedness to see it through and to escalate if necessary.\n       Milosevic who was never unaware of NATO deliberations \n     rightly concluded that the NATO threat was a bluff at this \n     time and finished his summer offensive which led to a clear \n     defeat of the KLA. My first lesson learnt for future crisis \n     management is therefore that one should not threaten the use \n     of force if one is not ready to act the next day. To achieve \n     this is difficult in a coalition in which the slowest ship \n     determines the speed of the convoy.\n       The responsibility for crisis management did not rest with \n     NATO throughout the crisis. NATO began but then the US took \n     the lead and introduced Ambassador Holbrook to be followed by \n     the OSCE and eventually the Contact Group. When the Contact \n     Group, not surprisingly, failed at Rambouillet and Paris NATO \n     was given back the baton but there was no peaceful solution \n     left. My second lesson learnt is that one should never change \n     horses midstream in crisis management. Whenever possible the \n     responsibility should remain in one hand, preferably in the \n     hands of those who have the means to act. As a minimum one \n     has to make sure that those who have the lead in crisis \n     management efforts of a coalition share the objectives the \n     coalition is committed to.\n       Another time seasoned experience gained during our \n     successful efforts to prevent a war during the days of the \n     Cold War is that one of the keys to success is to preserve \n     uncertainty in our opponent's mind on the consequences he \n     might face in the case of his rejection of peaceful \n     solutions. NATO nations did not pay heed to that experience \n     during the Kosovo Crisis. It became most obvious when NATO \n     began to prepare for military options but some NATO nations \n     began to rule out simultaneously options such as the use of \n     ground forces and did so, without any need, in public. This \n     allowed Milosevic to calculate his risk and to speculate that \n     there might be a chance for him to ride the threat out and to \n     hope that NATO would either be unable to act at all or that \n     the cohesion of the Alliance would melt away under the public \n     impression of punishing airstrikes. My third lesson learnt is \n     therefore that we need to preserve uncertainty as one of the \n     most powerful instruments of crisis management which does not \n     mean to agree to an escalation ladder without limits and \n     without rigid political control but which means not to speak \n     in public about these limits. To keep publicly all options \n     under consideration and to allow the military to go ahead \n     with planning for joint operations would allow for \n     uncertainty without the hands of politicians being tied.\n       During the air campaign we had to learn some lessons as \n     well.\n       First we learnt that even a tiny ambiguity in the \n     formulation of political objectives could have adverse \n     effects on military operations.\n       The OPLANs for Operation Allied Force had been developed in \n     fall 1998. Both ingredients, the Limited Air Response and the \n     Phased Air Operation had been designed to meet the objective \n     to bring Milosevic back to the negotiation table. When we \n     began the air strikes, however, we faced an opponent who had \n     accepted war whereas the NATO nations had accepted an \n     operation. Consequently it seems advisable to set a political \n     objective such as ``To impose our will on the opponent and to \n     force him to comply with our political demands''. This would \n     allow, first, to use all the elements of power not just the \n     military means to secure our objectives and, secondly, to \n     move as rapidly as possible to the decisive use of force \n     within the political constraints which drive a coalition war.\n       Translated into military operations this would not change \n     phases 0 and 1 of Operation Allied Force but it would lead to \n     a phase 2 which focuses more and earlier on those targets \n     which hurt a ruler such as Milosevic and which constitute the \n     pillars on which his power rests, namely the police, the \n     state controlled media and those industries whose barons \n     provide the money which allows Milosevic to stay in power.\n       Secondly, we had to learn how to conduct coalition \n     operations which is of particular interest since most if not \n     all of our future operations will most likely be coalition \n     operations. Coalition operations mean to accept that the pace \n     and the intensity of military operations will be determined \n     by the lowest common denominator and that there will be \n     restrictions due to differing national legislation which \n     could affect air operations in particular. Consequently it \n     will be virtually impossible to use the devastating power of \n     modern military forces in coalition operations to the fullest \n     extent. This is a lasting disadvantage which is on the other \n     hand partly compensated by the much stronger political impact \n     a coalition operation has as compared to the operation of an \n     individual nation.\n       Looking at Operation Allied Force it is fair to say that \n     the politicians of all NATO nations met most of our military \n     demands and most of them did not embark on micromanagement of \n     military operations. In this context I have to state that the \n     NAC never imposed a limitation which ruled out to bomb any \n     target in Montenegro. On the contrary, the NAC explicitly \n     accepted that we could strike targets on Montenegrin soil if \n     they posed a risk to our forces. I also have to say that the \n     gradualism of the air campaign was much more caused by the \n     political objective which soon saw revision against the \n     background of the dynamically unfolding situation than it was \n     influenced by politically motivated interference.\n       My lesson learnt from that is that coalition operations \n     will by definition see some gradualism and possibly some \n     delays in striking sensitive targets. The likelihood that \n     this could happen will be the more restricted the clearer the \n     political objectives will be formulated. Coalition operations \n     do, however, not mean that nations can block or veto any \n     operation which is conducted in execution of a NAC approved \n     and authorized Oplan. The only option open to a nation in \n     such a case is to instruct its national contingent not to \n     participate in the respective activity unless the nation \n     would wish to formally withdraw its agreement to the Oplan. \n     It is also noteworthy to state in this context that there are \n     no NATO procedures which could be called a red card rule.\n       Kosovo taught also and again that NATO's force structure is \n     in contrast to NATO's Integrated Command Structure no longer \n     flexible and responsive enough to react quickly and \n     decisively to unforeseen events. That we saw when Milosevic \n     accelerated his expulsion of the Kosovars in an obvious \n     attempt to counter NATO in an assymetric response and to \n     deprive NATO of its theoretical launching pad for ground \n     forces operations through a destabilization of FYROM and \n     Albania. Luckily we still had the Extraction Force in FYROM \n     and were thus able to react immediately. Without it, it would \n     have taken NATO weeks to deploy and assemble an appropriate \n     force. The lesson learnt is that we have increasingly to be \n     prepared for assymetric response, the more so the stronger \n     and hence invincible NATO is. To cope with these threats will \n     be necessary and hence it is critical for NATO's future \n     successes to enhance mobility, flexibility and deployability \n     of its forces which are inadequate at this time.\n       The NATO Summit drew the right conclusion and agreed the \n     DCI and the European allies did the same when they decided in \n     Cologne that the EU has to improve defense. My next lesson \n     learnt is that there is a totally unacceptable imbalance \n     of military capabilities between the US and its allies, \n     notably the Europeans. With no corrective action taken as \n     a matter of urgency there will be increasing difficulties \n     to ensure interoperability of allied forces and \n     operational security could be compromised. Moreover, it \n     cannot be tolerated that one ally has to carry on an \n     average some 70%, in some areas to 95% of the burden. This \n     imbalance needs to be redressed and therefore ESDI which \n     is after all an attempt to improve European efforts within \n     NATO deserves the full support of the US and should be \n     used to encourage those allies who are reluctant to \n     implement to live up to their commitments.\n       What conclusions can be drawn? (1) The integrated Command \n     Structure worked well. What needs to be improved are \n     procedures to achieve unity of command to be exercised by \n     NATO there where parallel existing national and NATO command \n     arrangements are unavoidable. (2) There is a need to think \n     through how crisis management can be improved. Simulation \n     technics may be a helpful tool to be considered. (3) There is \n     an urgent need to close the two gaps which exist today \n     between the US and the European/Canadian allies. The \n     technological gap in the field of C 41 and the capability gap \n     caused by the lack of investment in modern equipment. The DCI \n     is designed to provide some remedy. It should be speedily \n     implemented and the European/Canadian allies should be \n     strongly encouraged to take appropriate action. (4) There is \n     a need to study how NATO can perform better in the field of \n     Information Operations to include better information of the \n     public both in NATO countries and in the adversary's country. \n     (5) Most importantly, it can and it should be said that \n     Operation Allied Force was a success since it contributed \n     substantially to achieve the political aims set by the \n     Washington Summit.\n       It would be desirable that NATO stated simultaneously that \n     the Alliance will act again should the necessity arise. To do \n     so could help to deter potential opponents and could possibly \n     restrain the one or the other ruler in this world to seek \n     protection against\n\n[[Page S14080]]\n\n     intervention through increased efforts to acquire weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       I would be remiss did I not close by commending the \n     commanders from SACEUR down the chain of command, our forces \n     in the theatre and those back home who supported them so \n     splendidly. They all performed extremely well and you have \n     every reason to be proud of them and your great nation's \n     contribution.\n       Allow me to close by saying that I was proud to serve this \n     unique Alliance as the Chairman of the Military Committee in \n     such a crucial time and I felt privileged to serve with a man \n     whose superb contribution was crucial for our common success, \n     Javier Solana. This brings me to my final point which we \n     should never forget: It was the cohesion of our 19 nations \n     which brought about success.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague for his \nremarks on the bankruptcy bill.\n  I think one thing--while it is not necessarily appropriate to \nrecognize on the bankruptcy bill--we should recognize is the inability \nof our Federal Government to honor the sanctity of contractual \ncommitments. I can think offhand of the agreement that was made by the \nFederal Government some two decades ago to take the high-level nuclear \nwaste by the year 1998. The ratepayers paid something in the area of \n$15 billion into that fund for the Federal Government to meet its \ncontractual obligation. The pending lawsuits are somewhere between $40 \nbillion and $80 billion. Obviously, the Federal Government doesn't set \na very good example.\n  This is not necessarily apropos to bankruptcy, but it is apropos to \nthe theory that we pay our bills, that we honor the sanctity of our \ncontracts.

Mr. President, with the recent passage of a Senate \nFinance Committee trade package aimed at liberalizing trade with \nAfrican and Caribbean countries, and providing Trade Adjustment \nAssistance for American workers who need help transitioning into \ndifferent jobs, I thought it an appropriate time to come to the floor \nof the Senate to discuss the insidious propaganda campaign the Clinton \nAdministration is orchestrating over the phoney charges of \n``isolationism'' he has leveled at Congress.\n  In some ways, I am reluctant to get into this name-calling argument. \nAs I told my six children as they faced the normal school yard taunts, \nyou shouldn't dignify the name caller with a response. Something like \nthe old adage, ``Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will \nnever hurt me.''\n  The difference between Washington and the school yard, however, is \nthat it seems that if you repeat a lie long enough, and in enough \nplaces, the media will parrot it out to the country and around the \nworld as if it were true. And that is very, very serious for two \nreasons.\n  First, it distorts the political process and deceives the American \npublic. More importantly, it sends a false and dangerous signal to the \nenemies of America that their dream of disengaging America from world \nleadership may, in fact, be happening. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth, but when the President of the United States, and his \nflunkies, says it, terrorists around the world applaud.\n  Certainly there are Republicans, Democrats, Reform Party members and \nindependents who proudly wear the isolationist label, but to try and \nsmear Congress with that label is reprehensible.\n  So I want to look at what actions the Clinton Administration calls \nisolationist, and to separate fact from fiction.\n  Two weeks ago, National Security Advisor Sandy Berger gave a speech \nto the Council on Foreign Relations decrying as ``isolationist'' and \n``defeatist'' such actions as the Senate's refusal to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty (``CTBT'') and, as Mr. Berger \ncharacterized it, a Congress ``reluctant to support the Climate Change \nTreaty.''\n  Mr. President, it should not even pass the straight face test to \nlabel Senators such as Richard Lugar and Chuck Hagel, among others, as \nisolationists just because we voted against a treaty that we did not \nthink would preserve our national security in the years and decades \nahead.\n  Would Sandy Berger have the audacity to call former Secretary of \nState and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Henry Kissinger an isolationist \nbecause he was ``not persuaded that the proposed treaty would inhibit \nnuclear proliferation'' and therefore recommended voting against the \ntreaty?\n  Does Berger's isolationist tag also apply to six former Secretaries \nof Defense--James Schlesinger, Dick Cheney, Frank Carlucci, Caspar \nWeinberger, Donald Rumsfeld and Melvin Laird because they wrote the \nSenate leadership and stated:\n\n       We believe . . . a permanent, zero-yield Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty incompatible with the Nation's international \n     commitments and vital security interests and believe it does \n     not deserve the Senate's advice and consent.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate rejected a flawed treaty; the fault lies \nnot with so-called isolationists in Congress, but with the appeasers \nand former ``nuclear freeze'' people who are now in the Clinton \nAdministration and negotiated this treaty which was not in America's \nnational security interest.\n  As to the Climate Change Treaty, Congress is not reluctant to \nconsider the Treaty. In fact, we have been asking this President to \nsend the Treaty up, but he refuses. And he refuses because 95 Senators \nexpressed the strong sense of the Senate that the Kyoto protocol \ncontain commitments from developing countries to limit or reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Of course, this has not happened. This is not \nan isolationist fear of technological change. This is a realistic \nassessment of how you accomplish your goals.\n  On Monday, USTR Barshefsky also took up the isolationism call. At a \nspeech to the foreign press describing the U.S. agenda for the upcoming \nWTO ministerial meeting in Seattle, Ambassador Barshefsky said that \nisolationists ``at times believe that a growing economy and a clean \nenvironment cannot coexist.''\n  Mr. President, I hope the Ambassador does not mean to imply that \nsimply because Congress has not signed off on loading up trade \nagreements with the baggage of the extreme environmentalist agenda that \nwe are isolationists?\n  In fact, I wonder if this cry of isolationism is not simply to divert \nattention from the failures of this Administration to pursue trade \nopening measures in the face of domestic pressure from Unions?\n  If expanding trade is so important to the President, he could have \nwelcomed the April 8 offer by the Chinese Premier to make extraordinary \nconcessions to bring China into the World Trade Organization.\n  But he did not.\n  If expanding trade is so important to the President, he could have \ndirected his Administration to work with the Finance Committee to craft \na compromise on fast track trade negotiating authority that would \naddress the legitimate concerns of those who do not want to see labor \nand environment slogans used as smoke screens for protectionist \nmeasures.\n  But he did not lift a finger to support fast track for fear of \noffending his protectionist political supporters in organized labor\n  So Mr. President, I don't think President Clinton should have sent \nhis National Security Advisor or his USTR out to falsely label my party \nas the one turning its back on the world.\n  This is not to say that there are not some countries who should \nreceive a cold shoulder rather than a warm embrace. I do not support \naiding and comforting our enemies--like Iraq and North Korea. This is \nnot about a choice between isolationism or engagement. This is about \nwhat form of engagement will bring the desired results.\n\n[[Page S14081]]\n\n  It is in these areas where I think the Administration has a backwards \npolicy--rather than rewarding good behavior, we are rewarding bad \nbehavior.\n  Since 1994 when the U.S. adopted an ``Agreed Framework'' with North \nKorea, here are just some of the acts by North Korea:\n  Launched a three-stage missile last summer, and continues to work on \nand export missiles capable of hitting the United States;\n  Worked on vast underground construction complex--historically used by \nNorth Korea to cover work on military or nuclear installations;\n  Taken actions to hinder work of international inspectors sent to \nmonitor North Korea's nuclear program;\n  Sent submarine filled with commandos to South Korea; and\n  Violated the military armistice agreement by firing on ROK soldiers.\n  Today, the North Korea Advisory Group in the House of Representatives \nreleased a report that found that ``the comprehensive threat posed by \nNorth Korea to our national security has increased since 1994.''\n  What has been the U.S. response?\n  DPRK is now the No. 1 recipient of U.S. assistance in East Asia: $645 \nmillion since 1995 includes providing at least 45% of fuel needs and \nover 80% of food aid; and sending 500,000 tons of oil a year, as well \nas trying to get other countries to come up with the funds for KEDO \n(Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization) and for two light-\nwater reactors.\n  I cannot say for certain that North Korea's government would have \ncollapsed without our help. But I do not think that it will ever fall \nwith two strong American legs holding it up.\n  And how about U.S. policy toward Iraq?\n  The U.S. spent $4.5 billion during the Desert Shield operation. From \nthe end of the war until 1999, U.S. spent $6.9 billion on our ongoing \noperations--including the Desert Fox bombing, enforcing the no-fly \nzone, monitoring the seas, etc. It is estimated that we are spending \n$100 million a month currently to police the Northern and Southern no-\nfly zones. We have dropped over 1,000 bombs on Iraqi radar, air \ndefense, and communications facilities. Occasionally, we've also hit an \noil production facility.\n  But while we are spending all this money to ``keep Saddam in his \nbox'', we are allowing him to rebuild the oil production that funds his \nwar machine.\n  At the end of the war, a multilateral embargo was imposed on all \nIraqi exports, including oil. This embargo was supposed to remain in \nplace until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction \nprograms and undertakes unconditionally never to resume such \nactivities. This has not happened.\n  But we allowed the UN Security Council to implement an ``Oil-for-\nFood'' program that lets Hussein sell $5.2 billion of oil every six \nmonths.\n  In the year preceding Operation Desert Storm, Iraq's export earnings \ntotaled $10.4 billion, with 95% attributed to petroleum exports. Iraq's \nimports during that same year, 1990, totalled only $6.6 billion.\n  The U.N. has lifted the sanction on the only export that matters. \nIraq's oil production now equals production prior to the war (over 2 \nmillion B/D). And now we're going to let Saddam sell even more oil. And \nwe're buying his oil. The U.S. is importing 700,000 barrels a day of \nIraqi crude--almost twice what we import from Kuwait.\n  United Nation's recently announced that Iraq could export $3.04 \nbillion more in oil. This is in addition to the $5.26 billion already \nauthorized for the six-month period.\n  Incredibly, this new resolution, UNSR 1266, was adopted on the same \nday that reports surfaced that nearly 10,000 tons of oil smuggled from \nIraq was seized from five ships in the Persian Gulf in less than a \nthree week period.\n  Again, although I cannot say for certain that some of Iraq's friends \nin the world would not find ways around a total embargo, I do know that \nwithout cutting off Saddam's oil lifeline we still face an emboldened \ndictator.\n  The Administration seeks to defend this oil-for-food program as a \nhumanitarian gesture, but our own State Department pointed out in a \nrecent study that Saddam Hussein is subverting the program to his own \ngain.\n  September 1999 Report by the Department of State finding that \nSaddam's regime was illegally diverting food and other products such as \nbaby milk, baby powder, baby bottles and other nursing materials \nobtained under the oil-for-food program. In one example cited by the \nDepartment of State:\n\n       Baby milk sold to Iraq through the oil-for-food program has \n     been found in markets throughout the gulf, demonstrating that \n     the Iraqi regime is depriving its people of much needed goods \n     in order to make an illicit profit.\n\n  Moreover, the report found that ``the government of Iraq is \nmismanaging the oil-for-food program, either deliberately or through \nmismanagement.''\n  A few weeks ago, Kuwait seized three Iraqi cargo ships illegally \nexporting dates, lentils and jute seed and cloves used in animal feed.\n  But we continue to let money flow into this program. We've even \nallowed Baghdad to use about $900 million of oil revenue to rebuild its \noil industry. Perhaps to make up for the fact that we occasionally bomb \na facility that we know is used for smuggling gas oil?\n  The U.S. State Department Report concluded that:\n\n       Saddam Hussein's regime remains a threat to its people and \n     its neighbors, and has not met its obligations to the UN that \n     would allow the UN to lift sanctions.\n\n  With this conclusion in black and white, why in the world did the \nU.S. vote to lift the ceiling on oil. Oil is Saddam's lifeline? It is \nthe only sanction that matters.\n  Fueling and feeding the enemy is unacceptable to this Senator. \nUnfortunately, I don't have a vote at the UN and this President has \ncontinued to bypass Congress as it pursues appeasement of these two \nrogue regimes.\n  If these actions define this Administration's approach to engagement, \nthen I don't want to get married.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have another statement with which I would like to \nconclude. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I might need a couple of more minutes to finish. I ask \nunanimous consent I may extend my time to a full 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will be responding to some statements \nthat were made during a debate that was held on this floor late last \nweek concerning the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1999, which \nthe leadership attempted to bring before this body. It was objected to \nby the other side.\n  I will take this opportunity to go back and forth between truth and \nfiction regarding this issue, because I think it is important we all \nhave an opportunity to review the facts as opposed to the rhetoric that \nsuggested that some things are risky when, in reality, we have \naddressed that risk through technology or other means. Last week, there \nwas an allegation made that the radiation release standards for the \npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain contained in S. 1287 are \ninconsistent with the range of 2 to 20 millirem suggested by the \nNational Academy of Sciences.\n  In the real world, somebody has to make these judgment calls \nregarding what level of radiation the public will recognize as being \nvalid and protective of their interests. This level should be \ndetermined not by emotion but by sound science. The question is, Who \nhas the sound science?\n  We believe the National Academy of Sciences certainly has that \nscientific expertise to make these judgments. As a consequence, we \nbelieve they should play a role in setting the radiation standard, as \nrequired by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n  What we are going to do here is respond to the myth by reminding my \ncolleagues that the National Academy of Sciences, in fact, did not make \na recommendation for a specific radiation standard nor a range of \nexposure levels. Going back to page 49 of the NAS report, it states:\n\n       We do not directly recommend a level of acceptable risk.\n\n  In fact, the NAS said the appropriate risk level was a decision for \npolicymakers. Congress is the ultimate decisionmaker on policy. S. 1287 \nestablishes the basis for regulations that protect the public health \nand safety and the\n\n[[Page S14082]]\n\nenvironment from radiation releases at repositories.\n  My good friends and colleagues from Nevada will have you believe I \nhave something against the people of Nevada. I do not have a \nconstituency with regard to this issue because in Alaska we do not have \nan operating nuclear plant, therefore we do not have nuclear waste. \nHowever, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I \nhave an obligation and an oversight responsibility to address and \nresolve this issue.\n  The reality is, I am very sensitive to the feelings of the people in \nNevada regarding the waste. But we have to store it somewhere. The \nlogic has always been that the best place to store this waste is in an \narea where we have had 50 years of nuclear testing, out in the desert. \nThat is what we have done in the study of the feasibility of placing a \npermanent repository at Yucca Mountain, where we have expended over $6 \nbillion already.\n  S. 1287 is consistent with existing law, which required the National \nAcademy of Sciences to recommend a standard that protects people in \nNevada. This chart shows the annual radiation doses allowed by various \nregulations. I think it is important to recognize the standard in S. \n1287 is more stringent than required by Nevada law. Nevada has an \nadministrative code, section 459.35, which states that ``the total \neffective minimum dose to any member of the public from any licensed \nand registered operation does not exceed 100 millirems per year.'' S. \n1287 would result in a standard that is only one-quarter of that set by \nNevada itself.\n  To me, this is a responsible approach. I will repeat one more time: \nThis bill will result in a standard that is one-quarter of the standard \nset by Nevada itself. We are certainly sensitive to the demands of \nNevada that health and safety be protected. S. 1287 will ensure that \nreleases of radioactivity from the repository will not result in an \nannual dose to an average member of the population in the vicinity of \nthe site in excess of one-tenth the radioactivity received from natural \nbackground sources by the average U.S. resident.\n  This standard is lower than guidelines recommended by the preeminent \ninternational and national advisory organizations. These organizations \ninclude the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the \ncongressionally chartered National Council of Radiation Protection and \nMeasurement to provide guidance on radiation protection to countries \nworldwide.\n  I have another chart showing sources of radiation exposure. The term \n``millirem'' may not mean much to most people, but let me put this in \nperspective.\n  The standard we have set in S. 1287 will limit a possible exposure of \n25 to 30 millirems per year to the people who might receive the most \nexposure over the next 10,000 years.\n  As this chart shows, we all get 80 millirems a year of extra \nradiation working where? Right in this Capitol Building. Each one of \nus--all the pages, everybody--get 80 millirems a year of extra \nradiation, and it is from the stone in the Capitol which contains \nnaturally reoccurring radiation. Maybe we ought to tear the Capitol \ndown. That is one way to get rid of all extra radiation.\n  After all, we all get more than three times as much radiation above-\nbackground levels in a year as this bill, S. 1287, will allow the \nclosest individual to Yucca Mountain, which is the proposed site of the \npermanent repository. The next chart shows the location of the \npermanent repository. This is the Nevada Test Site. This is the area we \nhave used previously for more than 800 nuclear weapons tests. That is \nwhere we want to store our Nation's nuclear waste.\n  I have another chart that shows other examples, and this is in \ncomparison to the EPA's draft rule which would limit Yucca Mountain to \nexposures, assuming that people in Nevada drink untreated ground water, \nto levels as low as one-tenth of a millirem.\n  This is in violation of existing law. One of my five principles \nreflected in this legislation is that Yucca Mountain rules for \nradiation should be set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, not by \nthe Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Some have asked why. This is the reason why: The 1992 Energy Policy \nAct required the Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations \ngoverning the maximum annual effective dose equivalent to individual \nmembers of the public consistent with the study of the National Academy \nof Sciences. Instead, what EPA did is issue draft regulations that are \ncounter to the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  One has to wonder why. Is it to kill this effort? Some within the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency would like to see the nuclear industry \nin this country go away, die, buried, gone forever. Regardless, we have \nan obligation to recognize that about 20 percent of our power is \ngenerated from nuclear power. We have created significant waste and \nhave an obligation to address it.\n  S. 1287 is consistent with the NRC's proposed regulations for Yucca \nMountain which are consistent with the National Academy of Sciences \nreport. The Environmental Protection Agency continues to push for \nunrealistic, unnecessary, counterproductive standards that have nothing \nto do with protecting the health of Nevadans. Proof of that is they \nwant these standards to equal drinking water standards, as low as one-\ntenth of a millirem for a separate ground water protection standard. \nThe NRC measures radiation exposures to all individuals from all \nsources as required by law, including exposures from drinking water.\n\n  I question whether the Safe Drinking Water Act should be applied to \nground water from this area where we have had 50 years of nuclear \ntesting and over 800 tests. If the water becomes tap water, then \nperhaps the act should apply, but not while the water is still in the \nground.\n  EPA wants to take extreme, strict standards that were designed to \napply to drinking water out of a tap and apply it to water in the \nground whether people drink it or not. What they are saying is you \ncannot achieve the process of getting this site licensed if you set a \nstandard that is unattainable.\n  I am not hung up on standards and who dictates standards, but I am \ncommitted to getting this legislation through, protecting the public, \nand ensuring we have a standard that is achievable based on the best \nscience available. I will not support a standard that the EPA dictates \nthat will simply make the project unachievable at the expense of the \ntaxpayers, who probably have over $15 million already in this process, \nlet alone the expenditure of another $50 million to $80 million for not \nhaving taken the waste.\n  Let me clear up a very important point. The Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission standard fully protects the people in Nevada. Whether the \ndrinking water standard is applied to ground water has nothing to do \nwith how much additional exposure there is from this facility.\n  EPA applied similar regulations to the WIPP in Carlsbad, NM, to the \ntransuranic nuclear waste disposal facility. This is Government waste \nfrom weapons production facilities. WIPP is a Government facility in \nthe salt caverns of Carlsbad, NM.\n  The drinking water standard was not an issue when WIPP was licensed \nby EPA because WIPP is a salt mine and has no potable water around it. \nOne wonders whether EPA thinks all nuclear waste should be disposed of \nin a salt cavern. I am not sure everyone in this body will agree.\n  The National Academy of Sciences did not recommend that the Safe \nDrinking Water Act be applied to ground water. Instead, it addressed \nrequirements necessary to limit the overall risk to individuals as \nrequired by law.\n  Finally, the NAS concluded the decision regarding the acceptable \nlevels of protection at Yucca Mountain is a policy decision. I believe \nit is appropriate that Congress make the decision regarding the level \nof protection and that the NRC set the standard. In short, the \nstatement of the administration position bases its objections on a \ndisregard of both existing law and the reality of the Federal \nGovernment's obligation to take nuclear waste beginning in 1998.\n  There is a question of whether the EPA standard will harm health and \nsafety nationwide. Do not believe the draft EPA regulations are a \nvictimless crime. By ignoring this requirement and insisting on a \nstandard that no repository probably can meet, a standard\n\n[[Page S14083]]\n\nthat provides no additional protection for health and safety to the \npeople in Nevada, EPA and the opponents of Yucca Mountain will harm \nhealth and safety across the country. Why? Because the current storage \nwas not designed for this hazardous waste. It was designed to be \nremoved, because there was a commitment made by the Federal Government \npursuant to a contract beginning in 1998.\n\n  The Federal Government has failed to perform under that contract. As \na consequence, the waste stays where it is. Some of the Governors have \nsaid: Well, we are concerned about this waste staying in our State. And \nif indeed, as this legislation proposes, the Government takes title of \nthe waste site, we are fearful it will stay in our State. I would say \nto our Governors: If this legislation does not pass, it is just where \nit is going to stay. It is going to stay in those States.\n  This chart shows where it is. It is in over 80 sites around the \nUnited States, all over the east coast. The chart shows in brown where \nour commercial reactors are. We have shut down reactors with spent fuel \nshown in the green. That isn't going to move until we get the \nrepository for it. We have military reactors, Navy reactors, and we \nhave the Department of Energy reactors and waste around the country.\n  My point is, this legislation is a mandate to address a problem. It \nmight not be perfect, but if you have a better answer, come on aboard \nand let's try to address our responsibility.\n  In the remaining minutes, let me conclude by reminding you that the \nDepartment of Energy's draft environmental impact statement on Yucca \nMountain concludes that the public would be at a far greater risk of \nlatent cancer if high-level radioactive waste in used fuel were left at \nthe 80 sites around the country.\n  If you are comparing apples to apples, the draft EIS assumes that in \neither case, people completely walk away from the repository and the \non-site storage facilities after 100 years. This is the standard \nassumption of the EISs. For people living near the repository--with \nspent fuel shielded by natural and engineered barriers hundreds of feet \nbelow the ground and hundreds of feet above the water table--the long-\nterm effects are very negligible.\n  The Department of Energy concludes that there would be virtually no \nlatent cancer fatalities--much less than 1--over 10,000 years. On the \nother hand, the consequences of leaving the material at a score of \nsites around the Nation are certainly far greater. And that is where we \nare now.\n  In the absence of institutional controls, on-site storage would lead \nto ``about 3,300 latent cancer fatalities over 10,000 years as storage \nfacilities across the United States degraded and radionuclides from \nspent fuel and high-level radioactive waste reached and contaminated \nthe environment.''\n  The Department of Energy calls the outcome of this ``no action'' \nscenario a ``considerable human health risk.'' High-level nuclear waste \nis in the backyard of our constituents, young and old, across the land. \nIn further presentations, we are going to spell out specifically where \nit is, the street it is on, across from the school, across from the \nchurch.\n  As DOE points out in the environmental impact statement, each year \nthat goes by, our ability to continue storage of nuclear waste at each \nof these sites in a safe and responsible way diminishes. It is \nirresponsible to let this situation continue--literally, a crime \nagainst the future. We cannot let that happen.\n  A myth is: The release standards for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant \nprogram were set at 3 millirems.\n  Reality: The 3-millirem standard did not apply at WIPP. This is the \nSafe Drinking Water Act level which EPA has chosen to apply to ground \nwater. However, WIPP is in a salt dome and contains no potable ground \nwater, so the drinking water standard did not apply.\n  Myth: If you do not pass this bill, the Yucca Mountain will open on \nschedule.\n  The reality is, the antinuclear activists and the Nevada delegation \nare doing everything they possibly can to stop Yucca Mountain from \nopening, including encouraging the EPA to issue a counterproductive and \nimpossible-to-meet standard for radiation.\n\n  Further myth: Nuclear waste storage casks are safe for storage but \nnot for transport. The reality of that is, properly licensed nuclear \nstorage waste casks are safe for both storage and transport. We in the \nUnited States have transported over our highways 2,400 shipments of \nspent nuclear fuel by the nuclear energy industry and others, over the \npast 25 years. This chart shows the network of where it has traveled. \nIt has moved all over the country, up and down the east coast, through \nthe Rocky Mountains, through the Midwest, and up and down the east \ncoast.\n  There have been 2,400 shipments of spent nuclear fuel by the nuclear \nenergy industry and others over 25 years. No fatality, injury, or \nenvironmental damage has ever occurred because of a radioactive cargo. \nIt isn't that we could not have an accident, but we take steps to \nensure that the risk is at a minimum. I suggest we have had an occasion \nwhere we have had a truck break down but the casks have performed as \ndesigned; they have not broken up. The nuclear disasters the Nevada \nSenators have promised would happen simply have not happened. \nTechnology is the answer. Technology is available for safe \ntransportation, and it is already paid for.\n  We look at Europe. They are moving high-level radioactivity from \ntheir nuclear plants by ship, by railroad, as well as highways.\n  Senate bill 1287 provides the authorization to coordinate a \nsystematic, safe transportation network to move spent fuel to a storage \nfacility.\n  A further myth: Leaving the spent fuel where it is only costs $5 \nmillion per site.\n  Reality: At a hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the NRC Chairman testified that the startup costs of \nbuilding a dry cask storage facility at a reactor would be $6 million, \nplus $1.5 million per year for new casks and operation, plus $5 million \nper year for maintenance after the reactor is shut down.\n  But the real question is, What will it cost the taxpayer? The DOE has \ncollected, as I have previously indicated, over $15 billion from the \nratepayers, the people who pay their electric bills, under a binding \ncontract to move the spent nuclear fuel. The Federal Government did not \nmeet that binding contractual term to take it beginning in 1998. \nDamages, I have indicated, for nonperformance of that contract have \nbeen estimated between $40 and $80 billion. The Government is ignoring \nthe sanctity of its contract. That amounts to $1,300 per American \nfamily.\n  Here is how the damages break down: The cost of storage of spent \nnuclear fuel, $19 billion; return of nuclear waste fees, $8.5 billion; \ninterest on nuclear waste fees, $15 to $27 billion; consequential \ndamages for shutdown of 25 percent of the nuclear plants due to \ninsufficient storage--power replacement cost--$24 billion.\n  Well, this is billions upon billions.\n  If regulators prohibit additional on-site storage, utilities may be \nforced to close plants and buy replacement power at an average cost of \n$250,000 to $300,000 per day for a typical reactor.\n  Finally, let me conclude by exposing the ultimate myth. That myth is: \n80 nuclear storage waste sites are safer than 1 centralized storage \nsite at the Nevada Test Site, a site so remote that it has been used to \nexplode nuclear devices for 50 years.\n  Let's put the picture of the Nevada Test Site up one more time. The \nreality of this is simple, really. Why should we leave spent nuclear \nfuel at nuclear powerplants in 34 States when there is a less costly \nstorage method with an increased magnitude of safety?\n  The picture shows, the proposed site of where we will put it, the one \nsite. The point is, let's put it in one site where we can monitor it. \nIf we want, we can have an appropriate repository so that if at some \ntime we want to have a retrievable capability, we can do so, as \ntechnology advances.\n\n  DOE's own environmental impact statement calls the outcome of the \n``no action'' scenario a ``considerable human health risk.'' \nTransporting used nuclear fuel to a central storage facility in the \nNevada desert is the only sensible approach.\n  I do not have to remind my colleagues that the Federal Government \nmade a promise and signed contracts with utilities--including those in \nmany of individual Members' States--that it would start disposing of \nspent nuclear fuel in 1998.\n\n[[Page S14084]]\n\n  The evidence is squarely on the side of reaffirming this vital \ncommitment. It makes good sense to consider the Nevada Test Site, an \nisolated, unpopulated, desert location where we used to test nuclear \nbombs. You have seen that on the picture behind me.\n  When you test a nuclear bomb, even underground, radioactivity can and \ndoes escape. It does get into the ground water and sometimes even the \natmosphere. My colleagues from Nevada have supported continued bombing \ntests on the test site but don't support storage of spent nuclear fuel \nin an NRC-licensed and monitored facility. I just don't understand why. \nWhy was the Nevada Test Site good enough to test leaky bombs but \nsuddenly is not good enough for safe and secure spent fuel storage? I \nknow there is a little politics in it. I understand politics. Leaving \nused nuclear fuel at a nuclear plant site defies common sense, makes a \nmockery of Government accountability, reneges on a promise made by the \nGovernment, and is extremely costly to the taxpayer.\n\n  Spent fuel pools at reactor sites were never intended to be used for \nlong-term storage. As you remember, a few years ago, radioactive \ntritium gas leaked into Suffolk County, Long Island, ground water from \nthe spent nuclear fuel storage at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In \nresponse, the Department of Energy removed the spent fuel and shipped \nit for storage to another DOE site. All we are asking is that DOE \nperform the same task which it is legally obligated to perform for \ncivilian nuclear reactors.\n  Without a Federal spent fuel storage facility or an additional on-\nsite temporary storage, which many opponents of this bill also actively \noppose, some utilities will be forced to close plants down prematurely. \nIn fact, 26 reactors will exhaust existing storage capacity in the next \ncouple of years. To understand the calamity this would bring about, \nconsider what would happen if you started chipping away at 20 percent \nof this Nation's electric supply or what the skies would look like if \nthis base load capacity were replaced by fossil-fuel-burning plants of \nthe older technology. As some of you are aware, the temporary shutdown \nof nuclear plants in the Northeast and Midwest had authorities planning \nfor rolling blackouts during the hottest days this last summer.\n  The Senate must pass Senate bill 1287 and start developing the \nintegrated spent fuel management programs that Congress has mandated \nand engineers and scientists have thoroughly designed safe technology \nfor storage and for transportation of spent fuel, and for which \nelectricity consumers in this country have paid. The Federal Government \nhas promised it would dispose of this waste. It is now time for the \nFederal Government to stand up and be counted and do its job. S. 1287 \nis the solution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The distinguished Senator from Alaska indicated that we \nhave already spent $6 billion on this facility in Yucca Mountain?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct. We've actually spent a little \nbit more than that. We have the tunnel basically done. The facility is \ndesigned to be a permanent repository for this high-level waste.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. They are not just going to lay it out on the ground. \nThere is a tunnel into the ground in the desert out there?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct. It is the intention to put the waste \nin casks, and the scientific community is going to have to certify that \nthis waste will withstand whatever conditions that there might be for \n10,000 years.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It will be inside casks and then inside a concrete \ntunnel?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The Senator is correct; concrete and rock.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Do any people live right around there? Are people going \nto be living next to this facility?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, there won't be anybody living next to the \nfacility. Forty-some-odd miles away is the nearest living soul to that \nparticular area. Las Vegas is, of course, over the mountains.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Forty miles is a long way. I notice your chart showed \nthat if you stood 6 feet from a trainload of this waste that was being \nsent out there, you would get about one-tenth as much exposure as we \nget here in the Senate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That appears to be the case, because of the stone with \nwhich the building was built.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It strikes me, if you were 40 miles away, you wouldn't \nget the little 5-millirem exposure. It would be infinitesimal, what \nanybody in Nevada would be exposed to as a result of storing this waste \nin one facility.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate you pointing that out again.\n  As you know from the chart, it does say 80 millirems is the exposure \nwe get here in the Capitol. If you live in a brick house, you get 70 \nmillirems. You get 53 millirems of additional exposure from cosmic \nradiation in Denver, as a result of the higher altitude. The average \nradiation from the ground is 26 millirems. An x ray is 20. A dental x \nray is 14, and you have to write a check for it. A round-trip flight \nfrom New York to Los Angeles is 6. Exposure for a half hour from a \ntransport container to a truck 6 feet away is 5 millirems.\n  It is important that we put these in perspective.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished Senator for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I don't think I have ever seen a \npublic policy issue more bizarre than the inability of this Nation to \nremove nuclear waste from five sites in my home State of Alabama and \nall over the United States to one safe and secure location. Why that \ncan't be accomplished and why those continue to frustrate our efforts \nto carry out the law is beyond me.\n  I know the Senator said $6 billion had been spent on fixing this site \nso far. I understand everybody who pays their electric bill pays a \ncertain percentage of that bill for storing of nuclear waste. Does the \nSenator know how much has been paid in by the citizens of America to \nmake this a safe site for this disposal?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In responding to the Senator from Alabama, a little \nover $15 billion has been paid to the Federal Government. The Federal \nGovernment agreed to take the waste beginning in 1998. Clearly, that \ndate has come and gone.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I can see why the Senator began his remarks raising the \nconcern that the Federal Government should honor its commitments.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I might add also, there is a significant legal \nobligation for noncompliance with that contractual agreement, somewhere \nbetween $50 and $80 billion. I happen to be a banker and know something \nabout money, but I am not as familiar as perhaps a lawyer would be with \nthe significance of a settlement for damages, but it is going to cost \nthe taxpayer a bundle.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think that is important. Money cost is important, $15 \nbillion already spent.\n  For the Senator's edification and those in the body, in Alabama, \noutside of the education budget, the State general fund budget is less \nthan $1 billion a year. This is 15 annual general fund budgets for the \nState of Alabama we have invested, and to date there has been no \nmovement.\n  I thank the Senator for leading the effort on this. I believe his \nremarks are a comprehensive demolishment of any objection by a rational \nhuman being to carrying out the legislative mandate of this Congress. \nWe need the President to be helping rather than frustrating. We need to \npass this law. I was a Federal attorney for a long time. The Federal \nGovernment has the power and does, on a daily basis, condemn properties \nall over America for public use. This is 40 miles away from people. It \nis the appropriate location where we have done nuclear testing.\n  I stand in amazement that we are unable to bring it to a conclusion \nand thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The only explanation I can give my friend from Alabama \nis, for reasons I can only assume are associated with the objections \nfrom antinuclear groups, this administration has simply chosen to \nignore its obligation on the issue of nuclear waste. We have an \nindustry that is strangling on its own waste. Our technology has \ncreated that waste. On the other hand, we are dependent for about 20 \npercent\n\n[[Page S14085]]\n\nof our power on nuclear power generation. Obviously, it has made a \nsubstantial contribution to the air quality because there are no air \nemissions from nuclear power. As we look at the French, they are almost \n90-percent dependent on nuclear energy.\n  They have chosen not to be held hostage by the Mideast as they were \nin the 1973-74 timeframe. So they have developed almost entirely their \npower generation on a nuclear power generating industry and their \nsophistication of disposing of the waste is through technology. They \ntake the waste and reprocess it, recover the plutonium, put it back in \nthe reactors, and burn it, and hence reduce the proliferation. The \nresidue is vitrified like a glass and that is buried, but it has a \nrelatively short life.\n  So while we are committed to permanently disposing of our high-level \nwaste at Yucca, there is another alternative that we have precluded \nourselves from pursuing, which, in my opinion, is probably the right \nway to go, and it is the way the Japanese are going as well.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, the Senator mentioned that 20 percent of our \npower is nuclear. I have had some occasion to study this issue. I \nserved on the Clean Air Committee of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. The President has committed us to his view of reducing \nemissions into the atmosphere by 7 percent, during a period of time \nwhen our demand for electricity is going to nearly double; but 20 \npercent of our electricity comes from nuclear power in the United \nStates, is that right?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is right.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We haven't had a new nuclear plant built in almost 20 \nyears.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How are we going to increase production of power and at \nthe same time shut down the nuclear energy that other nations are using \nregularly?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is a very interesting point the Senator has \nbrought up, because if we look at the clean air proposal of this \nadministration and the proposal that 7\\1/2\\ percent could come from \nrenewables, we have to question whether we have that technology.\n  Somebody said if you took every square foot of New Mexico and Arizona \nand put solar panels across, you would only get half of 1 percent, \nbecause it gets dark once in a while and the wind doesn't blow all the \ntime. So we have real problems with facing reality in the \nadministration's proposal. There is no mention of the role of nuclear \npower in that proposal. Nor do they consider hydroelectric generation \nas a renewable, which is beyond me, because it rains, the lakes fill \nup, and the hydro works. But it is a mentality currently within this \nadministration.\n  I appreciate the Senator bringing up these points, but in the clean \nair proposal by this administration, there is no role for nuclear. \nClearly, there has to be.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I had the privilege of representing this Congress, with \na number of other Senators, at a European conference of the North \nAtlantic Assembly. The President's own appointee as Chairman of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Administration, or association, Mr. John \nRich, made a marvelous talk. I can sum it up fairly by saying that he \nconcluded there is no way this Nation, or the world, can ever meet our \nclean air global warming goals without the enhancement of nuclear \npower. He demolished the idea that renewables, or others, could come \nclose to filling the gap. This is the President's own appointee.\n  I don't know. Maybe he ought to go sit down in the White House, or \nwith the Vice President, and discuss these issues because we are facing \na crisis. We need to maintain our atmospheric purity as much as we can. \nWe certainly don't need to be increasing. I thank the Senator for his \ntime.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend. I see my friend from New Mexico \nwill be seeking recognition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I wish to say I wasn't present in \nthe discussion about clean air and the ambient air standards, as they \nmight pertain to nuclear power in America and what might happen to the \nnuclear power we have, the powerplants, and what might happen in the \nfuture. But I know, even without being here, that it was a very \nenlightened discussion about the fact that if you are looking for a \ncleaner world and for the ambient air of the world and in America in \nthe future, to sustain economic growth, for it to be clean and livable, \nanybody who leaves nuclear power off the map and doesn't even talk \nabout it is absolutely missing the greatest opportunity we have to \naccomplish what all of those who want clean air set out to do. In fact, \nI think the Senator shares this observation with me. The Kyoto \nagreement, with all of its preamble work--the whereases--was totally \nvoid of a reference to nuclear power.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I discussed that report with one of the most eminent \nphysicists in the world. What he said to me was: I looked from cover to \ncover, and since I could not find one word on nuclear power, I put the \nreport down and said it cannot be one that is really objective and \nrealistic.\n  Now, that is better than I can say it. I think that is what the \nSenator has been saying and what my friend from Alabama, who has \nregularly talked with me about nuclear power and clean air, has said. \nIt is amazing, if we can just come to the floor and talk about the \nother sources of energy and what they have done to human life in terms \nof deaths in mining, the deaths on the trains that have carried coal, \nand all of the other things related to producing energy that we use \nwillfully and without great concern about the danger and the risks, and \nthen put that up alongside nuclear power from its origin, it will look \nlike a big giant heap of coal versus a little tiny package of salt over \nhere that will represent the harm we have caused to people and the \nenvironment with nuclear power. They are not even in the same league in \nterms of damage to people, deaths to people, and the like. It has been \na very safe industry, and in the United States, it has been truly \nmiraculous that with this kind of engineering we have had two accidents \nand neither were fatal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. No fatalities. I thank my friend from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14085-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14085-S14086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCED BUDGET ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I came down to make a few remarks about \na bill that is in conference, a subject matter we have been talking \nabout for some time, and that is the Balanced Budget Act and what kind \nof impact it had on skilled nursing homes, on rural hospitals, and \nother parts of the entire health delivery network in the United States. \nWhile I won't take very long today, I do come because I think it is \nvery urgent to the conferees on what we have been calling a ``Medicare \nreplenishment'' bill--a bill that goes back and says let's make a few \nadjustments to the Balanced Budget Act as that Budget Act sought to \nrestrain the cost of health care in three, four, or five areas.\n  Particularly, I want to talk about the House and Senate and the \nultimate compromise on the legislation to increase payments for the \nnursing home patients and proprietors and owners of skilled nursing \nhomes and that industry. In fact, the problems in the nursing home \nindustry are as severe, if not more severe, than in any other part of \nthe health care system in the United States. To talk about hospitals as \nif they are more important than skilled nursing homes, and that we \nshould worry more about hospitals and less about skilled nursing homes, \nis not to address the issue properly, for there are literally hundreds \nof thousands of Americans, men and women, predominantly women, in the \nskilled nursing homes across this land. Some are Ma and Pa owners of \none or two units; some are corporately owned, where hundreds of these \nparticular skilled nursing home facilities are owned by a company.\n  A couple of weeks ago, a very large nursing home company with \nheadquarters in my home State filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy \nprotection. That was a second nursing home chain to file for bankruptcy \nprotection in the last 2 months. These two nursing home chains own \nhundreds of facilities all over the country. So every Senator\n\n[[Page S14086]]\n\nshould be concerned about what is happening to this industry and to \nthese facilities and their ability to care for our senior citizens.\n  The Senate Finance Committee, which got input from many Senators and \nmany parts of America's health delivery system, reported out a very \ngood bill in the area of skilled nursing homes and, likewise, in the \nother delivery components of American health care. In it, there are two \nprovisions which are particularly important. First, it provides, over \nthe next 3 years, for $1.4 billion in higher payment rates for skilled \nnursing facilities. These increases are targeted at what everyone \nagrees is the problem--that current rates do not cover the high costs \nof medically complex cases. In other words, skilled nursing homes and \nthe population of these homes have changed rather dramatically in the \nlast 15 years, and there are more and more very sick people in the \nskilled nursing home facilities, and we call these medically complex \ncases. The reimbursements we are now giving skilled nursing homes do \nnot cover the care for the medically complex cases. Secondly, it put a \nmoratorium--that is, the Senate bill--on the $1,500 therapy caps that \nhave been so disruptive to care to many seniors.\n  Quite frankly, one of the messages I would like the Senate to hear \ntoday is that the House bill is completely inadequate in this area. In \nfact, the House bill puts only $100 million--one-tenth of $1 billion--\ndirectly into the payment rates to correct the problem of high cost \ncases. That is $1.3 billion less than the Senate bill. Obviously, there \nis a problem, or there isn't a problem. If there is no problem, then \nthe House is right. Fund it with $100 million, which is almost nothing. \nBut if there is a problem, obviously $100 million over 3 years will not \nsolve that problem. The Senate is more apt to be right at $1.3 billion \nfor skilled nursing homes.\n  The House bill tries to salvage the concept of putting caps on \ntherapy services, which is the wrong way to be approaching and \ncontrolling the costs in this area.\n  The Medicare relief package reported by our Finance Committee--I give \nthe Finance Committee great credit and Chairman Bill Roth extraordinary \ncredit--includes other provisions: $1.8 billion for teaching hospitals, \nall hospitals $2.5 billion more than today's plans, and for home \nhealth, $1.3 billion to delay a 15-percent cut.\n  Many of us have looked at all of these and think they are needed and \nshould be supported. But certainly to go to conference and tragically \nleave out of the package anything significant for skilled nursing \nhomes, I tell you that we will rue the day. It will not be 6 months to \na year when there will be closings across this land, and we will have \nsick senior citizens unattended in nursing home after nursing home \nacross this country.\n  Even if the other provisions survive the conference and the nursing \nprovisions do not, let me repeat that I think we will have failed the \nNo. 1 problem in the delivery system right now, especially for those \nwho can do nothing for themselves. They are the very sick seniors in \nnursing homes.\n  I don't know any other way than to say that the Senate voted \noverwhelmingly for these provisions. I hope that means they will carry \nthis message into this conference and will insist that the House \nconcede when it comes to skilled nursing home parts of this bill and \nput substantially more into reimbursing provisions; that is, the two \nthat I have mentioned here today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

A bill to improve the safety of shell eggs; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                         egg safety act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Egg Safety Act \nof 1999. This legislation would improve the safety of our nation's egg \nsupply by granting USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) the \nauthority to regulate and inspect shell eggs from farm to retail level, \nrequiring labeling on egg cartons, requiring uniform expiration dating \nfor all shell eggs, and prohibiting repackaging of eggs.\n\n[[Page S14089]]\n\n  Last year, I requested a report from the General Accounting Office \n(GAO) regarding the safety of our egg supply. On July 1 of this year, \nthat report was released at a hearing before the Government Affairs \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, on which I serve. \nAccording to the report, the GAO found cracks, confusion and \ncontradictions in our nation's efforts to protect consumers against \ncontaminated eggs and egg products.\n  Approximately 67 billion eggs are sold each year in the United \nStates, with each American eating an average of 245 during that time. \nEggs are a nutrient-dense food that plays an important part in most \nAmericans' diets, either alone or as an ingredient in other foods. \nHowever, eggs, like any other perishable product, need to be handled \nwith care. Perishable products will always have a degree of risk, but \nthis risk is manageable.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), \nSalmonella enteriditis (SE), a bacteria commonly associated with raw or \nundercooked eggs, caused about 300,000 illnesses in 1997, resulting in \nbetween 115 and 230 deaths. According to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture (USDA), the economic costs of food-borne illnesses related \nto eggs were estimated to be between $225 million and $3 billion in \n1996. Between 1985 and 1998, 81.7 percent of SE outbreaks were \nassociated with eggs.\n  In 1998, the Illinois Department of Public Health recorded 405 \nreported cases and five deaths resulting from SE. Food-borne illness \nhas struck in Illinois several times over the past decade, including a \n1990 outbreak of SE from bread pudding with 1,100 reported cases; a \n1993 outbreak of SE from pancakes with 22 reported cases; and a 1993 \noutbreak of SE from bearnaise sauce with 13 reported cases.\n  Make no mistake about it: our country has one of the safest egg \nsupplies in the world. But we have the science and know-how to make it \neven safer. Eating French toast, Caesar salad, or any other foods that \nmay include raw or undercooked eggs is a manageable risk that can be \nreduced even further. Make some common sense changes in our federal \nfood safety efforts can protect consumers, families and the credibility \nof U.S. food products at home and abroad.\n  How would putting all egg safety responsibilities within one agency \nmake eggs safer? According to the GAO report, lack of coordination \nbetween the four federal agencies responsible for egg safety has \nresulted in gaps, inconsistencies and inefficiencies. For example, \nwhile one of those agencies, USDA, conducts daily inspections of plants \nwhere eggs are broken and made safe by pasteurization, another agency, \nFood and Drug Administration, rarely inspects egg farms or facilities \nwhere unbroken shell eggs are packed unless the agency is trying to \ntrace an outbreak of illness.\n  The absence of or inconsistent egg carton expiration dating laws can \nmislead consumers. Consumers may believe the expiration date accurately \nreflects the age of the egg. For example, when comparing carton dates, \na consumer may be more likely to select eggs not graded by USDA because \na later date on the carton seems to imply that those eggs are fresher. \nBut the eggs with the later date may actually be the older ones. Under \nthe USDA Agricultural marketing Service voluntary egg grading program, \nexpiration dates are set at 30 days from the date the eggs were packed. \nHowever, some egg processors that do not participate in the voluntary \nprogram set their own expiration date or have no expiration date at \nall.\n  The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would require uniform expiration dating \nfor all shell eggs. No eggs packed for consumers could be older than 21 \ndays from the date of lay when packed, and they must carry an \n``expiration date'' or ``sell by date'' of no more than 30 days from \nthe packing date.\n  Repackaging or re-dating of eggs provides the wrong information to \nconsumers. Both time and temperature safeguards are likely to be \ncompromised in eggs that are repackaged. For example, repackaged eggs \nare re-washed in hot water which can lead to increased SE risk. Under \nthe USDA Agricultural Marketing Service voluntary egg grading program, \nwhich includes 30 percent of shell eggs, repackaging is prohibited for \neggs coming back from the retail level but allowed for eggs stored at \nthe packaging plan. Industry has called for a prohibition on egg \nrepackaging.\n  While repackaging may not be a widespread practice, it should be \ncompletely prohibited. The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would prohibit eggs \nreturned to the packer from grocery stores or other retail \nestablishments from being repackaged as shell eggs intended for human \nconsumption. These eggs could only be diverted for further processing \nas pasteurized egg products.\n  The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would also grant FSIS the authority to \nregulate and inspect shell eggs from farm to retail level for the \npurpose of ensuring the protection of public health. The standard for \ninspection frequency would be ``continuous monitoring and verification \nof performance standards.'' The bill would also require FSIS to \nimplement a ``Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point'' (HACCP) \nprogram for egg safety.\n  The Egg Safety Act of 1999 would require labeling on egg cartons to \nwarn consumers of the risk of illness associated with consuming raw or \nundercooked eggs. This labeling requirement would be in addition to the \ncurrent ``keep refrigerated'' label which remains a requirement for all \neggs.\n  The Egg Safety Act of 1999 is supported by the Center for Science in \nthe Public Interest, Consumers Union and Consumer Federation of \nAmerica.\n  Consumers should have the information they need and the assurance \nthey deserve when buying eggs. They should be able to count on the fact \nthat what they're putting on the table is as safe as possible. The Egg \nSafety Act of 1999 is one step toward ensuring that goal.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation, to give people the assurance that the eggs they \nbuy are safe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 1869.

Mr. President I rise to send three separate bills \nto the desk. I am introducing these three pieces of legislation because \nI am very concerned about the direction of U.S. trade policy. Since the \nend of World War II, America has maintained a strong domestic consensus \non the importance of open markets, allowing us to lead the world into \nan era of unprecedented growth. That consensus is fraying at the edges. \nDivisions over the role of labor and the environment have helped to \nundermine it.\n  These divisions have prevented us from re-instituting fast track \nnegotiating authority, which lapsed nearly five years ago. While we \nhesitate, the rest of the world continues to move forward on economic \nintegration. Regional trade arrangements in Europe, Latin America, and \nAsia put U.S. exporters at a competitive disadvantage. We lose overseas \nmarkets to foreign competitors who enjoy trade preferences for which \nour farmers, manufacturers and service providers are ineligible. In my \nhome state of Montana, wheat exporters have lost their share of the \nChilean market to Canadian farmers, who are not subject to the 11% \nChilean import duty that Montana farmers face.\n  If we cannot agree on a global fast-track bill, then we should \ninstitute fast-track authority for specific countries where we have \nstrategic commercial and political interests. In doing so, we should \nchoose countries which not only share our commitment to open markets, \nbut also share our values for environmental quality and labor rights.\n\n[[Page S14090]]\n\n  I recently outlined some broad principles on trade and the \nenvironment in a statement here on the Senate floor. FTA's should be \nconsistent with those principles. In addition to addressing the \nenvironment, they should also firmly support core labor standards.\n  As to the countries, the bills I am introducing provide authority to \nnegotiate bilateral free trade agreements with three important trading \npartners: Singapore, the Republic of Korea and Chile. Taken together, \nthese three countries buy about $40 billion worth of U.S. goods \nannually.\n  For a number of years, the United States has considered, informally \nor formally, negotiating FTA's with all three of them. Soon after \nsigning NAFTA, we talked to Chile about acceding to it as the fourth \nNAFTA partner. Chile waited patiently for Congress to give the \nPresident negotiating authority. That authority never arrived. Since \nthen, Chile has gone ahead and signed bilateral trade agreements with \nboth Mexico and Canada.\n  Similarly, we broached the notion of either an FTA or accession to \nNAFTA with Singapore several years ago. Of all the countries of East \nAsia, none is more committed to open markets than Singapore. \nNegotiating an FTA not only makes commercial sense, it also reinforces \nour engagement in the Pacific Basin.\n  Finally, the Republic of Korea is a country which has made enormous \neconomic and political progress in the past two decades. It is now in \nthe midst of a very painful restructuring forced upon it by the Asian \nfinancial crisis. An FTA with Korea would lock in the gains--both \neconomic and political--of the past, much as NAFTA did for Mexico. \nRecently, the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative said that an FTA with \nKorea was an interesting idea, but that the only way to get there was \nto resolve our bilateral trade disputes. I think that's backwards. FTA \nnegotiations are a way to resolve these issues.\n  The bills also establish a general policy framework for negotiating \nfree trade agreements. They require that FTA's address the full range \nof issues, from guaranteeing national treatment and market access, to \nprotecting intellectual property. They require that FTA's address \nelectronic commerce, an area where the United States has a strong \ncommercial interest. And hey require that FTA's address the labor and \nenvironmental issues.\n  I entered the Senate not too many years after Congress passed the \noriginal fast-track legislation. At that time, the notion of \n``intellectual property'' was something novel. The idea that \n``intellectual property'' should be considered in trade negotiations \nwas ridiculed. Many said that patents, copyrights and trademarks were \ndomestic issues, and thus not appropriate subject for trade agreements. \nBut the United States insisted that the world trading system address \nthese issues. We put a lot of political capital behind it. Today, \nnobody questions the appropriateness of WTO rules for trade-related \nintellectual property rules.\n  I firmly believe that in the near future, we will see the same result \nwith trade-related labor and environmental issues. We cannot--and \nshould not--avoid these issues. So the bills I am introducing require \nthat FTA's address trade aspects of labor and the environment.\n  We must identify potential environmental consequences--both positive \nand negative--of trade agreements, and put in place mechanisms to deal \nwith any adverse impacts. Similarly, we must reaffirm our commitment to \ncore labor standards through a mechanism dealing with any adverse \nimpacts that trade agreements have on labor markets.\n  Mr. President, we need to send a strong signal to the rest of the \nworld that the United States intends to continue its leadership of the \nglobal trading system. The Africa Trade Bill that we passed here this \nweek was an excellent step in the right direction. We must continue to \nmake progress on opening markets for American farmers, manufacturers \nand service providers. Negotiating bilateral free trade agreements with \nlike-minded countries will support our multilateral negotiations in the \nWTO.\n  Just as we negotiated NAFTA and the Uruguay round at the same time, \nwe should pursue bilateral free trade agreements with Chile, Korea, and \nSingapore while we are negotiating the next round in the WTO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1872. A bill to amend the Federal Credit Union Act with respect to \nthe definition of a member business loan; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                    faith based lending legislation\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleagues, Senator Chris Dodd, which will support the work of \nover 600 religious organization based credit unions in the U.S. Many of \nthese credit unions provide an essential source of financing for \nchurches, religious schools, mission agencies, and related community \nprojects such as homeless shelters, drug intervention facilities, and \nhomes for abused women and children.\n  Some of these credit unions rely on other credit unions to fund their \nloans to religious organizations through loan participation agreements. \nthese loan participation agreements are classified as business loans \nand are counted against the member business loan caps that credit \nunions must abide by as a result of the Credit Union Membership Access \nAct signed into law last year. Consequently, the exemption for credit \nunions having a history of business lending contained in that act \nthough well intended, doesn't solve the problem because religious \norganizations based CUs will not be able to sell loans to other credit \nunions who will have to count these faith based loans toward their \nbusiness lending cap.\n  The sale of loan participations is a necessary first step before any \nof these loans can be originated. the legislation I am introducing \nalong with Senator Dodd will allow the approximately 600 religious \norganization based credit unions in America to exempt from loan \nparticipations those loans they originate to religious non-profit \norganizations. In doing so, our bill will assure a steady source of \ncapital for these organizations and community based missions.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like remind my colleagues that \nreligious organization based credit unions enjoy a long history of safe \nlending and encourage them join Senator Dodd and me in passing this \nlegislation. No other credit union program will do more to help the \npoor, the homeless, the disabled and those otherwise in need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no object, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to delay the effective date of the final rule \nregarding the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       organ procurement and transplantation network legislation\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with Senators \nTim Hutchinson, Warner, Torricelli, Mack, Shelby, Nickles, Inhofe, \nThurmond, Ashcroft, McConnell, Roberts, Kohl, Feingold, Cleland, \nHollings, Breaux, Graham, Collins, Grams, Lautenberg, Enzi, Murkowski, \nGorton, Landrieu, Robb and Lincoln in introducing the Organ Donation \nRegulatory Relief Act of 1999.\n\n[[Page S14091]]\n\n  This legislation is designed to prevent an unprecedented Federal \ntakeover of our Nation's organ transplant system by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. This act would nullify a highly \ncontroversial rule issued by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Donna Shalala, that would give her sole authority to approve \nor disapprove organ allocation policies that are currently established \nby the private-sector transplant community throughout this country.\n  This move by the administration would preempt Congress' role in \nencouraging a fair and equitable transplant system through the \nauthorization of the National Organ Transplant Act. My bill would \nsimply nullify the proposed HHS rule until such time as Congress passes \namendments to the National Organ Transplant Act.\n  This bill would preserve Congress' prerogative to consider changes or \nimprovements to the current system while maintaining the private-sector \nrole of thousands of patients, families, volunteers, and medical \nprofessionals that are now responsible for our organ transplant policy. \nIt will allow Congress the time needed to consider new initiatives to \nencourage more organ donation which is the heart of our organ shortage \nproblem.\n  In my home State of Alabama, the University of Alabama-Birmingham, \nhas one of the most effective and finest organ transplant centers in \nthe world. It is the largest liver transplant facility in the world. I \nam extremely proud of their efforts. Let me just say this, this system \nhas been built up carefully, utilizing State law and other laws. It \nworks very effectively.\n  I am very concerned that Federal Government policies have now been \nproposed that would upset this. It has not only upset the University of \nAlabama-Birmingham but transplant centers, and mainly university \nhospitals all over the country. And that is why we believe action needs \nto be taken at this time.\n  I believe the current plan is fair and does a good job of acquiring \nand allocating organs for transplantation. For example, since the \npassage of the National Organ Transplant Act in 1984, the number of \npeople receiving organs has increased annually, and the survival rate \nhas improved steadily.\n  A recent study by the Institute of Medicine came to the same \nconclusion:\n\n       The committee found that the current system is reasonably \n     equitable for the most severely ill (Status 1) liver \n     patients, since the likelihood of receiving a transplant is \n     similar across organ procurement organizations for these \n     patients.\n\n  The Institute of Medicine study contradicted the underlying rationale \nin some numbers that I believe were unwisely interpreted. They underlie \nthis rationale for the controversial ``rule'' on organ allocation that \nhas been proposed by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  In a careful analysis of 68,000 liver patient records, the Institute \nof Medicine panel said:\n\n       . . . the ``overall median waiting time'' that patients \n     wait for organs--the issue that seems to have brought the \n     committee to the table in the first place--is not a useful \n     statistic for comparing access to or equity of the current \n     system of liver transplantation, especially when aggregated \n     across all categories of liver transplant patients.\n\n  HHS has maintained that reducing regional differences in waiting \ntimes was the primary goal of their new rule on organ allocation. The \nHHS rule is a solution in search of a problem and would only inhibit \nthe continual improvements made by the transplant community since the \npassage of NOTA 15 years ago.\n\n  The HHS policy is also shortsighted in its wholesale preemption of \nState laws regarding organ transplantation. Many of the beneficial \npolicies that have served to improve organ procurement and donation are \nbased on State laws, such as the organ donor checkoff on driver's \nlicenses, and the HHS preemption fails to recognize that fact.\n  This year's Labor-HHS appropriations bill provided for a 3-month \nmoratorium on the implementation of the rule from the time of its \nenactment. But, unfortunately, this may not and probably will not \nprovide adequate time for Congress to consider this very complicated \nissue in the context of amendments to the National Organ Transplant \nAct.\n  That is why it is necessary, indeed, imperative. And that is why 26 \nSenators have signed on to this legislation in such a short period of \ntime. It is imperative that we nullify the rule so that these life-and-\ndeath issues can be considered without fear of a clock running out on \nways to improve the current system and provide the gift of life to so \nmany Americans.\n  Hospitals and the physicians who operate in those hospitals are the \nkey to the success of the organ transplant program. They receive phone \ncalls at all hours of the night, and they go out and retrieve those \norgans from people who have been killed. And they have to do it under \nshort periods of time. If they are going to do that simply to send off \nthe organs to some hospital of which they are not committed personally \nor to patients of which they are not serving, they will not be as \neffective in retrieving the organs. Not as many people will benefit and \nnot as many people will have their lives saved as a result.\n  I believe that HHS' actions are unwise. It reminds me of that old \nadage: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\n  We do not have and have not seen a real complaint from the citizens \nof America over the operation of our organ transplant system. This has \nbeen created by unelected bureaucrats here in Washington, and it is not \nhealthy, in my view.\n  But there will be a full opportunity, if this bill is passed, to \nallow the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, of which I \nam a member, to hold hearings and review the facts in order to develop \nthe best transplant program we possibly can. If we can improve the \nsystem, I say let's do it. But let's be sure we do not break something \nthat is not broken already.\n  So I thank the outstanding work of several of my colleagues on this \nimportant issue, including Senators Tim Hutchinson, John Warner, Robert \nTorricelli, and Senator Don Nickles, the assistant majority leader. \nWithout their leadership, this legislation could not have come to \nfruition.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1873\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve academic and social outcomes for youth and \nreduce both juvenile crime and the risk that youth will become victims \nof crime by providing productive activities conducted by law \nenforcement personnel during non-school hours; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n introduction of the police athletic league (pal) youth enrichment act \n                                of 1999\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with \nmy distinguished colleagues, Senator Bingaman and Senator Feinstein, in \nintroducing the Police Athletic League (PAL) Youth Enrichment Act of \n1999. This legislation is designed to reduce both juvenile crime and \nthe risk that youth will become victims of crime. By providing \nproductive activities during non-school hours in communities across \nthis country, we can provide the healthy environment that our young \npeople deserve. Outside the home, there is no safer place in any \ncommunity than a school, a playground, a community center, or a park \nwhere law enforcement personnel are coordinating the activities.\n  The Police Athletic League actually started back in the 1910's. A \ngroup of\n\n[[Page S14092]]\n\nNew York youth tossed a rock through a shopkeeper's window. That rock \npioneered a new approach to juvenile delinquency prevention. Lieutenant \nEd Flynn used that incident to create the Police Athletic League--an \norganization that makes police officers into role models and friends \nrather than enemies. PAL brings cops and kids together in activities \nwhere mutual trust and respect can be built. It is a statement to young \npeople, particularly in less advantaged neighborhoods, that the \ncommunity cares about them. It extends a hand of friendship to \nchildren--boys, girls, young men and women--who do not have many \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, there is clearly a direct link between crime \nprevention and PAL participation. Young people who are idle have the \npotential to be drawn into crime. In Baltimore, the PAL centers have \ncut juvenile crime by 30 percent and decreased juvenile victimization \nby 40 percent. In El Centro, California, PAL has reduced juvenile crime \nand gang activity in the HUD Housing Development by 64 percent.\n  PAL, staffed by police officers, has numerous success stories of \nhelping to shape the lives of individuals. In my own state of Florida, \nformer PAL kid Ed Tobin is now a successful attorney. Steve Colin is a \nwell known radio station personality in Miami Beach. In Jacksonville, \n23 Sheriff's Officers were PAL kids. Derrick Alexander of the Cleveland \nBrowns and Shawn Jefferson of the New England Patriots were both PAL \nkids.\n  Our legislation seeks to expand services of current chapters and \nprovide seed money for 50 new chapters per year for the next 5 years \n(2000-2004). New chapters will offer programs providing a combination \nof mentoring assistance; academic assistance; recreational and athletic \nactivities; technology training; and drug, alcohol, and gang prevention \nactivities. This list is by no means exhaustive. PAL centers also offer \nhealth and nutrition counseling; cultural and social programs; conflict \nresolution training, anger management, and peer pressure training; job \nskill preparation activities; and Youth PAL conferences or Youth \nForums.\n  PAL currently has 320 chapters serving over 3,000 communities with a \nnetwork of 1,700 facilities. Today, they mentor and serve more than one \nand half million young people, ages 6 to 18, throughout the United \nStates, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. In my home state, the \nMiami-Dade PAL serves over 13,000 youth annually, and Jacksonville \nserves over 12,000. We know, however, that many areas are still \nundeserved by PAL chapters.\n  Law enforcement, community organizations, and local governments \nstrongly support this bill. Mr. President, this investment in our youth \nwill pay for itself many times over in reduced crime and law \nenforcement costs. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of \nthis much needed legislation. Together with the Police Athletic League, \nwe can fill playgrounds instead of prisons.\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator \nGraham in introducing the ``Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act \nof 1999.''\n  The Police Athletic League (PAL) is a national organization that has \nbeen teaming up law enforcement with our nation's youth for the past 55 \nyears. New Mexico is fortunate to have a statewide PAL program. The New \nMexico PAL provides New Mexico's youth with a variety of after-school \nand summer activities. Last year, the New Mexico PAL provided hundreds \nof New Mexico kids with alternatives to getting into trouble. For these \nreasons, I am very proud to introduce the PAL Youth Enrichment Act with \nSenator Graham.\n  In New Mexico, the PAL chapter has ten sites around the state: Santa \nFe, Albuquerque, Gallup, Tohatchi, Bloomfield, Roswell, Dona Ana \nCounty, Clovis, Lordsburg and the Pueblo of Cochiti. The goal of the \nNew Mexico PAL is to provide recreational, educational and cultural \nactivities for at-risk youth ages five to eighteen with the intent of \nreducing negative behaviors and promoting healthy behavioral patterns. \nPAL aims to build self-esteem and resiliency in youth and provide \npositive alternatives to alcohol, drug use, delinquent behavior and \nviolence. The New Mexico PAL sponsors sporting leagues throughout the \nyear, participates in Sports Days during the summer, sponsors a one-\nweek summer camp and offers ongoing mentoring opportunities for youth.\n  The PAL volunteers not only play sports with the youth, but they \nfight for the youth. In Albuquerque, the PAL chapter aided in \npreserving the use of a baseball field for the youth sporting leagues.\n  Last summer the New Mexico PAL held several Youth Sports Days that \nattracted between 40 and 150 kids in each community. In August, I \nattended the Youth Sports Day in Santa Fe. The daylong event provided \nthe younger kinds in the community with a variety of sporting events, \nprizes and lunch. The kids and parents interacted with the law \nenforcement officers in a setting that allowed them to see the officers \nas community members, mentors and leaders.\n  The New Mexico PAL also sponsors a week long summer camp, Camp \nCourage, each year at the Cochiti Lake. It is a reward camp for kids \nthat have said ``no'' to antisocial behavior. More than one hundred \nkids participate in this program annually. Because a camp requires a \nlower adult child ratio, the local FBI agents, DEA agents and the \nNational Guard joined with the local police and sheriffs in organizing \na week of intense sporting activities. They also offered themselves as \nmentors and reachers for the youth. The commitment of these law \nenforcement officers to the youth of New Mexico is truly admirable.\n  After seeing what the New Mexico PAL has accomplished, I have come to \nbe a great supporter of PAL. I now want other communities around the \nnation to be able to benefit from the same programs and services and \nfor more New Mexico communities to be able to start PAL programs. As I \nsee it, a police officer's duty is primarily to protect a community. I \nlook at PAL as law enforcement's way of helping protect the health of \nour kids--both the physical well being and the mental well being.\n  The PAL Youth Enrichment Act will enable existing PAL to expand their \nservices and provide seed money for new PAL in distressed communities, \nincluding many Native American communities. The goal is to provide seed \nmoney for fifty new chapters each year for the next five years. By \nproviding $16 million annually for new and existing PAL, youth around \nthe country will benefit from a combination of academic assistance; \nmentoring assistance; recreational and athletic activities; technology \ntraining; drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities; health and \nnutrition counseling; cultural and social programs, conflict resolution \ntraining; anger management; peer pressure training; and job skill \npreparation classes.\n  Although PAL chapters consist of local law enforcement, they do not \nreceive direct funding from the law enforcement agencies, and instead \nrely on the efforts of volunteers and fund-raising proceeds. Because of \nthis funding situation, in 1977 I urged Congress to appropriate funds \nfor the New Mexico PAL. In 1998 I succeeded in getting $1 million \nappropriated through the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill for \nthe New Mexico PAL program to expand the PAL services to communities \naround the State and to greatly enhance the current programs it \noffered. This money has enabled the New Mexico PAL to carry out its \nsummer programs, its Camp Courage, and many other new activities. It \nalso has allowed them to expand the program to tribal communities in \nnorthwest New Mexico, with the cooperation of the tribal police in \nthose areas. The PAL Youth Enrichment Act will provide the funding \nneeded to continue programs like the New Mexico PAL and will give other \nstates the incentive to start up PAL programs in distressed \ncommunities.\n  Kids need healthy alternatives to crime and assistance in dealing \nwith their anger. Athletics and recreational activities like dancing \nand drama greatly improves one's well being--both physically and \nmentally--and give teens an outlet for their energy and anger. PAL's \nsports and recreational activities also help kids learn the importance \nof teamwork and help boost their self-esteem when they accomplish more \nthan they thought possible.\n\n[[Page S14093]]\n\n  Many folks do not realize it but the PALs have produced some great \nathletes over the years. New Mexico is proud of its native son, Danny \nRomero Jr., a former two-time world boxing champion and an alumnus of \nthe New Mexico PAL program. According to Danny's father, the PAL \nphilosophy taught his son life skills that he could no have learned any \nwhere else and kept him out of trouble.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the Senate to take up and pass this \nworthwhile legislation that expands a program with proven positive \nresults. Just ask the 1.5 million children in more than 3,000 \ncommunities that the PAL program over the past 55 years has served. The \nPAL programs will change our youth's attitude toward police, will \nprovide a variety of alternatives to criminal behavior and will \npositively influence a child's mental and physical well-being. I hope \nthat my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this important \nlegislation\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1876. A bill to amend the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991 \nto require a report to Congress; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 science and educational networking act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Science and Educational Networking Act with my colleague \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller. This legislation is a \ncompanion bill to legislation introduced in the other body by one of my \nConnecticut colleagues, John Larson and cosponsored by 49 other \nmembers.\n  Very simply, the Science and Educational Networking Act charts a \ncourse for the future for our schools and for education technology. \nJust as we cannot imagine schools and learning without books and \npencils, computers and technology have become today a critical element \nin education. But like other tools, technology has its limits. Teachers \nmust be trained to use technology in their teaching. Curriculum must \nincorporate and utilize technology. Students must have access to \ncomputers. Classroom technology must be connected, integrated and of \nhigh quality.\n  This legislation focuses specifically on this last element in the \nequation--the quality of the technology in our classrooms. Computers in \nand of themselves are amazing machines. But what is more powerful than \ntheir simple computing capacity is the connections students can make \nwith them. From accessing the collection of museums and libraries to \n``chatting'' with students from across the globe, computers have \nincredible potential to enrich our children's education. But in too \nmany schools this potential goes unrealized because of outdated, \ninadequate or non-existent equipment and slow connections to the \nInternet.\n  Since the enactment and implementation of the e-rate, we have made \nsubstantial progress toward meeting our goal of connecting all schools \nand classrooms to the Internet. Since 1994, the percentage of schools \nwith access to the Internet has more than doubled from 35 percent to 89 \npercent and the percentage of classrooms with access has risen from 3 \npercent to 51 percent. Gaps however remain. High income communities are \nmore likely to have Internet access than low income schools with over \n60 percent of classrooms in wealthier communities having Internet \naccess compared to under 40 percent of low income classrooms.\n  Further limiting the benefit of the Internet and the World Wide Web \nis the actual capacity of a school's connection. Most schools are \nconnected over regular telephone loans--although in many states even \nthis is a problem. In my home state of Connecticut, four in five school \ndistricts report inadequate classroom access to telephone lines. And \nfrankly, a regular telephone line just is not enough--trying to use the \nInternet with a regular telephone line can be frustratingly slow as \ndata quickly overloads the capacity of these lines designed for \ntelephones not computers. Students need access to high speed, large \nbandwidth capacity. Without these connections, it is like requiring our \nstudents to make their way only on the back roads rather than on the \nfreeway.\n  High speed, large bandwidth connections, which are rare except in \nsome of our nation's technological hubs, substantially increase the \nquality and capacity of Internet connections. The effect of these \nbetter connections is immediate--entering, searching and accessing the \nWeb and the information it contains is faster and much more efficient. \nMuch more important, in my view, is what this increased capacity will \ndo for distance learning opportunities in our elementary and secondary \nschools. High speed, large bandwidth connections offer the potential of \nreal-time, two-way video and audio interactions over the Net. This is \nwhere the promise of distance learning comes to fruition when students \nin a remote location or several remote locations participate in real \ntime classroom activities.\n  This legislation will move us toward this promising goal. It will \nbring together leading experts in government to assess the capacity of \nour schools in this area, to explore the digital divide, to examine \nways to better utilize this technology in schools and to report to \nCongress on how we can help schools meet these challenges.\n  Mr. President, this is an important first step if we are to make the \npromise of the Internet a reality for our children and schools. I ask \nthat the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1876\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 69\n\n       Whereas in the year 2000, the United States naval shipyards \n     will celebrate 200 years of service to the Nation;\n       Whereas naval technology has proven invaluable to the \n     Nation by strengthening national defense, preserving world \n     maritime freedom, and producing scientific breakthroughs;\n       Whereas in peacetime, ships built in United States naval \n     shipyards patrol around the clock to preserve peace and keep \n     the United States free;\n       Whereas Kittery, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard was the first \n     major United States naval shipyard of the modern era;\n       Whereas on June 12, 2000, the Kittery, Portsmouth Naval \n     Shipyard will celebrate the 200th anniversary of its \n     founding;\n       Whereas since its inception at Kittery, Portsmouth, the \n     United States naval shipyard system has grown to include 11 \n     facilities located on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, \n     and at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii;\n       Whereas since 1800, United States naval shipyards have \n     built hundreds of naval ships, and completed thousands of \n     overhauls on ships of both the United States Navy and those \n     of many United States allies;\n       Whereas today, the United States Navy is the preeminent \n     naval force in the world, and ships constructed in United \n     States naval shipyards have helped lead the way to victory in \n     numerous global conflicts; and\n       Whereas United States naval shipyard workers, both past and \n     present, have a well-deserved sense of pride in their \n     accomplishments, which have kept our Navy strong and our \n     country free: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress requests that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service issue a commemorative \n     postage stamp in honor of the 200th anniversary of the \n     founding of the United States naval shipyards; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee recommend to the \n     Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n\n[[Page S14095]]\n\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp \nshould be issued honoring the United States Naval Shipyards.\n  This legislation calls upon the United States Postal Service to issue \na commemorative postage stamp honoring the legacy of our naval shipyard \nsystem on the occasion of its 200th anniversary, which will take place \nin the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, naval technology has proven invaluable to our nation \nby strengthening our national defense, preserving world maritime \nfreedom, and producing significant scientific breakthroughs. In \npeacetime, ships built in naval shipyards patrol around the clock to \npreserve peace and keep the United States free. As Chair of the Senate \nArmed Services Subcommittee on Seapower, I am proud that, today, the \nU.S. Navy is the preeminent naval force in the world. Ships constructed \nin U.S. yards have helped lead the way to victory in numerous global \nconflicts.\n  Naval shipyards workers, both past and present, have a well-deserved \nsense of pride in their accomplishments which have kept our Navy strong \nand our country free. Likewise, veterans of the United States Naval \nForce have served with courage, honor and distinction, risking their \nlives in combat and against an unforgiving sea.\n  On June 12, 2000, the Kittery/Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine will \ncelebrate the 200th anniversary of its founding. Kittery/Portsmouth was \nthe first major naval shipyard of the modern era. From the beginnings \nat Kittery/Portsmouth, the naval shipyard system grew to eventually \ninclude eleven yards located on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, \nand at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. In the two hundred years since 1800, naval \nyards have built hundreds of naval ships, and completed thousands of \noverhauls on ships of both the U.S. Navy and those of U.S. allies.\n  I believe this resolution would be a fitting way to recognize the \nforthcoming bicentennial of our public shipyards. I strongly believe \nthat the contributions of the hundreds of thousands of men and women \nwho work in our shipyards are worthy of recognition.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in this show of \nsupport for our shipyards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14095-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 70--REQUESTING THAT THE UNITED STATES \n    POSTAL SERVICE ISSUE A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP HONORING THE \n      NATIONAL VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Ms. SNOWE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 70\n\n       Whereas United States service personnel have fought, bled, \n     and died in every war, conflict, police action, and military \n     intervention in which the United States has engaged during \n     this century and throughout the Nation's history;\n       Whereas throughout history, veterans service organizations \n     have ably represented the interests of veterans in Congress \n     and State legislatures across the Nation, and established \n     networks of trained service officers who, at no charge, have \n     helped millions of veterans and their families secure the \n     education, disability compensation, and health care benefits \n     they are rightfully entitled to receive as a result of the \n     military service performed by those veterans; and\n       Whereas veterans service organizations have been deeply \n     involved in countless local community service projects and \n     have been constant reminders of the American ideals of duty, \n     honor, and national service: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress requests that--\n       (1) the United States Postal Service issue a series of \n     commemorative postage stamps honoring the legacy and the \n     continuing contributions of veterans service organizations to \n     the United States; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee recommend to the \n     Postmaster General that such a series of commemorative \n     postage stamps be issued.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the sense of Congress that a series of commemorative postage \nstamps should be issued honoring veterans service organizations across \nthe United States.\n  As we near Veterans Day--81 years after the Armistice was signed in \nFrance that silenced the guns and ended the carnage of World War I--\nthis legislation calls upon the United States Postal Service to issue a \nseries of commemorative postage stamps honoring the legacy and the \ncontinuing contributions of veterans to our country. World War I was \nsupposed to be ``the war to end all wars'' * * * the war that made the \nworld safe for democracy. Sadly, that was not to be, and America has \nbeen repeatedly reminded that the defense of democracy is an on-going \nduty. That is why this is such an opportune moment to recognize those \nbrave Americans who fought to defend the freedoms we cherish.\n  Mr. President, when many of us think about war veterans, we think \nabout the tremendous sacrifices these defenders of freedom made. From \nthe War for Independence, through the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, and \nKosovo--more than two hundred years later--Americans have answered \ntheir country's call to duty to safeguard our freedoms. Of those who \nhave worn our nation's uniform, more than a million never returned. \nThey made the ultimate sacrifice so that those who followed could enjoy \nthe blessings of liberty. The debt of gratitude we owe to our veterans \ncan never be fully repaid. What we can and must do for our veterans is \nto keep alive the values of freedom and democracy they have defended, \nand honor them as the guardians of those ideals.\n  Elmer Runyon once wrote that: ``We will remain the home of the free \nonly as long as we are also the home of the brave''. Today, America and \nthe world is basking in the shine of freedom because of yesterday's and \ntoday's service men and women--who offer nobly to sacrifice in war so \nthat others may live in peace. These are America's true heroes.\n  After all, winning freedom is not the same as keeping it. The cost of \nsafeguarding freedom is high. It requires vigilance and sacrifice. Time \nand again when freedom has been threatened, American men and women have \nemerged as heroes.\n  America's veterans have served our country and the world ably in \ntimes of need, and know well the personal sacrifices which the defense \nof freedom demands. It is a true honor to represent these brave \nAmericans, as so many of them continue to make contributions day-in and \nday-out in our communities--through youth activities and scholarships \nprograms, homeless assistance initiatives, efforts to reach out to \nfellow veterans in need, and national leadership on issues of \nimportance to veterans and all Americans.\n  I have nothing but the utmost respect for those who have served their \ncountry. This legislation is a tribute to the men and women and their \nfamilies who have served this country with courage, honor and \ndistinction. They answered the call to duty when their country needed \nthem, and this is but a small token of our appreciation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this show of support and an \nexpression of appreciation to all veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14095-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14095-S14096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 221--TO AUTHORIZE TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENT PRODUCTION \n     IN THE MATTER OF PAMELA A.

1999\n\n     SEC. __1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Agribusiness Merger \n     Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. __2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Concentration in the agricultural economy including \n     mergers, acquisitions, and other combinations and alliances \n     among suppliers, producers, packers, other food processors, \n     and distributors has been accelerating at a rapid pace in the \n     1990's.\n       (2) The trend toward greater concentration in agriculture \n     has important and far-reaching implications not only for \n     family-based farmers, but also for the food we eat, the \n     communities we live in, and the integrity of the natural \n     environment upon which we all depend.\n       (3) In the past decade and a half, the top 4 largest pork \n     packers have seized control of some 57 percent of the market, \n     up from 36 percent. Over the same period, the top 4 beef \n     packers have expanded their market share from 32 percent to \n     80 percent, the top 4 flour millers have increased their \n     market share from 40 percent to 62 percent, and the market \n     share of the top 4 soybean crushers has jumped from 54 \n     percent to 80 percent.\n       (4) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, wet corn, and dry corn \n     processors now control 73 percent, 55 percent, 74 percent, \n     and 57 percent of the market, respectively.\n       (5) A handful of firms dominate the processing of every \n     major commodity. Many of them are vertically integrated, \n     which means that they control successive stages of the food \n     chain, from inputs to production to distribution.\n       (6) Growing concentration of the agricultural sector has \n     restricted choices for farmers trying to sell their products. \n     As the bargaining power of agribusiness firms over farmers \n     increases, agricultural commodity markets are becoming \n     stacked against the farmer.\n       (7) The farmer's share of every retail dollar has plummeted \n     from around 50 percent in 1952, to less than 25 percent \n     today, while the profit share for farm input, marketing, and \n     processing companies has risen.\n       (8) While agribusiness conglomerates are posting record \n     earnings, farmers are facing desperate times. The commodity \n     price index is the lowest since 1987. Hog prices are at their \n     lowest since 1972. Cotton and soybean prices are the lowest \n     they have been since the early 1970's.\n       (9) The benefits of low commodity prices are not being \n     passed on to American consumers. The gap between what \n     shoppers pay for food and what farmers are paid is growing \n     wider. From 1984 to 1998, prices paid to farmers fell 36 \n     percent, while consumer food prices actually increased by 3 \n     percent.\n       (10) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive practices, \n     and other manipulations and abuses of the agricultural \n     economy are driving family-based farmers out of business. \n     Farmers are going bankrupt or giving up, and few are taking \n     their places; more farm families are having to rely on other \n     jobs to stay afloat; and the number of farmers leaving the \n     land will continue to increase unless and until these trends \n     are reversed.\n       (11) The decline of family-based agriculture undermines the \n     economies of rural communities across America; it has pushed \n     Main Street businesses, from equipment suppliers to insurance \n     sales people, out of business or to the brink of insolvency.\n       (12) Increased concentration in the agribusiness sector has \n     a harmful effect on the environment; corporate hog farming, \n     for example, threatens the integrity of local water supplies \n     and creates noxious odors in neighboring communities. \n     Concentration also can increase the risks to food safety and \n     limit the biodiversity of plants and animals.\n       (13) The decline of family-based farming poses a direct \n     threat to American families and family values, by subjecting \n     farm families to turmoil and stress.\n       (14) The decline of family-based farming causes the demise \n     of rural communities, as stores lose customers, churches lose \n     congregations, schools and clinics become under-used, career \n     opportunities for young people dry up, and local inequalities \n     of wealth and income grow wider.\n       (15) These developments are not the result of inevitable \n     market forces. They are the consequence of policies made in \n     Washington, including farm, antitrust, and trade policies.\n       (16) To restore competition in the agricultural economy, \n     and to increase the bargaining power and enhance economic \n     prospects for family-based farmers, the trend toward \n     concentration must be reversed.\n\n     SEC. __3.

Mr. President, during the past several weeks, a \ncommunity in my state has come together to combat racism in their \nschools. One person, a student at Puyallup High School, has taken this \nproblem head on and devised a way to bring his fellow students together \nin their fight against racism.\n  This student, David Poffenberger, an 18-year-old senior, designed a \nt-shirt that will be distributed to all of his 1,900 classmates in \norder to demonstrate Puyallup High School's united front against \nracism.\n  In one of his art classes, David created a design for the shirt--two \nsilhouetted groups, one black and one white, united by a single \nhandshake. David completed the shirt by adding the phrase, ``Bridge the \nGap.'' With the encouragement from one of his art teachers, Candace \nLoring, David took a week off from swimming practice and visited with \nlocal community groups to turn his plan into reality.\n  The high school Booster Club, alumni association, the Puyallup Elks, \nand the Good Samaritan Hospital all contributed to his effort, raising \nover half of the $5,128 needed to print and distribute the shirts. The \nBooster Club has also agreed to cover the remaining amount in addition \nto their own $1,000 contribution.\n  David's principal, Wanda Berndston, credits him for single-handedly \nspearheading this effort to improve awareness throughout the school. In \nthe midst of an unfortunate situation, it is often the individuals who \nare closest to the problem who can best offer solutions.\n  I commend David for his determination to make his school a better \nplace for all students and am proud to present him with one of my \n``Innovation in Education'' Awards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14202-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  EXTENDED CARE SERVICES FOR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter or \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purposes of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts Between Sessions and During \n     Extended Recesses.

The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry  is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) Opportunity for Response: A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report: When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        rule 4: procedures for conducting an adjudicatory review\n\n       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review: An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review: When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its jurisdiction has \n     occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be conducted by \n     outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) of Senate \n     Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not to use \n     outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory review, \n     designated outside counsel, or if the Committee determines \n     not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its staff, may \n     conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn statements, \n     use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or take any \n     other actions that the Committee deems appropriate to secure \n     the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee: Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) Committee Action:\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the reasons \n     underlying the Committee's recommendation concerning \n     disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory review of \n     conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the Senate may be \n     conducted, or report or resolution or recommendation relating \n     to such an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made, except \n     by the affirmative recorded vote of not less than four \n     members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2(a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       i. In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       ii. In the case of an officer or employee, a recommendation \n     to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, payment of \n     restitution, or a combination of these;\n       iii. In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members\n\n[[Page S14206]]\n\n     order that a Member, officer or employee be reprimanded or \n     pay restitution or both;\n       iv. In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) Right of Appeal:\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    Rule 5: Procedures for Hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes on order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d)).\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     number or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions, \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchange under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's \n     scheduled appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may \n     submit to the Committee written questions proposed to be \n     asked of that witness. If the Committee determines that it \n     is necessary, such questions may be asked by any member of \n     the Committee, or by any Committee staff member if \n     directed by a Committee member. The witness or witness's \n     counsel may also submit additional sworn testimony for the \n     record within twenty-four hours after the last day that \n     the witness has testified. The insertion of such testimony \n     in that day's record is subject to the approval of the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly within five days \n     after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible, unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly but \n     the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination,\n\n[[Page S14207]]\n\n     including sexual harassment, or sexual misconduct, by a \n     Member, officer, or employee, within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee, the Committee shall be guided by the standards and \n     procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, \n     except that the Committee may admit evidence subject to the \n     provisions of this paragraph only upon a determination of not \n     less than four members of the full Committee that the \n     interests of justice require that such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, \n     staff member, outside counsel or witness may request a \n     ruling by the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly. \n     Any member or witness shall return the transcript with \n     suggested corrections to the Committee offices within five \n     working days after receipt of the transcript, or as soon \n     thereafter as is practicable. If the testimony as given in \n     executive session, the member or witness may only inspect \n     the transcript at a location determined by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any questions arising \n     with respect to the processing and correction of \n     transcripts shall be decided by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member of \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   Rule 6: Subpoenas and Depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of subpoena: The Committee, by recorded vote \n     of not less than four members of the Committee, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or authorized for \n     issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. \n     The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may withdraw \n     any subpoena authorized for issuance by them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons authorized to take depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may \n     refer the matter to the Committee or rule on the \n     objection. If the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee upon referral, overrules the objection, the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the Committee as the case may \n     be, may direct the witness to answer the question or \n     produce the document.

Mr. President, on behalf of Vice Chairman \nReid and other Members of the Ethics Committee, I am pleased to submit \nthe ``Senate Ethics Procedure Reform Resolution of 1999'' for Senate \nconsideration. This Resolution will implement key recommendations of \nthe Senate Ethics Study Commission of 1993, a body which included among \nits members both the current distinguished Majority Leader and the \ndistinguished Minority Leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Chairman Smith and \nother Members of the Ethics Committee to bring this Reform Resolution \nto the floor for consideration. And I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank the Chairman for his leadership in working to \nimplement these much needed changes in the Ethics Committee process.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate the Vice Chairman's comments \nand, more importantly, acknowledge his assistance and support in \nbringing these Reform measures before the Senate. This Resolution is \nthe product of a mutual and supportive effort on both sides of the \naisle to improve the Ethics Committee's procedures.\n  Let us briefly describe the changes included in this Reform. First, \nas Members may recall, the 1993 Study Commission was charged with \nstudying the Ethics Committee's procedures and recommending needed \nchanges. Such a Commission arose, a large part, out of the universal \nobservation by those who had participated in Ethics Committee \nproceedings that: (1) the procedures were unnecessarily confusing and \ncomplex; and (2) that this created the potential for unfairness to \nthose affected and contributed to a lack of confidence by those \nobserving the process. In its hearings, the 1993 Study Commission heard \nfrom three distinguished former chairs of the Ethics Committee, \nattorneys who have practiced before and with the Ethics Committee, and \nexperts on ethics issues and procedures from academia and public \norganizations with interests in legislative ethics. The resulting \nCommission Report, issued in 1994, recommended several changes designed \nto enhance public confidence in the Senate's ability to fulfill its \nconstitutional duty of self-discipline.\n  The Reform Resolution now before the Senate includes those Commission \nrecommendations specifically designed to simplify and streamline the \nSenate Ethics process. These reforms are intended to expedite the \nhandling of ethics complaints in a way which should make the process \nfairer and more understandable. By eliminating the current unnecessary, \nmulti-stage process for fact gathering, and using a single phase \n``preliminary inquiry'' for that purpose, the process will make a lot \nmore sense, and should save some time. If, after the facts are in, \nthere is substantial evidence with causes the Ethics Committee to \nconclude that a violation may have occurred, then changes would be \nissued, and an ``adjudicative review'' of the evidence would ensue. \nThis simplified process will be the same, whether the complaint is \nsworn or unsworn, and there will continue to be no procedural \nformalities surrounding the filing of a complaint with the Committee.\n  Mr. REID. The Reform Resolution also proposes a uniform set of \npossible sanctions for violations. The reforms would continue the \nEthics Committee's current authority to dismiss a complaint because \nthere is no violation, or find that any violation is inadvertent or \notherwise de minimis and resolve it informally, after the Committee has \ngathered the facts. Both the current and the reformed process \ncontemplate a letter of disapproval to resolve situations where a \nviolation is de minimis and does not deserve formal discipline. \nAlthough the use of such letters is not explicit under current rules, \nsuch letters have historically been used by the Committee to resolve \ncomplaints, and the reformed process would expressly provide for public \nor private ``Letters of Admonition'' for this purpose. Such letters \nhave not been and would not be considered discipline.\n  As to discipline by the Committee, the current process permits the \nCommittee to resolve a case, with the Committee does not believe \ndeserves sanction by the full Senate, by suggesting a remedy such as a \nreprimand, but only with consent of the respondent. The usefulness of \nthis method of resolution is limited by the requirement of consent. The \nreformed process would authorize the Committee to resolve an \nappropriate case with a reprimand without consent, and/or financial \nrestitution, but only after an opportunity for hearing and only with a \nright of appeal of the full Senate. In this fashion, cases which the \nCommittee does not believe deserve discipline by the full Senate could \nbe resolved, and the individual's right to defend his or her conduct \nbefore the full Senate would be preserved.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Beyond reprimand, and reserved for only \nthe most serious cases, both the current and the reformed process \ncontemplate that the Committee may make recommendations to the full \nSenate for Senate discipline. Under the current process, with respect \nto Members, the Committee has recommended or the full Senate has \nconsidered, either alone or in combination: financial restitution, \ndisgorgement of funds, referral to a party conference for attention \n(regarding seniority or positions of responsibility), denouncement, \ncensure, condemnation, and expulsion. The current system's use of a \nvariety of terms, each of which has been considered by Senate \nhistorians to be censure, has resulted in some confusion about the \nSenate's intent in disciplining its Members. The proposed process would \nprovide the Committee with a uniform set of recommendations for use \neither alone or in combination: financial restitution, referral to a \nparty conference for attention (regarding seniority or positions of \nresponsibility), censure, and expulsion. Absent\n\n[[Page S14211]]\n\nextraordinary circumstances, the intent would be to use uniform \nterminology in recommending discipline to the Senate, although the \nCommittee would retain needed flexibility in this regard. The proposal \nwould also add financial restitution to the possible recommendations \nrespecting a Senate officer or employee; suspension and dismissal are \ncurrently included.\n  Finally, Mr. President the Reform Resolution would amend the Ethics \nCommittee's enabling resolution to expressly provide for the \nCommittee's educational function.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 222) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 222\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Women's \nBusiness Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 (S. 791). This bill is the \nlatest step by the Committee on Small Business to strengthen the \nWomen's Business Center program at the Small Business Administration \n(SBA). Since this program first opened its doors in 1989, it has grown \nfrom an initial 12 centers to 81 centers operating in 47 states, the \nDistrict of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The bill I \nam bringing before the Senate today will increase the authorization \nlevel for the Women's business Centers program. Further, this bill \nestablishes a four year pilot program that will, for the first time, \nallow centers that have completed a grant or that are in their last \nyear of a grant under this program to apply for a second, five year \ngrant.\n  S. 791 was approved by the Committee on Small Business by a 17-1 \nvote, and I am urging my colleagues to support this bill with an \namendment that Senator Kerry and I are offering on the floor today. The \namendment includes changes to the bill that have been agreed to by the \nHouse Committee on Small business. Once Senate action on this bill is \ncomplete, it is our hope the House of Representatives will be able to \npass the bill before Congress adjourns, clearing the measure for the \nPresident's approval. The amendment adopts the authorization levels \nincluded in the House-passed version of this bill, and it places all \ncenters on an equal footing when competing for sustainability grants.\n  During the past decade, the number of women-owned small businesses \nhas exploded. Women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing \nsegment of our nation's business community. Years ago, there was an \nadvertising campaign slogan proclaiming that women ``had come a long \nway.'' I find that slogan very applicable to the plateau now reached by \nwomen entrepreneurs. Women business owners have established themselves \nas a key component of our small business community,\n\n[[Page S14215]]\n\nwhich has been the engine driving our economy during the 1990's.\n  The research foundation arm of the National Association of Women \nbusiness Owners (NAWBR) has conducted studies which show that women no \nlonger are having more trouble than men obtaining bank loans. However, \nobtaining a loan does not guarantee a business' success. In fact, many \nsmall businesses that start out well capitalized end up failing. \nSuccess of a small business is usually dependent on the owners' \nmanagement capabilities. Women's Business Centers offer help to women \nentrepreneurs who are looking to start a business or who already have a \nbusiness by providing them with business and education training, \nincluding marketing, finance, and management assistance.\n  For the past three years, I have worked with Senator Domenici, \nSenator Kerry, and Members of the Committee on Small Business first to \nsave and later to expand the Women's Business Center Program. In 1996, \nwhen the Administration sought to zero-out the budget of the program, I \nhelped lead the effort to earmark funds for the program within SBA's \nFiscal Year 1997 budget. In 1997, Senator Domenici, Senator Kerry and I \nsponsored the ``Women's Business Centers Act of 1997,'' which expanded \nthe program from $4 million to $8 million per year. This bill was \nincorporated into the ``Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997'' \n(Public Law 105-135).\n\n  Earlier this year, the Congress passed the ``Women's Business Center \nAmendments Act of 1999'' (Public Law 106-17), which helped bring us \ncloser to achieving our goal of having at least one Women's Business \nCenter up and running in each of the 50 states. This law authorized $11 \nmillion for Fiscal Year 2000 for the Women's Business Center Program, \nwhich allows SBA to continue to fund the existing 35 eligible Centers \nand provide seed funding to new eligible applicant Centers in states \nnot yet served by the program.\n  Under this latest step to strengthen the SBA's program for women-\nowned businesses, the ``Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of \n1999'' addresses the ongoing funding constraints that are making it \nincreasingly difficult for Women's Business Centers to sustain the \nlevel of services they provide after they graduate from the Women's \nBusiness Centers program.\n  To help these centers, S. 791 would establish a four-year competitive \ngrant pilot program that allows graduating and graduated centers that \noffer on-going programs and services to women entrepreneurs to compete \nfor another five years of matching grants known as a ``sustainability \ngrant.'' ``Graduating centers'' are centers that are in the final year \nof their initial five-year funding cycle. A ``graduated center'' is a \ncenter that participated in the Women's Business Center program and no \nlonger receives program funds but is still actively providing business \nprograms and services to its local market.\n  The ``Women's Business Center Sustainability Act of 1999'' also \nincreases oversight and review of the Women's Business Centers. Earlier \nthis year, the General Accounting Office (GAO) undertook an examination \nof the Women's Business Center Program at the request of the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business. The GAO found that more than two-\nthirds of the centers that currently receive grant funds or that \nreceived funds in the past continue to operate as Women's Business \nCenters. Most that are continuing to operate after Federal support \nceased have continued to offer similar services to women business \nowners.\n  While conducting its examination, GAO investigators experienced \ndifficulty obtaining complete data about the program from the SBA \nbecause of limitations of SBA's records and databases for program years \n1989 through 1998. I am concerned about the report from the GAO \nhighlighting the failure of SBA to keep complete program and financial \nrecords on Centers that are receiving SBA grants funds; therefore, the \nbill includes a provision requiring the SBA to send the Senate and \nHouse Committees on Small Business a yearly Management Report on the \nstatus of the program. This report will include an annual programmatic \nand financial examination of each Women's Business Center. Further, SBA \nis directed to make a determination annually of the programmatic and \nfinancial viability of each Women's Business Center. It is my belief \nthat this new statutory requirement will lead to better SBA oversight \nand a stronger Women's Business Center Program.\n  During the Committee's consideration of S. 791, it approved \nunanimously an amendment sponsored by Senator Abraham addressing \nFederal procurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The \namendment directs the GAO to conduct an audit on the federal \nprocurement system for the preceding three years and report on all \nidentifiable trends in Federal contracting that are related to women-\nowned small businesses.\n  It is difficult to understand how the women-owned small businesses \nsegment of our economy can make up 38 percent of all small businesses \nand receive only 2.2 percent of the $181 billion in Federal prime \ncontracts. In 1994, Congress passed into law a goal for women-owned \nsmall businesses to receive at least 5 percent of the total amount of \nFederal prime contract dollars. I am distributed by the failure of the \nFederal agencies to meet this goal, and it is our intention for the GAO \nstudy to shed some light on this problem.\n  Mr. President, passage of the ``Women's Business Centers \nSustainability Act of 1999'' will build on the progress and successes \nwe have accomplished to assist women entrepreneurs succeed as small \nbusiness owners. I urge each of my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, seven months ago I introduced the Women's \nBusiness Centers Sustainability Act of 1999, a bill to help our Women's \nBusiness Centers weather the increasingly harsh climate of fundraising. \nThese centers play an important role in our economy and in promoting \neconomic independence for women. They help women take an honest look at \ntheir strengths and interests to find out whether they should strike \nout on their own. They teach women how to turn their talents into a \nbusiness. And they train women in the fundamentals of starting and \nrunning a successful business. The centers are located in rural, urban \nand suburban areas, and direct much of their training and counseling \nassistance toward socially and economically disadvantaged women.\n  Through the Women's Business Centers Program, business development \nresources and assistance available to women have steadily improved. The \nprogram opened its first 12 centers in 1989. Ten years later, women \nreceive assistance at 81 centers in 47 states, the District of \nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition to \nincreasing self-sufficiency among women, Women's Business Centers \nstrengthen women's business ownership overall and encourage local job \ncreation. Over the past decade, the number of women-owned businesses \noperating in this country has grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 \nmillion firms, generating $3.6 trillion in sales annually, while \nemploying more than 27.5 million workers. In 1998, women-owned \nbusinesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million small \nbusinesses in the United States.\n  In spite of the important contributions the Women's Business Centers \nmake to the national economy, we are in danger of losing many effective \ncenters if we don't change the funding structure before their five-year \nfunding runs out. Currently, the Small Business Administration's \nWomen's Business Centers program provides five-year grants of up to \n$150,000, matched by non-Federal dollars, to private-sector \norganizations so that they can establish business-training centers for \nwomen. From Senate and House hearings at the beginning of the year, we \nknow that without the Federal matching grant, most centers cannot \nafford to continue providing the same quality of services or to keep \ntheir doors open. That money is their bread and butter, as well as \nindispensable for leveraging fundraising dollars. I believe the Women's \nBusiness Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 is a fair way to let WBCs \nrecompete for the base funding.\n  The Women's Business Centers Act creates a four-year pilot that \nallows graduating and graduated centers to recompete for five-year \nmatching grants of up to $125,000. It requires the SBA to do site \nvisits as part of the final selection process so that we can\n\n[[Page S14216]]\n\nbetter judge which centers merit a sustainability grant after five \nyears in the program. It includes a provision from Senator Bond to \nincrease management oversight and review of Centers to better evaluate \nthe viability of centers and improve SBA's management of the program. \nAnd it incrementally raises over four years the annual authorization \nlevels from $12 million in fiscal year 2000 to $14.5 million in fiscal \nyear 2003. The increased authorization levels ensure that there are \nadequate monies to fund 45 existing centers, an average of eight \nrecompeting centers annually, and an average of 10 new centers per \nyear.\n  The Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 has \ntremendous support. It is also the product of old-fashioned cooperation \nbetween Democrats and Republicans, and the House and Senate. I want to \nthank not only the 30 Senators--20 Democrats and 10 Republicans--who \nare cosponsors of this bill, but also the staff members on the House \nSmall Business Committee who work for Chairman Talent, Ranking Member \nNydia Velazquez, and Congresswoman Kelly.\n  For the record, I would like to recognize the 30 cosponsors of my \nbill--Bond, Harkin, Bingaman, Domenici, Levin, Enzi, Kennedy, Abraham, \nSarbanes, Akaka, Edwards, Feinstein, Landrieu, Boxer, Cleland, Kohl, \nWellstone, Burns, Leahy, Snowe, Hutchison, Durbin, Santorum, Murray, \nMikulski, Inouye, Jeffords, Lieberman, Bennett and Robb.\n  Mr. President, I know how important this bill is to members on both \nsides of the aisle. I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is prepared to pass \nthe Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation to strengthen SBA's Women's \nBusiness Centers in Michigan and across the nation which help \nentrepreneurs start and maintain successful businesses by providing \nsuch things as start-up help and financial expertise to women-owned \nbusinesses. This legislation will allow those Women's Business Centers \nthat are already successfully participating in the program to recompete \nfor Federal funding after their initial funding term expires. These \nCenters would have previously been ineligible for renewed funding.\n  Women-owned businesses are the fastest growing sector of small \nbusinesses in America and provide innumerable jobs and resources to the \nstate of Michigan and around the country. Last year, women-owned \nbusinesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million small \nbusinesses in the United States. The Women's Business Center program \noffers important tools to women who want to start or expand small \nbusinesses. However, the program is in danger of losing many effective \nCenters because the Centers are finding it increasingly difficult to \nraise the required non-Federal matching funds necessary to keep the \nprograms running.\n  This legislation allows existing Centers to recompete for Federal \nfunds, but sets the recompetition standards higher than those used for \ncenters applying for their initial five-year funding term. This is to \ntake into account established Centers' higher levels of experience and \nensures that Centers meeting the highest standards can continue to get \nfunded. The ability of established and successful Women's Business \nDevelopment Centers to continue to compete for Federal funding means \nthat critical resources will continue to be made available for women-\nowned businesses for such purposes as training and obtaining business \nfinancing.\n  Michigan has three Women's Business Centers, the Center for \nEmpowerment and Economic Development, CEED, which houses the Women's \nInitiative for Self-Employment, WISE, in Ann Arbor, the Grand Rapids \nOpportunities for Women, GROW, in Grand Rapids, and The Detroit \nEntrepreneurship Institute, Inc, DEI.\n  These Michigan programs offer women who want to open a small business \na comprehensive package of business education and training, start-up \nfinancing, technical assistance, peer group support and access to \ncommunity and government supportive resources such as child care. \nMichigan's Women's Business Centers strongly support this legislation \nand believe they need to be able to recompete for Federal resources in \norder to continue to be able to offer the current levels of services \nand support to Michigan's women-owned businesses. This bill would allow \nthem to do that.\n  I am pleased that Congress has continued to recognize the importance \nof funding the Women's Business Center program. In 1997, Congress \nenacted legislation to make a 1989-1991 pilot project a permanent part \nof the Small Business Administration programs available to help \nentrepreneurs start and maintain successful business. It also doubled \nthe annual funding of the Women's Business Centers and extend the \nfunding period from 3 to 5 years. And just this year, Congress enacted \nlegislation to change the non-Federal and Federal funding ratio \nrequirements and it again increased the annual authorization level from \n$8 million to $11 million.\n  The legislation that will be passed by the Senate today under a \nunanimous consent agreement will allow existing Women's Business \nCenters to compete for additional Federal funding. It also authorizes \nincreased appropriations for the program for 4 years. It increases the \nFY 2000 and FY 2001 authorization from $11 million to $12 million. It \nalso authorizes appropriations of $12.8 million in FY 2001; $13.7 \nmillion in FY 2002; and $14.5 million in FY 2003 for this program.\n  This is an important piece of legislation and I am pleased my Senate \ncolleagues are supporting it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act'' (S. 1346). This bill is designed to build on \nthe success achieved by the Office of Advocacy over the past 23 years. \nIt is intended to strengthen that foundation to make the Office of \nAdvocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses \nthroughout the United States. I introduced the ``Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act'' on July 1, 1999. Two weeks later, on July 15th, the \nCommittee on Small Business voted unanimously, 17-0, in favor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal \ngovernment. It is part of the Small Business Administration (SBA/\nAgency), and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the \nOffice is also intended to be the independent voice for small business \nwithin the Federal government. It is supposed to develop proposals for \nchanging government policies to help small businesses, and it is \nsupposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses \nbefore other Federal agencies.\n  As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the \nindependent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also \na part of the President's Administration. As you can imagine, those are \nsometimes difficult roles to play simultaneously.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' would make the Office of \nAdvocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent \nadvocate within the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the \nOffice of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless \nof the position taken on critical issues by the President and his \nAdministration.\n  S. 1346 would direct the Chief Counsel to submit an annual report on \nFederal agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act to the \nPresident and the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. The \n``Reg Flex Act'' is a very important weapon in the war against the \nover-regulation of small businesses. At the request of Senator Fred \nThompson, Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, I am offering a \nnoncontroversial amendment to S. 1346 that would direct the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy to send a copy of the report to the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Committee. In addition, my amendment would also \nrequire that copies of the report be sent to the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary. \nIt makes good sense for each of the committees to receive this report \non Reg Flex compliance, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the ``Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act'' would be unique with the Executive Branch. The Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy would be a wide-ranging advocate, who would be \nfree to take positions contrary to the Administration's policies and to \nadvocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact \nsmall businesses. During consideration of the bill, the Committee \nadopted unanimously an amendment I offered, which was cosponsored by \nSenator John Kerry, the Committee's Ranking Democrat, to require the\n\n[[Page S14220]]\n\nChief Counsel to be appointed ``from civilian life.'' This \nqualification is intended to emphasize that the person nominated to \nserve in this important role should have a strong small business \nbackground.\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \ngovernment. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy \nis the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly \nbelieve that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel should be \nindependent and free to advocate or support positions that might be \ncontrary to the Administration's policies, I have come to find that the \nOffice is not as independent as necessary to do the job for small \nbusiness.\n\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the \nSalaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated \nby the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall \nstaff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time \nemployees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-\nboard as the result of the hiring freeze imposed by the SBA \nAdministrator. The independence of the Office is diminished when the \nOffice of Advocacy staff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for \nnew programs and additional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the \ndiscretion of the Administrator.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently completed a \nreport for me on personnel practices at the SBA (GAO/GGD-99-68). I was \nalarmed by the GAO's finding that Assistant and Regional Advocates \nhired by the Office of Advocacy share many of the attributes of \nSchedule C political appointees. In fact, Regional Advocates are \nfrequently cleared by the White House personnel office--the same \nprocedure followed for approving Schedule C political appointees.\n  The facts discussed in the GAO Report cast the Office of Advocacy in \na whole new light--one that had not been apparent until earlier this \nyear. The report raises the questions, concerns and suspicions \nregarding the independence of the Office of Advocacy. Has there been a \ntime when the Office did not pursue a matter as vigorously as it might \nhave were it not for direct or indirect political influence? Prior to \nreceipt of the GAO Report, my response was a resounding ``No.'' But \nnow, a question mark arises.\n  Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my \nefforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy \nin all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small \nbusiness. However, so long as the Administration controls the budget \nallocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the \nindependence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this \nsituation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small \nbusiness community.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' builds a firewall to \nprevent the political intrusion into the management of day-to-day \noperations of the Office of Advocacy. The bill would require that the \nSBA's budget include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No \nlonger would its funds come from the general operating account of the \nAgency. The separate account would also provide for the number of full-\ntime employees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer \nwould the Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA \nAdministrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n  The bill would also continue the practice of allowing the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by federal law and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). I \nbelieve this special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  Mr. President, the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' is a sound \nbill. It is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review \nand consideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small Business, \nrepresentatives of the small business community, former Chief Counsels \nfor Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted much time \nand effort in actively participating in a Committee Roundtable \ndiscussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my Committee held on April \n21, 1999. And I stated earlier, the Committee on Small Business \napproved this bill by a unanimous 17-0 vote. Therefore, I strongly urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Office of \n     Advocacy Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) excessive regulations continue to burden our Nation's \n     small businesses;\n       (2) Federal agencies are reluctant to comply with the \n     requirements of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, and \n     continue to propose regulations that impose disproportionate \n     burdens on small businesses;\n       (3) the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business \n     Administration (referred to in this Act as the ``Office'') is \n     an effective advocate for small businesses that can help \n     ensure that agencies are responsive to small businesses and \n     that agencies comply with their statutory obligations under \n     chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code and under the Small \n     Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public \n     Law 104-121; 106 Stat. 4249 et seq.);\n       (4) the independence of the Office is essential to ensure \n     that it can serve as an effective advocate for small \n     businesses without being restricted by the views or policies \n     of the Small Business Administration or any other executive \n     branch agency;\n       (5) the Office needs sufficient resources to conduct the \n     research required to assess effectively the impact of \n     regulations on small businesses; and\n       (6) the research, information, and expertise of the Office \n     make it a valuable adviser to Congress as well as the \n     executive branch agencies with which the Office works on \n     behalf of small businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure that the Office has the statutory \n     independence and adequate financial resources to advocate for \n     and on behalf of small business;\n       (2) to require that the Office report to the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Committees on Small Business of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives and the Administrator \n     of the Small Business Administration in order to keep them \n     fully and currently informed about issues and regulations \n     affecting small businesses and the necessity for corrective \n     action by the regulatory agency or Congress;\n       (3) to provide a separate authorization for appropriations \n     for the Office;\n       (4) to authorize the Office to report to the President and \n     to Congress regarding agency compliance with chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code; and\n       (5) to enhance the role of the Office pursuant to chapter 6 \n     of title 5, United States Code.\n\n[[Page S14221]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act'' (S. 1346). This bill is designed to build on \nthe success achieved by the Office of Advocacy over the past 23 years. \nIt is intended to strengthen that foundation to make the Office of \nAdvocacy a stronger, more effective advocate for all small businesses \nthroughout the United States. I introduced the ``Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act'' on July 1, 1999. Two weeks later, on July 15th, the \nCommittee on Small Business voted unanimously, 17-0, in favor of this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Office of Advocacy is a unique office within the Federal \ngovernment. It is part of the Small Business Administration (SBA/\nAgency), and its director, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, is nominated \nby the President and confirmed by the Senate. At the same time, the \nOffice is also intended to be the independent voice for small business \nwithin the Federal government. It is supposed to develop proposals for \nchanging government policies to help small businesses, and it is \nsupposed to represent the views and interests of small businesses \nbefore other Federal agencies.\n  As the director of the Office of Advocacy, the Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy has a dual responsibility. On the one hand, he is the \nindependent watchdog for small business. On the other hand, he is also \na part of the President's Administration. As you can imagine, those are \nsometimes difficult roles to play simultaneously.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' would make the Office of \nAdvocacy and the Chief Counsel for Advocacy a fully independent \nadvocate within the Executive Branch acting on behalf of the small \nbusiness community. The bill would establish a clear mandate that the \nOffice of Advocacy will fight on behalf of small businesses regardless \nof the position taken on critical issues by the President and his \nAdministration.\n  S. 1346 would direct the Chief Counsel to submit an annual report on \nFederal agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act to the \nPresident and the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. The \n``Reg Flex Act'' is a very important weapon in the war against the \nover-regulation of small businesses. At the request of Senator Fred \nThompson, Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee, I am offering a \nnoncontroversial amendment to S. 1346 that would direct the Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy to send a copy of the report to the Senate \nGovernment Affairs Committee. In addition, my amendment would also \nrequire that copies of the report be sent to the House Committee on \nGovernment Reform and the House and Senate Committees on the Judiciary. \nIt makes good sense for each of the committees to receive this report \non Reg Flex compliance, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  The Office of Advocacy as envisioned by the ``Independent Office of \nAdvocacy Act'' would be unique with the Executive Branch. The Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy would be a wide-ranging advocate, who would be \nfree to take positions contrary to the Administration's policies and to \nadvocate change in government programs and attitudes as they impact \nsmall businesses. During consideration of the bill, the Committee \nadopted unanimously an amendment I offered, which was cosponsored by \nSenator John Kerry, the Committee's Ranking Democrat, to require the\n\n[[Page S14220]]\n\nChief Counsel to be appointed ``from civilian life.'' This \nqualification is intended to emphasize that the person nominated to \nserve in this important role should have a strong small business \nbackground.\n  In 1976, Congress established the Office of Advocacy in the SBA to be \nthe eyes, ears and voice for small business within the Federal \ngovernment. Over time, it has been assumed that the Office of Advocacy \nis the ``independent'' voice for small business. While I strongly \nbelieve that the Office of Advocacy and the Chief Counsel should be \nindependent and free to advocate or support positions that might be \ncontrary to the Administration's policies, I have come to find that the \nOffice is not as independent as necessary to do the job for small \nbusiness.\n\n  For example, funding for the Office of Advocacy comes from the \nSalaries and Expense Account of the SBA's budget. Staffing is allocated \nby the SBA Administrator to the Office of Advocacy from the overall \nstaff allocation for the Agency. In 1990, there were 70 full-time \nemployees working on behalf of small businesses in the Office of \nAdvocacy. Today's allocation of staff is 49, and fewer are actually on-\nboard as the result of the hiring freeze imposed by the SBA \nAdministrator. The independence of the Office is diminished when the \nOffice of Advocacy staff is reduced to allow for increased staffing for \nnew programs and additional initiatives in other areas of SBA, at the \ndiscretion of the Administrator.\n  In addition, the General Accounting Office (GAO) recently completed a \nreport for me on personnel practices at the SBA (GAO/GGD-99-68). I was \nalarmed by the GAO's finding that Assistant and Regional Advocates \nhired by the Office of Advocacy share many of the attributes of \nSchedule C political appointees. In fact, Regional Advocates are \nfrequently cleared by the White House personnel office--the same \nprocedure followed for approving Schedule C political appointees.\n  The facts discussed in the GAO Report cast the Office of Advocacy in \na whole new light--one that had not been apparent until earlier this \nyear. The report raises the questions, concerns and suspicions \nregarding the independence of the Office of Advocacy. Has there been a \ntime when the Office did not pursue a matter as vigorously as it might \nhave were it not for direct or indirect political influence? Prior to \nreceipt of the GAO Report, my response was a resounding ``No.'' But \nnow, a question mark arises.\n  Let me take a moment and note that I will be unrelenting in my \nefforts to insure the complete independence of the Office of Advocacy \nin all matters, at all times, for the continued benefit of all small \nbusiness. However, so long as the Administration controls the budget \nallocated to the Office of Advocacy and controls who is hired, the \nindependence of the Office may be in jeopardy. We must correct this \nsituation, and the sooner we do it, the better it will be for the small \nbusiness community.\n  The ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' builds a firewall to \nprevent the political intrusion into the management of day-to-day \noperations of the Office of Advocacy. The bill would require that the \nSBA's budget include a separate account for the Office of Advocacy. No \nlonger would its funds come from the general operating account of the \nAgency. The separate account would also provide for the number of full-\ntime employees who would work within the Office of Advocacy. No longer \nwould the Chief Counsel for Advocacy have to seek approval from the SBA \nAdministrator to hire staff for the Office of Advocacy.\n  The bill would also continue the practice of allowing the Chief \nCounsel to hire individuals critical to the mission of the Office of \nAdvocacy without going through the normal competitive procedures \ndirected by federal law and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). I \nbelieve this special hiring authority, which is limited only to \nemployees within the Office of Advocacy, is beneficial because it \nallows the Chief Counsel to hire quickly those persons who can best \nassist the Office in responding to changing issues and problems \nconfronting small businesses.\n  Mr. President, the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act'' is a sound \nbill. It is the product of a great deal of thoughtful, objective review \nand consideration by me, the staff of the Committee on Small Business, \nrepresentatives of the small business community, former Chief Counsels \nfor Advocacy and others. These individuals have also devoted much time \nand effort in actively participating in a Committee Roundtable \ndiscussion on the Office of Advocacy, which my Committee held on April \n21, 1999. And I stated earlier, the Committee on Small Business \napproved this bill by a unanimous 17-0 vote. Therefore, I strongly urge \nmy colleagues in the Senate to vote in favor of the ``Independent \nOffice of Advocacy Act.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

This report is required \n     to include information specified in section 2519(3).\n       (2) The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 \n     provides for the termination of certain laws requiring \n     submittal to Congress of annual, semiannual, and regular \n     periodic reports as of December 21, 1999, 4 years from the \n     effective date of that Act.\n       (3) Due to the Federal Reports Elimination Act and Sunset \n     Act of 1995, the Administrative Office of United States \n     Courts is not required to submit the annual report described \n     in section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code, as of \n     December 21, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONTINUED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Continued Reporting Requirements.--Section 2519 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(4) The reports required to be filed by subsection (3) \n     are exempted from the termination provisions of section \n     3003(a) of the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n     1995 (Public Law 104-66).''.\n       (b) Exemption.--Section 3003(d) of the Federal Reports \n     Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-66) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (31), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (2) in paragraph (32), by striking the period and inserting \n     ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(33) section 2519(3) of title 18, United States Code.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENCRYPTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       [Section 2519(1)(b)] (a) Section 2519(2)(b) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking ``and (iv)'' and \n     inserting ``(iv) the number of orders in which encryption was \n     encountered and whether such encryption prevented law \n     enforcement from obtaining the plain text of communications \n     intercepted pursuant to such order, and (v)''.\n       (b) The encryption reporting requirement in subsection (a) \n     shall be effective for the report transmitted by the Director \n     of the Administrative Office of the Courts for calendar year \n     2000 and in subsequent reports.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORTS CONCERNING PEN REGISTERS AND TRAP AND TRACE \n                   DEVICES.\n\n       Section 3126 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking the period and inserting ``, which report shall \n     include information concerning--\n       ``(1) the period of interceptions authorized by the order, \n     and the number and duration of any extensions of the order;\n       ``(2) the offense specified in the order or application, or \n     extension of an order;\n       ``(3) the number of investigations involved;\n       ``(4) the number and nature of the facilities affected; and\n       ``(5) the identity, including district, of the applying \n     investigative or law enforcement agency making the \n     application and the person authorizing the order.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nconsidering S. 1769, which I introduced with Chairman Hatch on October \n22, 1999. This bill will continue and enhance the current reporting \nrequirements for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the \nAttorney General on the eavesdropping and surveillance activities of \nour federal and state law enforcement agencies.\n  For many years, the Administrative Office (AO) of the Courts has \ncomplied with the statutory requirement, in 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2519(3), to \nreport to Congress annually the number and nature of federal and state \napplications for orders authorizing or approving the interception of \nwire, oral or electronic communications. By letter dated September 3, \n1999, the AO advised that it would no longer submit this report because \n``as of December 21, 1999, the report will no longer be required \npursuant to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995.'' I \ncommend the AO for alerting Congress that their responsibility for the \nwiretap reports would lapse at the end of this year, and for doing so \nin time for Congress to take action.\n  The AO has done an excellent job of preparing the wiretap reports. We \nneed to continue the AO's objective work in a consistent manner. If \nanother agency took over this important task at this juncture and the \nnumbers came out in a different format, it would immediately generate \nquestions and concerns over the legitimacy and accuracy of the contents \nof that report.\n  In addition, it would create difficulties in comparing statistics \nfrom prior years going back to 1969 and complicate the job of \ncongressional oversight. Furthermore, transferring this reporting duty \nto another agency might create delays in issuance of the report since \nno other agency has the methodology in place. Finally, federal, state \nand local agencies are well accustomed to the reporting methodology \ndeveloped by the AO. Notifying all these agencies that the reporting \nstandards and agency have changed would inevitably create more \nconfusion and more expense as law enforcement agencies across the \ncountry are forced to learn a new system and develop a liaison with a \nnew agency.\n  The system in place now has worked well and should be continued. We \nknow how quickly law enforcement may be subjected to criticism over \ntheir use of these surreptitious surveillance tools\n\n[[Page S14223]]\n\nand we should avoid aggravating these sensitivities by changing the \nreporting agency.\n  The bill would update the reporting requirements currently in place \nwith one additional reporting requirement. Specifically, the bill would \nrequire the wiretap reports prepared beginning in calendar year 2000 to \ninclude information on the number of orders in which encryption was \nencountered and whether such encryption prevented law enforcement from \nobtaining the plain text of communications intercepted pursuant to such \norder.\n  Encryption technology is critical to protect sensitive computer and \nonline information. Yet, the same technology poses challenges to law \nenforcement when it is exploited by criminals to hide evidence or the \nfruits of criminal activities. A report by the U.S. Working Group on \nOrganized Crime titled, ``Encryption and Evolving Technologies: Tools \nof Organized Crime and Terrorism,'' released in 1997, collected \nanecdotal case studies on the use of encryption in furtherance of \ncriminal activities in order to estimate the future impact of \nencryption on law enforcement. The report noted the need for ``an \nongoing study of the effect of encryption and other information \ntechnologies on investigations, prosecutions, and intelligence \noperations''. As part of this study, ``a database of case information \nfrom federal and local law enforcement and intelligence agencies should \nbe established and maintained.'' Adding a requirement that reports be \nfurnished on the number of occasions when encryption is encountered by \nlaw enforcement is a far more reliable basis than anecdotal evidence on \nwhich to assess law enforcement needs and make sensible policy in this \narea.\n  The final section of this bill would codify the information that the \nAttorney General already provides on pen register and trap and trace \ndevice orders, and require further information on where such orders are \nissued and the types of facilities--telephone, computer, pager or other \ndevice--to which the order relates. Under the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act (``ECPA'') of 1986, P.L. 99-508, codified at 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 3126, the Attorney General of the United States is required to \nreport annually to the Congress on the number of pen register orders \nand orders for trap and trace devices applied for by law enforcement \nagencies of the Department of Justice. As the original sponsor of ECPA, \nI believed that adequate oversight of the surveillance activities of \nfederal law enforcement could only be accomplished with reporting \nrequirements such as the one included in this law.\n  The reports furnished by the Attorney General on an annual basis \ncompile information from five components of the Department of Justice: \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United \nStates Marshals Service and the Office of the Inspector General. The \nreport contains information on the number of original and extension \norders made to the courts for authorization to use both pen register \nand trap and trace devices, information concerning the number of \ninvestigations involved, the offenses on which the applications were \npredicted and the number of people whose telephone facilities were \naffected.\n  These specific categories of information are useful, and the bill we \nhave introduced would direct the Attorney General to continue providing \nthese specific categories of information. In addition, the bill would \ndirect the Attorney General to include information on the identity, \nincluding the district, of the agency making the application and the \nperson authorizing the order. In this way, the Congress and the public \nwill be informed of those jurisdictions using this surveillance \ntechnique--information which is currently not included in the Attorney \nGeneral's annual reports.\n  The requirement for preparation of the wiretap reports will soon \nlapse so I am delighted to see the Senate take prompt action on this \nlegislation to continue the requirement for submission of the wiretap \nreports and to update the reporting requirements for both the wiretap \nreports submitted by the AO and the pen register and trap and trace \nreports submitted by the Attorney General.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, for several months, I have been working on \na case with the South Korean government on behalf of a family in \nCalifornia.\n  The family, Mr. and Mrs. B.K. Cho, are concerned about actions taken \nagainst them in South Korea in 1984. At that time, the Cho family owned \none of the largest construction companies in the country. The Cho \nfamily alleges that their holdings were illegally transferred to two \nother companies, Cho Hung Bank and Daelim Industries. They also accuse \nofficials of the then Chun government of ordering this transfer.\n  Soon after their property was taken from them, the Cho family left \nfor the United States. They have filed a lawsuit in California against \nCho Hung Bank and Daelim Industries and their U.S. subsidiaries.\n  Because of the strong concerns I have about this case, I had asked \nthat this particular treaty be delayed until I had\n\n[[Page S14227]]\n\nthe opportunity to further explore this matter. One of the concerns \nraised by the family was that the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade (MOFAT) had not served the court petition to the Cho Hung \nBank and Daelim Industries. I have now been assured that this action \nhas been taken. I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated September \n22, 1999 from the First Secretary of the Congressional Section of the \nSouth Korean Embassy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Embassy of the Republic of Korea,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 22, 1999.\n     Mr. Sean Moore,\n     Office of Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Moore, in reference to my letter dated August 6, \n     1999, concerning the case of Mr. Cho Bong-Koo, I am pleased \n     to inform you that, according to the Korean Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs and Trade (MOFAT), the Cho Hung Bank and the \n     Daelim Industrial Company have each received a court petition \n     at the end of August.\n       The Embassy has also learned that these two entities are \n     planning to establish legal counsel to represent their \n     interests regarding this lawsuit. As was mentioned in the \n     attached letter dated August 24, 1998 and addressed to \n     Senator Boxer, the Korean Government is of the view that any \n     remaining questions in transferring the management of Samho \n     in the 1980's should be settled through legal procedures in \n     court.\n       I thank you again for your interests and concern.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                               Chang Beom Kim,\n\n                                                  First Secretary,\n                                            Congressional Section.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I also have received assurances from the \nSouth Korean Ambassador, Dr. Lee Hong-koo, that his government will not \ninterfere with the pending court case and expresses hope that legal \nproceedings will be conducted as quickly as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to me dated November 5, 1999 \nfrom Ambassador Lee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Embassy of the Republic of Korea,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I would like to take this opportunity \n     to express my appreciation for your support for the \n     ratification of the U.S.-Korea Extradition Treaty.\n       I would also like to commend you on your efforts to assist \n     your Korean-American constituent, Mr. Cho Bong-Koo, who has \n     filed suit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against several \n     Korean corporations.\n       I understand your concerns about this case and have \n     considered it with the utmost gravity. Given our respect for \n     the integrity of the U.S. legal system, it is inappropriate \n     for the Embassy or any Korean government official to \n     interfere in a case pending in your courts. However, in view \n     of the long duration of this matter of concern to the Cho \n     family, I remain hopeful that the legal proceedings will be \n     conducted in a timely manner, so that the case may be \n     resolved without delay.\n       Please be assured that I understand your endeavor to help \n     ameliorate your constituent's concerns. As a public servant \n     in a democratic government, I fully recognize the importance \n     of your efforts. It is my belief that we will continue to \n     work well together on future matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Lee Hong-koo,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I have been coming to the floor now on a \nnumber of occasions, as we move toward the end of our work for this \nyear, in an effort to try to build bipartisan support for ensuring that \nsenior citizens can get prescription drugs under their Medicare.\n  There is one bipartisan bill now before the Senate. It is the \nlegislation that Senator Snowe and I have introduced together. Fifty-\nfour Members of the Senate have voted for this bill. It seems so sad \nthat the Senate cannot come together on an issue such as this and \nprovide some real relief for the Nation's older people.\n  So as part of this effort to get bipartisan support for legislation \nto cover seniors for their prescription drug bills, I have come to the \nfloor and urged seniors to send in copies of their prescription drug \nbills, to send in copies of their bills to all of us here in the Senate \nin Washington, DC. I hope that in doing that, it will help generate \nsome awareness about how serious a problem this really is for the \nNation's older people.\n\n  As I have done on previous occasions, I come to the floor to discuss \nsome of these letters. This afternoon, I want to take a couple of \nminutes to talk about a handful of the letters I have received from \nsenior citizens in my hometown of Portland. We have read from letters \nfrom seniors across the State of Oregon in the past. Today, I thought I \nwould look to my hometown and describe a little bit about what the \nseniors are faced with in terms of trying to pay these prescription \nbills.\n  One elderly widow wrote me in the last couple of days from Portland \nto describe her situation as one where she has a monthly income of \n$806. She spends about $150 of that monthly income on her \nprescriptions. She indicates she is having problems paying for these \nvery large prescription drug bills. When asked by our staff what she \ndoes in a situation such as this, she just said: I do without and pray. \nThat was her response to the question of making sure she could get help \nwith her prescriptions. She goes on to say, when we asked her about \nchoosing between food and fuel and health care--we have literally \nmillions of our Nation's seniors today walking on an economic \ntightrope, balancing these costs, medical bills against their fuel \nbills. When we asked her how she handled the situation with respect to \nher medicine, she said: I just wait. I always pay the utilities first.\n  Now, this isn't some kind of statistic or abstract kind of matter \nthat the think tanks are debating here in the beltway. This is a senior \ncitizen back home in Portland, my hometown. She has a monthly income of \n$806. She spends $150 of it on her prescription medicines. When she \ncan't afford her prescriptions, she writes me: I just do without and \npray.\n  How is it that a country as rich and strong and powerful as ours \ncan't provide some relief to an elderly widow with an income of $806 a \nmonth, spending more than $150 of it on her prescriptions and literally \nhaving to pray she will get some help with her medical bills? How is it \nthat our country, so strong and so good, can't come up with a plan to \nhelp an elderly widow such as this?\n  Senator Snowe and I are part of a bipartisan team trying to address \nit. The Snowe-Wyden legislation has garnered 54 votes on the floor of \nthe Senate in terms of its funding plan. Already a majority of the \nSenate is on record as saying this is an appropriate way to try to fund \na prescription drug benefit for older people. I am concerned--this is \nright at the heart of the philosophy behind the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation--that if we don't act, and act in a bipartisan way, in this \nsession of the Congress before we wrap up our business next year, it \nwill be years before older people get some help with their prescription \ndrugs.\n  I am very often asked at town hall meetings and other gatherings \nwhether our Nation can afford to cover prescription drugs. My view is, \nwe cannot afford not to cover these prescription drugs. Not only are we \nhearing about the suffering in these letters I keep bringing to the \nfloor of the Senate, but we are seeing in so many instances that if \nolder people could get just a little bit of help with their \nprescription drug costs, that would help our country save much more \nexpensive medical bills down the road.\n  I have repeatedly cited on this floor the anticoagulant drugs. That \nseems to me a particularly good example. The evidence shows that if \nolder people can get help with some of these anticoagulant medicines--\nthe cost might be $1,000 a year for help with anticoagulant medicines--\nthey could save the cost they might incur if they suffer a stroke as a \nresult of not getting their medicines. Those costs can be upwards of \n$100,000 a year. That is, in effect, the kind of challenge with which \nwe are faced. Either we address this issue on a bipartisan basis--that \nis what the Snowe-Wyden legislation is all about--or we continue to \nhave our senior citizens suffering, whether it is in Alabama, Oregon, \nor any other State. This is an area where we can work in a bipartisan \nway.\n  In the Snowe-Wyden legislation, we reject price controls. This isn't \na run from Washington, one-size-fits-all Federal approach. We try to \nuse marketplace forces, the ingenuity of the marketplace to give senior \ncitizens some clout. It is a model we all know something about. Federal \nemployees in Alabama and Oregon use the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. It is marketplace oriented. It gives folks choices and \noptions and alternatives. That is the model behind the Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation.\n  Our bill is called SPICE, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act. With a majority of the Senate already having voted for a \nfunding plan for the program, we think that is the way to proceed.\n  As seniors hear us on the floor of the Senate talking about this \nissue and urging that folks send us copies of their prescription drug \nbills to the Senate in Washington, DC, they may have other ideas than \nthe Snowe-Wyden legislation. The important thing is, there is no reason \nthis Senate cannot come together in a bipartisan fashion and act in a \nway to provide real and meaningful relief to the Nation's older people.\n  I will cite another couple of examples of older people who have been \nwriting us in recent days. An elderly gentleman from Portland, again, \ndescribes taking five drugs, a lot of them very familiar--Minocin, \nnitroglycerin for blood pressure, for heart ailments connected with \ndiabetes. This gentleman has a monthly income of about $900. He is \nspending about $170 from his monthly income on prescriptions.\n  We talked to him about what it means for him to be in this kind of \nfinancial crunch where, out of a monthly income of $900, $170 of it \ngoes for prescriptions. He reports that if he could have a little bit \nof help with his prescriptions, he would have money for other things he \ndescribes as clothing.\n  So we are not talking about seniors getting help with their \nprescriptions and then suddenly using it for some sort of luxury or \nsomething that might be considered nonessential. These seniors are \ntalking about not having enough money to pay for essentials. When they \ncan't get help for their prescription drugs, such as this elderly \ngentleman in Portland, this gentleman said, in effect, he can't afford \nhis clothing. He cannot afford clothing.\n  Of course, that, to some extent, is a health-related kind of matter \nbecause older people are susceptible to illness. This is getting to be \nthe colder part of the year. These are folks who, if they can't get \nadequate clothing, may pick up illnesses as a result of not being able \nto afford warm clothes.\n  What we are talking about may not be of great importance to some of \nthese think tanks in Washington. I have seen they are putting out all \nkinds of reports that this is not all that important to seniors. I talk \nto senior citizens at home in Oregon. The seniors we are\n\n[[Page S14229]]\n\ntalking to know these are real problems. What they want to see is the \nSenate deal with them in a bipartisan kind of fashion. They want to see \nus get beyond some of the bickering and the finger pointing.\n  The Snowe-Wyden legislation is built on that principle. We don't want \nto see the U.S. Senate duck this issue, have it go out on the campaign \ntrail where Democrats will attack the Republicans and Republicans will \nattack back. That is really easy. It is easy to take issues like this, \nusing the campaign fodder for advertisements. What is tough is crafting \nbipartisan legislation.\n  So I am very hopeful that seniors, as this poster says, will send in \ncopies of their prescription drug bills to us here in the Senate in \nWashington, DC. Instead of having to come to the floor of the Senate \nday after day, as I have, I can come to the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about being proud of working with my colleagues on a bipartisan \nbasis to address this issue.\n  Before I wrap this up for this afternoon, I wanted to mention one \nother account that came to Tualatin just outside Portland at home in \nOregon. This was an elderly couple, they spend about $300 a month on \ntheir prescription drugs. They are taking 11 prescriptions. They report \nthat they are retired but are trying to work to pay for prescriptions. \nThe husband is over 65 and he is trying to work now in order to pay \ntheir prescription drug bills of $300 a month. This is an elderly \ncouple in Tualatin, OR. None of it is covered by health insurance. They \nreport to us that they are cutting down on other essentials that are \nimportant to them, but they are going to keep working. The husband is \ngoing to keep working simply to pay the couple's prescription drug \nbills.\n  Think about that for a moment, the three cases I have read from \ntoday: An elderly widow who can't pay her prescription drug bills \nwithout great hardship with an income of $806 a month, with $150 for \nprescriptions. She says, ``I just do without and pray.'' Next is an \nelderly gentlemen from Portland, with a monthly income of $900 a month, \nand he is spending about $170 of it on prescription drugs. He says he \nhopes to be able to get some coverage so he would be able to afford \nsome clothing --an essential, especially as we move into the cold \nweather season. And then, finally, is the couple I just mentioned with \n$300 a month in prescription drug bills, with the husband not in good \nhealth but continuing to work solely to pay for their prescriptions.\n  I think it is so sad that when we have had a majority in the Senate \ngo on record as voting for a plan to fund this important benefit for \nthe elderly, when I know there are Senators of good will on both sides \nof the aisle who would like to work on a marketplace solution to \ncovering prescription drugs for seniors, the Senate can't come together \nand deal with it. The fact is, our senior citizens are getting creamed \nwith respect to their prescription drug bills, and it happens two ways. \nFirst, Medicare never covered prescriptions when the program began in \n1965. I guess the architects didn't think it would be all that \nimportant.\n  As I have said on the floor of the Senate, it is more important today \nthan it used to be because many of these drugs help to lower bills \nbecause they are preventive in nature. In addition to Medicare not \ncovering prescriptions, what is happening today is if you are a senior \ncitizen in Alabama, or in Oregon, and you walk into a drugstore in a \nsmall town in Oregon or in the State of the Presiding Officer, that \nsenior citizen who walks into the drugstore, in effect, subsidizes the \nbig buyers of medicine. If you are a health maintenance organization in \nOregon, or in any other State, you can go out and negotiate a discount. \nYou can go out and negotiate a good price on your medicine. You have \nclout in the marketplace. But if you are a senior citizen who just \nwalks into a drugstore, you don't have any bargaining power, you don't \nhave any clout. So, in effect, that senior citizen who walks into a \npharmacy is subsidizing the big buyers in the community, the health \nmaintenance organizations that can negotiate a discount. Those seniors \nare getting creamed twice. Medicare doesn't cover it, and then they \nhave to subsidize the big buyers.\n\n  So I intend to keep coming to the floor of the Senate, continuing to \nbring to light these various kinds of real-life examples from home in \nOregon. I hope seniors, as this poster indicates, will send us copies \nof their prescription drug bills. I want to hear from them. I want \nfolks who are listening to the work of the Senate and are following \nthis to send me and my colleagues copies of your prescription drug \nbills. Send it to us, each of us here, as the poster says, in \nWashington, DC.\n  I want you to do it for just one reason: I think this is the kind of \nproblem that we are sent here to deal with. This is not some trifling, \ninconsequential matter. This is a question of whether we are going to \nrespond to the more than 20 percent of the Nation's senior citizens who \nare walking on an economic tightrope every year, spending more than \n$1,000 a year out-of-pocket on prescriptions, balancing food costs \nagainst fuel costs, and fuel costs against their medical costs. As I \nhave said again and again, they are giving up medicines that are \nessential to their health.\n  I mentioned yesterday older people with diabetes who can't afford the \nGlucophage, an essential diabetes drug. This is not something that is \ninconsequential; this is something that, for older people, can \nliterally mean the difference between decent health or incurring a \nvery, very serious illness and, often, even death.\n  Let us not be indifferent to the plight of those older people. They \nare asking the Senate for action. The bipartisan Snowe-Wyden \nlegislation is one approach that I happen to favor. But I am sure our \ncolleagues have other ideas. What is unacceptable to me, though, is to \njust say that this Senate won't take it up, we will save it for the \ncampaign trail of 2000, we will tackle it another day. We ought to \ntackle it now. This has been an issue and a concern of the Nation's \nolder people since back in the days when I was director of the Gray \nPanthers at home in Oregon. But it is getting to be an even bigger \nconcern because more and more older people can't afford their medicine, \nand with more seniors interested in wellness and trying to stay \nhealthy, this is the time for the United States Senate to act.\n  So I intend to keep coming back again and again to the floor of the \nSenate, and I hope seniors will send in copies of their prescription \ndrug bills. I am proud there is a bipartisan bill now before the Senate \nto deal with this issue, the Snowe-Wyden legislation. I hope that \nseniors will be in contact with us, give us their ideas on whether they \nthink our bill is the way to go, or if they prefer another route. What \nis unacceptable to me is for the Senate to duck this issue. We have an \nopportunity to work in a bipartisan fashion on it. I intend to keep \ncoming back to the floor of the Senate again and again until we get \nthat action.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/05/senate-section/article/S14229-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
